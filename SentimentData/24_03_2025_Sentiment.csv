42227728,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104036,1742763908,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Tron Considering Bitcoin Inspired Halving — Will TRX go Above $0.4 in the Next Bull Phase?,https://zycrypto.com/tron-considering-bitcoin-inspired-halving-will-trx-go-above-0-4-in-the-next-bull-phase/,"Tron founder Justin Sun recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to raise public awareness regarding the digital currency’s proposed block reward halving. He drew parallels with Bitcoin’s much-touted 4-year halving cycle, in which the premier cryptocurrency undergoes a major bull phase followed by a bearish cooldown before starting things all over again in the ensuing couple of years. Sun wants TRX to eventually settle down on a similar halving cycle because it showcases the maturity of the digital asset. He tweeted : “….As the Bitcoin network grew, block rewards gradually decreased. In the early days, higher rewards were necessary for bootstrapping the network. However, as Bitcoin’s price surged, block rewards were lowered, and the halving cycle played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s long-term sustainability—aligning with Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision….” The New TRX Block Reward Halving Proposal On paper, following BTC seems like a straightforward proposal: periodically decrease the block reward halving to mimic the top cryptocurrency, and it can follow the same trajectory. However, in reality, it is easier said than done. Many other digital currencies have tried to come up with a similar model but failed to maintain a strong periodic foothold in the market like Bitcoin. However, Sun is very enthusiastic about the proposal currently being analyzed by the Tron community. The suggestion titled “Reduce TRX block rewards #738” presents several deflationary tactics, like reducing the block reward by 50% to 1.5-2% per year. Currently, it is set at 1%, which is apparently not enough to kickstart a BTC-like halving cycle. However, the Tron community has not provided definitive word on this proposal, but it is expected to be put to a vote soon. Sun tweeted: “Ultimately, this decision rests with the TRX community!” TRX to Rise to $0.4? Here is the TRX/USD graph from the last 4 months: Image Source: TradingView TRX is the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It has been able to cling to this coveted position during the last few months, especially during a time of turmoil in the markets. But, like the rest of the crypto market cap, it has experienced significant losses in dollar terms. It recorded an All-Time High (ATH) of $0.44 at the end of November 2024 but has since lost 50% against the greenback and has struggled to remain above $0.24 for long periods. A $0.4 valuation is very much in the realm of possibility, but a major market rebound or a successful block reward halving will be needed to supercharge the cryptocurrency’s market position. The Future While TRX’s long-term future depends on the larger cryptocurrency market, it can also make its way if it offers the perfect tokenization recipe. The network is resurgent and its growing use case in the sprawling meme coin economy has breathed new life into the digital network.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Tron News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRX|MARKET|TRADING|MINING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-23 21:05:08

Cosmos and Algorand Gain Strength,https://thecoinrise.com/can-qubetics-testnet-launch-secure-its-spot-as-the-best-crypto-presale-to-invest-this-week-cosmos-and-algorand-gain-strength/,"Crypto markets are heating up again, but not all eyes are on the usual suspects this time. With presale stages creating buzz, discerning participants are searching for the best crypto presale to invest this week. Amid the noise, a few projects stand out—not for hype, but for their robust ecosystems, technology, and real-world use cases. Qubetics has emerged as a top contender, gaining momentum with its successful testnet launch. Alongside it, Cosmos and Algorand continue to prove their worth with unique innovations in blockchain interoperability and financial-grade applications. These projects offer compelling reasons to watch closely, especially for those seeking quality beyond the speculative frenzy. Qubetics Testnet Go Live: Setting a New Standard for the Best Crypto Presale to Invest This Week Qubetics takes a giant leap forward by activating its TestNet —a major step from its alpha testnet phase. This launch is not just ceremonial. It provides a secure environment where developers, validators, and community members can engage directly with the platform, testing features without risking financial loss. Performance tuning, enhanced security protocols, and smooth transaction testing pave the way for a robust mainnet rollout. What sets Qubetics apart is its advanced Qubetics Wallet , designed to streamline complex financial operations for businesses, professionals, and individual users. The wallet eliminates reliance on third-party custodians by enabling complete control over digital assets. This user-centric approach enhances security while simplifying DeFi participation, token management, and smart contract execution. Strategic alliances with industry heavyweights such as 1inch , SWFT , and CertiK further boost Qubetics’ credibility. CertiK’s auditing prowess is widely respected, while 1inch and SWFT ensure liquidity and efficient cross-chain transactions. Together, these partnerships reinforce Qubetics’ mission to deliver a secure, reliable, and highly functional ecosystem. Qubetics Presale and ROI Projections With over 502 million $TICS tokens sold to 23,500 holders, the crypto presale has already raised $15.3 million in its 26th presale stage. At $0.1181 per token, Qubetics presents a prime opportunity for early buyers aiming for long-term rewards. Analysts project impressive potential returns: $1 post-presale — 746.05% ROI $5 post-presale — 4,130% ROI $6 post-presale — 4,976% ROI $10 post-presale — 8,360% ROI $15 post-mainnet launch — 12,590% ROI These forecasts, though exciting, come with the usual crypto market risks. Still, such metrics solidify Qubetics as the best crypto presale to invest this week. Cosmos Powers Ahead: Breaking Barriers and Bearish Trends Cosmos (ATOM) has seen a sharp turnaround after enduring a grueling stretch that pushed its price from $10 to $3.62 by March 10. However, with a 22% surge in the last week, ATOM now stands at $4.67—and momentum continues to build. Technical indicators point toward sustained strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) readings are bullish, confirming heightened buying pressure. Social dominance has risen to 0.27%, signaling growing market buzz around Cosmos. A recent breakout from a descending triangle pattern invalidated the bearish outlook. ATOM now trades above the 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a classic sign of trend reversal. Additionally, the Bull Bear Power (BBP) remains in positive territory, affirming bullish control. Cosmos could soon break the $5 resistance if momentum holds, potentially climbing toward $6.21, aligning with the golden ratio Fibonacci level. While risks persist, Cosmos reclaims its spot as a blockchain worthy of attention this week. Algorand’s Strategic Moves: Is It Joining the Best Crypto Presale to Invest This Week Club? Algorand (ALGO), currently trading near $0.2480, is turning heads in 2025 for reasons beyond price action. Algorand’s tech is gaining real-world relevance, especially through its DeRec Alliance partnership with Hedera and Ripple. This collaboration focuses on decentralized asset recovery standards—a critical need in the evolving Web3 landscape. Further strengthening its use case, Algorand plays a key role in Sweden’s central bank CBDC trials, showcasing its technology in large-scale financial applications. These developments underline Algorand’s commitment to providing scalable and secure blockchain solutions, elevating its status among top-performing projects this year. With increasing demand for interoperability and institutional-grade infrastructure, Algorand’s strategic advancements make it a prime watchlist candidate. While not a presale token, ALGO’s steady growth aligns it with those projects drawing strong community and enterprise support. Final Thoughts Choosing the best crypto presale to invest this week requires more than hype-chasing. Projects like Qubetics, Cosmos, and Algorand demonstrate why fundamentals matter, especially in volatile markets. Qubetics stands tall with its testnet success, strategic partnerships, and a presale model offering substantial ROI potential. Its wallet features, real-world business focus, and rigorous testing regime place it at the center of market attention. Cosmos has defied bearish expectations, flashing strong technical signals and renewed social dominance. Algorand’s practical applications in national financial systems and decentralized asset recovery make it a standout for 2025. While crypto remains inherently risky, these three projects show the traits of long-term players. Qubetics, in particular, emerges as the best crypto presale to invest this week, backed by innovation, community momentum, and a clear roadmap.

42228152,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104038,1742764690,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"US Treasury Uses Discretionary Powers to End Sanctions Against Tornado Cash, says “Innovation” Benefits Americans",https://zycrypto.com/us-treasury-uses-discretionary-powers-to-end-sanctions-against-tornado-cash-says-innovation-benefits-americans/,"The U.S. Treasury has ended its sanctions on Tornado Cash , a prominent mixing service, by removing addresses associated with the token, including Ethereum addresses. Under the U.S. Treasury, the department responsible for this decision is the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The list of banned addresses is referred to as the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. However, the Treasury Department maintains sanctions on one of Tornado’s founders, Roman Semenov. In 2022, OFAC blacklisted Tornado Cash allegedly for facilitating money laundering on its platform. Lazarus, a North Korean hacking group, had used the service to anonymize their stolen money, totaling millions of dollars in stolen tokens. Tornado Cash is a mixer service for Ethereum and allows users to anonymize their coins by randomly mixing them with other coins. Tornado users sued the Treasury when the service was blacklisted. Coinbase financially backed the lawsuit. The Treasury made an official announcement about the delisting of the crypto service: “Based on the Administration’s review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by the use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments, we have exercised our discretion to remove the economic sanctions against Tornado Cash as reflected in Treasury’s Monday filing in Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury”. Tornado Cash is a tool that allows users to make their transactions more private. It combines different transactions, making it more difficult for people to track them. Privacy advocates see the service as vital for protecting one’s anonymity and financial security. However, many governments see it as a tool used by hackers to disguise their transactions. In November 2024, a judge from the Fifth Circuit ruled that a piece of automatic software cannot be classified as property and, therefore, cannot be sanctioned by OFAC. Tornado supporters are celebrating the decision by OFAC to drop the blacklisting. They argue that banning Tornado because Lazarus is misusing the service is like banning the internet because Lazarus is using the web to hack crypto wallets. The Treasury, however, further stated that it is still concerned about money laundering, particularly the Lazarus group stealing billions from various crypto wallets. It plans to strike a balance between cutting back on crime and giving people room to make critical innovations. “Digital assets present enormous opportunities,” said Scott Bessent, secretary of the Treasury, “for innovation and value creation for the American people. Securing the digital asset industry from abuse by North Korea and other illicit actors is essential to establishing U.S. leadership and ensuring the American people can benefit from financial innovation and inclusion”. Roman Storm, Tornado Cash co-founder, still faces a criminal trial in July for creating protocols and smart contracts. Storm’s lawyer tried to get the case dropped after the November 2024 ruling. However, Judge Katherine Failla denied the request in February, stating that Storm still defied the sanctions list, regardless of the November ruling. Coinbase helped finance Tornado Cash’s legal defense, claiming the allegations were unreasonable. Brian Armstrong has argued that open source technology benefits citizens and should therefore not be banned.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|ETH|EXCHANGE|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-23 21:18:10

Cathie Wood to give inaugural lecture for El Salvador's AI public education program Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood is kicking off El Salvador's AI education program by giving the inaugural lecture for the public education initiative. In a March 23 X post , El Salvador's Bitcoin Office wrote that the program would leverage industry experts to provide university-level artificial intelligence education to students and professionals. The Bitcoin Office added: ""This is the only national education program bringing in top-tier field experts to blow young minds!

Bitcoin needs weekly close above $85k to avoid correction to $76k: analysts Bitcoin analysts are eying the weekly close to gauge Bitcoin’s price trajectory for next week, as traditional and crypto markets are lacking direction amid a mix of global trade war fears paired with easing inflation concerns. Bitcoin's ( BTC ) price may see more downside next week unless it manages to close the week above the $85,000 psychological mark, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. “Bitcoin’s relief rally after the FOMC meeting and lower CPI readings has analysts eyeing a weekly close above $85,000, as critical for resuming upside momentum,” Lee told Cointelegraph, adding: “A close above this level could prevent a drop to $76,000 and signal strength, while $87,000 would provide even clearer bullish confirmation. Macro factors like steady rates and cooling inflation support risk assets, but the Sunday close will be decisive.” BTC/USD, 1-year chart.

Crypto security will always be a game of ‘cat and mouse’ — Wallet exec Cryptocurrency wallet providers are getting more sophisticated , but so are bad actors — which means the battle between security and threats is at a deadlock, says a hardware wallet firm executive. “It will always be a cat and mouse game,” Ledger chief experience officer Ian Rogers told Cointelegraph when describing the constant race between crypto wallet firms adding new security features and hackers finding more advanced ways to access victims’ wallets. Rogers said, unfortunately, the most straightforward scams work best because scammers rely on people making simple mistakes. “People give their 24-word phrases to people every day, so as long as that happens, then they are going to go for the low-cost tax,” he said, adding: “Anyone who asks for your 24 words is a criminal.” Rogers highlighted a common crypto scam where victims get tricked by replies under “any post on Twitter about crypto,” with messages like “DM me, and I’ll help you.” “You know that scammers are always asking you for your 24 words,” Rogers said.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|BCH|ETH|USDT|XRP|MATIC|ZK|ADA|TON|BNB|WLD|SOL|APT|ARB|AVAX|LINK|ASIA|MINING|USDC|FIAT|ARKM|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-23 21:23:23

The attacker tried to exploit GitHub permissions to add harmful code into the project’s automated build system (CI/CD pipeline). Thanks to a fast response from Coinbase and help from security professionals, no major damage occurred. The issue was first made public on March 23, when Yu Jian, the founder of the security firm SlowMist, shared a post on X. He referred to a detailed report from Unit 42, the security research team at Palo Alto Networks. The hacker targeted Coinbase’s open-source tool agentkit , which helps create blockchain-based AI agents. They also attacked another related toolkit, onchainkit , both hosted on GitHub. By forking these repositories, the attacker inserted dangerous code into the automation process. This malicious activity was detected on March 14, 2025 . Unit 42 explained that the goal was to take advantage of the public CI/CD flow in agentkit. The hacker used GitHub’s broad “write-all” permissions, which allowed them to plant harmful payloads into the automated workflows. This could have exposed sensitive data or opened the door to further compromises. Fortunately, the injected code did not include highly dangerous features like remote control tools or reverse shell exploits. Instead, it was built to gather internal data quietly. Still, the risk was serious. Coinbase moved quickly. Working closely with cybersecurity experts, the company isolated the threat and applied key protections. Their quick action stopped the attack before it could reach deeper systems or cause lasting harm. This incident comes at a time when Coinbase holds a critical role in the crypto world, especially as the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. and a main custodian for spot Bitcoin ETFs . A successful breach could have created serious problems in the wider industry, similar to Bybit’s recent $1.4 billion hack. Although this attack failed, the same threat actor is now believed to be part of a larger cyber campaign that is gaining global attention. In response, Yu Jian urged developers to carefully review their GitHub setups. He specifically warned those using tools like reviewdog or tj-actions to double-check their systems and make sure no sensitive information has leaked. “If your company uses reviewdog or tj-actions, do a thorough self-examination,” he advised on X. The case shows how securing open-source tools is becoming more urgent as the crypto space grows. According to data from DeFiLlama, over $1.5 billion in crypto has already been lost to hacks and exploits this year alone.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-23 21:40:54
42230932,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61406,1742766188,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Role of Blockchain in the Digital World,https://timestabloid.com/the-role-of-blockchain-in-the-digital-world/,"Blockchain technology has emerged as one of the most transformative innovations of the 21st century. It has revolutionized industries ranging from finance to healthcare, creating new opportunities for secure and decentralized digital transactions. While initially known as the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchain has expanded beyond digital currencies, shaping various sectors and redefining how data is stored and verified. In this article, we will explore how blockchain is influencing the world and the many ways it is being integrated into different industries. Understanding Blockchain Technology At its core, blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that records transactions across multiple computers. This system ensures transparency, security, and immutability, making it nearly impossible to alter or hack data once it has been recorded. Unlike traditional centralized databases, blockchain does not rely on a single authority to manage or validate information. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that work together to maintain the integrity of the ledger. Each block in a blockchain contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, forming a continuous chain. This structure enhances security and prevents tampering, making blockchain a reliable tool for digital record-keeping. Key Features of Blockchain 1. Decentralization One of the most important aspects of blockchain technology is decentralization. Unlike traditional financial systems that depend on central banks or governments, blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network. This means that no single entity has control over the entire system, reducing the risks of fraud and manipulation. 2. Security and Transparency Blockchain networks use cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions, making them highly resistant to cyber threats. Additionally, all transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust among users. 3. Immutability Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or deleted. This immutability ensures that records remain accurate and unaltered, which is particularly valuable in industries that require verifiable data integrity, such as healthcare and supply chain management. Applications of Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency Although blockchain gained popularity through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, its potential extends far beyond digital money. Here are some of the key areas where blockchain is making a significant impact: 1. Finance and Banking Blockchain has transformed the financial sector by enabling faster, more secure, and cost-effective transactions. Traditional banking processes often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and high transaction fees. Blockchain eliminates these middlemen, allowing direct peer-to-peer transactions. Moreover, smart contracts – self-executing agreements stored on the blockchain – streamline processes like loan approvals and cross-border payments. 2. Supply Chain Management Blockchain enhances transparency and traceability in supply chains by providing an immutable record of goods as they move through various stages of production and distribution. Companies can use blockchain to track product origins, prevent counterfeiting, and improve inventory management. 3. Healthcare and Medical Records The healthcare industry benefits greatly from blockchain’s ability to store and secure patient records. Blockchain ensures that medical histories remain accurate, up-to-date, and accessible only to authorized individuals. This reduces errors, prevents data breaches, and improves patient care. 4. Real Estate and Property Transactions Real estate transactions often involve complex paperwork and lengthy verification processes. Blockchain simplifies this by creating digital property ownership records, reducing the need for intermediaries, and minimizing fraud risks. Smart contracts also automate property sales, ensuring smooth and transparent transactions. 5. Voting Systems Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize voting systems by ensuring secure and tamper-proof elections. With blockchain-based voting, each vote is recorded on a decentralized ledger, preventing fraud and ensuring transparency in the electoral process. 6. Intellectual Property and Digital Rights Artists, musicians, and content creators can use blockchain to protect their intellectual property rights. By registering their work on a blockchain, they can create a verifiable proof of ownership, preventing unauthorized use and ensuring fair compensation. 7. Education and Credential Verification Blockchain can be used in the education sector to verify academic credentials. Universities and employers can use blockchain to ensure that diplomas, certificates, and degrees are authentic and tamper-proof, reducing fraud in academic qualifications. 8. Decentralized Identity Verification Identity theft and data breaches are major concerns in today’s digital world. Blockchain offers a solution by enabling decentralized identity verification, allowing individuals to control their own digital identities securely. This eliminates the need for centralized databases that are vulnerable to hacking. 9. Energy Trading and Sustainability Blockchain technology is being integrated into the energy sector to enable peer-to-peer energy trading. Homeowners with solar panels can sell excess energy directly to others without the need for intermediaries. This creates a more efficient and sustainable energy distribution system. The Future of Blockchain Blockchain technology continues to evolve, and its adoption is expected to grow across multiple industries. Innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain-based identity verification are paving the way for a more secure and decentralized digital future. However, challenges remain, including regulatory uncertainty, scalability issues, and energy consumption concerns. Governments and organizations worldwide are working to address these challenges to ensure the responsible development and integration of blockchain technology. Conclusion Blockchain is more than just a buzzword; it is a groundbreaking technology with the potential to reshape numerous industries. From finance and healthcare to real estate and digital rights management, blockchain’s decentralized and secure nature is revolutionizing how data and transactions are handled. As technology continues to evolve, its impact on the world will only grow, offering endless possibilities for innovation and efficiency. Businesses and individuals looking to stay ahead in the digital era should embrace blockchain technology and explore its benefits. Whether it’s through secure financial transactions, transparent supply chains, or tamper-proof voting systems, blockchain is set to become a fundamental pillar of the future digital landscape.

42229812,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=697835,1742767200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42229812.jpeg,Solana (SOL) Holder Abruptly Sells Huge SOL Stake for New Coin Currently Under $0.03,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-holder-abruptly-sells-huge-sol-stake-for-new-coin-currently-under-0-03/,"One of the largest Solana (SOL) investors has cashed in a huge amount of their bag in the crypto market to purchase Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending token that is in presale and is currently valued at less than $0.03. It follows the turbocharged presale of Mutuum Finance, with Phase 3 already 60% full after raking in $4.5 million and 6,400 holders. Despite currently sitting at $0.02, on its next stage, MUTM will rise to $0.025 — a 25% increase — fostering an urge to buy MUTM to prevent a gap formed with the next price range. The token is said to have artificially induced buy pressure mechanisms and real-world use cases in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, which analysts are looking to as catalysts for its explosive potential. Presale Ramps Up For Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting immense demand as a first to market with its unique lending model and profit-sharing ecosystem. The project’s presale has already surpassed $4.5 million, with Phase 3 tokens being snapped up quickly in advance of an exchange listing at $0.06. In fact, those who snatch the token up now at the $0.02 price will be able to see a return of 200% when MUTM hits the public markets. An exciting post-launch price prediction based on tokenomics is also strongly propelling optimism – $1.50 would imply a 7,400% ROI and has established MUTM as a genuine breakout candidate in terms of DeFi due diligence across 2025. A share of protocol income flows into the platform’s “buy-and-distribute” system, directly purchasing MUTM tokens for distribution among stakers. This mechanism maintains demand and prevents sell offs which creates a self-reinforcing cycle of scarcity and value increase. Moreover, Mutuum’s overcollateralized lending pools and peer-to-peer borrowing services provide real utility that distinguishes it from speculative competitors. Shift In Investors On Solana Reflects The Confidence In The Market The Solana (SOL) investor’s move to Mutuum Finance is part of a larger trend of capital flowing toward projects with tangible use cases. Despite being one of the leading blockchains, Solana has faced challenges in recent months — including price fluctuations and network congestion — which have motivated some investors to seek additional opportunities among newer tokens, such as MUTM. The presale mechanics of Mutuum with progressive price increases between phases is a hook for many looking for asymmetric returns. The $0.02 barrier to entry of Phase 3 in particular is well considered. Over half of the allocation has already been taken, so the window to secure tokens at this tier is closing. By buying now ahead of Phase 4, investors not only secure themselves a 25% gain, but place themselves in prime position for even more exponential growth after listing. In contrast, Solana’s 2025 estimates fall short of MUTM’s potential, given the latter’s strategic integrations with DeFi and token burns designed to escalate its market presence. Security and Long-Term Vision The development team of Mutuum Finance has started a security audit with CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm. The results of the audit will be made public, and behind it, transparency. This preventive measure is in line with the project’s dedication to risk mitigation and keeping users’ funds and platform operations safe from exploits. The protocol’s roadmap involves the launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin, which would add to the diversity of its DeFi offerings. By minting stablecoins against pooled deposits, Mutuum plans to improve liquidity while keeping things decentralized — a direct challenge to centralized stablecoin masters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is changing what it means to have value, revolutionizing lending and incentivizing investors. With the presale gaining momentum and exchange listings on the horizon, the $0.02 price point could mark a brief window of opportunity for the project. Those early adopters will be able to enjoy life-changing returns that would be a mirror image of the foresight shown by the Solana whale who bet on MUTM. With Phase 3 almost full, waiting will cost you the final low-price entry before the flood of price increases irreversibly begins.

Perhaps basking in the landmark win, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, says the company will continue to push for fair regulations. Victory over SEC Sparks Renewed Push for Fair Rules In an interview with CNBC , Alderoty maintained that Ripple will lead the quest for “clear and fair crypto regulation.” This stance comes after Ripple announced that the U.S. regulatory body has decided not to pursue its controversial appeal against it. The SEC did not only drop its case with Ripple; other crucial cases were also tossed off. Some of those cases included the SEC’s case against American crypto exchange Coinbase, Kraken, and OpenSea . The development comes amid the shift in aggressive crypto enforcement the SEC has been known for under its former Chair, Gary Gensler. Interestingly, despite the SEC dropping its lawsuit, Ripple has remained silent about the cross-appeal it filed. The company has not made its stance known as to whether it would continue with the case or withdraw it. In a recent interview, Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO, stated that it has not yet reached a decision yet. Ripple’s Legal Battle and Its Market Impact Ripple’s victory over the SEC is a testament to the firm’s resilience. According to Alderoty, “Ripple stands alone as the company that fought back and won on essential legal questions.” Notably, the SEC filed a suit against the company four years ago, accusing it of raising over one billion dollars from XRP sales. The regulatory body argued that Ripple failed to register XRP as a security. XRP, launched in 2012, is one of the first altcoins in the cryptocurrency space. It became the native currency of Ripple Labs. Future of Crypto Regulation Post-Ripple Case The asset has remained resilient throughout the legal drama and witnessed an 11% increase after the news of the legal battle hit the market. As of this writing, XRP is changing hands at $2.41, a 1.72% increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. With the legal hurdle over, many analysts anticipate XRP’s value to soar. Interestingly, Ripple’s executives predict that crypto assets could record explosive growth this year.

Coinbase Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Paul Grewal has taken swipes at the US Treasury for its “botched” attempt at waiving the need for a final judgment. Coinbase CLO Pokes Holes In US Treasury’s Latest Court Filing In a strongly worded post on X , Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal railed against the US Treasury’s handling of Tornado Cash’s delisting from the sanctions list. According to Grewal’s disclosure, the US Treasury filed a pleading to moot the need for a final judgment on the matter. In legal terms, a party to dispute can apply to moot a final judgment, arguing that the issue at hand is no longer significant or actionable. Following Tornado Cash’s removal from the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list, the US Treasury’s latest filing seeks to waive a final judgment on the case. Tornado Cash users have been in court, challenging the US Treasury’s decision to place the mixer on the SDN list. However, Grewal argues that the filing runs contrary to established legal processes in the US. He notes a proper filing follows only if the defendant can show that the “practice cannot reasonably be expected to recur.” The Coinbase CLO cited several legal precedents involving law enforcement agencies removing sanctions and not moving a case. He argues that without a final court judgment, law enforcement can review their decision to impose fresh sanctions at a future date. “Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again,” said Grewal. A Protracted Legal Battle Against Authorities The road toward the lifting of Tornado Cash’s sanctions was long and winding. A raft of Tornado Cash users headed to court to protest the placing of the mixer on the SDN list. US authorities say the mixer played a principal role in laundering nearly $500 million worth of stolen digital assets by North-Korean backed Lazarus Group. After notching a series of small wins in Court, Grewal criticized the US Treasury for failing to comply with a court ruling clarifying the status of Tornado Cash’s smart contract. The court ruled that the smart contract did not form property under the IEEPA as it is non-erasable. Tornado Cash has received support from Coinbase with the Ethereum Foundation supporting the legal defense of lead developer Alexey Pertsev.

Prosecutors allege that he misused $11 million from a major streaming service, meant for his science fiction television series “White Horse,” on crypto trading. The $11M Fraud According to the indictment, Rinsch reached a deal with the streaming platform in 2018, securing $44 million to complete the production of White Horse. In 2019 and early 2020, he requested an additional $11 million, which was transferred to his company on March 6, 2020. In a statement , acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said: “As alleged, Carl Erik Rinsch orchestrated a scheme to steal millions by soliciting a large investment from a video streaming service, claiming that money would be used to finance a television show that he was creating. But that was fiction.” Instead of using the funds as intended, he moved them through various accounts before storing them in a personal brokerage account. He then engaged in speculative securities trading but lost more than half of the funds within two months. Rather than redirecting the remaining money back into the show, Rinsch allegedly shifted to crypto trading and continued making extravagant personal purchases. Prosecutors say he spent nearly $1.8 million on credit card payments, $1 million on legal fees for lawsuits against the streaming service and his divorce, and $395,000 on luxury hotel stays and rental properties. Further, the Netflix director spent $3.8 million on furniture and antiques, including $638,000 on two mattresses and $295,000 on luxury bedding. His purchases also included five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari totaling $2.4 million and $652,000 on designer watches and clothing. The Charges Against Rinsch The 47-year-old has been indicted with one count of wire fraud, one count of money laundering, and five counts of engaging in financial transactions involving criminally gotten property. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison for wire fraud, 20 years for money laundering, and 10 years for each financial transaction charge. This is not Rinsch’s first encounter with controversy. In 2023, the “Conquest” director reportedly took $4 million from the show’s budget to invest in Dogecoin, earning a $27 million return. Much like the current case, his crypto profits were followed by a lavish spending spree. Rinsch allegedly spent nearly $9 million on luxury purchases, including high-end furniture, designer clothing, a $380,000 watch, and luxury vehicles.

Concurrently, BlockDAG’s latest AMA delivered a wealth of updates, especially thrilling the community with a major announcement: an upcoming beta testnet launch accompanied by a generous 10,000 testnet token airdrop. These distinct developments reflect significant momentum for both projects, each impacting investor sentiment uniquely. For XRP, traders focus on its technical strength and legal milestones. For BlockDAG , investor enthusiasm builds on ambitious testnet plans and community incentives. This combination of XRP’s steady progress and BlockDAG’s strategic community engagement sets a compelling scene for crypto observers this quarter. XRP Holds Steady, Targets a New High XRP traders watched carefully as the cryptocurrency bounced from its critical support at $2.30, positioning itself for a potential move toward $3. Recently, XRP’s stability at this support level boosted market optimism significantly. Technical indicators highlighted a successful defense against bearish pressures, showing strength amid market volatility. Analysts identified the $2.42 resistance level as the key barrier before XRP can successfully break toward its ambitious $3 target. This current range ($2.30-$2.42) remains closely monitored as traders await clear directional signals. Adding further fuel to the bullish sentiment, XRP recently celebrated a pivotal legal milestone. The protracted lawsuit involving Ripple Labs and the SEC concluded favorably, significantly alleviating regulatory pressures that had long cast shadows over XRP. The resolution of this lawsuit dramatically improved market sentiment, giving XRP bulls additional confidence to maintain buying pressure at current support levels. This optimism is further supported by XRP’s broader adoption trajectory, with Ripple’s growing cross-border payment partnerships continuing to strengthen the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals. As Ripple expands globally, demand for XRP’s liquidity solutions steadily grows, underpinning bullish arguments beyond mere technical analyses. Traders and investors alike are thus hopeful that these combined factors can push XRP confidently toward the much-anticipated $3 price point in the near term. BlockDAG AMA Highlights Robust Community Initiatives On the other hand, BlockDAG continues capturing investor interest through proactive community-building strategies. The project’s latest AMA session unveiled detailed updates, significantly elevating enthusiasm within its community. Perhaps most notably, BlockDAG announced an imminent beta testnet launch coupled with an ambitious 10,000 testnet token airdrop to each of its 110,000 investors. This significant initiative aims to amplify community engagement while thoroughly testing network capacity, usability, and stability. During the AMA, the BlockDAG team emphasized the meticulous preparations for this testnet phase, detailing extensive improvements implemented since the previous alpha phase. Upgrades include enhanced node installation processes, streamlined documentation, and significantly improved network explorers. New capabilities like contract verification, node explorer functionalities, and real-time token views further bolster the testnet’s appeal, setting clear benchmarks for transparency and user-friendliness. Additionally, the AMA outlined a compelling incentive program designed explicitly to boost participation. The top 30 participants across various engagement metrics—including active wallets, miner participation, and token balances—stand to receive substantial rewards totaling $60,000, distributed in real BDAG tokens post-launch. This strategy highlights BlockDAG’s determination to foster an active and involved community, creating valuable feedback loops that improve network functionalities ahead of the mainnet launch. Beyond short-term excitement, BlockDAG also provided crucial clarifications on token vesting schedules, enhancing investor clarity. Presale investors will receive 40% of their tokens immediately upon the Token Generation Event (TGE), followed by evenly paced releases over subsequent months. Bonuses and miner rewards involve structured lock-ups extending from one to five years, underscoring BlockDAG’s commitment to sustainable growth and market stability post-launch. These details revealed transparently in the AMA, reinforce investor confidence, showcasing long-term planning and fiscal responsibility from the project’s leadership. The AMA also spotlighted significant strategic partnerships, including a prominent alliance with Inter Milan. This high-profile partnership offers substantial marketing potential, blending crypto innovation with traditional global sports appeal. Exclusive fan experiences, branded merchandise, and stadium tours were detailed as elements of this partnership, designed explicitly to extend BlockDAG’s global reach beyond crypto-native audiences. Additionally, BlockDAG’s participation in significant blockchain events—like ETHDenver, ETHPanama, and upcoming Token2049 summits in Dubai and Singapore—reflects the project’s coordinated strategy to bolster visibility and credibility within the broader crypto and blockchain sectors. Key takeaways As XRP maintains bullish ambitions, BlockDAG’s transparent AMA and community-first strategies continue driving meaningful investor engagement. Both cryptocurrencies stand poised for significant developments, each with clearly defined catalysts. XRP’s near-term path hinges on overcoming resistance, supported by robust fundamentals and favorable legal outcomes. For BlockDAG, the imminent testnet launch, significant airdrop incentives, structured vesting policies, and high-profile partnerships paint a clear and exciting trajectory. These clear, milestone-driven developments position both XRP and BlockDAG attractively within the broader market. However, BlockDAG’s raging presale with over $206M in presale, carefully structured community incentives, thorough transparency, and strategic event participation underline a particularly appealing narrative for long-term-oriented investors seeking sustainable value. Investors assessing crypto opportunities today would be wise to closely monitor both projects, though BlockDAG’s meticulous preparation and long-term vision distinctly set it apart.

The star of this trend? Remittix (RTX) , a $0.0734 altcoin that has already raised over $14 million and sold more than 520 million tokens. Some traders are calling it “XRP 2.0” thanks to its focus on low-cost, near-instant remittances. There’s also chatter that RTX could surge past $5 by 2025, an enormous leap from its current price. Below, we unpack how the PayFi narrative is gaining traction, why Remittix leads the pack, and how high it might climb in the next bull market. Why PayFi Is Booming PayFi tokens like Remittix are aimed at making payments simpler, cheaper and more user-friendly. Traditional wire transfers can be expensive and slow, a hassle for families, freelancers or small shops dealing with international clients. Remittix addresses this pain point directly, letting users convert crypto (BTC, ETH or others) into local cash and send it to a bank account in around 24 hours. This sets PayFi apart from advanced DeFi or NFT platforms, appealing to people who need to move money across borders without crazy fees. With the global remittance market worth trillions, PayFi tokens might have a huge real-world audience ready to jump in. As cross-border payments remain a daily challenge for countless people, the simplicity of PayFisolutions often wins them over. Someone who struggles with wire transfers or expensive remittance apps wants a no-fuss way to convert digital assets to local currency. That’s why PayFitokens like Remittix are attracting fresh interest, as they marry the benefits of crypto (speed and low fees) with the familiarity of regular bank deposits. Remittix (RTX): The ‘XRP 2.0’? While XRP famously tackled cross-border finance for banks, Remittix focuses on everyone else's families, gig workers and small businesses. Priced at $0.0734, RTX has pulled in over $14 million in funding, with 520+ million tokens sold in presale, showing strong initial backing. The team aims to keep things user-friendly, automating the entire conversion process so recipients don’t have to wrestle with crypto wallets or advanced steps. Observers believe that if Remittix (RTX) secures deals with major payroll systems or e-commerce companies, daily usage could skyrocket, pushing the token well beyond its current valuation. That’s why some analysts see it as “XRP 2.0,” but with a more direct approach to real people’s needs. Could RTX Really Pass $5 by 2025? At first glance, jumping from about $0.07 to over $5 sounds wild yet fans note that similar leaps happened when tokens like XRP or early DeFi coins caught mainstream attention. If Remittix(RTX) does become a go-to solution for cross-border transfers, its daily transaction volume could spike rapidly. Each new user has friends or family who might also switch, creating a chain reaction of adoption. Of course, hitting $5 demands big partnerships, consistent network stability and a supportive crypto market cycle. But given how large the international remittance market is, some experts say the goal is possible especially if PayFi becomes the next hot niche. Conclusion: Why Remittix Might Outpace XRP’s Old Record While XRP still plays a major role in cross-border banking, Remittix aims to capture everyday payments. At $0.0734 with over $14+ million raised, its potential user base (from freelancers to families) could drive a bigger, faster adoption wave than older tokens reliant on big institutional deals. If PayFi momentum continues, RTX has a big chance of surpassing $5 in the next bull run delivering life-changing gains for early buyers. Remittix stands as a prime example of how focusing on an everyday problem can catapult a token from obscurity to stardom, even in a crowded crypto landscape. Ready to Give Remittix a Go?

It also vowed to consider talking points raised by the Virtual Asset Committee, a government advisory body that answers to the FSC. The BOK, meanwhile, is more “reluctant” to act. It has gone on the record as stating that it is “cautious about investing in virtual assets,” as they “do not meet the IMF’s foreign exchange reserve requirements.” The bank has also claimed that “high price volatility” means BTC and other tokens may not be “in line with the purpose of managing foreign exchange reserves.” South Korea’s financial authorities tighten AML controls to address new money laundering risks in the crypto sector. #SouthKorea #CryptoLaws https://t.co/2BlRNYWfxR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 5, 2025 The FSC has taken a different stance, noting that the Virtual Asset Committee has reported on “the possibility of stockpiling digital assets” and “setting the standards for stockpiling” crypto.

Web3 casinos represent a fundamental shift in gambling, reducing the risk of manipulation or fraud through verifiable randomness and immutable transaction records. The marriage of cryptocurrency and gambling creates a powerful combination that addresses long-standing issues in the industry. Through token ownership, players can verify game fairness, enjoy faster withdrawals, and participate in casino governance. These platforms are building what some call ""GambleFi"", an ecosystem where betting becomes community-centric and tokenised. As blockchain technology matures​​, the trajectory of Web3 gambling points toward increased democratisation and player control. The concept of rolling the decentralised dice goes beyond just playing games, it represents a new paradigm in which gamblers become stakeholders in the platforms they use. This shift from mere consumers to active participants may fundamentally restructure the £100+ billion online gambling industry for decades to come. The Advancement of Decentralised Gaming Platforms Decentralised gaming platforms have transformed the gambling industry by introducing transparency, security, and user ownership. These platforms leverage blockchain technology to create a more fair and accessible gambling environment. Evolution from Traditional to Decentralised Gambling “Traditional online casinos operate under centralised control, requiring players to trust the operator to maintain fair games and handle funds properly. Web3 gambling changes this dynamic by using blockchain to create trustless environments where outcomes are verifiable,” said UK online casino website JeffBet . The shift began with simple decentralised betting applications that processed payments using Bitcoin. These primitive platforms demonstrated the potential for removing intermediaries from gambling transactions. Today's Web3 casinos offer sophisticated experiences comparable to conventional online gambling sites. Without lengthy verification processes, players can now use digital wallets to deposit and withdraw various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Solana. User ownership represents a critical advancement. Players can verify game fairness through distributed ledgers rather than relying on opaque algorithms controlled by a single entity. Technological Underpinnings of Web3 Casinos Blockchain technology, smart contracts, and digital currencies are the foundation of Web3 casinos. Together, these elements create transparent, secure, and user-controlled gambling platforms. Smart contracts, self-executing agreements with rules written in code, automatically determine game outcomes and distribute winnings. This automation eliminates the need to trust a centralised casino operator to pay out winnings. Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and game results are recorded immutably. Players can independently verify that games run fairly by checking the distributed ledger. Security benefits extend beyond fair play. Digital wallets provide enhanced protection against fraud compared to traditional payment methods. Players maintain control of their funds until they actively place bets. Interoperability between blockchains is improving, allowing gamblers to use their preferred digital currency. Whether using Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, or emerging currencies, the increasing flexibility makes Web3 gambling more accessible. Benefits and Opportunities of Dice Gaming on the Blockchain Blockchain technology offers unique advantages for dice games that traditional online casinos simply cannot match. These innovations reshape the player experience through verifiable fairness, economic incentives, and unmatched security. Providing Fair Systems and Transparency The most compelling feature of blockchain-based dice games is their provably fair system. Unlike traditional online casinos where algorithms remain hidden, Web3 dice games use cryptographic methods to verify each roll's fairness. By examining the blockchain record, players can independently check that outcomes weren't manipulated. This verification happens through cryptographic hash functions and publicly visible smart contracts. The transparency extends beyond individual dice rolls. Casino profit margins (house edge) are coded directly into smart contracts, making them immutable and visible to all players. This openness builds unprecedented trust. Players who know with mathematical certainty that games aren't rigged develop stronger confidence in the platform. Many decentralised dice games publicly display transaction histories and dice roll outcomes on the blockchain, creating a permanent, tamper-proof record that regulatory bodies and players can audit. Tokenomics: Earning and Spending in Web3 Web3 dice games introduce innovative economic models through tokenised systems. Players often earn native platform tokens through gameplay, staking, or participation. These tokens serve multiple functions. They act as in-game currency for placing bets and grant governance rights in decentralised platforms. Token holders may vote on house edge percentages or new game implementations. Loyalty programmes in blockchain dice games offer free spins and bonuses based on token holdings rather than centralised decisions, creating a more equitable reward structure. Players can earn passive income by staking their tokens to provide liquidity to the dice game's betting pool. This makes players partial ""house owners"" who share in platform profits. The interoperability of tokens means winnings from dice games can be used across the broader Web3 ecosystem, creating greater utility than closed casino systems. Enhanced Security and Player Autonomy Blockchain dice games dramatically improve security through cryptographic protection and eliminating central points of failure. Funds remain in player-controlled wallets rather than casino accounts. Smart contracts automate payouts instantly when winning conditions are met. This removes the withdrawal delays and arbitrary limits common in traditional online casinos. Instant withdrawals via cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin allow players to access their winnings whenever they choose, without waiting for approval from centralised authorities. Players maintain full custody of their funds until they place a bet. This self-custody model eliminates the risk of casino insolvency affecting player deposits. KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements are often minimised or eliminated, protecting player privacy while maintaining responsible gambling standards through blockchain verification. Implications for the Online Gambling Ecosystem The rise of decentralised dice platforms forces traditional gambling operators to reconsider their business models. Many are now incorporating blockchain elements to remain competitive. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to accommodate these new models. Some jurisdictions now recognise blockchain's inherent protections and are creating specialised licensing for Web3 gambling operations. Rolling the decentralised dice represents more than technological change, it signals a philosophical shift towards player-centric gambling experiences. Cross-chain compatibility allows dice games to operate across multiple blockchains, reaching broader audiences and providing flexibility in cryptocurrency choice for betting. The community-governed nature of these platforms ensures that development priorities reflect actual player needs rather than purely profit-driven motives.

According to the company, the number of active altcoins listed on CoinMarketCap dropped by 400, indicating a decrease in public interest. This decline is largely attributed to the significant decline in altcoin trading volume on exchanges, which currently averages $100 billion, much lower than the $400 billion recorded in December 2024. Despite this, Alphractal suggests that decreasing trading volumes will not necessarily prevent future price increases in altcoins. Historical trends show that altcoins have reached all-time highs even when trading volume has not peaked, as seen in 2021. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson stated that new incentives are needed in the cryptocurrency market. Wedson stated that, unlike the peak enthusiasm in 2017 and 2021, the current market is facing slow growth and lack of investor confidence. Wedson also identified the significant decline in investments in Web3 startups as a major contributing factor: 2021: $33 billion worldwide 2022: $7.1 billion raised despite “crypto winter,” signaling an early slowdown. 2023: Less than $7 billion raised, a 74% decrease from 2021. According to Crunchbase, $1.7 billion was raised in the first quarter alone, the lowest amount since late 2020. This decline in Web3 investments outpaced the downturn in the overall Venture Capital (VC) market, which saw a 38% decline between 2021 and 2023. Wedson pointed out several key reasons for the market slump: The collapse of FTX and the resulting loss of confidence in the industry. Regulatory uncertainties in major cryptocurrency markets. Shifting investor focus to Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is set to attract around $50 billion by 2023. Despite these challenges, Wedson remains optimistic about the potential for a resurgence in crypto investment, believing that the combination of AI, crypto, and gaming-themed cryptocurrencies could be the next big driver of institutional capital. Alphractal’s latest observations show that Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) have accumulated more long positions than short positions over the past week, suggesting that the market could experience higher volatility early next week. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency world now focuses on Remittix as the token projected to surpass both Solana and Cardano in 2025 market performance. The market has shown its desire for straightforward payment options by allowing Remittix to sell more than 521 million tokens at $0.0734 each which resulted in $14 million raised. Solana’s Strong Momentum and ETF Speculation Source: tradingview . SOL’s current price is $133.27. The price of Solana regularly undergoes substantial changes. High growth rates and quick processing combined to make Solana renowned until obstacles such as network failures and negative market changes appeared. Recent attention on Solana news revolves around developing a Solana ETF just like traditional investors utilized for Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs. Such an ETF approval would enhance SOL's standing while offering an opportunity for new capital inflow from hedge funds alongside institutional participants. Solana could establish itself permanently in the cryptocurrency industry thanks to additional institutional support. Meme coin developers choose Solana because of its affordable transaction costs which allows them to deploy new tokens on its chain thus increasing on-chain action. The increase in transactions generates both short-term popularity and enhances the speed of operations in the network. The proposed exchange-traded fund could create institutional backing for Solana if its hopes materialize. Cardano’s Choppy Waters and Possible Recovery Since its inception Cardano (ADA) followed a step-by-step development process while relying on research reviewed by peers together with network upgrading layers. The coin experiences unstable performance during the latest week. The crypto market experiences significant challenges as analysts detect a “ Death Cross ” technical indicator that signals a bearish pattern following a 37% value decrease during this month. At its current price of $0.71 the ADA coin remains close to its essential support value at $0.70 . If the price drops below $0.62 it will strengthen the current bearish market sentiment. Source: tradingview . ADA’s death cross pattern. Although Cardano maintains fans who focus on its long-term development. Pioneers expect ADA to retrace to $1 after it successfully rises above $0.77 and maintains upward momentum. ADA along with the entire cryptocurrency market continues to give Charles Hoskinson hope as he suggests 2025 will mark their breakthrough year. Large holders continue to envision ADA growth potential based on their recent purchases of approximately 190 million tokens in the span of 48 hours. The signals point in different directions at present while new heavy buying spells the start of significant market advancement. Remittix: The Altcoin Forecasted to Outperform The direct everyday functionality of Remittix enters the market as settled competitors Solana and Cardano face scaling issues together with uncertain market sentiment alongside upcoming price barriers. The project obtained $14 million in funding through selling 521 million tokens at $0.0734. Through its swift crypto shortcode method Remittix enables users to make instant digital asset conversions that lead to easy spending and transferring capabilities. Numerous experts predict Remittix will deliver market successes because they believe today's consumers are seeking user-friendly practical solutions over multilayered platforms or delayed system updates. The incoming merchant partnerships, remittance services and e-commerce deals have the potential to create significant demand for Remittix tokens. Many experts consider Remittix the leading altcoin to dominate market gains during 2025 because it appeals to both crypto veterans and introductory users seeking simple payment methods. Why Remittix Could Eclipse Solana and Cardano Remittix distinguishes itself from Solana and Cardano with its straightforward link between cryptocurrency and regular bank funds while Solana focuses on developer needs and Cardano drives their development through research. The user bases continue supporting both coins but institutional money could potentially choose projects offering solutions for instant everyday needs. The rumored ETF for Solana holds promise along with potential improvements for Cardano yet these outcomes depend on directed and gradual project developments. Conclusion Analysts predict that both Solana and Cardano will experience partial price gains as certain market players continue to show enthusiasm for well-recognized platforms. New alternatives to Bitcoin are earning widespread approval as they address routine challenges in the year 2025. Near-instant payment solutions form the key priority of Remittix in its market leadership. The market recommends Remittix's direct payment solutions for its clear approach to delivering everyday utility ahead of methodical roadmap-driven projects like Cardano and prospectively successful projects like Solana.

Fidelity’s March 21 filing with the US securities regulator said “OnChain” would help track transactions of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX) — an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills. While OnChain is pending regulatory approval, it is expected to take effect on May 30, Fidelity said. Fidelity’s filing to register a tokenized version of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund. Source: Securities and Exchange Commission The OnChain share class aims to provide investors transparency and verifiable tracking of share transactions of FYHXX, although Fidelity will maintain traditional book-entry records as the official ownership ledger. “Although the secondary recording of the OnChain class on a blockchain will not represent the official record of ownership, the transfer agent will reconcile the secondary blockchain transactions with the official records of the OnChain class on at least a daily basis.” Fidelity said the US Treasury bills wouldn’t be directly tokenized. The $5.8 trillion asset manager said it may also expand OnChain to other blockchains in the future.

That’s why many now focus on other coins that show better speed, utility, or smart tech upgrades. In this article, we’ll take a close look at four top trending cryptos in 2025—BlockDAG, Litecoin, Mantra, and XRP. These coins offer unique value with their strong tech and market plans. Each project is expected to make a big move in the coming year. Let’s explore how they work and what makes them special in today’s fast-growing space. BlockDAG: Most Advanced Layer-1 Crypto BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining a lot of attention due to a fast-moving presale that has raised more than $205 million while selling over 18.8 billion coins. Starting at just $0.001 in its first batch, the price has now climbed to $0.0248 in batch 27—a growth of 2,380%. This steady climb shows strong backing from the crypto crowd and explains why BDAG is one of the top trending cryptos in 2025. With plans to list on 10 centralized exchanges (CEXs) in 2025, BlockDAG will become easier to access globally, making buying and trading smoother. Alongside this, its awaited mainnet launch will take the system live, offering real use of its peer-to-peer setup. This move can help shape the future of decentralized tech use. The presale is getting closer to its goal of $600 million, and with only a few batches left, demand is growing. Prices are set to rise with each batch, so those waiting too long might miss a better deal. BlockDAG’s fast growth, mainnet launch, and CEX plans explain why it leads among the top trending cryptos in 2025. Litecoin: Trusted Digital Coin with Fast Transactions Created by ex-Google engineer Charlie Lee in 2011, Litecoin (LTC) was built to improve transaction speed while using less data space than Bitcoin. It now holds a market value of $8.61 billion and trades at $114.46 per coin, proving its steady and reliable track record. The coin’s quick transfer times and lower cost make it a solid pick among top trending cryptos in 2025. It is known for handling daily use cases well, making it ideal for fast digital payments. Its steady support and active use in the crypto scene keep it relevant. LTC”s history of long-term use and simple network function gives it an edge. Keeping watch on Litecoin’s progress may help those tracking coins with proven value and function. Mantra: Bringing DeFi Closer to Traditional Finance Mantra (OM) is a platform that mixes decentralized finance (DeFi) with more familiar banking ideas. It offers services like lending, staking, and community voting, all managed on a blockchain-based setup. The OM coin helps run these services while also giving users voting rights. Priced at $7.38 currently, Mantra has shown a 92.71% price jump in 2024. This performance makes it one of the top trending cryptos in 2025. Yet beyond numbers, it’s also working on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and forming new links in both crypto and finance sectors. People looking at Mantra will want to study its growth path, active user role, and wider adoption before making any long-term move. Its mix of features and ties to DeFi and real finance could make it a strong pick going forward. XRP: Designed for Fast Global Transactions XRP helps move money across borders quickly and with fewer fees. It’s the base of RippleNet, a payment system made for speed and scale. Unlike banks using slow tools like SWIFT, XRP allows faster and cheaper transfers between countries. Its system is built differently from most cryptocurrencies, which has led to talks about how it should be classified. Still, XRP’s tech works well for solving real problems in global payments, which keeps it high on the list of top trending cryptos in 2025. Open-source coding and a clear goal to ease money movement across countries make XRP a project worth watching. For those following coins focused on global use, XRP may be a clear option. Which Top Trending Crypto to Buy Right Now? The crypto space offers many choices, but a few stand out due to strong use cases and clear paths forward. Litecoin has stood the test of time by offering fast and affordable transfers, making it a trusted pick. Mantra takes a smart step by combining DeFi tools with the finance world people already know. Its growth in RWA and service features give it a long-term appeal. XRP’s role in changing how global payments are made gives it solid ground in the top trending cryptos in 2025. Even with these strong names, BlockDAG may have the biggest leap ahead. Its presale passing $205 million, major exchange plans, and upcoming mainnet make it one to watch closely. Few batches remain, and with each one, the price is expected to rise. This mix of timing and strong tech places BlockDAG firmly among the t op trending cryptos in 2025 .

Pseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 244,300 followers on the social media platform X that he expects meme tokens to eventually take center stage, highlighting that the crypto sector relies on trader attention. But while the analyst believes that memecoins will make a comeback, he says those that have been around longer than others will likely lead the surge. One asset on his radar is the Solana ( SOL )-based token Bonk ( BONK ). “Most memes got smashed overall but I think that they’ll eventually come back to some degree. Memes by nature are attention driven but I do think that some of the more ‘Lindy’ ones will have a better chance You probably just go off ecosystem. When SOL is hot, coins like BONK are going to be decent bets (along with some others like Fartcoin and WIF and others). BONK being down 85% from highs to lows probably makes it an ok bet down here (I have a bag of it).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X The trader is referring to the Lindy Effect, a concept suggesting that the longer something has survived, the longer it’s likely to keep surviving. At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.000012. Another memecoin on the trader’s roster is the Ethereum ( ETH )-based token Pepe ( PEPE ). “Feels like PEPE is also around a bottom, too. PEPE obviously an ETH beta but it’s also a good one if BTC starts going wild in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that PEPE would either rally to a high of $0.000015 or collapse to a new 2025 low of $0.000001. At time of writing, PEPE is trading for $0.000007.

Currently though, the market price of DOGE and Pepe Coin is seeking to stabilize but Remittixis performing impressively as it has yielded over 300% returns for early investors positioning it as currently one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Dogecoin Price Is Struggling To Find Footing In 2025 While DOGE began as a joke crypto coin, the currency has cemented its longevity in the top 10 altcoin list by boasting a market capitalization of more than $25 billion. Now trading at $0.17 , Dogecoin has seen modest gains of 2% in the past 24 hours on the back of a broader market rebound following a few weeks of bearish downturns. Some technical analysts have observed that the price of Dogecoin shows downtrend potential under intense resistance causing bearish effects as its EMAs cross paths and trading volume declines rapidly. Other analysts think DOGE shows signs of an upcoming price increase through its formation of an ascending triangle pattern. The price is expected to increase based on the anticipated movement from point AB to point CD and should hit highs of $0.59 in Q3 2025. Overall, the consensus remains that DOGE's reliance on fan-driven hype makes it vulnerable to change in market sentiment and limits its long-term growth potential compared to utility-driven ventures like Remittix . Pepe Coin Is Riding The Meme Wave; Will It Outperform Utility Tokens Like Remittix? Pepe Coin has emerged as one of the most talked-about meme coins in recent weeks, following its 22% price surge in the past 14 days which was brought about by its nostalgic appeal and viral marketing campaigns. With a price of $0.0000073, Pepe Coin sits at number 42 on the list of cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $3 Billion. While analysts project Pepe to reach $0.000026 by mid-2025 should its user base continue to grow, its lack of tangible use cases taints its long-term viability. Like Dogecoin, the success of Pepe Coin relies on maintaining its meme coin value through hype while not offering functional solutions a stark contrast to what Remittix is set to offer the Defi space. Remittix: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments The predictions for Dogecoin price show growth potential while Pepe Coin maintains its position in meme coin speculation but Remittix stands as a unique investment option combining functional benefits with explosive profit. The main distinction of Remittix arises from its aggressive approach in applying blockchain solutions to concrete business utility by providing rapid international money transfers. In contrast to hype-dependent speculative meme coins, Remittix has innovation and utility embedded within it and is a distinctive project in today's saturated new ICO market. Remittixpresale has been nothing but phenomenal and has generated a staggering $13.9 million to date. Trading at $0.0734 per RTX token at the current stage, the presale is a worthwhile entry for those seeking early adopter exponential growth potential. Industry experts forecast the RTX token will see an exponential leap increasing up to 800% by the end of the token presale with further gains anticipated in subsequent months after release and listing on top crypto exchanges.

With growing market optimism following the recent Fed rate pause, speculative BTC traders deployed increased leverage over the weekend. Will BTC advance above $90,000, or will it reverse to $80,000 in the week ahead? Bitcoin (BTC) Retakes $85,500 After Three-Day Consolidation After a prolonged consolidation phase, Bitcoin (BTC) made a major recovery bounce on Sunday. Following Trump’s appearance at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit, many short-term traders opted to take profits on their BTC holdings. Despite the decline, Bitcoin continues to find buyers, as the recent U.S. Fed rate pause announced on Wednesday prompted macro-sensitive capital to flow toward risky assets. Bitcoin price action, March, 24 2025 Bullish tailwinds from the Fed rate pause counteracted the downward pressure from profit-taking, leading to a three-day stalemate at the $84,000 level since Thursday. However, as sell-side pressure subsided, BTC price recorded a major breakout above $86,000 on Sunday, March 23. The chart above shows how BTC rose 2.6%, hitting a daily peak of $85,600. BTC Options Volume nears $800M as Whales Return After Fed Rate Pause Bitcoin price demonstrated remarkable resilience consolidating around $84,000 over the past three days, as macro-sensitive institutional investors reassess their stance on U.S. economic policies. Earlier this month, fears of inflationary pressure from Trump’s proposed tariffs triggered a cautious retreat from risk assets, including Bitcoin. However, with recent CPI and PPI reports showing inflation cooling and the Federal Reserve opting to pause rate hikes, large investors appear to be re-entering the market. This shift in sentiment is reflected in broader financial markets. The S&P 500 surged by 32 points following the Fed rate pause, signalling renewed risk appetite. As Bitcoin mirrors this trend, it has seen a sharp uptick in speculative trading activity from large investors. Validating this stance, Coinglass derivatives market data shows BTC’s options trading volume skyrocketed 24% in the last 24 hours, pushing total volume above $793 million. Bitcoin Derivatives Market Analysis, March 24 | Coinglass What Does 24% Options Trading Surge Mean for Bitcoin Price Action This Week? Options trading is a derivatives market strategy that allows traders to bet on the future price movements of an asset without directly purchasing it. This technique is particularly popular among institutional investors and whales because leverage enables traders to control large positions with relatively small capital, amplifying returns, especially during periods of market volatility. Given that options trading volume surged 24% over the last day, it suggests that whales and institutional investors are taking bullish positions on BTC’s near-term price movements. Why is BTC Options Volume Rising? The renewed interest in BTC options trading aligns with key macroeconomic narratives: Fed Rate Pause Fuels Risk Appetite – With the Fed pausing rate hikes, liquidity-sensitive assets like Bitcoin become more attractive. S&P 500 Rally Indicates Broader Market Confidence – TradFi investors reallocating capital to stocks may also be expanding exposure to BTC. Altcoin Season Rotation – With BTC holding steady above $85,000, traders are betting on volatility to capture short-term gains. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Data Supports Bullish Outlook, But $90K Flip Unlikely Beyond options trading, other key metrics reinforce a positive BTC outlook for the week ahead: Open Interest Rose 3.88% to $54.04B – A sign that new capital is entering the derivatives market. Long/Short Ratio at 1.28 on OKX & 1.2217 on Binance – Indicates more traders are placing long bets. Liquidations Favor Shorts – Over the last 12 hours, $14.2M in short positions were wiped out, compared to just $2.82M in longs. With Bitcoin showing strong demand above $86,000 and institutional investors actively positioning through options, a bullish breakout toward $90,000 remains a distinct possibility. However, signals on the daily Bitcoin price forecast charts below suggest the rally could face significant resistance below the $90,000 mark. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTCUSD Technical Indicators Signal $90,000 Resistance Despite these bullish signals, the technical chart presents a nuanced picture. While Bitcoin has reclaimed $85,600, the looming death cross—where the 50-day moving average trends below the 200-day moving average—remains a cause for concern. This bearish formation suggests that unless BTC can decisively break above $87,200, a retracement toward the $80,000 region remains plausible. Bulls must clear this key resistance zone to sustain momentum toward $90,000. If BTC fails to establish support above $87,200, bears could regain control, triggering a potential pullback.

At the same time, attention turns to a new DeFi project that offers real solutions to crypto payment challenges. It may help many people who struggle with traditional banking by offering faster, safer ways to send money. Many now call it one of the best cryptos to buy. Shiba Inu Price Prediction and Trends Recent data shows that SHIB has seen fluctuations over the past month. The current Shiba Inu price prediction reports a slight dip, but increased whale activity may signal a turn around soon. Technical indicators point to a potential rebound if the market finds a steady base. Analysts who follow Shiba Inu price prediction note that heavy selling by whales may soon turn to accumulation. Some Shiba Inu price prediction reports show that if whales buy more, SHIB could recover and even grow by 97.14% to $0.00002562 by March 28. The coin still enjoys a vibrant community and strong online interest, which many believe will help its price bounce back.

Several positive indicators suggest a rise toward the $5,000 ETH price level. However, the path to this success faces challenges because experts predict Remittix (RTX) will perform better than Ethereum's most ambitious expectations. Retesting a Multi-Year Ascending Support Ethereum has displayed strong resistance over the years. Previous market surges of more than 1,400% and 270% from this technical structure have occurred following the LUNA collapse and the Bybit hack events. Observers of Ethereum's bullish sentiment have valid reasons to be optimistic due to the historical reliability of this trendline despite current market skepticism. This strong level serves as a launchpad which allows Ethereum to generate a positive technical indicator. Analysts predict that ETH overcoming mid-$2,000 resistance zones would enable a quick rising trend towards $3,000, $4,000 or even $5,000. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported during March that whale accumulation of ETH experienced a substantial boost as big players purchased 120,000 Ether worth approximately $236 million throughout three days. Another whale bought approximately 7,000 ETH worth $13.8 million. The large whale purchases indicate widespread enthusiasm because investors small and large view Ethereum as a platform that will persist into the future. Analysts from Standard Chartered predict that ETH may reach $4,000 by 2025 regardless of their previous $10,000 projection. The Road to $5K: Resistance Levels Ahead Despite the renewed optimism, Ethereum still faces stiff resistance at various price checkpoints. The price movement took ETH from 1,825 to 1,940 before reaching $2,061 but selling activity triggered a reversal below the $2,000 mark. The token is currently trading at $1,997. source: coingecko.com The price mechanics alone will not determine if or when ETH can begin its serious push for $5000 because broader market trends will also impact this situation. The crypto market experiences fluctuations driven by both macroeconomic factors and governmental changes that create quick changes in market sentiment. Why Remittix Could Outshine Ethereum’s Ambitions Remittix (RTX) has recently caught significant attention because researchers believe this project might generate superior returns than the upcoming Ethereum rally. Remittix has achieved a successful fundraising round that exceeded $14 million through selling 521 million coins at a price of $0.0734 each. This token addresses a worldwide market need of streamlining international payment systems which positions it to resolve problems affecting many global users while processing huge worldwide remittance flows. Remittix aims to reach an extensive market segment which Ethereum did previously when it established its blockchain applications during its early development phase. The company should succeed in delivering affordable digital remittance services supported by dependable performance to quickly acquire users from both retail and institutional client bases. RTX token prices should follow the pattern of initial Ethereum price growth during its period of rapid expansion. Remittix Holds the Real Key to Growth Despite Ethereum’s solid foundations supported by technology infrastructure and large investor presence there is still a chance new market entrants will seize a significant portion of investors' attention more quickly than Ethereum can achieve its potential $5,000 price target. Remittix(RTX) aims to transform the vast untapped remittance industry by focusing on a market that needs transformation. The main distinction between Remittix and Ethereum exists in its total dedication to address real-life problems rather than resolving consensus models or Layer-2 separation issues. Those who want to capitalize on upcoming crypto developments should consider investing in Remittixinstead of traditional Ethereum because the company represents exciting changes in blockchain technology.

TRX, which has recovered about 10% from its weekend low of $0.22; is still struggling with the $0.25 resistance level, last transferring at $0.232. Although during October prices rose but technical indicators suggest only weak buying as the On-Balance Volume (OBV) has not confirmed the recent price rise. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s almost-blank performance adds to the uncertainty, which could lead TRX to sink into a downward spiral. Investors are seeking alternatives as uncertainty surrounds the markets, and the decentralized lending ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been attracting significant interest, a sub-$0.05 token boasting presale momentum and a structured growth model. TRX’s Technical Ceiling Enhanced The inability of TRX to break through $0.25 is the result of two rejections at this psychological level. For weeks, the token has been stuck in an oscillation between $0.22 and $0.2745, where $0.248 is an obstinate point of resistance in the middle. Not even a swift 10% recovery on March 19th was enough to breach this ceiling, a sign that bullish conviction was waning. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains close to 50, indicating indecision, while liquidation heatmaps suggest $0.25 is a particularly high-risk area. A push toward this level TD maybe trigger the automated sell-off, bringing TRX back into its lower range. It risks being kicked out of the crypto elite if it fails to deliver a decisive breakout, analysts caution. Whales Shift Towards Presale Investments With TRX still stagnating, investors are diversifying into emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now in Phase 3 of its presale. Current token price of $0.02, growing to $4.5 million raised with over 6,400 holders and a massive +60% of Phase 3 tokens already claimed. Stage two will raise the price to $0.025 — a 25 percent increase — giving existing buyers an instant paper gain of 200 percent when it launches at $0.06. In addition to outlining their projections, analysts have predicted that with its revenue-sharing model and token buybacks, MUTM could be worth $3.50 or higher by late 2025. This potential 17,400% return stands in stark contrast to TRX’s stagnant outlook, which explains the accelerating capital shift. The Strategic Framework of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance presents a self-reinforcing ecosystem. Its platform allows for decentralized lending, where users can deposit assets (such as ETH or stablecoins) in return for interest-yielding mtTokens. Some protocol fees go to automatic MUTM buybacks redistributing tokens to long-term stakers. This method minimizes the sell pressure while maintaining demand, creating a cycle of scarcity and appreciation. Moreover, the team is in the final stages of a smart contract audit with CertiK, a landmark step anticipated to enhance investor confidence. Results will be revealed through social channels, further aligning with Mutuum’s ethos around transparency. Timing the Presale Window The rapid sell-out in Phase 3 indicates urgency, with the $0.02 entry point evaporating with the tokens. By gaining early participation, investors can not only secure better rates but also prepare for the imminent launch, which will help pump the project’s visibility with listing exchanges. The project’s tokenomics — capped supply and buyback-driven scarcity — implies post-launch supply squeeze, a catalyst for rapid price discovery. For example, a $500 investment today could become $17,500 in junction price ($3.50) a potential if MUTM hits $3.50 — Something some compare to early adopters of Eth.

Its presale model and clear metrics such as the CertiK audit reduce speculative risk compared to memes and aged stalwarts. As to whales look for alternatives that can offer stability and exponential upside, MUTM´s sub-$0.05 valuation sets it up as the ideal entry point. Agility is the key to survival in the tireless evolution of the crypto market. TRX holders looking for diminishing returns now have a choice: stay in those for which returns are far from certain in 2025, or migrate to where this decentralized finance will be in 2025. While Mutuum Finance’s presale continues to be open to investors, the dwindling of Phase 3 suggests hitting the brakes on access to the lowest pricing in the tranches.

As look toward 2025, three meme coins— Arctic Pablo Coin , Dogwifhat, and Ponke—are generating significant buzz. Each offers distinct narratives and potential for investors seeking the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: Bridging Myth and Reality – One of the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025 Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin presale ; it’s an adventurous journey inviting investors to explore the world’s hidden mysteries. As one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025, Arctic Pablo stands out with its unique blend of storytelling, financial potential, and an ever-growing community. At the heart of this project is the intrepid explorer Arctic Pablo, who embarks on expeditions to uncover mystical $APC coins. These shimmering tokens symbolize more than just currency; they represent a gateway to prosperity and potential, infused with the magic of forgotten lands. The presale structure of Arctic Pablo Coin is uniquely designed around Pablo’s travels. Instead of traditional stages, each presale phase is tied to a specific location, with the current being Nippy Nook, the 15th location. As of now, the price stands at $0.000079, with a final presale price set at $0.0008 and a launch price of $0.008. This structure not only adds an element of storytelling but also creates a sense of anticipation and excitement among investors. If you’re lucky enough to join now, you could be looking at a return on investment (ROI) of 10,027.85% once the coin hits the listing price of $0.008—just one of the reasons why it’s considered among the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Investing in Arctic Pablo offers significant potential returns. For instance, a $500 investment would yield approximately 6,328,430.00 APC tokens. Upon reaching the listing price of $0.008, this investment could balloon to $50,627.44 showcasing an impressive return on investment. With such high-profit potential, it’s no surprise that APC is gaining attention as one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. A deflationary mechanism is also in place, where unsold tokens are burned at the end of each week during the presale. This approach reduces the total supply, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens and fostering a deflationary environment. Arctic Pablo has strategically chosen the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for its robust platform, ensuring efficient and secure transactions. The project’s tokenomics are well-structured, with a total maximum supply of 221,200,000,000 APC tokens, allocated across presale, staking, ecosystem development, community rewards, and the team. In essence, Arctic Pablo combines an engaging narrative with solid financial incentives, making it a compelling choice for those seeking the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Dogwifhat: The Viral Sensation in the Solana Ecosystem Dogwifhat (WIF) has become one of the most talked-about meme coins in the Solana ecosystem, riding the wave of hype and community-driven momentum. With a market cap exceeding $500 million and a 24-hour trading volume surpassing $248 million, WIF continues to capture the attention of traders and meme coin enthusiasts alike. As the crypto market sees renewed interest in meme coins, Dogwifhat’s impressive rally and cult-like following make it a standout contender. With its viral appeal and growing liquidity, many investors are eyeing WIF as a potential high-reward play in the ever-evolving meme coin landscape. The success of Dogwifhat can be attributed to its strong community engagement and viral marketing strategies. Leveraging social media platforms, the project has created a buzz that resonates with Gen Z and Millennials, particularly in Australasia. Memes, challenges, and interactive content have fueled its popularity, making it more than just a cryptocurrency but a cultural phenomenon. Ponke: The Underdog with Growing Momentum Ponke (PONKE) is a rapidly emerging meme coin on the Solana blockchain, boasting a market cap of $56.5 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $10.68 million. With a total and max supply of 555.55 million tokens, Ponke has demonstrated impressive volatility, surging over 4,411% from its all-time low of $0.002254. Despite an 87.9% decline from its all-time high of $0.8409, the coin maintains strong momentum, backed by an active community and viral social media presence. The project thrives on user engagement, offering features like the “helmet” utility for its holders and leveraging influencer-driven hype. With increasing liquidity and exchange listings, Ponke continues to position itself as a top contender in the meme coin space, drawing comparisons to major players like PEPE and DOGE. Ponke’s appeal lies in its community-centric approach. The project has cultivated a loyal following by engaging users through interactive campaigns, meme contests, and collaborations with influencers. This strategy has not only increased its visibility but also fostered a sense of ownership and participation among holders.

Right now, it’s at Nippy Nook, the 15th location, with a presale price of $0.000079. The price increases every week, and unsold tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply. Over $1.96 million has already been raised, and the listing price is set at $0.008, offering massive upside potential. 3. Is Dogwifhat (WIF) still a good investment in 2025?

After the presale, any remaining unsold tokens will also be burned, making the tokenomics even stronger for long-term holders. The post Low Price, High Gains!

The start of 2025 has been troubling, particularly in Europe, where Tesla saw a 45% drop in new registrations in January compared to the same period in 2024, with further declines in February. While the sales rose by 21% in the UK and Australia, shipments of Chinese-made cars in China fell by more than 49%. In March, a Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, Joseph Spak, published a research note predicting a decrease of 5% in Tesla’s sales around the world. Despite the 10% growth expectations, Spak’s forecast triggered a negative reaction in the stock market, causing Tesla’s share price to drop. There can be many other reasons for the fall in Tesla sales. People working with Tesla already expected this drop as the company headed toward the launch of the new Model Y with customers waiting for the latest version. However, research by Morning Consult Intelligence, a brand monitoring firm, says that Musk’s actions have harmed Tesla significantly in Europe and Canada. It also acknowledges the Chinese market remains crucial for Tesla’s success despite the backlash elsewhere. In reality, the recent decline only wiped out a huge rally Tesla experienced right after the election, which nearly doubled its market valuation. In the U.S., the situation seems a bit more complicated. Sure, a lot of consumers seem to be on board with DOGE cuts in government spending. But there’s a catch, “Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.” Tesla’s problems go way beyond how the public views Musk. Prof. Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University’s Centre for Automotive Industry Research told BBC “We’ve not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.” The competition is coming from all directions. Traditional carmakers have been pouring money into electric vehicles, with companies like Kia and Hyundai building a strong reputation for reliable, high-quality EVs. Meanwhile, China is making serious moves. Brands like BYD are expanding rapidly by offering well-performing cars at affordable prices. And then you have higher-end players like Xpeng and Nio, which are all about luxury and advanced tech. Judging from Musk’s comments during Tesla’s earnings calls, he seems much more focused on the robotaxi vision than anything else. Back in January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service up and running in Texas by June. But skeptics were quick to respond, pointing out that Musk has been making these kinds of promises for years. In 2019, he said that within a year, there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of working as robotaxis. Yet Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” package still requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and stay alert. “Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,” says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy. Tesla needs solid leadership, but Musk’s hands are clearly full. Apart from running Tesla, Musk is also deeply involved in his social media platform X, artificial intelligence firm xAI, and SpaceX, which has had a couple of setbacks with its massive Starship rocket recently. When Fox Business asked him how he was managing all these responsibilities, Musk admitted it was “with great difficulty.” “It’s hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,” says Prof. Wells. “If he’s making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.” Despite all this, Musk’s position at Tesla seems untouchable. He’s the company’s largest shareholder, owning about 13% of the stock, which is worth over $95 billion. That’s nearly the same amount held by investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock combined. Other financial players like State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley also have smaller stakes. Sure, Tesla’s recent drop in share price probably wasn’t fun for those investors. But if you look at the big picture, the stock is still about 30% higher than it was a year ago. In reality, the recent decline only wiped out a huge rally Tesla experienced right after the election, which nearly doubled its market valuation. Musk should hand over Tesla to new leadership. Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings. That’s way higher than other car companies like Ford, General Motors, or Toyota. And the reason? Shareholders are still banking on Tesla’s technological breakthroughs and explosive growth. For now, none of the big investors are calling for major changes. But Ross Gerber, a longtime shareholder who’s turned into one of Musk’s most outspoken critics, recently said Musk should step down. Analysts tend to agree that a leadership change could be beneficial. “A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,” says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research. “It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.” Prof. Wells adds, “I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalize the business. It needs a significant change of direction now.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

For the first time, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are officially recognized in global economic reports. However, this sparked a wave of discussion in the crypto community where many claimed that the IMF had referred to Bitcoin as “digital gold.”This quickly caught the attention of many in the space, fueling debates and speculation across social media. However, Dennis Porter, a well-known voice in the space, quickly questioned this interpretation, asking, “Can anyone point to exactly where the IMF says Bitcoin is ‘digital gold’?” Dennis Clarifies The Confusion After diving into the IMF’s statement , Dennis clarified the source of the confusion. The IMF actually referred to Bitcoin as a “new digital asset designed to be used as a means of payment or act as a store of value.” Ok I’ve tracked down why people are claiming the IMF said Bitcoin is digital gold. “new digital assets designed to be used as a means of payment or act as a store of value.” This is a massive stretch to jump to: “IMF says bitcoin is digital gold”. The key phrase is… https://t.co/2bWMbIdRgK pic.twitter.com/wEm7ht62CZ — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) March 23, 2025 He remarked that the phrase “designed to be” is crucial here and it doesn’t necessarily mean that the IMF is officially endorsing Bitcoin as “digital gold” or guaranteeing its stability or value like gold. It’s more about recognizing Bitcoin’s potential, not confirming it as a proven asset. The “store of value” idea for Bitcoin is debated due to its volatility. Unlike gold, which has a long history of stability, Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate significantly. IMF Provides Guidelines on Tracking Digital Assets The IMF’s latest update to the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7) now includes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) in its global economic framework. This is the first time the IMF has provided clear guidelines on how digital assets should be tracked in global financial stats, marking a big step for crypto in the financial world. Cryptos like Bitcoin are classified as non-productive capital assets, while stablecoins are treated as financial instruments. The update also changes how cross-border crypto transactions, staking, and mining are tracked, with mining and staking now recorded as services in a country’s computer services exports/imports. This update is a big step in officially recognizing digital assets as part of the global economy, helping to track and regulate them better in the future.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 01:42:36

One of the tokens currently drawing interest from both early-stage investors and analysts is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). While still in its presale phase, the protocol has already gained traction—not just for its fundraising numbers but for the potential upside that experts say could carry it all the way to the $1 mark. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that emphasizes non-custodial control and real on-chain functionality. The idea is simple: users deposit their crypto assets into liquidity pools, earning passive income while borrowers can access those funds by providing overcollateralized assets. All of this happens through smart contracts, with no need for intermediaries, and complete transparency at every step. What separates Mutuum from many early-stage tokens is the level of focus on functionality. The platform is set up to allow both passive earners and borrowers to engage in DeFi in a way that doesn’t compromise ownership. Lenders receive mtTokens in return for their deposits, which not only represent their share in the pool but also increase in value over time as interest accrues. These mtTokens are ERC20-compliant and can be transferred, traded, or used in other DeFi applications—offering flexibility for users who want more than just a locked position. Another key feature is the upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted directly through the Mutuum lending protocol, allowing users to access liquidity without selling their original assets. It adds another layer of utility while reinforcing demand for the platform itself. Since interest from these stablecoin loans feeds directly into the protocol’s treasury, it also supports long-term stability and value growth for the ecosystem. So why are experts increasingly bullish on MUTM’s price potential? A few reasons stand out. First, the presale momentum has been impressive—Mutuum has already raised over $4.5 million, and more than 6,300 holders have joined the project during its early stages. Currently, in Phase 3, the token is priced at $0.02 and will launch at $0.06. That alone offers early investors a 3x return out of the gate. But more than that, the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform around the time the token goes live. This is critical because it means the token’s utility won’t be based on future promises—it will be tied to an active product from day one. That alignment between launch and functionality is a major reason why many in the crypto space believe MUTM isn’t just another presale token—it’s a DeFi protocol with room to scale. Shortly after its launch, analysts expect the token to trade between $0.21 and $0.28, already showing strong price movement. But in the weeks that follow, projections go even further. Experts suggest that MUTM will reach $1 as the platform gains more traction and user adoption increases. For those buying in at the current $0.02 price, this would represent a 50x return—a rare opportunity in today’s more competitive and cautious market. The presale is expected to sell out quickly, especially given how fast earlier phases have progressed. With strong early adoption, clear communication from the team, and real utility backing the token, the demand isn’t surprising. It’s not just hype that’s driving attention—it’s the structure, the timing, and the execution. As more eyes turn to the DeFi space in search of projects that combine usability with growth, Mutuum Finance is making its case. With key milestones approaching and a working product on the horizon, the $1 prediction doesn’t feel out of reach—it feels like a matter of time.

For BDAG, March brings several powerful shifts that strengthen its long-term future. Beta Testnet Arrives in March The beta testnet goes live this month, offering the first full test of BlockDAG’s parallel chain setup. Compared to slower platforms like Ethereum, BDAG’s design handles high traffic without delays. Backed by SpaceDev This partnership is more than a tech move. SpaceDev will support BDAG with advanced upgrades, aiming to improve system strength and user adoption. HackerEarth Hackathon Launched BlockDAG aims to grow a large developer base. Through major hackathons, it is bringing in global Web3 talent to create useful apps that will raise BDAG’s demand. Third Keynote Update After the success of the last two, the upcoming Keynote 3 is expected to unveil new roadmap plans. Previous keynotes have always sparked fresh interest—and this one could have a greater effect. Early BDAG Buyers Have Strong Return Potential Let’s look at the expected returns with clear numbers. BDAG sells for $0.0248 in batch 27. Some experts believe BDAG could reach $1 after it goes live—a 40x gain. Putting in $1,000 today would get roughly 40,000 BDAG. If BDAG reaches $1, that turns into $40,000. This reminds many of Solana, which started near $0.22 and jumped above $250. BDAG may follow a similar track but with quicker growth signals. Key Factors That May Push BDAG to $1 Over 10 CEX Listings—Access to major exchanges means more people can trade, pushing demand up. Limited Supply Structure—BDAG’s setup limits supply, so higher demand could drive price increases. Growing Crowd Interest—Both large-scale and casual buyers are getting involved, and broader attention could lift prices quickly. Final Words! Big updates this month give BDAG an edge, but the highest returns are likely for those who act early. The beta testnet, strong technical support, and near-future listings all signal major changes ahead. Waiting might mean paying 5x, 10x, or even 20x more per coin. For those watching closely, this could be the time BDAG breaks through—like Solana or Avalanche once did.

Qubetics Presale is Your Next Big Chance—Get in on the Top Altcoin Presale of 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bitcoin-cashs-boom-qubetics-presale-is-your-next-big-chance-get-in-on-the-top-altcoin-presale-of-2025/,"The cryptocurrency market has been an absolute rollercoaster lately. From Bitcoin hitting new highs to altcoins skyrocketing with innovative tech, it’s been a non-stop adventure. But here’s the kicker: not everyone caught the early train to profit-town. Whether it was too much uncertainty or simply missing the boat, opportunities have been missed, and some are left scrambling. If you’re feeling like you missed your shot at a big payday with some altcoins, you’re not alone. The truth is, many people passed on Bitcoin Cash, and now it’s too late to scoop up a massive return on that one. But don’t sweat it – there’s a new kid on the block. Qubetics ($TICS) is currently going through an exciting presale phase, and the buzz surrounding this project is something you don’t want to sleep on. Its presale is already in its 27th stage, and the response has been insane. Over 502 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $15.3 million with 23,500+ holders jumping on board. With analysts predicting massive returns after the presale, Qubetics might just be the chance to turn missed opportunities into winning ones. So, let’s dive in and take a look at why Qubetics is the altcoin presale that’s too good to ignore. Bitcoin Cash Coin: A Missed Opportunity Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had its time to shine. Back in 2017, it was one of the top contenders to become the go-to digital currency for everyday transactions. Bitcoin Cash split from Bitcoin due to disagreements over scaling solutions, and its goal was clear: make Bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. For a while, it seemed like BCH could potentially overtake Bitcoin itself, with many crypto enthusiasts touting it as the future of digital cash. However, as time passed, it became clear that Bitcoin Cash couldn’t quite live up to the hype. Its use case, while solid, didn’t evolve fast enough. Competing technologies like Ethereum and newer platforms started to steal the spotlight with their smart contract capabilities and scalability solutions. The market began to see Bitcoin Cash as a “nostalgic” crypto option, more of a historical token than a futuristic one. While BCH still has its place in the market, the window for massive gains is largely closed. It’s a missed opportunity for those who couldn’t jump on board when it was hot. In the crypto space, timing is everything. A few years ago, Bitcoin Cash had the potential for massive returns, but now, for the average crypto enthusiast, it’s like trying to catch lightning in a bottle. There are new projects on the horizon, and many are more innovative, adaptable, and prepared for the future of crypto than BCH ever was. And here’s where Qubetics comes in: it’s offering something Bitcoin Cash never could – real-world applications and huge ROI potential that’s far from tapped out. Qubetics: Still Available and Ready for Action You’ve probably heard whispers about Qubetics ($TICS), and now it’s time to get the lowdown. Right now, this altcoin is in the 27th stage of its presale, and analysts are hyping it up for good reason. As of now, $TICS is priced at $0.1300 per token. The presale is raking in serious money, with over $15.3 million raised and more than 23,500 holders jumping on board. But here’s the thing: there’s still time to get in early, and the price is expected to explode. The real kicker with Qubetics is the sheer promise it holds. Unlike many altcoins that are all talk and no action, Qubetics is set to revolutionize the world of Real World Asset Tokenization (RWAT). In simple terms, Qubetics is aiming to take real-world assets – like real estate, commodities, and even artwork – and tokenize them on the blockchain. This means individuals and businesses can buy, sell, and trade ownership in things like properties and valuable assets with the transparency and security of blockchain technology. So, what does this mean for everyday folks? Let’s break it down. Imagine you’re a small business owner looking to raise capital but don’t want to deal with the headaches of traditional financing methods. With Qubetics, you could tokenize your business’s assets, making it easier to access funding while providing more security and potential for future growth. Or think about the average person who wants to own a piece of luxury real estate but doesn’t have the full cash flow to buy a property outright. Qubetics lets them purchase fractional ownership in that property through tokenization. No more waiting for a miracle investment opportunity – Qubetics offers an affordable, secure, and efficient way to make significant investments possible for everyone. Now, consider the massive return potential of $TICS. Analysts predict that after the presale, the token could skyrocket to $1, giving early adopters a 669% ROI. But that’s not all – experts are predicting it could hit $5 post-presale, offering a jaw-dropping 3745% ROI. And the best part? Once the mainnet launches, the $TICS token could go as high as $15, offering a mind-blowing 11,436% return. The presale is moving fast, so if you’re still sitting on the sidelines, it’s time to get serious about your crypto future. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy in 2025: Qubetics is the One So, let’s face it – there are a ton of cryptos out there, and it can be tough to pick the right one to buy in 2025. From DeFi projects to meme coins, there’s no shortage of choices. But here’s the thing: not all of them have staying power. Many coins will fizzle out or fail to deliver on their promises. When it comes to identifying which altcoin presale is the real deal, it’s all about finding a project with a solid use case, scalability, and massive upside potential. That’s where Qubetics checks all the boxes. Think about it: the crypto space has seen some solid growth, but it’s still stuck in a lot of legacy thinking. Traditional investment options, like real estate, haven’t evolved to the same degree. The world is shifting toward tokenization, and Qubetics is right at the forefront of that shift. What makes this project stand out from others in the crypto presale space is its potential to solve real-world problems. Tokenizing assets like real estate and luxury goods isn’t just an idea; it’s a tangible solution that’s going to change the way people think about ownership and investment. Qubetics isn’t just some moonshot – it’s a project that addresses actual pain points in the global economy. People have been craving solutions to fractional ownership, transparency, and liquidity in the asset space, and Qubetics is answering that call. And when it comes to the presale, there’s still time to grab $TICS at a low price before it potentially shoots up after the mainnet launch. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Qubetics Presale If you’ve been sleeping on the idea of getting involved in a top altcoin presale , Qubetics ($TICS) is the one to wake up to. With its revolutionary approach to Real World Asset Tokenization, it’s positioning itself to be a major player in 2025 and beyond. The presale is in full swing, with over $15 million raised, and the $TICS token price is expected to soar once the presale ends. Analysts predict massive returns, and with real-world use cases that solve actual problems, there’s no reason to sit this one out. Now’s the time to act. Qubetics is poised for a breakout, and missing out on this presale could mean missing a huge opportunity. So, jump in while the price is still low, and don’t let another top altcoin presale slip through your fingers.

The scam involved the fraudsters contacting victims and earning trust before directing them to websites masquerading as legitimate crypto investment platforms, Virginia’s Eastern District US Attorney’s Office said in a March 21 statement. Once victims made a deposit, the funds were funneled through over 75 bank accounts under the names of shell companies, then sent abroad “deceptively characterized” as domestic wires, despite being transferred to a bank outside the US. Source: US Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of Virginia “The sites falsely represented to the victims that their investments were making sizeable gains,” Virginia’s US Attorney’s Office added in its statement. “When victims would attempt to make withdrawals, the perpetrators would coerce the victims to send even more money using tactics such as claiming the victims owed taxes on their purported profits.” The United States Secret Service seized some of the stolen funds from a foreign bank in 2023 and began the civil forfeiture action by filing a claim in a US District Court. However, the bank also made a claim against the cash, and the US authorities eventually reached a settlement agreement for $7 million of the seized funds. Victims of the scam have been urged to contact the Secret Service to petition to recover their losses.

Gordon added that a cut could sway people to put their savings into shares of local companies, which could then spark other firms to go public in the UK and help the economy. In comparison, she called crypto “a non-productive asset” that “doesn’t feed back into the economy.” “Equities provide growth capital to companies that employ people, innovate and pay corporation tax. That is a social contract. We shouldn’t be afraid of advocating for that.” The country’s Financial Conduct Authority said in November that crypto ownership rose to 12% of adults, equivalent to around 7 million people. A majority of crypto owners, 36%, were under the age of 55 years old. Gordon said that many had “shifted to saving rather than investing,” which she claimed “is not going to fund a viable retirement.” A 2022 FCA survey found that 70% of adults had a savings account, while 38% either directly held shares or held them through an account allowing nearly 20,000 British pounds ($26,000) of tax-free savings a year — around three in four 18-24 years olds held no investments. A quarter of 18-25 year olds and a third of 25-44 year olds held any investment in 2022. Source: FCA But in a follow-up survey, the regulator reported that in the 12 months to January 2024, the cost of living crisis had seen 44% of all adults either stop or reduce saving or investing, while nearly a quarter used savings or sold their investments to cover day-to-day costs. Gordon is a member of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce, a group of industry executives aiming to revive the local market, which Cavendish would benefit from as it advises companies on how to navigate possible public offerings. Related: Will new US SEC rules bring crypto companies onshore? Consulting giant EY reported in January that the London stock market had one of its “quietest years on record,” with just 18 companies listing last year, down from 23 in 2023. At the same time, EY said 88 companies delisted or transferred from the exchange, with many saying they moved due to “declining liquidity and lower valuations compared to other markets” such as the US. However, Gordon claimed the UK is a “safe haven” compared to markets such as the US, which has lost trillions of dollars in its stock markets due to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and fears of a recession. Crypto markets have also slumped alongside US equities, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) trading down 11% over the past 30 days and struggling to maintain support above $85,000 since early March. In the past 24 hours, at least, Bitcoin is up 2%, trading around $85,640.

In 2022, the Treasury blacklisted Tornado Cash for its role in laundering $455 million stolen by the Lazarus hacking group. The Move Sparks Criticism From Grewal But the move has sparked strong backlash. In a latest X post, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, has publicly criticized the U.S. Treasury for its handling of Tornado Cash’s delisting. He argues that the Treasury is wrongly trying to avoid a final court decision. Grewal is criticizing the U.S. Treasury for continuing legal actions against Tornado Cash, even after it was removed from the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. The Treasury now claims that a final court decision is unnecessary, but Grewal argues that this is against legal procedures. Relying on that decision, the Fifth Circuit rejected an agency’s argument that its withdrawal of a determination “unilaterally and avoid judicial review” did not moot the case, because the agency could decide to revisit the decision and issue a similar determination against the… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 23, 2025 He shared that this is only valid if the defendant can prove the issue won’t happen again. He also mentioned past cases where sanctions were lifted but the case stayed open, allowing them to be reimposed later. “Here, Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from the SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again. That’s not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,” noted Grewal. Grewal’s criticism comes during a long legal battle where Tornado Cash users challenged the Treasury’s decision to add the mixer to the SDN list. The users argued that the smart contract didn’t qualify as property under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because it’s non-erasable. Although the court sided with the users, clarifying the status of the Tornado’s smart contract, despite this, Grewal criticized the Treasury for not fully following the court’s ruling. Coinbase, Ethereum Foundation Back Tornado Cash Tornado Cash has been supported by groups like Coinbase and the Ethereum Foundation, which are backing lead developer Alexey Pertsev’s defense. The legal battle has been intense, with supporters claiming the Treasury’s actions were unfair and lacked clear legal grounds. Lifting the sanctions against Tornado Cash is an important step in the ongoing debate over how crypto mixers should be regulated. The Treasury lifted them after reviewing legal issues but still expressed concern over North Korea’s use of digital assets for hacking and money laundering.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|ETH|ASIA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 02:53:54

The Federal Reserve signaled in its March 18-19 meeting that it would also “look past short-term inflationary pressures, laying the groundwork for potential future easing,” Thielen added. “Powell’s mildly dovish tone suggests that the Fed's put remains intact, providing further support for a recovery in stock prices.” 10x Research’s Bitcoin reversal indicators have turned bullish as a result, with Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) 21-day moving average now at $85,200, Thielen noted. Bitcoin’s bottoming formations over the last two years. Source: 10x Research He said these weekly reversal indicators have pulled back to levels where past bull markets have resumed, such as in September 2023 — spurred on by the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund narrative — and August 2024 as the US election neared. “In short, the technical backdrop has now reset to a point where a renewed uptrend could plausibly unfold.” Thielen also noted that several altcoins are already breaking out of their downtrend channels and trading at more “attractive levels.” Bitcoin is currently trading at $85,720, up 2.1% over the last 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. Meanwhile, Ether ( ETH ), Tron ( TRX ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ) have rebounded 4.3%, 6.4% and 8.9% respectively over the last week. The crypto research analyst, however, expects to see “significant resistance” at the $90,000 mark for Bitcoin, should it reach that level. Despite the more positive outlook, “no clear catalyst exists for an immediate parabolic rally” is in sight, Thielen said. Related: Bitcoin ‘in position’ for first key RSI breakout in 6 months at $85K He initially said Bitcoin wouldn’t drop below $73,000 — thereby avoiding a “deep bear market” — because the largest sum bracket of Bitcoin holders (wallets with 100-1000 Bitcoin) are likely family offices and wealth managers who are invested in Bitcoin for the long term. He also noted that the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs returned inflows for the first time last week since the last week of January. “We expect Bitcoin ETF selling from arbitrage-focused investors to wind down, as the arbitrage opportunities have primarily been closed for weeks,” Thielen added.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC , Nabiullina told journalists at a press conference that she wants to “ban settlements made in cryptocurrencies between residents” outside the so-called experimental legal regime (ELR). Russian Crypto Ban – Still on the Table? The ELR, policed by the Central Bank, is a regulatory sandbox that the bank uses to allow certain Russian firms to buy and sell goods, using crypto as a payment tool. The Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina speaking to journalists on March 21, 2025. (Source: Bank of Russia/Screenshot) The bank also appears to want to use the ELR as a mechanism for Russian crypto miners to sell their coins to global buyers. In recent days, the bank has suggested that it is prepared to allow “qualified investors” to trade crypto within the confines of the sandbox . But Nabiullina’s recent comments suggest she has lost none of her famous crypto-skepticism . The long-serving Governor has previously called for total bans on crypto exchanges and token trading . The bank even drafted a bill calling for a total ban on all forms of crypto trading and ownership, as well as crypto mining. Sanctions regimes have forced her to change her stand, however. With Russian companies and banks forced out of the SWIFT messaging network and dollar-denominated trade, many companies now use tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to trade with overseas partners.

These echo her previous calls to keep “private cryptocurrencies” out “of the Russian economy.” The Russian Central Bank. (Source: Bank of Russia/Screenshot) ‘Criminal Liability’ Nabiullina told journalists that Moscow should introduce criminal “liability” for anyone caught “violating the ban.” “We maintain our old position that cryptocurrencies should not be allowed as a means of payment. So we propose introducing a ban on settlements in cryptocurrencies between residents [of Russia] outside the ELR. We don’t only propose introducing a ban, but also establishing liability for violating the ban.” Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina Nabiullina claimed, however, that “it was time to take a step forward” in “relations with cryptocurrencies.” She said that Moscow must “build a regulatory environment” that would give “particularly qualified” investors the right to “invest in cryptocurrencies on the Russian market.” In recent days, some have suggested that the ELR could team up with the Moscow Exchange to launch crypto trading products for these “particularly qualified” investors.

The Russian state-run media agency TASS reported that the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Alexander Shokhin, wants the government to “analyze the prospects for using cryptocurrencies” after US President Donald Trump’s decision to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve . Shokhin said: “It seems that it has been agreed [in Moscow] that crypto can be used in cross-border settlements. After Trump said that the US will now become the crypto capital of the world and started accumulating crypto reserves – at least in Ethereum and Bitcoin – we also need to look at this somehow.” Alexander Shokhin, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. (Source: Moscow Financial Forum/YouTube/Screenshot) However, these comments will likely fall on deaf ears at the Central Bank. Nabiullina has previously stated that she “does not see any circumstances under which” cryptoassets “could end up in the reserves of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.” The Ministry of Finance, however, has expressed a more cautiously optimistic stance on the matter .

By March 14, 2025, XRP is being exchanged at around $2.31. Despite the fact that experts are very positive about the prospects of its future, the highest price scale forecast varies from $3.40 to $15, and the situation in which as impressive a rally as that of 2017 would take place again seems very far away. .

According to a Mar. 23 press release , Titan operates as a layer above standard DEX aggregators like Jupiter ( JUP ) and DFlow. To ensure traders receive the best price with no fees, it aggregates quotes from all available DEX aggregators rather than just sourcing liquidity from different DEXs. In addition to aggregation , Titan introduces Talos, a proprietary routing algorithm that, according to the press release, outperforms competitors 80% of the time. Compared to current Solana ( SOL ) solutions, Talos analyzes more liquidity sources and optimizes routing at a granular level to enhance trade execution. Quote slippage caused by execution delays is a major problem with on-chain swaps. Because Solana transactions take around 10 seconds (25 blocks) to complete, the price may fluctuate before the trade is executed. Titan wants to address this issue by continuously updating quotes in real-time to provide traders with the most accurate pricing. “Titan’s aim is to provide DeFi traders with the best possible prices while abstracting away the complexity involved. Today, crypto trading lags behind traditional markets in its order placement design. It’s time for us to upgrade our infrastructure and close this gap, and that’s what Titan is designed to do.” — Chris Chung, CEO and co-founder of Titan You might also like: Solana ETF set to debut in the U.S Titan previously raised $3.5 million in a September 2024 pre-seed round, backed by Round13 Digital Asset Fund and Beluga Labs. Solana is seeing record adoption alongside Titan’s launch. According to Ali Charts Mar. 22 post on X, the network now has over 11 million wallets holding SOL. Solana continues to lead in DEX trading volume , which hit a record $258 billion in January before cooling off to $105 billion in February amid a broader market downturn. Impressively, the stablecoin market cap on the network has grown to $12.36 billion, a three times increase from December 2024, according to DefiLlama data . Despite this growth, SOL’s price has seen volatility. It peaked at $298.31 in January before dipping to $118 on Mar. 11. The price has rebounded to $133 as of press time. With rising institutional interest, analysts speculate SOL could push toward the $300 mark in the coming months.

33767162,[object Object],1742787013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,$250-Million Bitcoin Whale Awakens After 8 Years – Massive Move Stirs Market,https://bitcoinist.com/250-million-bitcoin-whale-awakens-after-8-years-massive-move-stirs-market/,"Bitcoin continues to trade below key resistance levels as fears of a looming bear market grow across the crypto space. Investors are increasingly adopting a risk-off approach, driven by rising macroeconomic uncertainty and intensifying global trade war tensions. As equities and crypto markets face synchronized selling pressure, confidence is weakening among retail and institutional participants. Adding fuel to market speculation, Arkham Intelligence reported that a dormant Bitcoin whale—who has held BTC since late 2016—moved over $250 million worth of Bitcoin Friday night. This sudden transfer has sparked concerns about potential selling pressure, as large movements from long-term holders often precede market volatility. While on-chain analysts have yet to confirm whether the funds were sent to an exchange, the timing of the move amid heightened fear only adds to investor anxiety. The broader sentiment in the market is shifting, with many now questioning whether Bitcoin’s bull cycle has ended. Bulls must defend current demand zones and reclaim critical resistance to revive momentum. Until then, traders are bracing for continued sideways action—or worse, a further drop. With volatility likely to remain elevated, Bitcoin’s next move will be crucial in shaping sentiment heading into the second quarter of 2024. Bitcoin Sentiment Weakens As Whale Movement Sparks Market Uncertainty Bitcoin is struggling to convince analysts and investors that the bull market will continue in 2025. After hitting an all-time high earlier this year, BTC has lost significant momentum, and the current price action reflects growing doubts about the sustainability of further gains. Many key indicators and broader market sentiment now lean toward the possibility of a bear market taking shape, especially as global economic turmoil and inflation fears continue to shake investor confidence. The uncertainty in the market is not limited to crypto alone. US equities have also experienced a slowdown as fears of a potential recession mount. Investors are adopting a risk-off stance, redirecting capital into safer assets as macroeconomic instability grows. Adding to the unease, Arkham Intelligence revealed that a long-dormant Bitcoin whale just moved over $250 million in BTC. The whale originally accumulated the coins in late 2016, turning a $3 million investment into over $250 million across an eight-year period—holding all the BTC in a single address until now. This sudden move raises questions: is the whale preparing to sell, or simply repositioning? Such significant on-chain activity often precedes market volatility. While this could signal profit-taking before a deeper correction, it may also foreshadow a bullish breakout if the move was part of a strategic transfer. Either way, the market is on edge, watching closely for Bitcoin’s next big decision. BTC Bulls Eye Key Resistance Bitcoin is trading at $84,200 after days of consolidation, struggling to reclaim the 200-day moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), both sitting near the critical $85,000 level. This zone has become a decisive battleground for bulls and bears, with BTC needing to break above it to signal any serious momentum shift. Reclaiming $85K would set the stage for a test of the $88K level, which many analysts view as the last major resistance before a push above $90K. A clean breakout above $88K could mark the beginning of a recovery rally, potentially restoring bullish sentiment across the market. However, the current rejection at these technical levels raises concerns. If bulls fail to push above $90K in the coming sessions, BTC may continue to consolidate in this tight range or even face a deeper correction. Market volatility, macroeconomic uncertainty, and cautious investor sentiment continue to weigh heavily on price action. As the 200-day MA and EMA act as dynamic resistance, the next few days could be pivotal. Bitcoin must reclaim these levels to confirm strength—or risk slipping into a longer phase of weakness and potential downside pressure.

The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made its decisions, and the long-running XRP lawsuit was finally resolved, bringing relief to the community. However, the Pi Network faced some tough challenges. The migration and Know Your Customer (KYC) process are now complete, but many users were unable to claim their tokens. As a result, Pi fell behind the market, leading to doubts about whether now is a good time to buy. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Pi was the worst performer last week, losing more value than the rest. A big blow came when Binance refused to list Pi. They stated that any token not listed on the Binance Smart Chain is not eligible for a vote, disqualifying Pi from consideration. What’s Next For Pi Coin Price? The Pi token dropped below the $1 mark, after hitting an all-time high of $3 following its Open Network launch on February 20. It hit the lows of around $0.70, leaving many investors uncertain about the future. However, it has now bounced back, trading at around $0.96. Despite the downturn, analysts are spotting potential for a rebound and there are signs that a breakout could happen. If the support level holds strong, Pi could push back toward $2. The trading volume saw an initial spike but later declined, showing that sellers are currently in control, weakening the momentum of buyers. Ater a 3% drop, the price is approaching the critical $0.70 support level, and if this breaks, it could lead to further drops, potentially down to $0.50 or $0.10.

While some users are taking profit, others are adding more coins, expecting another price rally. Even with market dips, digital assets have often bounced back. However, only a few manage to recover fully. Picking coins with solid use, high trading volumes, and strong tech backing can help in the long run. Based on market study and performance, five top bullish cryptos to buy now are Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and BlockDAG. These coins show strong signs of growth. Let’s explore what makes each one stand out and how they could offer high returns. BlockDAG: Record-Breaking Presale with Huge ROI Potential By using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure instead of a typical blockchain, BlockDAG (BDAG) handles many transactions at once. This leads to faster and smoother operations. Its structure offers more safety and better scaling compared to others. These features place it among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Its presale is seeing massive support, with over $205 million raised and more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold. Currently, in Batch 27, the coin trades at $0.0248—jumping 2,380% from its $0.001 starting price. The quick sales show growing interest. With more batches selling fast, the $600 million target seems close, making it one of the biggest presales in years. The referral plan gives users 5% cashback in USDT when buying through shared links. With no caps on earnings or time limits, people are using it to earn rewards while getting BDAG coins. This helps keep buying active and adds more support to BDAG’s rise as one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Bitcoin: Key Player with Strong Market Role As the earliest digital currency, Bitcoin still leads with its tight network security and known role as a value holder. Though prices go up and down, its supply cap and name value keep it in demand. News of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve plan could affect future price changes. Bitcoin also plays a role in money transfers and shields from rising costs. Though newer tech options exist, Bitcoin’s strong hold and network trust keep it among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. BNB: Boosting DeFi Access and Trading Reach What began as Binance Coin has grown into a key part of the Binance system. It helps lower trading costs and unlocks special options on the platform. Beyond trading, BNB fuels dApps on Binance Smart Chain, offering quick service and low fees. New meme coins are gaining ground on BNB Chain, adding more use to the network. This boosts BNB’s status as a strong rival to Ethereum and Solana in the DeFi world. Because of its steady demand and wide reach, BNB holds a spot among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Solana: Fast Transactions Speeds Known for quick actions and cheap fees, Solana can handle thousands of steps every second. Its special Proof-of-History method gives it an edge in running smoothly and scaling well. Developers are turning to Solana thanks to its strong support for smart contracts and dApps. Even after network pauses, many still expect growth from Solana. There’s also talk of a spot ETF, which may boost its price. These signs make Solana one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Ethereum: Smart Contracts and Pectra Upgrade With strong use in smart contract building, Ethereum helps run many dApps today. Its shift to Proof-of-Stake in Ethereum 2.0 brings better speed and lower power use. This improves user and developer experience. The platform leads in DeFi and NFT growth, hosting thousands of active projects. While rivals like Solana and BNB grow, Ethereum’s strong base and planned Pectra changes help it keep its place. It stays one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Top Bullish Cryptos to Buy Now— Final Say! News of Bitcoin reserves, Ethereum’s Pectra update, BNB’s growing DeFi use, and Solana’s speed plus ETF hopes keep them among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Still, BlockDAG stands out with its fast-rising presale and broad use of DAG tech. With $205 million already raised and a target of $600 million, it’s setting new records. The DAG setup, high-speed power, and rewarding system help push BDAG ahead. It’s gaining attention from those who seek the top bullish cryptos to buy now for better returns.
