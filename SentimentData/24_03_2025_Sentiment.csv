42227728,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104036,1742763908,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Tron Considering Bitcoin Inspired Halving — Will TRX go Above $0.4 in the Next Bull Phase?,https://zycrypto.com/tron-considering-bitcoin-inspired-halving-will-trx-go-above-0-4-in-the-next-bull-phase/,"Tron founder Justin Sun recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to raise public awareness regarding the digital currency’s proposed block reward halving. He drew parallels with Bitcoin’s much-touted 4-year halving cycle, in which the premier cryptocurrency undergoes a major bull phase followed by a bearish cooldown before starting things all over again in the ensuing couple of years. Sun wants TRX to eventually settle down on a similar halving cycle because it showcases the maturity of the digital asset. He tweeted : “….As the Bitcoin network grew, block rewards gradually decreased. In the early days, higher rewards were necessary for bootstrapping the network. However, as Bitcoin’s price surged, block rewards were lowered, and the halving cycle played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s long-term sustainability—aligning with Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision….” The New TRX Block Reward Halving Proposal On paper, following BTC seems like a straightforward proposal: periodically decrease the block reward halving to mimic the top cryptocurrency, and it can follow the same trajectory. However, in reality, it is easier said than done. Many other digital currencies have tried to come up with a similar model but failed to maintain a strong periodic foothold in the market like Bitcoin. However, Sun is very enthusiastic about the proposal currently being analyzed by the Tron community. The suggestion titled “Reduce TRX block rewards #738” presents several deflationary tactics, like reducing the block reward by 50% to 1.5-2% per year. Currently, it is set at 1%, which is apparently not enough to kickstart a BTC-like halving cycle. However, the Tron community has not provided definitive word on this proposal, but it is expected to be put to a vote soon. Sun tweeted: “Ultimately, this decision rests with the TRX community!” TRX to Rise to $0.4? Here is the TRX/USD graph from the last 4 months: Image Source: TradingView TRX is the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It has been able to cling to this coveted position during the last few months, especially during a time of turmoil in the markets. But, like the rest of the crypto market cap, it has experienced significant losses in dollar terms. It recorded an All-Time High (ATH) of $0.44 at the end of November 2024 but has since lost 50% against the greenback and has struggled to remain above $0.24 for long periods. A $0.4 valuation is very much in the realm of possibility, but a major market rebound or a successful block reward halving will be needed to supercharge the cryptocurrency’s market position. The Future While TRX’s long-term future depends on the larger cryptocurrency market, it can also make its way if it offers the perfect tokenization recipe. The network is resurgent and its growing use case in the sprawling meme coin economy has breathed new life into the digital network.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Tron News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRX|MARKET|TRADING|MINING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-23 21:05:08

Cosmos and Algorand Gain Strength,https://thecoinrise.com/can-qubetics-testnet-launch-secure-its-spot-as-the-best-crypto-presale-to-invest-this-week-cosmos-and-algorand-gain-strength/,"Crypto markets are heating up again, but not all eyes are on the usual suspects this time. With presale stages creating buzz, discerning participants are searching for the best crypto presale to invest this week. Amid the noise, a few projects stand out—not for hype, but for their robust ecosystems, technology, and real-world use cases. Qubetics has emerged as a top contender, gaining momentum with its successful testnet launch. Alongside it, Cosmos and Algorand continue to prove their worth with unique innovations in blockchain interoperability and financial-grade applications. These projects offer compelling reasons to watch closely, especially for those seeking quality beyond the speculative frenzy. Qubetics Testnet Go Live: Setting a New Standard for the Best Crypto Presale to Invest This Week Qubetics takes a giant leap forward by activating its TestNet —a major step from its alpha testnet phase. This launch is not just ceremonial. It provides a secure environment where developers, validators, and community members can engage directly with the platform, testing features without risking financial loss. Performance tuning, enhanced security protocols, and smooth transaction testing pave the way for a robust mainnet rollout. What sets Qubetics apart is its advanced Qubetics Wallet , designed to streamline complex financial operations for businesses, professionals, and individual users. The wallet eliminates reliance on third-party custodians by enabling complete control over digital assets. This user-centric approach enhances security while simplifying DeFi participation, token management, and smart contract execution. Strategic alliances with industry heavyweights such as 1inch , SWFT , and CertiK further boost Qubetics’ credibility. CertiK’s auditing prowess is widely respected, while 1inch and SWFT ensure liquidity and efficient cross-chain transactions. Together, these partnerships reinforce Qubetics’ mission to deliver a secure, reliable, and highly functional ecosystem. Qubetics Presale and ROI Projections With over 502 million $TICS tokens sold to 23,500 holders, the crypto presale has already raised $15.3 million in its 26th presale stage. At $0.1181 per token, Qubetics presents a prime opportunity for early buyers aiming for long-term rewards. Analysts project impressive potential returns: $1 post-presale — 746.05% ROI $5 post-presale — 4,130% ROI $6 post-presale — 4,976% ROI $10 post-presale — 8,360% ROI $15 post-mainnet launch — 12,590% ROI These forecasts, though exciting, come with the usual crypto market risks. Still, such metrics solidify Qubetics as the best crypto presale to invest this week. Cosmos Powers Ahead: Breaking Barriers and Bearish Trends Cosmos (ATOM) has seen a sharp turnaround after enduring a grueling stretch that pushed its price from $10 to $3.62 by March 10. However, with a 22% surge in the last week, ATOM now stands at $4.67—and momentum continues to build. Technical indicators point toward sustained strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) readings are bullish, confirming heightened buying pressure. Social dominance has risen to 0.27%, signaling growing market buzz around Cosmos. A recent breakout from a descending triangle pattern invalidated the bearish outlook. ATOM now trades above the 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a classic sign of trend reversal. Additionally, the Bull Bear Power (BBP) remains in positive territory, affirming bullish control. Cosmos could soon break the $5 resistance if momentum holds, potentially climbing toward $6.21, aligning with the golden ratio Fibonacci level. While risks persist, Cosmos reclaims its spot as a blockchain worthy of attention this week. Algorand’s Strategic Moves: Is It Joining the Best Crypto Presale to Invest This Week Club? Algorand (ALGO), currently trading near $0.2480, is turning heads in 2025 for reasons beyond price action. Algorand’s tech is gaining real-world relevance, especially through its DeRec Alliance partnership with Hedera and Ripple. This collaboration focuses on decentralized asset recovery standards—a critical need in the evolving Web3 landscape. Further strengthening its use case, Algorand plays a key role in Sweden’s central bank CBDC trials, showcasing its technology in large-scale financial applications. These developments underline Algorand’s commitment to providing scalable and secure blockchain solutions, elevating its status among top-performing projects this year. With increasing demand for interoperability and institutional-grade infrastructure, Algorand’s strategic advancements make it a prime watchlist candidate. While not a presale token, ALGO’s steady growth aligns it with those projects drawing strong community and enterprise support. Final Thoughts Choosing the best crypto presale to invest this week requires more than hype-chasing. Projects like Qubetics, Cosmos, and Algorand demonstrate why fundamentals matter, especially in volatile markets. Qubetics stands tall with its testnet success, strategic partnerships, and a presale model offering substantial ROI potential. Its wallet features, real-world business focus, and rigorous testing regime place it at the center of market attention. Cosmos has defied bearish expectations, flashing strong technical signals and renewed social dominance. Algorand’s practical applications in national financial systems and decentralized asset recovery make it a standout for 2025. While crypto remains inherently risky, these three projects show the traits of long-term players. Qubetics, in particular, emerges as the best crypto presale to invest this week, backed by innovation, community momentum, and a clear roadmap.

42228152,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104038,1742764690,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"US Treasury Uses Discretionary Powers to End Sanctions Against Tornado Cash, says “Innovation” Benefits Americans",https://zycrypto.com/us-treasury-uses-discretionary-powers-to-end-sanctions-against-tornado-cash-says-innovation-benefits-americans/,"The U.S. Treasury has ended its sanctions on Tornado Cash , a prominent mixing service, by removing addresses associated with the token, including Ethereum addresses. Under the U.S. Treasury, the department responsible for this decision is the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The list of banned addresses is referred to as the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. However, the Treasury Department maintains sanctions on one of Tornado’s founders, Roman Semenov. In 2022, OFAC blacklisted Tornado Cash allegedly for facilitating money laundering on its platform. Lazarus, a North Korean hacking group, had used the service to anonymize their stolen money, totaling millions of dollars in stolen tokens. Tornado Cash is a mixer service for Ethereum and allows users to anonymize their coins by randomly mixing them with other coins. Tornado users sued the Treasury when the service was blacklisted. Coinbase financially backed the lawsuit. The Treasury made an official announcement about the delisting of the crypto service: “Based on the Administration’s review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by the use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments, we have exercised our discretion to remove the economic sanctions against Tornado Cash as reflected in Treasury’s Monday filing in Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury”. Tornado Cash is a tool that allows users to make their transactions more private. It combines different transactions, making it more difficult for people to track them. Privacy advocates see the service as vital for protecting one’s anonymity and financial security. However, many governments see it as a tool used by hackers to disguise their transactions. In November 2024, a judge from the Fifth Circuit ruled that a piece of automatic software cannot be classified as property and, therefore, cannot be sanctioned by OFAC. Tornado supporters are celebrating the decision by OFAC to drop the blacklisting. They argue that banning Tornado because Lazarus is misusing the service is like banning the internet because Lazarus is using the web to hack crypto wallets. The Treasury, however, further stated that it is still concerned about money laundering, particularly the Lazarus group stealing billions from various crypto wallets. It plans to strike a balance between cutting back on crime and giving people room to make critical innovations. “Digital assets present enormous opportunities,” said Scott Bessent, secretary of the Treasury, “for innovation and value creation for the American people. Securing the digital asset industry from abuse by North Korea and other illicit actors is essential to establishing U.S. leadership and ensuring the American people can benefit from financial innovation and inclusion”. Roman Storm, Tornado Cash co-founder, still faces a criminal trial in July for creating protocols and smart contracts. Storm’s lawyer tried to get the case dropped after the November 2024 ruling. However, Judge Katherine Failla denied the request in February, stating that Storm still defied the sanctions list, regardless of the November ruling. Coinbase helped finance Tornado Cash’s legal defense, claiming the allegations were unreasonable. Brian Armstrong has argued that open source technology benefits citizens and should therefore not be banned.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|ETH|EXCHANGE|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-23 21:18:10

Cathie Wood to give inaugural lecture for El Salvador's AI public education program Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood is kicking off El Salvador's AI education program by giving the inaugural lecture for the public education initiative. In a March 23 X post , El Salvador's Bitcoin Office wrote that the program would leverage industry experts to provide university-level artificial intelligence education to students and professionals. The Bitcoin Office added: ""This is the only national education program bringing in top-tier field experts to blow young minds!

Bitcoin needs weekly close above $85k to avoid correction to $76k: analysts Bitcoin analysts are eying the weekly close to gauge Bitcoin’s price trajectory for next week, as traditional and crypto markets are lacking direction amid a mix of global trade war fears paired with easing inflation concerns. Bitcoin's ( BTC ) price may see more downside next week unless it manages to close the week above the $85,000 psychological mark, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. “Bitcoin’s relief rally after the FOMC meeting and lower CPI readings has analysts eyeing a weekly close above $85,000, as critical for resuming upside momentum,” Lee told Cointelegraph, adding: “A close above this level could prevent a drop to $76,000 and signal strength, while $87,000 would provide even clearer bullish confirmation. Macro factors like steady rates and cooling inflation support risk assets, but the Sunday close will be decisive.” BTC/USD, 1-year chart.

Crypto security will always be a game of ‘cat and mouse’ — Wallet exec Cryptocurrency wallet providers are getting more sophisticated , but so are bad actors — which means the battle between security and threats is at a deadlock, says a hardware wallet firm executive. “It will always be a cat and mouse game,” Ledger chief experience officer Ian Rogers told Cointelegraph when describing the constant race between crypto wallet firms adding new security features and hackers finding more advanced ways to access victims’ wallets. Rogers said, unfortunately, the most straightforward scams work best because scammers rely on people making simple mistakes. “People give their 24-word phrases to people every day, so as long as that happens, then they are going to go for the low-cost tax,” he said, adding: “Anyone who asks for your 24 words is a criminal.” Rogers highlighted a common crypto scam where victims get tricked by replies under “any post on Twitter about crypto,” with messages like “DM me, and I’ll help you.” “You know that scammers are always asking you for your 24 words,” Rogers said.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|BCH|ETH|USDT|XRP|MATIC|ZK|ADA|TON|BNB|WLD|SOL|APT|ARB|AVAX|LINK|ASIA|MINING|USDC|FIAT|ARKM|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-23 21:23:23

The attacker tried to exploit GitHub permissions to add harmful code into the project’s automated build system (CI/CD pipeline). Thanks to a fast response from Coinbase and help from security professionals, no major damage occurred. The issue was first made public on March 23, when Yu Jian, the founder of the security firm SlowMist, shared a post on X. He referred to a detailed report from Unit 42, the security research team at Palo Alto Networks. The hacker targeted Coinbase’s open-source tool agentkit , which helps create blockchain-based AI agents. They also attacked another related toolkit, onchainkit , both hosted on GitHub. By forking these repositories, the attacker inserted dangerous code into the automation process. This malicious activity was detected on March 14, 2025 . Unit 42 explained that the goal was to take advantage of the public CI/CD flow in agentkit. The hacker used GitHub’s broad “write-all” permissions, which allowed them to plant harmful payloads into the automated workflows. This could have exposed sensitive data or opened the door to further compromises. Fortunately, the injected code did not include highly dangerous features like remote control tools or reverse shell exploits. Instead, it was built to gather internal data quietly. Still, the risk was serious. Coinbase moved quickly. Working closely with cybersecurity experts, the company isolated the threat and applied key protections. Their quick action stopped the attack before it could reach deeper systems or cause lasting harm. This incident comes at a time when Coinbase holds a critical role in the crypto world, especially as the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. and a main custodian for spot Bitcoin ETFs . A successful breach could have created serious problems in the wider industry, similar to Bybit’s recent $1.4 billion hack. Although this attack failed, the same threat actor is now believed to be part of a larger cyber campaign that is gaining global attention. In response, Yu Jian urged developers to carefully review their GitHub setups. He specifically warned those using tools like reviewdog or tj-actions to double-check their systems and make sure no sensitive information has leaked. “If your company uses reviewdog or tj-actions, do a thorough self-examination,” he advised on X. The case shows how securing open-source tools is becoming more urgent as the crypto space grows. According to data from DeFiLlama, over $1.5 billion in crypto has already been lost to hacks and exploits this year alone.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-23 21:40:54
42230932,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61406,1742766188,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Role of Blockchain in the Digital World,https://timestabloid.com/the-role-of-blockchain-in-the-digital-world/,"Blockchain technology has emerged as one of the most transformative innovations of the 21st century. It has revolutionized industries ranging from finance to healthcare, creating new opportunities for secure and decentralized digital transactions. While initially known as the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchain has expanded beyond digital currencies, shaping various sectors and redefining how data is stored and verified. In this article, we will explore how blockchain is influencing the world and the many ways it is being integrated into different industries. Understanding Blockchain Technology At its core, blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that records transactions across multiple computers. This system ensures transparency, security, and immutability, making it nearly impossible to alter or hack data once it has been recorded. Unlike traditional centralized databases, blockchain does not rely on a single authority to manage or validate information. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that work together to maintain the integrity of the ledger. Each block in a blockchain contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, forming a continuous chain. This structure enhances security and prevents tampering, making blockchain a reliable tool for digital record-keeping. Key Features of Blockchain 1. Decentralization One of the most important aspects of blockchain technology is decentralization. Unlike traditional financial systems that depend on central banks or governments, blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network. This means that no single entity has control over the entire system, reducing the risks of fraud and manipulation. 2. Security and Transparency Blockchain networks use cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions, making them highly resistant to cyber threats. Additionally, all transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust among users. 3. Immutability Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or deleted. This immutability ensures that records remain accurate and unaltered, which is particularly valuable in industries that require verifiable data integrity, such as healthcare and supply chain management. Applications of Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency Although blockchain gained popularity through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, its potential extends far beyond digital money. Here are some of the key areas where blockchain is making a significant impact: 1. Finance and Banking Blockchain has transformed the financial sector by enabling faster, more secure, and cost-effective transactions. Traditional banking processes often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and high transaction fees. Blockchain eliminates these middlemen, allowing direct peer-to-peer transactions. Moreover, smart contracts – self-executing agreements stored on the blockchain – streamline processes like loan approvals and cross-border payments. 2. Supply Chain Management Blockchain enhances transparency and traceability in supply chains by providing an immutable record of goods as they move through various stages of production and distribution. Companies can use blockchain to track product origins, prevent counterfeiting, and improve inventory management. 3. Healthcare and Medical Records The healthcare industry benefits greatly from blockchain’s ability to store and secure patient records. Blockchain ensures that medical histories remain accurate, up-to-date, and accessible only to authorized individuals. This reduces errors, prevents data breaches, and improves patient care. 4. Real Estate and Property Transactions Real estate transactions often involve complex paperwork and lengthy verification processes. Blockchain simplifies this by creating digital property ownership records, reducing the need for intermediaries, and minimizing fraud risks. Smart contracts also automate property sales, ensuring smooth and transparent transactions. 5. Voting Systems Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize voting systems by ensuring secure and tamper-proof elections. With blockchain-based voting, each vote is recorded on a decentralized ledger, preventing fraud and ensuring transparency in the electoral process. 6. Intellectual Property and Digital Rights Artists, musicians, and content creators can use blockchain to protect their intellectual property rights. By registering their work on a blockchain, they can create a verifiable proof of ownership, preventing unauthorized use and ensuring fair compensation. 7. Education and Credential Verification Blockchain can be used in the education sector to verify academic credentials. Universities and employers can use blockchain to ensure that diplomas, certificates, and degrees are authentic and tamper-proof, reducing fraud in academic qualifications. 8. Decentralized Identity Verification Identity theft and data breaches are major concerns in today’s digital world. Blockchain offers a solution by enabling decentralized identity verification, allowing individuals to control their own digital identities securely. This eliminates the need for centralized databases that are vulnerable to hacking. 9. Energy Trading and Sustainability Blockchain technology is being integrated into the energy sector to enable peer-to-peer energy trading. Homeowners with solar panels can sell excess energy directly to others without the need for intermediaries. This creates a more efficient and sustainable energy distribution system. The Future of Blockchain Blockchain technology continues to evolve, and its adoption is expected to grow across multiple industries. Innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain-based identity verification are paving the way for a more secure and decentralized digital future. However, challenges remain, including regulatory uncertainty, scalability issues, and energy consumption concerns. Governments and organizations worldwide are working to address these challenges to ensure the responsible development and integration of blockchain technology. Conclusion Blockchain is more than just a buzzword; it is a groundbreaking technology with the potential to reshape numerous industries. From finance and healthcare to real estate and digital rights management, blockchain’s decentralized and secure nature is revolutionizing how data and transactions are handled. As technology continues to evolve, its impact on the world will only grow, offering endless possibilities for innovation and efficiency. Businesses and individuals looking to stay ahead in the digital era should embrace blockchain technology and explore its benefits. Whether it’s through secure financial transactions, transparent supply chains, or tamper-proof voting systems, blockchain is set to become a fundamental pillar of the future digital landscape.

42229812,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=697835,1742767200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42229812.jpeg,Solana (SOL) Holder Abruptly Sells Huge SOL Stake for New Coin Currently Under $0.03,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-holder-abruptly-sells-huge-sol-stake-for-new-coin-currently-under-0-03/,"One of the largest Solana (SOL) investors has cashed in a huge amount of their bag in the crypto market to purchase Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending token that is in presale and is currently valued at less than $0.03. It follows the turbocharged presale of Mutuum Finance, with Phase 3 already 60% full after raking in $4.5 million and 6,400 holders. Despite currently sitting at $0.02, on its next stage, MUTM will rise to $0.025 — a 25% increase — fostering an urge to buy MUTM to prevent a gap formed with the next price range. The token is said to have artificially induced buy pressure mechanisms and real-world use cases in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, which analysts are looking to as catalysts for its explosive potential. Presale Ramps Up For Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting immense demand as a first to market with its unique lending model and profit-sharing ecosystem. The project’s presale has already surpassed $4.5 million, with Phase 3 tokens being snapped up quickly in advance of an exchange listing at $0.06. In fact, those who snatch the token up now at the $0.02 price will be able to see a return of 200% when MUTM hits the public markets. An exciting post-launch price prediction based on tokenomics is also strongly propelling optimism – $1.50 would imply a 7,400% ROI and has established MUTM as a genuine breakout candidate in terms of DeFi due diligence across 2025. A share of protocol income flows into the platform’s “buy-and-distribute” system, directly purchasing MUTM tokens for distribution among stakers. This mechanism maintains demand and prevents sell offs which creates a self-reinforcing cycle of scarcity and value increase. Moreover, Mutuum’s overcollateralized lending pools and peer-to-peer borrowing services provide real utility that distinguishes it from speculative competitors. Shift In Investors On Solana Reflects The Confidence In The Market The Solana (SOL) investor’s move to Mutuum Finance is part of a larger trend of capital flowing toward projects with tangible use cases. Despite being one of the leading blockchains, Solana has faced challenges in recent months — including price fluctuations and network congestion — which have motivated some investors to seek additional opportunities among newer tokens, such as MUTM. The presale mechanics of Mutuum with progressive price increases between phases is a hook for many looking for asymmetric returns. The $0.02 barrier to entry of Phase 3 in particular is well considered. Over half of the allocation has already been taken, so the window to secure tokens at this tier is closing. By buying now ahead of Phase 4, investors not only secure themselves a 25% gain, but place themselves in prime position for even more exponential growth after listing. In contrast, Solana’s 2025 estimates fall short of MUTM’s potential, given the latter’s strategic integrations with DeFi and token burns designed to escalate its market presence. Security and Long-Term Vision The development team of Mutuum Finance has started a security audit with CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm. The results of the audit will be made public, and behind it, transparency. This preventive measure is in line with the project’s dedication to risk mitigation and keeping users’ funds and platform operations safe from exploits. The protocol’s roadmap involves the launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin, which would add to the diversity of its DeFi offerings. By minting stablecoins against pooled deposits, Mutuum plans to improve liquidity while keeping things decentralized — a direct challenge to centralized stablecoin masters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is changing what it means to have value, revolutionizing lending and incentivizing investors. With the presale gaining momentum and exchange listings on the horizon, the $0.02 price point could mark a brief window of opportunity for the project. Those early adopters will be able to enjoy life-changing returns that would be a mirror image of the foresight shown by the Solana whale who bet on MUTM. With Phase 3 almost full, waiting will cost you the final low-price entry before the flood of price increases irreversibly begins.

Perhaps basking in the landmark win, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, says the company will continue to push for fair regulations. Victory over SEC Sparks Renewed Push for Fair Rules In an interview with CNBC , Alderoty maintained that Ripple will lead the quest for “clear and fair crypto regulation.” This stance comes after Ripple announced that the U.S. regulatory body has decided not to pursue its controversial appeal against it. The SEC did not only drop its case with Ripple; other crucial cases were also tossed off. Some of those cases included the SEC’s case against American crypto exchange Coinbase, Kraken, and OpenSea . The development comes amid the shift in aggressive crypto enforcement the SEC has been known for under its former Chair, Gary Gensler. Interestingly, despite the SEC dropping its lawsuit, Ripple has remained silent about the cross-appeal it filed. The company has not made its stance known as to whether it would continue with the case or withdraw it. In a recent interview, Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO, stated that it has not yet reached a decision yet. Ripple’s Legal Battle and Its Market Impact Ripple’s victory over the SEC is a testament to the firm’s resilience. According to Alderoty, “Ripple stands alone as the company that fought back and won on essential legal questions.” Notably, the SEC filed a suit against the company four years ago, accusing it of raising over one billion dollars from XRP sales. The regulatory body argued that Ripple failed to register XRP as a security. XRP, launched in 2012, is one of the first altcoins in the cryptocurrency space. It became the native currency of Ripple Labs. Future of Crypto Regulation Post-Ripple Case The asset has remained resilient throughout the legal drama and witnessed an 11% increase after the news of the legal battle hit the market. As of this writing, XRP is changing hands at $2.41, a 1.72% increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. With the legal hurdle over, many analysts anticipate XRP’s value to soar. Interestingly, Ripple’s executives predict that crypto assets could record explosive growth this year.

Coinbase Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Paul Grewal has taken swipes at the US Treasury for its “botched” attempt at waiving the need for a final judgment. Coinbase CLO Pokes Holes In US Treasury’s Latest Court Filing In a strongly worded post on X , Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal railed against the US Treasury’s handling of Tornado Cash’s delisting from the sanctions list. According to Grewal’s disclosure, the US Treasury filed a pleading to moot the need for a final judgment on the matter. In legal terms, a party to dispute can apply to moot a final judgment, arguing that the issue at hand is no longer significant or actionable. Following Tornado Cash’s removal from the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list, the US Treasury’s latest filing seeks to waive a final judgment on the case. Tornado Cash users have been in court, challenging the US Treasury’s decision to place the mixer on the SDN list. However, Grewal argues that the filing runs contrary to established legal processes in the US. He notes a proper filing follows only if the defendant can show that the “practice cannot reasonably be expected to recur.” The Coinbase CLO cited several legal precedents involving law enforcement agencies removing sanctions and not moving a case. He argues that without a final court judgment, law enforcement can review their decision to impose fresh sanctions at a future date. “Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again,” said Grewal. A Protracted Legal Battle Against Authorities The road toward the lifting of Tornado Cash’s sanctions was long and winding. A raft of Tornado Cash users headed to court to protest the placing of the mixer on the SDN list. US authorities say the mixer played a principal role in laundering nearly $500 million worth of stolen digital assets by North-Korean backed Lazarus Group. After notching a series of small wins in Court, Grewal criticized the US Treasury for failing to comply with a court ruling clarifying the status of Tornado Cash’s smart contract. The court ruled that the smart contract did not form property under the IEEPA as it is non-erasable. Tornado Cash has received support from Coinbase with the Ethereum Foundation supporting the legal defense of lead developer Alexey Pertsev.

Prosecutors allege that he misused $11 million from a major streaming service, meant for his science fiction television series “White Horse,” on crypto trading. The $11M Fraud According to the indictment, Rinsch reached a deal with the streaming platform in 2018, securing $44 million to complete the production of White Horse. In 2019 and early 2020, he requested an additional $11 million, which was transferred to his company on March 6, 2020. In a statement , acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said: “As alleged, Carl Erik Rinsch orchestrated a scheme to steal millions by soliciting a large investment from a video streaming service, claiming that money would be used to finance a television show that he was creating. But that was fiction.” Instead of using the funds as intended, he moved them through various accounts before storing them in a personal brokerage account. He then engaged in speculative securities trading but lost more than half of the funds within two months. Rather than redirecting the remaining money back into the show, Rinsch allegedly shifted to crypto trading and continued making extravagant personal purchases. Prosecutors say he spent nearly $1.8 million on credit card payments, $1 million on legal fees for lawsuits against the streaming service and his divorce, and $395,000 on luxury hotel stays and rental properties. Further, the Netflix director spent $3.8 million on furniture and antiques, including $638,000 on two mattresses and $295,000 on luxury bedding. His purchases also included five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari totaling $2.4 million and $652,000 on designer watches and clothing. The Charges Against Rinsch The 47-year-old has been indicted with one count of wire fraud, one count of money laundering, and five counts of engaging in financial transactions involving criminally gotten property. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison for wire fraud, 20 years for money laundering, and 10 years for each financial transaction charge. This is not Rinsch’s first encounter with controversy. In 2023, the “Conquest” director reportedly took $4 million from the show’s budget to invest in Dogecoin, earning a $27 million return. Much like the current case, his crypto profits were followed by a lavish spending spree. Rinsch allegedly spent nearly $9 million on luxury purchases, including high-end furniture, designer clothing, a $380,000 watch, and luxury vehicles.

Concurrently, BlockDAG’s latest AMA delivered a wealth of updates, especially thrilling the community with a major announcement: an upcoming beta testnet launch accompanied by a generous 10,000 testnet token airdrop. These distinct developments reflect significant momentum for both projects, each impacting investor sentiment uniquely. For XRP, traders focus on its technical strength and legal milestones. For BlockDAG , investor enthusiasm builds on ambitious testnet plans and community incentives. This combination of XRP’s steady progress and BlockDAG’s strategic community engagement sets a compelling scene for crypto observers this quarter. XRP Holds Steady, Targets a New High XRP traders watched carefully as the cryptocurrency bounced from its critical support at $2.30, positioning itself for a potential move toward $3. Recently, XRP’s stability at this support level boosted market optimism significantly. Technical indicators highlighted a successful defense against bearish pressures, showing strength amid market volatility. Analysts identified the $2.42 resistance level as the key barrier before XRP can successfully break toward its ambitious $3 target. This current range ($2.30-$2.42) remains closely monitored as traders await clear directional signals. Adding further fuel to the bullish sentiment, XRP recently celebrated a pivotal legal milestone. The protracted lawsuit involving Ripple Labs and the SEC concluded favorably, significantly alleviating regulatory pressures that had long cast shadows over XRP. The resolution of this lawsuit dramatically improved market sentiment, giving XRP bulls additional confidence to maintain buying pressure at current support levels. This optimism is further supported by XRP’s broader adoption trajectory, with Ripple’s growing cross-border payment partnerships continuing to strengthen the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals. As Ripple expands globally, demand for XRP’s liquidity solutions steadily grows, underpinning bullish arguments beyond mere technical analyses. Traders and investors alike are thus hopeful that these combined factors can push XRP confidently toward the much-anticipated $3 price point in the near term. BlockDAG AMA Highlights Robust Community Initiatives On the other hand, BlockDAG continues capturing investor interest through proactive community-building strategies. The project’s latest AMA session unveiled detailed updates, significantly elevating enthusiasm within its community. Perhaps most notably, BlockDAG announced an imminent beta testnet launch coupled with an ambitious 10,000 testnet token airdrop to each of its 110,000 investors. This significant initiative aims to amplify community engagement while thoroughly testing network capacity, usability, and stability. During the AMA, the BlockDAG team emphasized the meticulous preparations for this testnet phase, detailing extensive improvements implemented since the previous alpha phase. Upgrades include enhanced node installation processes, streamlined documentation, and significantly improved network explorers. New capabilities like contract verification, node explorer functionalities, and real-time token views further bolster the testnet’s appeal, setting clear benchmarks for transparency and user-friendliness. Additionally, the AMA outlined a compelling incentive program designed explicitly to boost participation. The top 30 participants across various engagement metrics—including active wallets, miner participation, and token balances—stand to receive substantial rewards totaling $60,000, distributed in real BDAG tokens post-launch. This strategy highlights BlockDAG’s determination to foster an active and involved community, creating valuable feedback loops that improve network functionalities ahead of the mainnet launch. Beyond short-term excitement, BlockDAG also provided crucial clarifications on token vesting schedules, enhancing investor clarity. Presale investors will receive 40% of their tokens immediately upon the Token Generation Event (TGE), followed by evenly paced releases over subsequent months. Bonuses and miner rewards involve structured lock-ups extending from one to five years, underscoring BlockDAG’s commitment to sustainable growth and market stability post-launch. These details revealed transparently in the AMA, reinforce investor confidence, showcasing long-term planning and fiscal responsibility from the project’s leadership. The AMA also spotlighted significant strategic partnerships, including a prominent alliance with Inter Milan. This high-profile partnership offers substantial marketing potential, blending crypto innovation with traditional global sports appeal. Exclusive fan experiences, branded merchandise, and stadium tours were detailed as elements of this partnership, designed explicitly to extend BlockDAG’s global reach beyond crypto-native audiences. Additionally, BlockDAG’s participation in significant blockchain events—like ETHDenver, ETHPanama, and upcoming Token2049 summits in Dubai and Singapore—reflects the project’s coordinated strategy to bolster visibility and credibility within the broader crypto and blockchain sectors. Key takeaways As XRP maintains bullish ambitions, BlockDAG’s transparent AMA and community-first strategies continue driving meaningful investor engagement. Both cryptocurrencies stand poised for significant developments, each with clearly defined catalysts. XRP’s near-term path hinges on overcoming resistance, supported by robust fundamentals and favorable legal outcomes. For BlockDAG, the imminent testnet launch, significant airdrop incentives, structured vesting policies, and high-profile partnerships paint a clear and exciting trajectory. These clear, milestone-driven developments position both XRP and BlockDAG attractively within the broader market. However, BlockDAG’s raging presale with over $206M in presale, carefully structured community incentives, thorough transparency, and strategic event participation underline a particularly appealing narrative for long-term-oriented investors seeking sustainable value. Investors assessing crypto opportunities today would be wise to closely monitor both projects, though BlockDAG’s meticulous preparation and long-term vision distinctly set it apart.

The star of this trend? Remittix (RTX) , a $0.0734 altcoin that has already raised over $14 million and sold more than 520 million tokens. Some traders are calling it “XRP 2.0” thanks to its focus on low-cost, near-instant remittances. There’s also chatter that RTX could surge past $5 by 2025, an enormous leap from its current price. Below, we unpack how the PayFi narrative is gaining traction, why Remittix leads the pack, and how high it might climb in the next bull market. Why PayFi Is Booming PayFi tokens like Remittix are aimed at making payments simpler, cheaper and more user-friendly. Traditional wire transfers can be expensive and slow, a hassle for families, freelancers or small shops dealing with international clients. Remittix addresses this pain point directly, letting users convert crypto (BTC, ETH or others) into local cash and send it to a bank account in around 24 hours. This sets PayFi apart from advanced DeFi or NFT platforms, appealing to people who need to move money across borders without crazy fees. With the global remittance market worth trillions, PayFi tokens might have a huge real-world audience ready to jump in. As cross-border payments remain a daily challenge for countless people, the simplicity of PayFisolutions often wins them over. Someone who struggles with wire transfers or expensive remittance apps wants a no-fuss way to convert digital assets to local currency. That’s why PayFitokens like Remittix are attracting fresh interest, as they marry the benefits of crypto (speed and low fees) with the familiarity of regular bank deposits. Remittix (RTX): The ‘XRP 2.0’? While XRP famously tackled cross-border finance for banks, Remittix focuses on everyone else's families, gig workers and small businesses. Priced at $0.0734, RTX has pulled in over $14 million in funding, with 520+ million tokens sold in presale, showing strong initial backing. The team aims to keep things user-friendly, automating the entire conversion process so recipients don’t have to wrestle with crypto wallets or advanced steps. Observers believe that if Remittix (RTX) secures deals with major payroll systems or e-commerce companies, daily usage could skyrocket, pushing the token well beyond its current valuation. That’s why some analysts see it as “XRP 2.0,” but with a more direct approach to real people’s needs. Could RTX Really Pass $5 by 2025? At first glance, jumping from about $0.07 to over $5 sounds wild yet fans note that similar leaps happened when tokens like XRP or early DeFi coins caught mainstream attention. If Remittix(RTX) does become a go-to solution for cross-border transfers, its daily transaction volume could spike rapidly. Each new user has friends or family who might also switch, creating a chain reaction of adoption. Of course, hitting $5 demands big partnerships, consistent network stability and a supportive crypto market cycle. But given how large the international remittance market is, some experts say the goal is possible especially if PayFi becomes the next hot niche. Conclusion: Why Remittix Might Outpace XRP’s Old Record While XRP still plays a major role in cross-border banking, Remittix aims to capture everyday payments. At $0.0734 with over $14+ million raised, its potential user base (from freelancers to families) could drive a bigger, faster adoption wave than older tokens reliant on big institutional deals. If PayFi momentum continues, RTX has a big chance of surpassing $5 in the next bull run delivering life-changing gains for early buyers. Remittix stands as a prime example of how focusing on an everyday problem can catapult a token from obscurity to stardom, even in a crowded crypto landscape. Ready to Give Remittix a Go?

It also vowed to consider talking points raised by the Virtual Asset Committee, a government advisory body that answers to the FSC. The BOK, meanwhile, is more “reluctant” to act. It has gone on the record as stating that it is “cautious about investing in virtual assets,” as they “do not meet the IMF’s foreign exchange reserve requirements.” The bank has also claimed that “high price volatility” means BTC and other tokens may not be “in line with the purpose of managing foreign exchange reserves.” South Korea’s financial authorities tighten AML controls to address new money laundering risks in the crypto sector. #SouthKorea #CryptoLaws https://t.co/2BlRNYWfxR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 5, 2025 The FSC has taken a different stance, noting that the Virtual Asset Committee has reported on “the possibility of stockpiling digital assets” and “setting the standards for stockpiling” crypto.

Web3 casinos represent a fundamental shift in gambling, reducing the risk of manipulation or fraud through verifiable randomness and immutable transaction records. The marriage of cryptocurrency and gambling creates a powerful combination that addresses long-standing issues in the industry. Through token ownership, players can verify game fairness, enjoy faster withdrawals, and participate in casino governance. These platforms are building what some call ""GambleFi"", an ecosystem where betting becomes community-centric and tokenised. As blockchain technology matures​​, the trajectory of Web3 gambling points toward increased democratisation and player control. The concept of rolling the decentralised dice goes beyond just playing games, it represents a new paradigm in which gamblers become stakeholders in the platforms they use. This shift from mere consumers to active participants may fundamentally restructure the £100+ billion online gambling industry for decades to come. The Advancement of Decentralised Gaming Platforms Decentralised gaming platforms have transformed the gambling industry by introducing transparency, security, and user ownership. These platforms leverage blockchain technology to create a more fair and accessible gambling environment. Evolution from Traditional to Decentralised Gambling “Traditional online casinos operate under centralised control, requiring players to trust the operator to maintain fair games and handle funds properly. Web3 gambling changes this dynamic by using blockchain to create trustless environments where outcomes are verifiable,” said UK online casino website JeffBet . The shift began with simple decentralised betting applications that processed payments using Bitcoin. These primitive platforms demonstrated the potential for removing intermediaries from gambling transactions. Today's Web3 casinos offer sophisticated experiences comparable to conventional online gambling sites. Without lengthy verification processes, players can now use digital wallets to deposit and withdraw various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Solana. User ownership represents a critical advancement. Players can verify game fairness through distributed ledgers rather than relying on opaque algorithms controlled by a single entity. Technological Underpinnings of Web3 Casinos Blockchain technology, smart contracts, and digital currencies are the foundation of Web3 casinos. Together, these elements create transparent, secure, and user-controlled gambling platforms. Smart contracts, self-executing agreements with rules written in code, automatically determine game outcomes and distribute winnings. This automation eliminates the need to trust a centralised casino operator to pay out winnings. Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and game results are recorded immutably. Players can independently verify that games run fairly by checking the distributed ledger. Security benefits extend beyond fair play. Digital wallets provide enhanced protection against fraud compared to traditional payment methods. Players maintain control of their funds until they actively place bets. Interoperability between blockchains is improving, allowing gamblers to use their preferred digital currency. Whether using Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, or emerging currencies, the increasing flexibility makes Web3 gambling more accessible. Benefits and Opportunities of Dice Gaming on the Blockchain Blockchain technology offers unique advantages for dice games that traditional online casinos simply cannot match. These innovations reshape the player experience through verifiable fairness, economic incentives, and unmatched security. Providing Fair Systems and Transparency The most compelling feature of blockchain-based dice games is their provably fair system. Unlike traditional online casinos where algorithms remain hidden, Web3 dice games use cryptographic methods to verify each roll's fairness. By examining the blockchain record, players can independently check that outcomes weren't manipulated. This verification happens through cryptographic hash functions and publicly visible smart contracts. The transparency extends beyond individual dice rolls. Casino profit margins (house edge) are coded directly into smart contracts, making them immutable and visible to all players. This openness builds unprecedented trust. Players who know with mathematical certainty that games aren't rigged develop stronger confidence in the platform. Many decentralised dice games publicly display transaction histories and dice roll outcomes on the blockchain, creating a permanent, tamper-proof record that regulatory bodies and players can audit. Tokenomics: Earning and Spending in Web3 Web3 dice games introduce innovative economic models through tokenised systems. Players often earn native platform tokens through gameplay, staking, or participation. These tokens serve multiple functions. They act as in-game currency for placing bets and grant governance rights in decentralised platforms. Token holders may vote on house edge percentages or new game implementations. Loyalty programmes in blockchain dice games offer free spins and bonuses based on token holdings rather than centralised decisions, creating a more equitable reward structure. Players can earn passive income by staking their tokens to provide liquidity to the dice game's betting pool. This makes players partial ""house owners"" who share in platform profits. The interoperability of tokens means winnings from dice games can be used across the broader Web3 ecosystem, creating greater utility than closed casino systems. Enhanced Security and Player Autonomy Blockchain dice games dramatically improve security through cryptographic protection and eliminating central points of failure. Funds remain in player-controlled wallets rather than casino accounts. Smart contracts automate payouts instantly when winning conditions are met. This removes the withdrawal delays and arbitrary limits common in traditional online casinos. Instant withdrawals via cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin allow players to access their winnings whenever they choose, without waiting for approval from centralised authorities. Players maintain full custody of their funds until they place a bet. This self-custody model eliminates the risk of casino insolvency affecting player deposits. KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements are often minimised or eliminated, protecting player privacy while maintaining responsible gambling standards through blockchain verification. Implications for the Online Gambling Ecosystem The rise of decentralised dice platforms forces traditional gambling operators to reconsider their business models. Many are now incorporating blockchain elements to remain competitive. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to accommodate these new models. Some jurisdictions now recognise blockchain's inherent protections and are creating specialised licensing for Web3 gambling operations. Rolling the decentralised dice represents more than technological change, it signals a philosophical shift towards player-centric gambling experiences. Cross-chain compatibility allows dice games to operate across multiple blockchains, reaching broader audiences and providing flexibility in cryptocurrency choice for betting. The community-governed nature of these platforms ensures that development priorities reflect actual player needs rather than purely profit-driven motives.

According to the company, the number of active altcoins listed on CoinMarketCap dropped by 400, indicating a decrease in public interest. This decline is largely attributed to the significant decline in altcoin trading volume on exchanges, which currently averages $100 billion, much lower than the $400 billion recorded in December 2024. Despite this, Alphractal suggests that decreasing trading volumes will not necessarily prevent future price increases in altcoins. Historical trends show that altcoins have reached all-time highs even when trading volume has not peaked, as seen in 2021. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson stated that new incentives are needed in the cryptocurrency market. Wedson stated that, unlike the peak enthusiasm in 2017 and 2021, the current market is facing slow growth and lack of investor confidence. Wedson also identified the significant decline in investments in Web3 startups as a major contributing factor: 2021: $33 billion worldwide 2022: $7.1 billion raised despite “crypto winter,” signaling an early slowdown. 2023: Less than $7 billion raised, a 74% decrease from 2021. According to Crunchbase, $1.7 billion was raised in the first quarter alone, the lowest amount since late 2020. This decline in Web3 investments outpaced the downturn in the overall Venture Capital (VC) market, which saw a 38% decline between 2021 and 2023. Wedson pointed out several key reasons for the market slump: The collapse of FTX and the resulting loss of confidence in the industry. Regulatory uncertainties in major cryptocurrency markets. Shifting investor focus to Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is set to attract around $50 billion by 2023. Despite these challenges, Wedson remains optimistic about the potential for a resurgence in crypto investment, believing that the combination of AI, crypto, and gaming-themed cryptocurrencies could be the next big driver of institutional capital. Alphractal’s latest observations show that Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) have accumulated more long positions than short positions over the past week, suggesting that the market could experience higher volatility early next week. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency world now focuses on Remittix as the token projected to surpass both Solana and Cardano in 2025 market performance. The market has shown its desire for straightforward payment options by allowing Remittix to sell more than 521 million tokens at $0.0734 each which resulted in $14 million raised. Solana’s Strong Momentum and ETF Speculation Source: tradingview . SOL’s current price is $133.27. The price of Solana regularly undergoes substantial changes. High growth rates and quick processing combined to make Solana renowned until obstacles such as network failures and negative market changes appeared. Recent attention on Solana news revolves around developing a Solana ETF just like traditional investors utilized for Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs. Such an ETF approval would enhance SOL's standing while offering an opportunity for new capital inflow from hedge funds alongside institutional participants. Solana could establish itself permanently in the cryptocurrency industry thanks to additional institutional support. Meme coin developers choose Solana because of its affordable transaction costs which allows them to deploy new tokens on its chain thus increasing on-chain action. The increase in transactions generates both short-term popularity and enhances the speed of operations in the network. The proposed exchange-traded fund could create institutional backing for Solana if its hopes materialize. Cardano’s Choppy Waters and Possible Recovery Since its inception Cardano (ADA) followed a step-by-step development process while relying on research reviewed by peers together with network upgrading layers. The coin experiences unstable performance during the latest week. The crypto market experiences significant challenges as analysts detect a “ Death Cross ” technical indicator that signals a bearish pattern following a 37% value decrease during this month. At its current price of $0.71 the ADA coin remains close to its essential support value at $0.70 . If the price drops below $0.62 it will strengthen the current bearish market sentiment. Source: tradingview . ADA’s death cross pattern. Although Cardano maintains fans who focus on its long-term development. Pioneers expect ADA to retrace to $1 after it successfully rises above $0.77 and maintains upward momentum. ADA along with the entire cryptocurrency market continues to give Charles Hoskinson hope as he suggests 2025 will mark their breakthrough year. Large holders continue to envision ADA growth potential based on their recent purchases of approximately 190 million tokens in the span of 48 hours. The signals point in different directions at present while new heavy buying spells the start of significant market advancement. Remittix: The Altcoin Forecasted to Outperform The direct everyday functionality of Remittix enters the market as settled competitors Solana and Cardano face scaling issues together with uncertain market sentiment alongside upcoming price barriers. The project obtained $14 million in funding through selling 521 million tokens at $0.0734. Through its swift crypto shortcode method Remittix enables users to make instant digital asset conversions that lead to easy spending and transferring capabilities. Numerous experts predict Remittix will deliver market successes because they believe today's consumers are seeking user-friendly practical solutions over multilayered platforms or delayed system updates. The incoming merchant partnerships, remittance services and e-commerce deals have the potential to create significant demand for Remittix tokens. Many experts consider Remittix the leading altcoin to dominate market gains during 2025 because it appeals to both crypto veterans and introductory users seeking simple payment methods. Why Remittix Could Eclipse Solana and Cardano Remittix distinguishes itself from Solana and Cardano with its straightforward link between cryptocurrency and regular bank funds while Solana focuses on developer needs and Cardano drives their development through research. The user bases continue supporting both coins but institutional money could potentially choose projects offering solutions for instant everyday needs. The rumored ETF for Solana holds promise along with potential improvements for Cardano yet these outcomes depend on directed and gradual project developments. Conclusion Analysts predict that both Solana and Cardano will experience partial price gains as certain market players continue to show enthusiasm for well-recognized platforms. New alternatives to Bitcoin are earning widespread approval as they address routine challenges in the year 2025. Near-instant payment solutions form the key priority of Remittix in its market leadership. The market recommends Remittix's direct payment solutions for its clear approach to delivering everyday utility ahead of methodical roadmap-driven projects like Cardano and prospectively successful projects like Solana.

Fidelity’s March 21 filing with the US securities regulator said “OnChain” would help track transactions of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX) — an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills. While OnChain is pending regulatory approval, it is expected to take effect on May 30, Fidelity said. Fidelity’s filing to register a tokenized version of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund. Source: Securities and Exchange Commission The OnChain share class aims to provide investors transparency and verifiable tracking of share transactions of FYHXX, although Fidelity will maintain traditional book-entry records as the official ownership ledger. “Although the secondary recording of the OnChain class on a blockchain will not represent the official record of ownership, the transfer agent will reconcile the secondary blockchain transactions with the official records of the OnChain class on at least a daily basis.” Fidelity said the US Treasury bills wouldn’t be directly tokenized. The $5.8 trillion asset manager said it may also expand OnChain to other blockchains in the future.

That’s why many now focus on other coins that show better speed, utility, or smart tech upgrades. In this article, we’ll take a close look at four top trending cryptos in 2025—BlockDAG, Litecoin, Mantra, and XRP. These coins offer unique value with their strong tech and market plans. Each project is expected to make a big move in the coming year. Let’s explore how they work and what makes them special in today’s fast-growing space. BlockDAG: Most Advanced Layer-1 Crypto BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining a lot of attention due to a fast-moving presale that has raised more than $205 million while selling over 18.8 billion coins. Starting at just $0.001 in its first batch, the price has now climbed to $0.0248 in batch 27—a growth of 2,380%. This steady climb shows strong backing from the crypto crowd and explains why BDAG is one of the top trending cryptos in 2025. With plans to list on 10 centralized exchanges (CEXs) in 2025, BlockDAG will become easier to access globally, making buying and trading smoother. Alongside this, its awaited mainnet launch will take the system live, offering real use of its peer-to-peer setup. This move can help shape the future of decentralized tech use. The presale is getting closer to its goal of $600 million, and with only a few batches left, demand is growing. Prices are set to rise with each batch, so those waiting too long might miss a better deal. BlockDAG’s fast growth, mainnet launch, and CEX plans explain why it leads among the top trending cryptos in 2025. Litecoin: Trusted Digital Coin with Fast Transactions Created by ex-Google engineer Charlie Lee in 2011, Litecoin (LTC) was built to improve transaction speed while using less data space than Bitcoin. It now holds a market value of $8.61 billion and trades at $114.46 per coin, proving its steady and reliable track record. The coin’s quick transfer times and lower cost make it a solid pick among top trending cryptos in 2025. It is known for handling daily use cases well, making it ideal for fast digital payments. Its steady support and active use in the crypto scene keep it relevant. LTC”s history of long-term use and simple network function gives it an edge. Keeping watch on Litecoin’s progress may help those tracking coins with proven value and function. Mantra: Bringing DeFi Closer to Traditional Finance Mantra (OM) is a platform that mixes decentralized finance (DeFi) with more familiar banking ideas. It offers services like lending, staking, and community voting, all managed on a blockchain-based setup. The OM coin helps run these services while also giving users voting rights. Priced at $7.38 currently, Mantra has shown a 92.71% price jump in 2024. This performance makes it one of the top trending cryptos in 2025. Yet beyond numbers, it’s also working on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and forming new links in both crypto and finance sectors. People looking at Mantra will want to study its growth path, active user role, and wider adoption before making any long-term move. Its mix of features and ties to DeFi and real finance could make it a strong pick going forward. XRP: Designed for Fast Global Transactions XRP helps move money across borders quickly and with fewer fees. It’s the base of RippleNet, a payment system made for speed and scale. Unlike banks using slow tools like SWIFT, XRP allows faster and cheaper transfers between countries. Its system is built differently from most cryptocurrencies, which has led to talks about how it should be classified. Still, XRP’s tech works well for solving real problems in global payments, which keeps it high on the list of top trending cryptos in 2025. Open-source coding and a clear goal to ease money movement across countries make XRP a project worth watching. For those following coins focused on global use, XRP may be a clear option. Which Top Trending Crypto to Buy Right Now? The crypto space offers many choices, but a few stand out due to strong use cases and clear paths forward. Litecoin has stood the test of time by offering fast and affordable transfers, making it a trusted pick. Mantra takes a smart step by combining DeFi tools with the finance world people already know. Its growth in RWA and service features give it a long-term appeal. XRP’s role in changing how global payments are made gives it solid ground in the top trending cryptos in 2025. Even with these strong names, BlockDAG may have the biggest leap ahead. Its presale passing $205 million, major exchange plans, and upcoming mainnet make it one to watch closely. Few batches remain, and with each one, the price is expected to rise. This mix of timing and strong tech places BlockDAG firmly among the t op trending cryptos in 2025 .

Pseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 244,300 followers on the social media platform X that he expects meme tokens to eventually take center stage, highlighting that the crypto sector relies on trader attention. But while the analyst believes that memecoins will make a comeback, he says those that have been around longer than others will likely lead the surge. One asset on his radar is the Solana ( SOL )-based token Bonk ( BONK ). “Most memes got smashed overall but I think that they’ll eventually come back to some degree. Memes by nature are attention driven but I do think that some of the more ‘Lindy’ ones will have a better chance You probably just go off ecosystem. When SOL is hot, coins like BONK are going to be decent bets (along with some others like Fartcoin and WIF and others). BONK being down 85% from highs to lows probably makes it an ok bet down here (I have a bag of it).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X The trader is referring to the Lindy Effect, a concept suggesting that the longer something has survived, the longer it’s likely to keep surviving. At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.000012. Another memecoin on the trader’s roster is the Ethereum ( ETH )-based token Pepe ( PEPE ). “Feels like PEPE is also around a bottom, too. PEPE obviously an ETH beta but it’s also a good one if BTC starts going wild in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that PEPE would either rally to a high of $0.000015 or collapse to a new 2025 low of $0.000001. At time of writing, PEPE is trading for $0.000007.

Currently though, the market price of DOGE and Pepe Coin is seeking to stabilize but Remittixis performing impressively as it has yielded over 300% returns for early investors positioning it as currently one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Dogecoin Price Is Struggling To Find Footing In 2025 While DOGE began as a joke crypto coin, the currency has cemented its longevity in the top 10 altcoin list by boasting a market capitalization of more than $25 billion. Now trading at $0.17 , Dogecoin has seen modest gains of 2% in the past 24 hours on the back of a broader market rebound following a few weeks of bearish downturns. Some technical analysts have observed that the price of Dogecoin shows downtrend potential under intense resistance causing bearish effects as its EMAs cross paths and trading volume declines rapidly. Other analysts think DOGE shows signs of an upcoming price increase through its formation of an ascending triangle pattern. The price is expected to increase based on the anticipated movement from point AB to point CD and should hit highs of $0.59 in Q3 2025. Overall, the consensus remains that DOGE's reliance on fan-driven hype makes it vulnerable to change in market sentiment and limits its long-term growth potential compared to utility-driven ventures like Remittix . Pepe Coin Is Riding The Meme Wave; Will It Outperform Utility Tokens Like Remittix? Pepe Coin has emerged as one of the most talked-about meme coins in recent weeks, following its 22% price surge in the past 14 days which was brought about by its nostalgic appeal and viral marketing campaigns. With a price of $0.0000073, Pepe Coin sits at number 42 on the list of cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $3 Billion. While analysts project Pepe to reach $0.000026 by mid-2025 should its user base continue to grow, its lack of tangible use cases taints its long-term viability. Like Dogecoin, the success of Pepe Coin relies on maintaining its meme coin value through hype while not offering functional solutions a stark contrast to what Remittix is set to offer the Defi space. Remittix: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments The predictions for Dogecoin price show growth potential while Pepe Coin maintains its position in meme coin speculation but Remittix stands as a unique investment option combining functional benefits with explosive profit. The main distinction of Remittix arises from its aggressive approach in applying blockchain solutions to concrete business utility by providing rapid international money transfers. In contrast to hype-dependent speculative meme coins, Remittix has innovation and utility embedded within it and is a distinctive project in today's saturated new ICO market. Remittixpresale has been nothing but phenomenal and has generated a staggering $13.9 million to date. Trading at $0.0734 per RTX token at the current stage, the presale is a worthwhile entry for those seeking early adopter exponential growth potential. Industry experts forecast the RTX token will see an exponential leap increasing up to 800% by the end of the token presale with further gains anticipated in subsequent months after release and listing on top crypto exchanges.

With growing market optimism following the recent Fed rate pause, speculative BTC traders deployed increased leverage over the weekend. Will BTC advance above $90,000, or will it reverse to $80,000 in the week ahead? Bitcoin (BTC) Retakes $85,500 After Three-Day Consolidation After a prolonged consolidation phase, Bitcoin (BTC) made a major recovery bounce on Sunday. Following Trump’s appearance at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit, many short-term traders opted to take profits on their BTC holdings. Despite the decline, Bitcoin continues to find buyers, as the recent U.S. Fed rate pause announced on Wednesday prompted macro-sensitive capital to flow toward risky assets. Bitcoin price action, March, 24 2025 Bullish tailwinds from the Fed rate pause counteracted the downward pressure from profit-taking, leading to a three-day stalemate at the $84,000 level since Thursday. However, as sell-side pressure subsided, BTC price recorded a major breakout above $86,000 on Sunday, March 23. The chart above shows how BTC rose 2.6%, hitting a daily peak of $85,600. BTC Options Volume nears $800M as Whales Return After Fed Rate Pause Bitcoin price demonstrated remarkable resilience consolidating around $84,000 over the past three days, as macro-sensitive institutional investors reassess their stance on U.S. economic policies. Earlier this month, fears of inflationary pressure from Trump’s proposed tariffs triggered a cautious retreat from risk assets, including Bitcoin. However, with recent CPI and PPI reports showing inflation cooling and the Federal Reserve opting to pause rate hikes, large investors appear to be re-entering the market. This shift in sentiment is reflected in broader financial markets. The S&P 500 surged by 32 points following the Fed rate pause, signalling renewed risk appetite. As Bitcoin mirrors this trend, it has seen a sharp uptick in speculative trading activity from large investors. Validating this stance, Coinglass derivatives market data shows BTC’s options trading volume skyrocketed 24% in the last 24 hours, pushing total volume above $793 million. Bitcoin Derivatives Market Analysis, March 24 | Coinglass What Does 24% Options Trading Surge Mean for Bitcoin Price Action This Week? Options trading is a derivatives market strategy that allows traders to bet on the future price movements of an asset without directly purchasing it. This technique is particularly popular among institutional investors and whales because leverage enables traders to control large positions with relatively small capital, amplifying returns, especially during periods of market volatility. Given that options trading volume surged 24% over the last day, it suggests that whales and institutional investors are taking bullish positions on BTC’s near-term price movements. Why is BTC Options Volume Rising? The renewed interest in BTC options trading aligns with key macroeconomic narratives: Fed Rate Pause Fuels Risk Appetite – With the Fed pausing rate hikes, liquidity-sensitive assets like Bitcoin become more attractive. S&P 500 Rally Indicates Broader Market Confidence – TradFi investors reallocating capital to stocks may also be expanding exposure to BTC. Altcoin Season Rotation – With BTC holding steady above $85,000, traders are betting on volatility to capture short-term gains. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Data Supports Bullish Outlook, But $90K Flip Unlikely Beyond options trading, other key metrics reinforce a positive BTC outlook for the week ahead: Open Interest Rose 3.88% to $54.04B – A sign that new capital is entering the derivatives market. Long/Short Ratio at 1.28 on OKX & 1.2217 on Binance – Indicates more traders are placing long bets. Liquidations Favor Shorts – Over the last 12 hours, $14.2M in short positions were wiped out, compared to just $2.82M in longs. With Bitcoin showing strong demand above $86,000 and institutional investors actively positioning through options, a bullish breakout toward $90,000 remains a distinct possibility. However, signals on the daily Bitcoin price forecast charts below suggest the rally could face significant resistance below the $90,000 mark. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTCUSD Technical Indicators Signal $90,000 Resistance Despite these bullish signals, the technical chart presents a nuanced picture. While Bitcoin has reclaimed $85,600, the looming death cross—where the 50-day moving average trends below the 200-day moving average—remains a cause for concern. This bearish formation suggests that unless BTC can decisively break above $87,200, a retracement toward the $80,000 region remains plausible. Bulls must clear this key resistance zone to sustain momentum toward $90,000. If BTC fails to establish support above $87,200, bears could regain control, triggering a potential pullback.

At the same time, attention turns to a new DeFi project that offers real solutions to crypto payment challenges. It may help many people who struggle with traditional banking by offering faster, safer ways to send money. Many now call it one of the best cryptos to buy. Shiba Inu Price Prediction and Trends Recent data shows that SHIB has seen fluctuations over the past month. The current Shiba Inu price prediction reports a slight dip, but increased whale activity may signal a turn around soon. Technical indicators point to a potential rebound if the market finds a steady base. Analysts who follow Shiba Inu price prediction note that heavy selling by whales may soon turn to accumulation. Some Shiba Inu price prediction reports show that if whales buy more, SHIB could recover and even grow by 97.14% to $0.00002562 by March 28. The coin still enjoys a vibrant community and strong online interest, which many believe will help its price bounce back.

Several positive indicators suggest a rise toward the $5,000 ETH price level. However, the path to this success faces challenges because experts predict Remittix (RTX) will perform better than Ethereum's most ambitious expectations. Retesting a Multi-Year Ascending Support Ethereum has displayed strong resistance over the years. Previous market surges of more than 1,400% and 270% from this technical structure have occurred following the LUNA collapse and the Bybit hack events. Observers of Ethereum's bullish sentiment have valid reasons to be optimistic due to the historical reliability of this trendline despite current market skepticism. This strong level serves as a launchpad which allows Ethereum to generate a positive technical indicator. Analysts predict that ETH overcoming mid-$2,000 resistance zones would enable a quick rising trend towards $3,000, $4,000 or even $5,000. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported during March that whale accumulation of ETH experienced a substantial boost as big players purchased 120,000 Ether worth approximately $236 million throughout three days. Another whale bought approximately 7,000 ETH worth $13.8 million. The large whale purchases indicate widespread enthusiasm because investors small and large view Ethereum as a platform that will persist into the future. Analysts from Standard Chartered predict that ETH may reach $4,000 by 2025 regardless of their previous $10,000 projection. The Road to $5K: Resistance Levels Ahead Despite the renewed optimism, Ethereum still faces stiff resistance at various price checkpoints. The price movement took ETH from 1,825 to 1,940 before reaching $2,061 but selling activity triggered a reversal below the $2,000 mark. The token is currently trading at $1,997. source: coingecko.com The price mechanics alone will not determine if or when ETH can begin its serious push for $5000 because broader market trends will also impact this situation. The crypto market experiences fluctuations driven by both macroeconomic factors and governmental changes that create quick changes in market sentiment. Why Remittix Could Outshine Ethereum’s Ambitions Remittix (RTX) has recently caught significant attention because researchers believe this project might generate superior returns than the upcoming Ethereum rally. Remittix has achieved a successful fundraising round that exceeded $14 million through selling 521 million coins at a price of $0.0734 each. This token addresses a worldwide market need of streamlining international payment systems which positions it to resolve problems affecting many global users while processing huge worldwide remittance flows. Remittix aims to reach an extensive market segment which Ethereum did previously when it established its blockchain applications during its early development phase. The company should succeed in delivering affordable digital remittance services supported by dependable performance to quickly acquire users from both retail and institutional client bases. RTX token prices should follow the pattern of initial Ethereum price growth during its period of rapid expansion. Remittix Holds the Real Key to Growth Despite Ethereum’s solid foundations supported by technology infrastructure and large investor presence there is still a chance new market entrants will seize a significant portion of investors' attention more quickly than Ethereum can achieve its potential $5,000 price target. Remittix(RTX) aims to transform the vast untapped remittance industry by focusing on a market that needs transformation. The main distinction between Remittix and Ethereum exists in its total dedication to address real-life problems rather than resolving consensus models or Layer-2 separation issues. Those who want to capitalize on upcoming crypto developments should consider investing in Remittixinstead of traditional Ethereum because the company represents exciting changes in blockchain technology.

TRX, which has recovered about 10% from its weekend low of $0.22; is still struggling with the $0.25 resistance level, last transferring at $0.232. Although during October prices rose but technical indicators suggest only weak buying as the On-Balance Volume (OBV) has not confirmed the recent price rise. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s almost-blank performance adds to the uncertainty, which could lead TRX to sink into a downward spiral. Investors are seeking alternatives as uncertainty surrounds the markets, and the decentralized lending ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been attracting significant interest, a sub-$0.05 token boasting presale momentum and a structured growth model. TRX’s Technical Ceiling Enhanced The inability of TRX to break through $0.25 is the result of two rejections at this psychological level. For weeks, the token has been stuck in an oscillation between $0.22 and $0.2745, where $0.248 is an obstinate point of resistance in the middle. Not even a swift 10% recovery on March 19th was enough to breach this ceiling, a sign that bullish conviction was waning. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains close to 50, indicating indecision, while liquidation heatmaps suggest $0.25 is a particularly high-risk area. A push toward this level TD maybe trigger the automated sell-off, bringing TRX back into its lower range. It risks being kicked out of the crypto elite if it fails to deliver a decisive breakout, analysts caution. Whales Shift Towards Presale Investments With TRX still stagnating, investors are diversifying into emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now in Phase 3 of its presale. Current token price of $0.02, growing to $4.5 million raised with over 6,400 holders and a massive +60% of Phase 3 tokens already claimed. Stage two will raise the price to $0.025 — a 25 percent increase — giving existing buyers an instant paper gain of 200 percent when it launches at $0.06. In addition to outlining their projections, analysts have predicted that with its revenue-sharing model and token buybacks, MUTM could be worth $3.50 or higher by late 2025. This potential 17,400% return stands in stark contrast to TRX’s stagnant outlook, which explains the accelerating capital shift. The Strategic Framework of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance presents a self-reinforcing ecosystem. Its platform allows for decentralized lending, where users can deposit assets (such as ETH or stablecoins) in return for interest-yielding mtTokens. Some protocol fees go to automatic MUTM buybacks redistributing tokens to long-term stakers. This method minimizes the sell pressure while maintaining demand, creating a cycle of scarcity and appreciation. Moreover, the team is in the final stages of a smart contract audit with CertiK, a landmark step anticipated to enhance investor confidence. Results will be revealed through social channels, further aligning with Mutuum’s ethos around transparency. Timing the Presale Window The rapid sell-out in Phase 3 indicates urgency, with the $0.02 entry point evaporating with the tokens. By gaining early participation, investors can not only secure better rates but also prepare for the imminent launch, which will help pump the project’s visibility with listing exchanges. The project’s tokenomics — capped supply and buyback-driven scarcity — implies post-launch supply squeeze, a catalyst for rapid price discovery. For example, a $500 investment today could become $17,500 in junction price ($3.50) a potential if MUTM hits $3.50 — Something some compare to early adopters of Eth.

Its presale model and clear metrics such as the CertiK audit reduce speculative risk compared to memes and aged stalwarts. As to whales look for alternatives that can offer stability and exponential upside, MUTM´s sub-$0.05 valuation sets it up as the ideal entry point. Agility is the key to survival in the tireless evolution of the crypto market. TRX holders looking for diminishing returns now have a choice: stay in those for which returns are far from certain in 2025, or migrate to where this decentralized finance will be in 2025. While Mutuum Finance’s presale continues to be open to investors, the dwindling of Phase 3 suggests hitting the brakes on access to the lowest pricing in the tranches.

As look toward 2025, three meme coins— Arctic Pablo Coin , Dogwifhat, and Ponke—are generating significant buzz. Each offers distinct narratives and potential for investors seeking the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: Bridging Myth and Reality – One of the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025 Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin presale ; it’s an adventurous journey inviting investors to explore the world’s hidden mysteries. As one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025, Arctic Pablo stands out with its unique blend of storytelling, financial potential, and an ever-growing community. At the heart of this project is the intrepid explorer Arctic Pablo, who embarks on expeditions to uncover mystical $APC coins. These shimmering tokens symbolize more than just currency; they represent a gateway to prosperity and potential, infused with the magic of forgotten lands. The presale structure of Arctic Pablo Coin is uniquely designed around Pablo’s travels. Instead of traditional stages, each presale phase is tied to a specific location, with the current being Nippy Nook, the 15th location. As of now, the price stands at $0.000079, with a final presale price set at $0.0008 and a launch price of $0.008. This structure not only adds an element of storytelling but also creates a sense of anticipation and excitement among investors. If you’re lucky enough to join now, you could be looking at a return on investment (ROI) of 10,027.85% once the coin hits the listing price of $0.008—just one of the reasons why it’s considered among the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Investing in Arctic Pablo offers significant potential returns. For instance, a $500 investment would yield approximately 6,328,430.00 APC tokens. Upon reaching the listing price of $0.008, this investment could balloon to $50,627.44 showcasing an impressive return on investment. With such high-profit potential, it’s no surprise that APC is gaining attention as one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. A deflationary mechanism is also in place, where unsold tokens are burned at the end of each week during the presale. This approach reduces the total supply, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens and fostering a deflationary environment. Arctic Pablo has strategically chosen the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for its robust platform, ensuring efficient and secure transactions. The project’s tokenomics are well-structured, with a total maximum supply of 221,200,000,000 APC tokens, allocated across presale, staking, ecosystem development, community rewards, and the team. In essence, Arctic Pablo combines an engaging narrative with solid financial incentives, making it a compelling choice for those seeking the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Dogwifhat: The Viral Sensation in the Solana Ecosystem Dogwifhat (WIF) has become one of the most talked-about meme coins in the Solana ecosystem, riding the wave of hype and community-driven momentum. With a market cap exceeding $500 million and a 24-hour trading volume surpassing $248 million, WIF continues to capture the attention of traders and meme coin enthusiasts alike. As the crypto market sees renewed interest in meme coins, Dogwifhat’s impressive rally and cult-like following make it a standout contender. With its viral appeal and growing liquidity, many investors are eyeing WIF as a potential high-reward play in the ever-evolving meme coin landscape. The success of Dogwifhat can be attributed to its strong community engagement and viral marketing strategies. Leveraging social media platforms, the project has created a buzz that resonates with Gen Z and Millennials, particularly in Australasia. Memes, challenges, and interactive content have fueled its popularity, making it more than just a cryptocurrency but a cultural phenomenon. Ponke: The Underdog with Growing Momentum Ponke (PONKE) is a rapidly emerging meme coin on the Solana blockchain, boasting a market cap of $56.5 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $10.68 million. With a total and max supply of 555.55 million tokens, Ponke has demonstrated impressive volatility, surging over 4,411% from its all-time low of $0.002254. Despite an 87.9% decline from its all-time high of $0.8409, the coin maintains strong momentum, backed by an active community and viral social media presence. The project thrives on user engagement, offering features like the “helmet” utility for its holders and leveraging influencer-driven hype. With increasing liquidity and exchange listings, Ponke continues to position itself as a top contender in the meme coin space, drawing comparisons to major players like PEPE and DOGE. Ponke’s appeal lies in its community-centric approach. The project has cultivated a loyal following by engaging users through interactive campaigns, meme contests, and collaborations with influencers. This strategy has not only increased its visibility but also fostered a sense of ownership and participation among holders.

Right now, it’s at Nippy Nook, the 15th location, with a presale price of $0.000079. The price increases every week, and unsold tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply. Over $1.96 million has already been raised, and the listing price is set at $0.008, offering massive upside potential. 3. Is Dogwifhat (WIF) still a good investment in 2025?

After the presale, any remaining unsold tokens will also be burned, making the tokenomics even stronger for long-term holders. The post Low Price, High Gains!

The start of 2025 has been troubling, particularly in Europe, where Tesla saw a 45% drop in new registrations in January compared to the same period in 2024, with further declines in February. While the sales rose by 21% in the UK and Australia, shipments of Chinese-made cars in China fell by more than 49%. In March, a Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, Joseph Spak, published a research note predicting a decrease of 5% in Tesla’s sales around the world. Despite the 10% growth expectations, Spak’s forecast triggered a negative reaction in the stock market, causing Tesla’s share price to drop. There can be many other reasons for the fall in Tesla sales. People working with Tesla already expected this drop as the company headed toward the launch of the new Model Y with customers waiting for the latest version. However, research by Morning Consult Intelligence, a brand monitoring firm, says that Musk’s actions have harmed Tesla significantly in Europe and Canada. It also acknowledges the Chinese market remains crucial for Tesla’s success despite the backlash elsewhere. In reality, the recent decline only wiped out a huge rally Tesla experienced right after the election, which nearly doubled its market valuation. In the U.S., the situation seems a bit more complicated. Sure, a lot of consumers seem to be on board with DOGE cuts in government spending. But there’s a catch, “Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.” Tesla’s problems go way beyond how the public views Musk. Prof. Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University’s Centre for Automotive Industry Research told BBC “We’ve not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.” The competition is coming from all directions. Traditional carmakers have been pouring money into electric vehicles, with companies like Kia and Hyundai building a strong reputation for reliable, high-quality EVs. Meanwhile, China is making serious moves. Brands like BYD are expanding rapidly by offering well-performing cars at affordable prices. And then you have higher-end players like Xpeng and Nio, which are all about luxury and advanced tech. Judging from Musk’s comments during Tesla’s earnings calls, he seems much more focused on the robotaxi vision than anything else. Back in January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service up and running in Texas by June. But skeptics were quick to respond, pointing out that Musk has been making these kinds of promises for years. In 2019, he said that within a year, there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of working as robotaxis. Yet Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” package still requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and stay alert. “Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,” says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy. Tesla needs solid leadership, but Musk’s hands are clearly full. Apart from running Tesla, Musk is also deeply involved in his social media platform X, artificial intelligence firm xAI, and SpaceX, which has had a couple of setbacks with its massive Starship rocket recently. When Fox Business asked him how he was managing all these responsibilities, Musk admitted it was “with great difficulty.” “It’s hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,” says Prof. Wells. “If he’s making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.” Despite all this, Musk’s position at Tesla seems untouchable. He’s the company’s largest shareholder, owning about 13% of the stock, which is worth over $95 billion. That’s nearly the same amount held by investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock combined. Other financial players like State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley also have smaller stakes. Sure, Tesla’s recent drop in share price probably wasn’t fun for those investors. But if you look at the big picture, the stock is still about 30% higher than it was a year ago. In reality, the recent decline only wiped out a huge rally Tesla experienced right after the election, which nearly doubled its market valuation. Musk should hand over Tesla to new leadership. Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings. That’s way higher than other car companies like Ford, General Motors, or Toyota. And the reason? Shareholders are still banking on Tesla’s technological breakthroughs and explosive growth. For now, none of the big investors are calling for major changes. But Ross Gerber, a longtime shareholder who’s turned into one of Musk’s most outspoken critics, recently said Musk should step down. Analysts tend to agree that a leadership change could be beneficial. “A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,” says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research. “It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.” Prof. Wells adds, “I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalize the business. It needs a significant change of direction now.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

For the first time, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are officially recognized in global economic reports. However, this sparked a wave of discussion in the crypto community where many claimed that the IMF had referred to Bitcoin as “digital gold.”This quickly caught the attention of many in the space, fueling debates and speculation across social media. However, Dennis Porter, a well-known voice in the space, quickly questioned this interpretation, asking, “Can anyone point to exactly where the IMF says Bitcoin is ‘digital gold’?” Dennis Clarifies The Confusion After diving into the IMF’s statement , Dennis clarified the source of the confusion. The IMF actually referred to Bitcoin as a “new digital asset designed to be used as a means of payment or act as a store of value.” Ok I’ve tracked down why people are claiming the IMF said Bitcoin is digital gold. “new digital assets designed to be used as a means of payment or act as a store of value.” This is a massive stretch to jump to: “IMF says bitcoin is digital gold”. The key phrase is… https://t.co/2bWMbIdRgK pic.twitter.com/wEm7ht62CZ — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) March 23, 2025 He remarked that the phrase “designed to be” is crucial here and it doesn’t necessarily mean that the IMF is officially endorsing Bitcoin as “digital gold” or guaranteeing its stability or value like gold. It’s more about recognizing Bitcoin’s potential, not confirming it as a proven asset. The “store of value” idea for Bitcoin is debated due to its volatility. Unlike gold, which has a long history of stability, Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate significantly. IMF Provides Guidelines on Tracking Digital Assets The IMF’s latest update to the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7) now includes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) in its global economic framework. This is the first time the IMF has provided clear guidelines on how digital assets should be tracked in global financial stats, marking a big step for crypto in the financial world. Cryptos like Bitcoin are classified as non-productive capital assets, while stablecoins are treated as financial instruments. The update also changes how cross-border crypto transactions, staking, and mining are tracked, with mining and staking now recorded as services in a country’s computer services exports/imports. This update is a big step in officially recognizing digital assets as part of the global economy, helping to track and regulate them better in the future.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 01:42:36

One of the tokens currently drawing interest from both early-stage investors and analysts is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). While still in its presale phase, the protocol has already gained traction—not just for its fundraising numbers but for the potential upside that experts say could carry it all the way to the $1 mark. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that emphasizes non-custodial control and real on-chain functionality. The idea is simple: users deposit their crypto assets into liquidity pools, earning passive income while borrowers can access those funds by providing overcollateralized assets. All of this happens through smart contracts, with no need for intermediaries, and complete transparency at every step. What separates Mutuum from many early-stage tokens is the level of focus on functionality. The platform is set up to allow both passive earners and borrowers to engage in DeFi in a way that doesn’t compromise ownership. Lenders receive mtTokens in return for their deposits, which not only represent their share in the pool but also increase in value over time as interest accrues. These mtTokens are ERC20-compliant and can be transferred, traded, or used in other DeFi applications—offering flexibility for users who want more than just a locked position. Another key feature is the upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted directly through the Mutuum lending protocol, allowing users to access liquidity without selling their original assets. It adds another layer of utility while reinforcing demand for the platform itself. Since interest from these stablecoin loans feeds directly into the protocol’s treasury, it also supports long-term stability and value growth for the ecosystem. So why are experts increasingly bullish on MUTM’s price potential? A few reasons stand out. First, the presale momentum has been impressive—Mutuum has already raised over $4.5 million, and more than 6,300 holders have joined the project during its early stages. Currently, in Phase 3, the token is priced at $0.02 and will launch at $0.06. That alone offers early investors a 3x return out of the gate. But more than that, the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform around the time the token goes live. This is critical because it means the token’s utility won’t be based on future promises—it will be tied to an active product from day one. That alignment between launch and functionality is a major reason why many in the crypto space believe MUTM isn’t just another presale token—it’s a DeFi protocol with room to scale. Shortly after its launch, analysts expect the token to trade between $0.21 and $0.28, already showing strong price movement. But in the weeks that follow, projections go even further. Experts suggest that MUTM will reach $1 as the platform gains more traction and user adoption increases. For those buying in at the current $0.02 price, this would represent a 50x return—a rare opportunity in today’s more competitive and cautious market. The presale is expected to sell out quickly, especially given how fast earlier phases have progressed. With strong early adoption, clear communication from the team, and real utility backing the token, the demand isn’t surprising. It’s not just hype that’s driving attention—it’s the structure, the timing, and the execution. As more eyes turn to the DeFi space in search of projects that combine usability with growth, Mutuum Finance is making its case. With key milestones approaching and a working product on the horizon, the $1 prediction doesn’t feel out of reach—it feels like a matter of time.

For BDAG, March brings several powerful shifts that strengthen its long-term future. Beta Testnet Arrives in March The beta testnet goes live this month, offering the first full test of BlockDAG’s parallel chain setup. Compared to slower platforms like Ethereum, BDAG’s design handles high traffic without delays. Backed by SpaceDev This partnership is more than a tech move. SpaceDev will support BDAG with advanced upgrades, aiming to improve system strength and user adoption. HackerEarth Hackathon Launched BlockDAG aims to grow a large developer base. Through major hackathons, it is bringing in global Web3 talent to create useful apps that will raise BDAG’s demand. Third Keynote Update After the success of the last two, the upcoming Keynote 3 is expected to unveil new roadmap plans. Previous keynotes have always sparked fresh interest—and this one could have a greater effect. Early BDAG Buyers Have Strong Return Potential Let’s look at the expected returns with clear numbers. BDAG sells for $0.0248 in batch 27. Some experts believe BDAG could reach $1 after it goes live—a 40x gain. Putting in $1,000 today would get roughly 40,000 BDAG. If BDAG reaches $1, that turns into $40,000. This reminds many of Solana, which started near $0.22 and jumped above $250. BDAG may follow a similar track but with quicker growth signals. Key Factors That May Push BDAG to $1 Over 10 CEX Listings—Access to major exchanges means more people can trade, pushing demand up. Limited Supply Structure—BDAG’s setup limits supply, so higher demand could drive price increases. Growing Crowd Interest—Both large-scale and casual buyers are getting involved, and broader attention could lift prices quickly. Final Words! Big updates this month give BDAG an edge, but the highest returns are likely for those who act early. The beta testnet, strong technical support, and near-future listings all signal major changes ahead. Waiting might mean paying 5x, 10x, or even 20x more per coin. For those watching closely, this could be the time BDAG breaks through—like Solana or Avalanche once did.

Qubetics Presale is Your Next Big Chance—Get in on the Top Altcoin Presale of 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bitcoin-cashs-boom-qubetics-presale-is-your-next-big-chance-get-in-on-the-top-altcoin-presale-of-2025/,"The cryptocurrency market has been an absolute rollercoaster lately. From Bitcoin hitting new highs to altcoins skyrocketing with innovative tech, it’s been a non-stop adventure. But here’s the kicker: not everyone caught the early train to profit-town. Whether it was too much uncertainty or simply missing the boat, opportunities have been missed, and some are left scrambling. If you’re feeling like you missed your shot at a big payday with some altcoins, you’re not alone. The truth is, many people passed on Bitcoin Cash, and now it’s too late to scoop up a massive return on that one. But don’t sweat it – there’s a new kid on the block. Qubetics ($TICS) is currently going through an exciting presale phase, and the buzz surrounding this project is something you don’t want to sleep on. Its presale is already in its 27th stage, and the response has been insane. Over 502 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $15.3 million with 23,500+ holders jumping on board. With analysts predicting massive returns after the presale, Qubetics might just be the chance to turn missed opportunities into winning ones. So, let’s dive in and take a look at why Qubetics is the altcoin presale that’s too good to ignore. Bitcoin Cash Coin: A Missed Opportunity Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had its time to shine. Back in 2017, it was one of the top contenders to become the go-to digital currency for everyday transactions. Bitcoin Cash split from Bitcoin due to disagreements over scaling solutions, and its goal was clear: make Bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. For a while, it seemed like BCH could potentially overtake Bitcoin itself, with many crypto enthusiasts touting it as the future of digital cash. However, as time passed, it became clear that Bitcoin Cash couldn’t quite live up to the hype. Its use case, while solid, didn’t evolve fast enough. Competing technologies like Ethereum and newer platforms started to steal the spotlight with their smart contract capabilities and scalability solutions. The market began to see Bitcoin Cash as a “nostalgic” crypto option, more of a historical token than a futuristic one. While BCH still has its place in the market, the window for massive gains is largely closed. It’s a missed opportunity for those who couldn’t jump on board when it was hot. In the crypto space, timing is everything. A few years ago, Bitcoin Cash had the potential for massive returns, but now, for the average crypto enthusiast, it’s like trying to catch lightning in a bottle. There are new projects on the horizon, and many are more innovative, adaptable, and prepared for the future of crypto than BCH ever was. And here’s where Qubetics comes in: it’s offering something Bitcoin Cash never could – real-world applications and huge ROI potential that’s far from tapped out. Qubetics: Still Available and Ready for Action You’ve probably heard whispers about Qubetics ($TICS), and now it’s time to get the lowdown. Right now, this altcoin is in the 27th stage of its presale, and analysts are hyping it up for good reason. As of now, $TICS is priced at $0.1300 per token. The presale is raking in serious money, with over $15.3 million raised and more than 23,500 holders jumping on board. But here’s the thing: there’s still time to get in early, and the price is expected to explode. The real kicker with Qubetics is the sheer promise it holds. Unlike many altcoins that are all talk and no action, Qubetics is set to revolutionize the world of Real World Asset Tokenization (RWAT). In simple terms, Qubetics is aiming to take real-world assets – like real estate, commodities, and even artwork – and tokenize them on the blockchain. This means individuals and businesses can buy, sell, and trade ownership in things like properties and valuable assets with the transparency and security of blockchain technology. So, what does this mean for everyday folks? Let’s break it down. Imagine you’re a small business owner looking to raise capital but don’t want to deal with the headaches of traditional financing methods. With Qubetics, you could tokenize your business’s assets, making it easier to access funding while providing more security and potential for future growth. Or think about the average person who wants to own a piece of luxury real estate but doesn’t have the full cash flow to buy a property outright. Qubetics lets them purchase fractional ownership in that property through tokenization. No more waiting for a miracle investment opportunity – Qubetics offers an affordable, secure, and efficient way to make significant investments possible for everyone. Now, consider the massive return potential of $TICS. Analysts predict that after the presale, the token could skyrocket to $1, giving early adopters a 669% ROI. But that’s not all – experts are predicting it could hit $5 post-presale, offering a jaw-dropping 3745% ROI. And the best part? Once the mainnet launches, the $TICS token could go as high as $15, offering a mind-blowing 11,436% return. The presale is moving fast, so if you’re still sitting on the sidelines, it’s time to get serious about your crypto future. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy in 2025: Qubetics is the One So, let’s face it – there are a ton of cryptos out there, and it can be tough to pick the right one to buy in 2025. From DeFi projects to meme coins, there’s no shortage of choices. But here’s the thing: not all of them have staying power. Many coins will fizzle out or fail to deliver on their promises. When it comes to identifying which altcoin presale is the real deal, it’s all about finding a project with a solid use case, scalability, and massive upside potential. That’s where Qubetics checks all the boxes. Think about it: the crypto space has seen some solid growth, but it’s still stuck in a lot of legacy thinking. Traditional investment options, like real estate, haven’t evolved to the same degree. The world is shifting toward tokenization, and Qubetics is right at the forefront of that shift. What makes this project stand out from others in the crypto presale space is its potential to solve real-world problems. Tokenizing assets like real estate and luxury goods isn’t just an idea; it’s a tangible solution that’s going to change the way people think about ownership and investment. Qubetics isn’t just some moonshot – it’s a project that addresses actual pain points in the global economy. People have been craving solutions to fractional ownership, transparency, and liquidity in the asset space, and Qubetics is answering that call. And when it comes to the presale, there’s still time to grab $TICS at a low price before it potentially shoots up after the mainnet launch. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Qubetics Presale If you’ve been sleeping on the idea of getting involved in a top altcoin presale , Qubetics ($TICS) is the one to wake up to. With its revolutionary approach to Real World Asset Tokenization, it’s positioning itself to be a major player in 2025 and beyond. The presale is in full swing, with over $15 million raised, and the $TICS token price is expected to soar once the presale ends. Analysts predict massive returns, and with real-world use cases that solve actual problems, there’s no reason to sit this one out. Now’s the time to act. Qubetics is poised for a breakout, and missing out on this presale could mean missing a huge opportunity. So, jump in while the price is still low, and don’t let another top altcoin presale slip through your fingers.

The scam involved the fraudsters contacting victims and earning trust before directing them to websites masquerading as legitimate crypto investment platforms, Virginia’s Eastern District US Attorney’s Office said in a March 21 statement. Once victims made a deposit, the funds were funneled through over 75 bank accounts under the names of shell companies, then sent abroad “deceptively characterized” as domestic wires, despite being transferred to a bank outside the US. Source: US Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of Virginia “The sites falsely represented to the victims that their investments were making sizeable gains,” Virginia’s US Attorney’s Office added in its statement. “When victims would attempt to make withdrawals, the perpetrators would coerce the victims to send even more money using tactics such as claiming the victims owed taxes on their purported profits.” The United States Secret Service seized some of the stolen funds from a foreign bank in 2023 and began the civil forfeiture action by filing a claim in a US District Court. However, the bank also made a claim against the cash, and the US authorities eventually reached a settlement agreement for $7 million of the seized funds. Victims of the scam have been urged to contact the Secret Service to petition to recover their losses.

Gordon added that a cut could sway people to put their savings into shares of local companies, which could then spark other firms to go public in the UK and help the economy. In comparison, she called crypto “a non-productive asset” that “doesn’t feed back into the economy.” “Equities provide growth capital to companies that employ people, innovate and pay corporation tax. That is a social contract. We shouldn’t be afraid of advocating for that.” The country’s Financial Conduct Authority said in November that crypto ownership rose to 12% of adults, equivalent to around 7 million people. A majority of crypto owners, 36%, were under the age of 55 years old. Gordon said that many had “shifted to saving rather than investing,” which she claimed “is not going to fund a viable retirement.” A 2022 FCA survey found that 70% of adults had a savings account, while 38% either directly held shares or held them through an account allowing nearly 20,000 British pounds ($26,000) of tax-free savings a year — around three in four 18-24 years olds held no investments. A quarter of 18-25 year olds and a third of 25-44 year olds held any investment in 2022. Source: FCA But in a follow-up survey, the regulator reported that in the 12 months to January 2024, the cost of living crisis had seen 44% of all adults either stop or reduce saving or investing, while nearly a quarter used savings or sold their investments to cover day-to-day costs. Gordon is a member of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce, a group of industry executives aiming to revive the local market, which Cavendish would benefit from as it advises companies on how to navigate possible public offerings. Related: Will new US SEC rules bring crypto companies onshore? Consulting giant EY reported in January that the London stock market had one of its “quietest years on record,” with just 18 companies listing last year, down from 23 in 2023. At the same time, EY said 88 companies delisted or transferred from the exchange, with many saying they moved due to “declining liquidity and lower valuations compared to other markets” such as the US. However, Gordon claimed the UK is a “safe haven” compared to markets such as the US, which has lost trillions of dollars in its stock markets due to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and fears of a recession. Crypto markets have also slumped alongside US equities, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) trading down 11% over the past 30 days and struggling to maintain support above $85,000 since early March. In the past 24 hours, at least, Bitcoin is up 2%, trading around $85,640.

In 2022, the Treasury blacklisted Tornado Cash for its role in laundering $455 million stolen by the Lazarus hacking group. The Move Sparks Criticism From Grewal But the move has sparked strong backlash. In a latest X post, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, has publicly criticized the U.S. Treasury for its handling of Tornado Cash’s delisting. He argues that the Treasury is wrongly trying to avoid a final court decision. Grewal is criticizing the U.S. Treasury for continuing legal actions against Tornado Cash, even after it was removed from the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. The Treasury now claims that a final court decision is unnecessary, but Grewal argues that this is against legal procedures. Relying on that decision, the Fifth Circuit rejected an agency’s argument that its withdrawal of a determination “unilaterally and avoid judicial review” did not moot the case, because the agency could decide to revisit the decision and issue a similar determination against the… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 23, 2025 He shared that this is only valid if the defendant can prove the issue won’t happen again. He also mentioned past cases where sanctions were lifted but the case stayed open, allowing them to be reimposed later. “Here, Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from the SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again. That’s not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,” noted Grewal. Grewal’s criticism comes during a long legal battle where Tornado Cash users challenged the Treasury’s decision to add the mixer to the SDN list. The users argued that the smart contract didn’t qualify as property under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because it’s non-erasable. Although the court sided with the users, clarifying the status of the Tornado’s smart contract, despite this, Grewal criticized the Treasury for not fully following the court’s ruling. Coinbase, Ethereum Foundation Back Tornado Cash Tornado Cash has been supported by groups like Coinbase and the Ethereum Foundation, which are backing lead developer Alexey Pertsev’s defense. The legal battle has been intense, with supporters claiming the Treasury’s actions were unfair and lacked clear legal grounds. Lifting the sanctions against Tornado Cash is an important step in the ongoing debate over how crypto mixers should be regulated. The Treasury lifted them after reviewing legal issues but still expressed concern over North Korea’s use of digital assets for hacking and money laundering.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|ETH|ASIA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 02:53:54

The Federal Reserve signaled in its March 18-19 meeting that it would also “look past short-term inflationary pressures, laying the groundwork for potential future easing,” Thielen added. “Powell’s mildly dovish tone suggests that the Fed's put remains intact, providing further support for a recovery in stock prices.” 10x Research’s Bitcoin reversal indicators have turned bullish as a result, with Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) 21-day moving average now at $85,200, Thielen noted. Bitcoin’s bottoming formations over the last two years. Source: 10x Research He said these weekly reversal indicators have pulled back to levels where past bull markets have resumed, such as in September 2023 — spurred on by the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund narrative — and August 2024 as the US election neared. “In short, the technical backdrop has now reset to a point where a renewed uptrend could plausibly unfold.” Thielen also noted that several altcoins are already breaking out of their downtrend channels and trading at more “attractive levels.” Bitcoin is currently trading at $85,720, up 2.1% over the last 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. Meanwhile, Ether ( ETH ), Tron ( TRX ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ) have rebounded 4.3%, 6.4% and 8.9% respectively over the last week. The crypto research analyst, however, expects to see “significant resistance” at the $90,000 mark for Bitcoin, should it reach that level. Despite the more positive outlook, “no clear catalyst exists for an immediate parabolic rally” is in sight, Thielen said. Related: Bitcoin ‘in position’ for first key RSI breakout in 6 months at $85K He initially said Bitcoin wouldn’t drop below $73,000 — thereby avoiding a “deep bear market” — because the largest sum bracket of Bitcoin holders (wallets with 100-1000 Bitcoin) are likely family offices and wealth managers who are invested in Bitcoin for the long term. He also noted that the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs returned inflows for the first time last week since the last week of January. “We expect Bitcoin ETF selling from arbitrage-focused investors to wind down, as the arbitrage opportunities have primarily been closed for weeks,” Thielen added.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC , Nabiullina told journalists at a press conference that she wants to “ban settlements made in cryptocurrencies between residents” outside the so-called experimental legal regime (ELR). Russian Crypto Ban – Still on the Table? The ELR, policed by the Central Bank, is a regulatory sandbox that the bank uses to allow certain Russian firms to buy and sell goods, using crypto as a payment tool. The Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina speaking to journalists on March 21, 2025. (Source: Bank of Russia/Screenshot) The bank also appears to want to use the ELR as a mechanism for Russian crypto miners to sell their coins to global buyers. In recent days, the bank has suggested that it is prepared to allow “qualified investors” to trade crypto within the confines of the sandbox . But Nabiullina’s recent comments suggest she has lost none of her famous crypto-skepticism . The long-serving Governor has previously called for total bans on crypto exchanges and token trading . The bank even drafted a bill calling for a total ban on all forms of crypto trading and ownership, as well as crypto mining. Sanctions regimes have forced her to change her stand, however. With Russian companies and banks forced out of the SWIFT messaging network and dollar-denominated trade, many companies now use tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to trade with overseas partners.

These echo her previous calls to keep “private cryptocurrencies” out “of the Russian economy.” The Russian Central Bank. (Source: Bank of Russia/Screenshot) ‘Criminal Liability’ Nabiullina told journalists that Moscow should introduce criminal “liability” for anyone caught “violating the ban.” “We maintain our old position that cryptocurrencies should not be allowed as a means of payment. So we propose introducing a ban on settlements in cryptocurrencies between residents [of Russia] outside the ELR. We don’t only propose introducing a ban, but also establishing liability for violating the ban.” Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina Nabiullina claimed, however, that “it was time to take a step forward” in “relations with cryptocurrencies.” She said that Moscow must “build a regulatory environment” that would give “particularly qualified” investors the right to “invest in cryptocurrencies on the Russian market.” In recent days, some have suggested that the ELR could team up with the Moscow Exchange to launch crypto trading products for these “particularly qualified” investors.

The Russian state-run media agency TASS reported that the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Alexander Shokhin, wants the government to “analyze the prospects for using cryptocurrencies” after US President Donald Trump’s decision to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve . Shokhin said: “It seems that it has been agreed [in Moscow] that crypto can be used in cross-border settlements. After Trump said that the US will now become the crypto capital of the world and started accumulating crypto reserves – at least in Ethereum and Bitcoin – we also need to look at this somehow.” Alexander Shokhin, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. (Source: Moscow Financial Forum/YouTube/Screenshot) However, these comments will likely fall on deaf ears at the Central Bank. Nabiullina has previously stated that she “does not see any circumstances under which” cryptoassets “could end up in the reserves of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.” The Ministry of Finance, however, has expressed a more cautiously optimistic stance on the matter .

By March 14, 2025, XRP is being exchanged at around $2.31. Despite the fact that experts are very positive about the prospects of its future, the highest price scale forecast varies from $3.40 to $15, and the situation in which as impressive a rally as that of 2017 would take place again seems very far away. .

According to a Mar. 23 press release , Titan operates as a layer above standard DEX aggregators like Jupiter ( JUP ) and DFlow. To ensure traders receive the best price with no fees, it aggregates quotes from all available DEX aggregators rather than just sourcing liquidity from different DEXs. In addition to aggregation , Titan introduces Talos, a proprietary routing algorithm that, according to the press release, outperforms competitors 80% of the time. Compared to current Solana ( SOL ) solutions, Talos analyzes more liquidity sources and optimizes routing at a granular level to enhance trade execution. Quote slippage caused by execution delays is a major problem with on-chain swaps. Because Solana transactions take around 10 seconds (25 blocks) to complete, the price may fluctuate before the trade is executed. Titan wants to address this issue by continuously updating quotes in real-time to provide traders with the most accurate pricing. “Titan’s aim is to provide DeFi traders with the best possible prices while abstracting away the complexity involved. Today, crypto trading lags behind traditional markets in its order placement design. It’s time for us to upgrade our infrastructure and close this gap, and that’s what Titan is designed to do.” — Chris Chung, CEO and co-founder of Titan You might also like: Solana ETF set to debut in the U.S Titan previously raised $3.5 million in a September 2024 pre-seed round, backed by Round13 Digital Asset Fund and Beluga Labs. Solana is seeing record adoption alongside Titan’s launch. According to Ali Charts Mar. 22 post on X, the network now has over 11 million wallets holding SOL. Solana continues to lead in DEX trading volume , which hit a record $258 billion in January before cooling off to $105 billion in February amid a broader market downturn. Impressively, the stablecoin market cap on the network has grown to $12.36 billion, a three times increase from December 2024, according to DefiLlama data . Despite this growth, SOL’s price has seen volatility. It peaked at $298.31 in January before dipping to $118 on Mar. 11. The price has rebounded to $133 as of press time. With rising institutional interest, analysts speculate SOL could push toward the $300 mark in the coming months.

33767162,[object Object],1742787013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,$250-Million Bitcoin Whale Awakens After 8 Years – Massive Move Stirs Market,https://bitcoinist.com/250-million-bitcoin-whale-awakens-after-8-years-massive-move-stirs-market/,"Bitcoin continues to trade below key resistance levels as fears of a looming bear market grow across the crypto space. Investors are increasingly adopting a risk-off approach, driven by rising macroeconomic uncertainty and intensifying global trade war tensions. As equities and crypto markets face synchronized selling pressure, confidence is weakening among retail and institutional participants. Adding fuel to market speculation, Arkham Intelligence reported that a dormant Bitcoin whale—who has held BTC since late 2016—moved over $250 million worth of Bitcoin Friday night. This sudden transfer has sparked concerns about potential selling pressure, as large movements from long-term holders often precede market volatility. While on-chain analysts have yet to confirm whether the funds were sent to an exchange, the timing of the move amid heightened fear only adds to investor anxiety. The broader sentiment in the market is shifting, with many now questioning whether Bitcoin’s bull cycle has ended. Bulls must defend current demand zones and reclaim critical resistance to revive momentum. Until then, traders are bracing for continued sideways action—or worse, a further drop. With volatility likely to remain elevated, Bitcoin’s next move will be crucial in shaping sentiment heading into the second quarter of 2024. Bitcoin Sentiment Weakens As Whale Movement Sparks Market Uncertainty Bitcoin is struggling to convince analysts and investors that the bull market will continue in 2025. After hitting an all-time high earlier this year, BTC has lost significant momentum, and the current price action reflects growing doubts about the sustainability of further gains. Many key indicators and broader market sentiment now lean toward the possibility of a bear market taking shape, especially as global economic turmoil and inflation fears continue to shake investor confidence. The uncertainty in the market is not limited to crypto alone. US equities have also experienced a slowdown as fears of a potential recession mount. Investors are adopting a risk-off stance, redirecting capital into safer assets as macroeconomic instability grows. Adding to the unease, Arkham Intelligence revealed that a long-dormant Bitcoin whale just moved over $250 million in BTC. The whale originally accumulated the coins in late 2016, turning a $3 million investment into over $250 million across an eight-year period—holding all the BTC in a single address until now. This sudden move raises questions: is the whale preparing to sell, or simply repositioning? Such significant on-chain activity often precedes market volatility. While this could signal profit-taking before a deeper correction, it may also foreshadow a bullish breakout if the move was part of a strategic transfer. Either way, the market is on edge, watching closely for Bitcoin’s next big decision. BTC Bulls Eye Key Resistance Bitcoin is trading at $84,200 after days of consolidation, struggling to reclaim the 200-day moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), both sitting near the critical $85,000 level. This zone has become a decisive battleground for bulls and bears, with BTC needing to break above it to signal any serious momentum shift. Reclaiming $85K would set the stage for a test of the $88K level, which many analysts view as the last major resistance before a push above $90K. A clean breakout above $88K could mark the beginning of a recovery rally, potentially restoring bullish sentiment across the market. However, the current rejection at these technical levels raises concerns. If bulls fail to push above $90K in the coming sessions, BTC may continue to consolidate in this tight range or even face a deeper correction. Market volatility, macroeconomic uncertainty, and cautious investor sentiment continue to weigh heavily on price action. As the 200-day MA and EMA act as dynamic resistance, the next few days could be pivotal. Bitcoin must reclaim these levels to confirm strength—or risk slipping into a longer phase of weakness and potential downside pressure.

The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made its decisions, and the long-running XRP lawsuit was finally resolved, bringing relief to the community. However, the Pi Network faced some tough challenges. The migration and Know Your Customer (KYC) process are now complete, but many users were unable to claim their tokens. As a result, Pi fell behind the market, leading to doubts about whether now is a good time to buy. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Pi was the worst performer last week, losing more value than the rest. A big blow came when Binance refused to list Pi. They stated that any token not listed on the Binance Smart Chain is not eligible for a vote, disqualifying Pi from consideration. What’s Next For Pi Coin Price? The Pi token dropped below the $1 mark, after hitting an all-time high of $3 following its Open Network launch on February 20. It hit the lows of around $0.70, leaving many investors uncertain about the future. However, it has now bounced back, trading at around $0.96. Despite the downturn, analysts are spotting potential for a rebound and there are signs that a breakout could happen. If the support level holds strong, Pi could push back toward $2. The trading volume saw an initial spike but later declined, showing that sellers are currently in control, weakening the momentum of buyers. Ater a 3% drop, the price is approaching the critical $0.70 support level, and if this breaks, it could lead to further drops, potentially down to $0.50 or $0.10.

While some users are taking profit, others are adding more coins, expecting another price rally. Even with market dips, digital assets have often bounced back. However, only a few manage to recover fully. Picking coins with solid use, high trading volumes, and strong tech backing can help in the long run. Based on market study and performance, five top bullish cryptos to buy now are Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and BlockDAG. These coins show strong signs of growth. Let’s explore what makes each one stand out and how they could offer high returns. BlockDAG: Record-Breaking Presale with Huge ROI Potential By using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure instead of a typical blockchain, BlockDAG (BDAG) handles many transactions at once. This leads to faster and smoother operations. Its structure offers more safety and better scaling compared to others. These features place it among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Its presale is seeing massive support, with over $205 million raised and more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold. Currently, in Batch 27, the coin trades at $0.0248—jumping 2,380% from its $0.001 starting price. The quick sales show growing interest. With more batches selling fast, the $600 million target seems close, making it one of the biggest presales in years. The referral plan gives users 5% cashback in USDT when buying through shared links. With no caps on earnings or time limits, people are using it to earn rewards while getting BDAG coins. This helps keep buying active and adds more support to BDAG’s rise as one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Bitcoin: Key Player with Strong Market Role As the earliest digital currency, Bitcoin still leads with its tight network security and known role as a value holder. Though prices go up and down, its supply cap and name value keep it in demand. News of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve plan could affect future price changes. Bitcoin also plays a role in money transfers and shields from rising costs. Though newer tech options exist, Bitcoin’s strong hold and network trust keep it among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. BNB: Boosting DeFi Access and Trading Reach What began as Binance Coin has grown into a key part of the Binance system. It helps lower trading costs and unlocks special options on the platform. Beyond trading, BNB fuels dApps on Binance Smart Chain, offering quick service and low fees. New meme coins are gaining ground on BNB Chain, adding more use to the network. This boosts BNB’s status as a strong rival to Ethereum and Solana in the DeFi world. Because of its steady demand and wide reach, BNB holds a spot among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Solana: Fast Transactions Speeds Known for quick actions and cheap fees, Solana can handle thousands of steps every second. Its special Proof-of-History method gives it an edge in running smoothly and scaling well. Developers are turning to Solana thanks to its strong support for smart contracts and dApps. Even after network pauses, many still expect growth from Solana. There’s also talk of a spot ETF, which may boost its price. These signs make Solana one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Ethereum: Smart Contracts and Pectra Upgrade With strong use in smart contract building, Ethereum helps run many dApps today. Its shift to Proof-of-Stake in Ethereum 2.0 brings better speed and lower power use. This improves user and developer experience. The platform leads in DeFi and NFT growth, hosting thousands of active projects. While rivals like Solana and BNB grow, Ethereum’s strong base and planned Pectra changes help it keep its place. It stays one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Top Bullish Cryptos to Buy Now— Final Say! News of Bitcoin reserves, Ethereum’s Pectra update, BNB’s growing DeFi use, and Solana’s speed plus ETF hopes keep them among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Still, BlockDAG stands out with its fast-rising presale and broad use of DAG tech. With $205 million already raised and a target of $600 million, it’s setting new records. The DAG setup, high-speed power, and rewarding system help push BDAG ahead. It’s gaining attention from those who seek the top bullish cryptos to buy now for better returns.

Sonic, a rebranded high-speed blockchain, is moving ahead with the development of a yield-generating algorithmic stablecoin despite lingering concerns following the Terra-Luna collapse. At the same time, Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser is predicting a shift toward gold-backed stablecoins, arguing they offer greater global trust and geopolitical neutrality than US dollar-pegged tokens. Sonic Blockchain Pushes Forward with High-Yield Algorithmic Stablecoin Amid Lingering Terra Ghosts The Sonic blockchain, a project that rebranded from the Fantom network and touts itself as the fastest Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain, is forging ahead with one of crypto’s most controversial innovations: an algorithmic stablecoin that promises yields of up to 23%. The bold move is reigniting conversations and concerns about the risks of such tokens, especially following the catastrophic collapse of TerraUSD (UST) nearly three years ago—a crisis that ushered in one of the longest crypto winters in history. The announcement came via Andre Cronje, co-founder of Sonic Labs and founder of Yearn.finance, who revealed in a March 22 post on X that a proof-of-concept (POC) for the stablecoin was showing promising yield results. “POC looks good. Yielding > 200% APR @ 10m TVL, around 23.5% APR @ 100m, steady at around 4.9% at 1bn+. Will scale up and get team for a full release,” Cronje wrote. Despite his optimism, Cronje didn’t shy away from admitting the emotional burden associated with algorithmic stablecoins . Just one day earlier, he confessed to experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the fallout from Terra’s failure. “Pretty sure our team cracked algo stable coins today, but previous cycle gave me so much PTSD not sure if we should implement,” he added. Algorithmic stablecoins differ from fiat-backed stablecoins by using code-based mechanisms to maintain their peg to the US dollar or other fiat currencies. These mechanisms often rely on incentivizing traders or burning and minting partner tokens to maintain equilibrium. While elegant in theory, they have proven dangerous in practice. In May 2022, TerraUSD (UST), once a rising star in decentralized finance, lost its peg during a liquidity crisis that rapidly spiraled out of control. The token, which offered a tantalizing 20%+ APY through the Anchor Protocol, crashed from $1 to as low as $0.30. Its sister token, LUNA, used to help stabilize UST, saw a catastrophic collapse of over 98%, plunging from $120 to less than a dollar. The $40 billion implosion of the Terra ecosystem rattled the entire industry, tanking investor confidence and drawing the attention of global regulators. It also left investors—both retail and institutional—holding worthless tokens and prompted a wave of lawsuits and investigations into Terraform Labs and co-founder Do Kwon. Unlike Terra, Sonic is attempting to address scalability and finality as foundational elements of its blockchain. The platform claims to be the fastest EVM chain, boasting a true 720 milliseconds (ms) finality—an industry record confirmed during its testnet launch on Sept. 8, 2024. Sonic’s revamped network has attracted considerable attention. Since rebranding from Fantom, its total value locked (TVL) has surged by 66% to $253 million. The network’s ability to finalize transactions faster than its competitors has positioned it as a promising infrastructure layer for high-frequency decentralized applications (dApps), including stablecoins. Now, with the development of a yield-generating algorithmic stablecoin, Sonic is once again pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance—this time, in more dangerous waters. The move comes at a time when regulatory bodies are actively cracking down on algorithmic stablecoins. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation will effectively ban the issuance of such tokens in the bloc, specifically citing the need to avoid repeats of the Terra-Luna disaster. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and other global regulators have similarly taken a cautious stance, noting the lack of collateral backing and the systemic risks these coins can pose to broader crypto markets. Despite this, interest in algorithmic stablecoins hasn’t completely faded. Speculators continue to trade Terra’s resurrected LUNA token. This enduring appetite for risk sheds light on a key challenge facing projects like Sonic: the allure of high yields remains powerful, even as memories of devastating losses linger. Can Sonic Break the Algorithmic Curse? Sonic’s team believes their new algorithmic stablecoin is fundamentally different from its predecessors, with a more sustainable yield curve and enhanced mechanisms to avoid death spirals. The estimated yield decreases as more capital flows in, designed to maintain long-term equilibrium and reduce the reliance on overly generous incentive programs. However, with Cronje himself expressing hesitation and PTSD from the last cycle, even insiders recognize that the ghosts of Terra still haunt this sector. Whether Sonic’s version of an algorithmic stablecoin can survive where others have failed remains an open question. For now, all eyes are on the upcoming release as the industry holds its breath—again. Gold-Backed Stablecoins Poised to Challenge Dollar Dominance, Says Bitcoin Maximalist Max Keiser In related news, the battle for the future of digital money is heating up—and it may be fought not in Bitcoin or the US dollar, but in gold. According to Bitcoin maximalist and prominent financial commentator Max Keiser, gold-backed stablecoins are poised to overtake US dollar-pegged alternatives on the global stage due to gold’s inflation-hedging properties, minimal volatility, and geopolitical neutrality. In a series of recent statements, Keiser criticized the push by US lawmakers to preserve global dollar dominance through fiat-backed stablecoins. Instead, he predicted a coming wave of gold-backed digital tokens led by countries that oppose US financial hegemony. “Russia, China, and Iran are not going to accept a U.S. dollar stablecoin. I predict they will counter the USD stablecoin with a gold one,” Keiser said, arguing that these nations see the dollar as a geopolitical weapon rather than a trusted reserve asset. “China and Russia have a combined 50,000 tonnes of gold — more than what is reported,” he added. Keiser’s comments bring attention to a growing ideological and strategic divide between Western and Eastern powers when it comes to the future of monetary systems. US officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller, have recently emphasized the importance of stablecoins pegged to the dollar as tools for maintaining US financial influence abroad. At the March 7 White House Crypto Summit, Bessent announced that the Trump administration would make dollar-pegged stablecoin development a top national priority, citing the need to ”protect the dollar's reserve currency status” and prevent the global financial system from fragmenting into competing digital zones. In contrast, many foreign governments are exploring or already piloting alternatives, including stablecoins backed by hard assets such as gold. These efforts reflect growing resistance to dollar-centric financial infrastructure and the sanctions power it enables. The rise of gold-backed stablecoins like Tether’s Alloy (aUSD₮), launched in mid-2024, marks a significant shift in how value is being collateralized in the digital age. Alloy is backed by Tether’s XAU₮, a token that offers a claim to physical gold held in reserve. Gabor Gurbacs, founder of PointsVille and former VanEck executive, argued that XAU₮ represents a return to the sound money principles that underpinned the dollar before it was taken off the gold standard in 1971. “Tether Gold is what the dollar used to be before 1971,” Gurbacs noted in a March 19 post on X. “XAU₮ is up 15.7% year-to-date, while the broad crypto market is in the red. Foundations and businesses should hedge their holdings with XAU₮.” Indeed, XAU₮ recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by a historic rally in the global gold market amid fears of economic stagflation, geopolitical instability, and waning trust in central banks. Keiser and other critics argue that dollar-pegged stablecoins, while convenient, carry inherent political baggage. Since they are ultimately backed by dollar-denominated assets and often governed by US regulations, adversarial nations are unlikely to adopt them for large-scale cross-border transactions. The introduction of gold-backed alternatives, therefore, could allow countries like Russia, China, and Iran to participate in the digital economy without exposing themselves to US surveillance or sanctions. “Gold doesn’t come with a central bank or a central government,” Keiser pointed out. “It’s been money for 5,000 years, and that credibility is not something the dollar can easily replicate—especially not in the form of a token.” Lawmakers Push for Stablecoin Regulation Despite these geopolitical headwinds, US policymakers are pressing ahead with legislative efforts to support dollar-based stablecoins. The Stable Act of 2025 and the newly proposed GENIUS Stablecoin Bill aim to establish clear guidelines for issuance, reserve requirements, and regulatory oversight. Proponents argue that without such a framework, the US risks losing control over the most important financial innovation of the 21st century. They see dollar-pegged stablecoins as a necessary tool for preserving dollar supremacy in an increasingly multipolar world. However, the rise of gold-backed alternatives threatens to upend these plans. As more investors, corporations, and even governments begin to hedge with digital assets backed by physical gold, the appeal of fiat-pegged coins may diminish—especially in regions where trust in the US financial system is already eroding. The stablecoin market is approaching a critical inflection point. On one side is the US-led vision of regulated, fiat-pegged stablecoins tightly integrated into the existing financial system. On the other is an emerging movement toward decentralized, hard-asset-backed tokens that reject centralized control and seek to restore monetary neutrality. With gold-backed tokens like XAU₮ gaining traction and central banks worldwide accumulating bullion at record pace, the digital gold standard may no longer be a fringe idea—it could be the foundation of the next global monetary order. And as Max Keiser sees it, the race is already on.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|LUNA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-24 05:00:00

The $5.9t asset management heavyweight on Friday filed to tokenize a share class of its US Treasury money market fund on Ethereum, marking its first major move into asset tokenization. Its filing , submitted to the US SEC on March 21, outlines Fidelity’s plan to launch an “OnChain” share class of its $80m Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX). The underlying assets — mainly US Treasury bills and cash — will stay in traditional custody. Investor share records, however, will also be logged on the Ethereum blockchain to improve transparency and traceability. The official ownership record will still be kept off-chain by Fidelity’s transfer agent. Blockchain entries will be reconciled with this official record on a daily basis. Source: US SEC TradFi Titans Embrace Tokenization to Modernize Markets Fidelity now joins a growing group of traditional finance giants exploring tokenization . Others in this space include BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. These firms see tokenization as a way to modernize financial infrastructure. It involves creating digital representations of real-world assets (RWAs) on a blockchain. The promise lies in real-time settlement, fractional ownership, improved transparency and broader access to financial products that were once difficult to reach. So far, that promise is catching on. According to data from rwa.xyz , the total market for tokenized US Treasuries has surged to $4.78b. Ethereum alone accounts for over $3.3b in value, far outpacing other blockchains like Stellar. BlackRock launched its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) just last year. It has already amassed $1.46b in tokenized assets. This shows that institutions are no longer just exploring blockchain. They are now actively building on it. Fidelity Experiments with Ethereum, Keeps Options Open Fidelity’s approach is cautious but deliberate. By keeping the core asset structure unchanged and only recording a secondary ledger on-chain, the firm can test blockchain benefits without disrupting regulatory compliance or investor expectations. The fund itself remains a conventional money market vehicle — focusing on capital preservation, income generation, and liquidity — but now with an optional tech-forward twist. Pending regulatory approval, the OnChain share class is expected to go live by May 30. Fidelity also noted that it may explore other blockchains beyond Ethereum in the future, signaling longer-term ambitions in the digital asset space.

The resolution has sparked optimism among XRP watchers, with analysts eyeing a potential climb to $10 by 2030, driven by regulatory clarity, the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and the possibility of a Ripple Labs IPO. Bitget’s Ryan Lee noted a breakout from the current trading range of $2.35 to $2.55 could lead to extensive moves in either direction. “Short-term price targets range from $2.00-$2.17 on the downside to $2.65-$3.00 on the upside,” Lee said, adding, “Long-term forecasts suggest $4.20-$10+ by 2030 if Ripple capitalizes on payment adoption, though $2.50 remains a pivotal level to watch for the next breakout or breakdown.” He attributed the medium-term range of $1.50-$5.89 to the SEC’s retreat and potential XRP ETF approvals, though technical indicators like a neutral RSI and bearish MACD suggest consolidation. The RSI, or relative strength index, is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale of 0 to 100, signaling overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions. MACD, or moving average convergence divergence, is a trend-following indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a price, with its signal line crossovers indicating bullish or bearish momentum shifts. Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, added relatively lesser volatility in XRP’s price-action was a further sign of sentiment leaning bullish: “XRP has fared well under the past months’ crypto selloff and has room to potentially continue upward, though momentum can be lost if U.S. macroeconomic factors and tariffs disrupt the industry.” The forecasts come as IPO chatter is heating up, which Garlinghouse mentioned was “possible” in a Wednesday interview last week, providing further cues for bullish positioning.",Markets|XRP|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-24 05:03:38

Meanwhile, the US is exploring innovative ways to fund Bitcoin purchases by using revalued gold certificates. In the private sector, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is preparing for another major BTC acquisition after raising $711 million. Pakistan Joins Global Crypto Wave Pakistan is making a bold move toward embracing cryptocurrency after Bilal Bin Saqib, the CEO of the newly-formed Crypto Council, proposed the use of the country’s surplus energy to mine Bitcoin. This proposal was brought forward during the council’s inaugural meeting on March 21, which signaled a major shift in the country's stance on digital assets. The meeting gathered high-profile figures, including lawmakers, the governor of the Bank of Pakistan, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and the federal IT secretary. The main goal of the initiative is to lay the groundwork for a robust crypto ecosystem in Pakistan, focusing on attracting foreign investment and establishing the nation as a major crypto hub. Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb praised the efforts, and stated that it was the start of a new digital era for the country, one that promotes transparency, economic empowerment, and technological leadership. This change in policy is especially interesting when considering the government's previously rigid opposition to cryptocurrencies. In May of 2023, then-Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Aisha Ghaus Pasha stated that crypto will never be legalized in Pakistan, due to concerns over anti-money laundering compliance under FATF guidelines. However, the tide turned on Nov. 4, 2024, when the government officially moved to regulate cryptocurrencies as legal tender. This was during the same time that elections were held in the United States. The global shift toward pro-crypto policies seems to have influenced Pakistan’s decision. After his re-election, President Donald Trump very quickly implemented several digital asset-friendly policies. On Jan. 23, 2025, he signed an executive order forming the Working Group on Digital Assets to explore broad regulatory reform. Donald Trump signing executive orders The same order also banned any government-led research or issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). In another show of support, Trump signed another executive order in March of 2025 to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve along with a digital asset stockpile composed of US-origin cryptocurrencies. Pakistan’s pivot seems to align with this emerging international trend. US Gold to Bitcoin Plan Gains Momentum The Trump administration is also exploring creative, budget-neutral ways to expand the United States’ Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to Bo Hines , the executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets. On the Crypto in America podcast, Hines revealed that one of the most promising strategies under consideration involves using the government's undervalued gold certificates. These certificates are currently priced at a statutory value of $42.22 per troy ounce, which is much lower than the current market price of gold, which exceeds $3,000 per ounce. Hines referenced Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025, which proposes revaluing these gold certificates to reflect their true market worth, thereby enabling the government to buy Bitcoin without it impacting taxpayers. The legislation recommends that Federal Reserve banks submit all outstanding gold certificates to the Treasury Secretary, who will then issue updated certificates based on the fair market value of the underlying gold. This mechanism could potentially unlock substantial funds for Bitcoin purchases, which certainly aligns with the Trump administration’s push for a strategic, fiscally responsible accumulation of digital assets. Currently, the US government holds approximately 207,000 BTC, primarily from seizures in criminal and civil cases. This makes it the largest known national holder of Bitcoin . According to Hines, the strategic reserve is being treated as a separate entity from the broader digital asset stockpile, a distinction driven by Bitcoin’s unique qualities as a commodity with no issuer and widely accepted status as a store of value. He stated that Bitcoin’s special status had been carefully defended by the administration, even as other digital assets were being considered for inclusion in the new national stockpile. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other officials agreed with this sentiment that Bitcoin occupies a privileged position in the administration’s digital asset framework. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is also making legislative progress on crypto-related policies, with bipartisan momentum building behind a stablecoin bill and a broader crypto market structure bill. Representative Ro Khanna is very optimistic that both measures could be passed this year. Strategy Signals More BTC Ahead It is not only countries interested in gathering more Bitcoin. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at yet another potential Bitcoin purchase after the company’s recent capital raise through a preferred stock offering. In a post on X , Saylor shared a Bitcoin price chart with the caption “needs more orange,” teasing the possibility of another BTC acquisition once markets reopen. According to SaylorTracker, the company’s last purchase took place on March 17, when it bought 130 BTC for approximately $10.7 million. This brought its total holdings to 499,226 BTC. Although it was a relatively small buy compared to its previous acquisitions, it followed a brief two-week pause in activity. On March 21, Strategy announced the pricing of a new tranche of preferred stock , sold at $85 per share with a 10% coupon, expected to generate about $711 million in revenue. This capital infusion may set the stage for another large-scale Bitcoin purchase, which is consistent with the company’s long-term accumulation strategy. Michael Saylor is still one of Bitcoin’s most vocal advocates, and he uses both financial and political channels to promote the asset. He also called for the US government to buy 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply by 2035, when almost all of the 21 million coins will have been mined. He also published a proposal titled “A Digital Assets Strategy to Dominate the 21st Century Global Economy,” urging the government to adopt a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. At the recent Blockworks Digital Asset Summit, Saylor delivered his “21 Truths of Bitcoin” address, in which he placed a lot of emphasis on Bitcoin’s superiority over traditional commodities. He argued that gold continues to underperform the S&P Index and claimed that Bitcoin is the only non-garbage investment commodity in human history. Despite recent volatility in the crypto markets, Strategy saw some very impressive returns on its Bitcoin holdings. The company is currently sitting on more than $9.3 billion in unrealized gains, with its investment up more than 28%.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-24 05:10:03

Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes expects the Federal Reserve to undertake quantitative easing (QE) measures soon, which could push BTC to $110K and beyond. Bitcoin Price Rally to $110K Coming, Says Arthur Hayes Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes has confidently forecasted that Bitcoin will climb to $110,000 before revisiting its $76,500 level. Hayes attributed his bullish stand on BTC to the upcoming pivot in the Fed policy, suggesting an upcoming move from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE) moving ahead. Furthermore, Hayes downplayed the impact of Trump’s tariffs, while referring to it as “transitory inflation” as noted by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Last week, the former BitMEX CEO also stated the chances of a Bitcoin bottom formation at $77,000 while eyeing an upward trajectory from here onwards. As of press time, Bitcoin price is trading 3.17% up at $86,758 with daily trading volume surging 74% to $16.69 billion, highlighting a strong bullish undercurrent. As per the Coinglass data, the BTC futures open interest is also up by 7.79% to more than $56 billion, with the 24-hour short liquidations soaring past $50 million. US PCE Data To Highlight Inflation Trajectory This week, the Federal Reserve will unveil its most closely watched inflation measure, the U.S. core PCE price index for February. Market expectations point to a slight rebound in the index, with forecasts predicting an increase from 2.6% to 2.7%. Along with the US PCE data, the Fed will also unveil the final one-year inflation rate forecast for March, while offering greater insights into inflationary trends. This will help shape the market sentiment for risk assets moving ahead. Below is the list of key events scheduled for this week. Key Events This Week: 1. S&P Global Manufacturing PMI data – Monday 2.

Last week, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows for six consecutive days in a row showing strong resumption in demand. Additionally, corporate players like Strategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet have continued with their Bitcoin purchases. In the early trading hours in Aisa on Monday, Japan’s Metaplanet announced buying an additional 150 Bitcoin, taking its total holdings to 3,350 BTC. Earlier today, the company announced an investment of $12.6 million, for an average purchase price of $83,801 per BTC. The cumulative investment stands at approximately $278.8 million, averaging $83,224 per BTC. Notably, Metaplanet has achieved an impressive year-to-date BTC yield of 68.3%. Last week, Eric Trump joined Metaplanet’s board of advisers to take further its Bitcoin acquisition plans. Strategy’s executive chairman Michael Saylor has also hinted at more BTC purchases coming ahead.

Investors are at a crossroads weather to invest, sell, or stay firm in the market. One expert blames it on a lack of education. Here’s an enigmatic eye-opener for those who are dealing with the fear of missing out. Robert Kiyosaki, the renowned author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has once again made a strong case for why some people remain financially stagnant while others build wealth. According to him, it’s not just Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) that holds people back, but something deeper—Fear of Making Mistakes (FOMM). He argues that this fear keeps many from taking advantage of life-changing financial opportunities, particularly Bitcoin. Bitcoin: The Greatest Wealth Opportunity? Robert Kiyosaki believes that many people invest blindly, relying on social media, friends, or financial news instead of doing proper research. He warns that this mindset turns investing into gambling, increasing the risk of losses. Hence, Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin as one of the biggest wealth-building opportunities in history, yet he believes many will hesitate due to FOMM. He predicts that as Bitcoin crosses $200,000 , skeptics will say, “It’s too expensive,” just as they did when it was at $10,000, $20,000, and beyond. Meanwhile, those who understand its long-term value position themselves for generational wealth. The Importance of Learning From the Right People Rather than simply urging people to buy Bitcoin, Kiyosaki encourages learning from both supporters and critics to form an educated perspective. He follows well-known Bitcoin advocates like Michael Saylor , Samson Mow, Max Keiser, and Raoul Pal, while also advising people to listen to Bitcoin skeptics. A major point in Kiyosaki’s argument is that traditional education conditions people to avoid mistakes, equating errors with failure. He compares this to how babies learn to walk—through falling and trying again. If schools taught babies, he jokes, they’d never learn to walk. This, he believes, is why many highly educated people remain financially poor despite their intelligence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Metaplanet Boosts BTC Holdings to 3,350 with Latest Purchase , Education Is Free—Take Advantage of It Kiyosaki emphasizes that the best financial education doesn’t come from schools or Wall Street but from free resources like YouTube and independent thinkers. He urges people to take control of their financial learning rather than relying on outdated traditional education systems. President Trump shutting down the Department of Education. He is draining the swamp of filled with slithering Marxists. God bless him. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) March 6, 2025 Not all Agree With Him… Crypto Analyst CA Vivek Khatri pushes back against Kiyosaki’s view, arguing that poverty isn’t just about mindset but structural barriers. He points out that the poor often lack disposable income, work multiple jobs just to get by, and don’t have time or insider access to research investments. While Bitcoin made early adopters rich, he warns against selling false hope, emphasizing that not everyone can afford to take financial risks when survival is the priority. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In August 2022, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash after alleging the protocol helped launder crypto stolen by North Korean hacking crew the Lazarus Group , leading to a number of Tornado Cash users filing a lawsuit against the regulator. After a court ruling in favor of Tornado Cash, the US Treasury dropped the mixer from its sanctions list on March 21 , along with several dozen Tornado-affiliated smart contract addresses from the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, and has now argued “this matter is now moot.” Because Tornado Cash has been dropped from the sanctions list, the US Treasury Department argues there is no need for a final court judgment in the lawsuit. Source: Paul Grewal “Because this court, like all federal courts, has a continuing obligation to satisfy itself that it possesses Article III jurisdiction over the case, briefing on mootness is warranted,” the US Treasury said. However, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the Treasury’s hope to have the case declared moot before an official judgment can be made isn’t the correct legal process. “After grudgingly delisting TC, they now claim they’ve mooted any need for a final court judgment. But that’s not the law, and they know it,” he said. “Under the voluntary cessation exception, a defendant’s decision to end a challenged practice moots a case only if the defendant can show that the practice cannot ‘reasonably be expected to recur.’” Grewal pointed to a 2024 Supreme Court ruling that found a legal complaint from Yonas Fikre, a US citizen who was put on the No Fly List, is not moot by taking him off the list because the ban could be reinstated again at a later date. Source: Paul Grewal “Here, Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from the SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again. That’s not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,” Grewal said. Six Tornado Cash users led by Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon, with the support of Coinbase, sued the Treasury in September 2022 to reverse the sanctions under the argument that they were unlawful. Crypto policy advocacy group Coin Center followed through with a similar suit in October 2022 . In August 2023, a Texas federal court judge sided with the US Treasury, ruling that Tornado Cash was an entity that may be designated per OFAC regulations. On appeal, a three-judge panel ruled in November that Treasury’s sanctions against the crypto mixer’s immutable smart contracts were unlawful. US Treasury had a 60-day window to challenge the decision, which it did; however, the US court sided with Tornado Cash, overturning the sanctions on Jan. 21 and forcing the government agency to remove the sanctions by March. Related: US Treasury under Trump could take a different approach to Tornado Cash Its founders are still facing legal strife, however. The US charged Roman Storm and fellow co-founder Roman Semenov in August 2023, accusing them of helping launder over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash. Semenov is still at large and on the FBI’s most wanted list. Storm is free on a $2 million bond and expected to face trial in April. Meanwhile, Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was released from prison after a Dutch court suspended his “pretrial detention” as he prepared to appeal his money laundering conviction.

The cryptocurrency has been experiencing a downward trend in market dominance since its peak in 2017. However, a recent break above this downward trend suggests a possible reversal. This could set XRP on a path to reclaiming higher market dominance, much like it did during the 2017 bull run. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World , XRP’s price on the 3-day chart, the market is still showing signs of a bearish divergence. This suggests that any significant bullish movement is unlikely in the near future. Over the past few months, this pattern has continued, with only occasional small price increases that don’t lead to any major rallies. Support and Resistance Levels to Watch In the short-term, XRP has solid support around $2.24 to $2.30, with additional support between $1.95 and $2.05. On the resistance side, there is a significant level just above $2.60, with stronger resistance between $2.65 and $2.80, and another key level around $3. Sideways Movement Expected Currently, XRP’s price is mostly moving sideways, bouncing between support and resistance levels. This range-bound action has been ongoing for the last month, which results in relatively slow and uneventful price movement. While the price action may seem boring, there are still opportunities for profit if the right strategies are applied. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is XRP’s Price Not Going Up After the SEC Lawsuit Win? , What’s Next for XRP?

Investor buzz has surrounded Pepe Coin, Sui, Litecoin, and a revolutionary new Defi project that has caught attention throughout the previous 2 months. Market volatility is compelling experienced investors to look for projects that demonstrate solid fundamentals and generate high potential value. The unique project Remittix continues to establish itself as an upcoming exponential growth project for 2025. Let us find out why. Pepe Coin: The Meme Coin That Continues to Surprise The cryptocurrency market still recognizes Pepe Coin among its most popular meme coins. Currently trading at $0.0000073, Pepe has risen by 9.3% over the past week amid renewed interest in meme coins across social media platforms. PEPE has staged a comeback from its established support area while establishing conditions to break out from its trading bracket between $0.00000722 and $0.00000724. The market participants with bullish positions are buying near the midpoint and expect PEPE to reach resistance at $0.00000739 in the short term. Analysts predict Pepe is able to reach $0.0000260 by Q2 2025 if it continues to ride its community hype and develop its ecosystem. While Pepe and other meme coins are required to go past mere speculative investments by creating genuine real-world applications, Remittix already possesses an advantage in this area. Sui: A New Contender in Layer-1 Blockchains The price of Sui stands at $2.26 with a 2% weekly gain because institutional investors along with developers show increasing interest. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) partnered with SUI to push its price toward $2.75 during the trading session after WLFI decided to add SUI tokens to its “Macro Strategy” token reserve and explore blockchain applications. The market predicts Sui will reach $7.9 by mid 2025 as its adoption expands across DeFi platforms and gaming platforms. The blockchain development field has chosen Sui as its top preference because developers seek practical solutions to enhance their projects. Litecoin: The Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold Litecoin remains one of the most experienced cryptocurrencies in the market, touted as “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” Currently trading at $92 , Litecoin has experienced steady gains in the past month, buoyed by its reputation as a stable and secure payments network. The upcoming LTC mining rate halving in August 2025 has also generated optimism about Litecoin’s price trajectory. At present the LTC market shows substantial liquidity accumulation across bidding zones and asking zones. Market makers make strategic position increases as they expect a forthcoming market movement. The LTC market promises an intense upward price movement when trading crosses above $94.6 as entry into the blue zone will trigger elevated trading activity and volatility. Analysts have projected that Litecoin could reach $150 by this time in 2026 if adoption among merchants and payment processors continues to rise. However, with newer projects with practical c features entering the arena, Litecoin is coming under increasing pressure to stay relevant among investors and users. Remittix: Changing the Game in Cross-Border Payments The Defi sector is eager to see Remittix solve global remittance system inefficiencies through blockchain technology which offer less expensive and transparent cross-border payment solutions that deliver faster results. Remittix distinguishes itself from speculative meme coins and older cryptocurrencies through its dual use case of payment and innovation which targets real world problems. Remittix presale activities have proven spectacular, as investors have contributed more than $14 million to the project demonstrating strong belief in its future potential. The ERC tokens have reached $0.0734 per token making sure early investors can access an entry point that provides vast potential for growth. The listing of Remittix on major exchanges including OKX and Binance and Coinbase will likely result in substantial profits during the first several months after public launch. Market analysts project Remittix tokens will increase by 10,000% in value by Q4 2025 due to partnerships between remittance operators combined with continuous technological improvements for global expansion. The single platform of Remittix combines the payment network excellence of Litecoin with the dApps scalability solutions of Sui to create an optimal solution for efficient and scalable remittance operations. The Remittix presale presents a once-in-a-lifetime chance to join the promising crypto project of 2025 so participate right now to achieve huge profits as the revolutionary platform accelerates its growth.

The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Trump said on Truth Social on March 23 at 2:33 am UTC. Source: Donald Trump Nearly $250 million was added to the TRUMP token’s $2.5 billion market cap by 3:11 am before the memecoin fell back down to $11.38 about 90 minutes later, CoinGecko data shows and is now trading at $11.82. Despite being the 53rd largest coin by market cap, Trump’s post contributed to it being the eighth most-traded token over the last 24 hours with $1.4 billion in trading volume.

Source: CoinGecko Tornado Cash goes live on MegaETH testnet A largely unknown crypto developer who goes by the name “GUNBOATs” on X has launched crypto privacy mixer Tornado Cash on MegaETH testnet — a new Ethereum layer 2 blockchain looking to resolve Ethereum’s scalability issues. The crypto developer showed a command-line interface (terminal window) of the Tornado Cash smart contract “0x0cB…65142” deployed on the MegaETH testnet at block 1,397,845 — which was timestamped on March 21 at 5:41 pm UTC, according to the MegaETH explorer. Source: GUNBOATs The integration occurred shortly after the US Treasury Department removed Tornado Cash from its sanctions list on March 21 and two months after a US appeals court said the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control couldn’t sanction Tornado Cash smart contracts because they are not the property of a foreign national. MegaETH also launched its testnet on the same day the Tornado Cash sanction was lifted. While it isn’t clear if and when a full launch will occur, the company behind the MegaETH public testnet claims it offers “unparalleled performance” with 10 millisecond block times while processing around 20,000 transactions per second. Solo Bitcoin miner wins BTC block, banking $266K A solo Bitcoin miner believed to have been using a miner with less than one terahash per second (TS/s) has solved one of the blockchain’s blocks and earned a $266,552 reward. “Another solo miner found a block!! This time on a self hosted Public Pool. We can’t be sure but the guess is it was a miner with less than 1 TH/s,” Nerdminer Store said in a March 23 X post. The Bitcoin miner snared a total of 3.15 BTC for solving block 888,989, which was timestamped on March 23 at 1:30 am UTC, mempool.space data shows. That bounty included the current 3.125 Bitcoin subsidy and another 0.027 Bitcoin ($2,254) from transaction fees. If Nerdminer is correct in believing a miner with less than 1 TH/s was used to mine the block, the machine likely would have been a hand or pocket-sized rig that possesses a fraction of the hashrate that industrial-scale application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) have. Example of a pocket-sized Bitcoin mining rig that may have solved Bitcoin block 888,989. Source: ASIC Miner Value For context, the Bitcoin mining marketplace estimates that the odds of the 1.2TH/s rig mining a solo block on any day is one in 4.6 million chance. It comes after a 0.48 TH/s mining machine solved Bitcoin block 887,212 on March 10, banking $263,000 in total rewards. No, the IMF did not say Bitcoin is “digital gold” Bitcoin was mentioned several times in the International Monetary Fund’s seventh edition of its “Integrated Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual,” which was published on March 20 — but none of which referred to it as “digital gold,” contrary to some reports. The IMF provided classifications on “crypto assets” such as Bitcoin as a “medium of exchange” while stating that many new digital assets are designed to also act as a “store of value.” The IMF’s comment on digital assets was misinterpreted by members of the crypto industry. Source: IMF “This is a massive stretch to jump to: ‘IMF says bitcoin is digital gold,’” Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter said in a March 23 X post. “[It’s] a good sign that the IMF is recognizing this but definitely not an endorsement of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold.’” The IMF also distinguished fungible tokens from non-fungible tokens and classified the latter as either a token designed to act as a medium of exchange or as a security.

However, President Trump suggested there could be ""flexibility"" in the tariff plans, and recent reports indicate the scope might be narrower than expected, potentially exempting some industries from the full impact. Adding to market unease, tensions in the Middle East escalated as Israel resumed strikes targeting Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, investors also continue to monitor the impact of recently announced U.S. sanctions on Iran, which could further influence oil market dynamics. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.03% to above 37,700, while the Topix Index slipped 0.3% to 2,795 in mixed trading on Monday. The Japanese yen slipped toward 150 per dollar on Monday, extending losses from the previous session, as disappointing business activity data countered a hawkish Bank of Japan outlook. In March, Japan’s private sector activity contracted for the first time in five months, with the manufacturing downturn extending to a ninth month and services activity also turning negative. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.29% to below 3,360 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.4% to 10,645 on Monday, extending losses from last weekand, and the offshore yuan edges lower to around 7.26 per dollar, reaching its lowest level in two weeks, pressured by rising concerns over a potential escalation of US-China trade disputes as the deadline for Trump’s reciprocal tariffs approaches. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.02% were little changed in early trading on Monday, hovering around 23,686 after sharp losses in the prior two sessions. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.85% The HSBC India Services PMI fell to 57.7 in March 2025 from 59.0 in the previous month, marking the 44th consecutive month of growth in services activity, preliminary estimates showed. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.04% dipped 0.15% to around 7,920 on Monday, trimming last week’s gains. The Australian dollar climbed toward $0.63 on Monday, snapping a four-day losing streak, as upbeat private sector activity data boosted market sentiment. In March, the manufacturing sector saw its fastest expansion in over two years to 52.6 in March 2025 from 50.4 in February, while services sector growth also picked up to 51.3 in March 2025 from 50.6 in February. Australia will unveil its 2025 federal budget on Tuesday, March 25, with Treasurer Jim Chalmers emphasizing cost-of-living relief and economic resilience amid global uncertainty. Key measures include extending electricity bill subsidies until the end of 2025, costing AUD 1.8 billion, and expanding a shared equity scheme to help first-home buyers. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher as President Trump suggested some “flexibility” on tariffs, while several megacap stocks made a recovery. U.S. stock futures gapped higher on Monday as Wall Street looked to extend last week's gains, with investors seeking fresh market catalysts: Dow +0.56% ; S&P 500 +0.65% ; Nasdaq +0.81% .

Pi Coin just bounced 8% after a short dip. XRP claimed a historic legal win that may reshape U.S. crypto laws. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) stands at $0.0734, with over $14 million raised and 521+ million tokens sold—offering a straightforward path to cheaper, faster cross-border payments. Below, we explore why these three tokens might give you a strong chance to turn a $1,000 investment into life-changing profits. Pi Coin: Can It Stay Above $1? Pi Coin at $1. Source: CoinGecko Pi Coin, now at $1.00 , recently slipped to $0.86 before rebounding 8%. It remains popular thanks to its easy mining model and focus on mainstream adoption. However, unlocking more Pi tokens each month can put downward pressure on its price unless demand remains strong. A lot also hinges on official exchange listings— rumors of a Binance listing boosted Pi’s price before nothing materialized. If Pi’s upcoming events, such as PiFest 2025, successfully expand its real-world uses and push more developers to build on Pi’s platform, the token might maintain a solid floor above $1 or climb higher. But Pi’s future is uncertain without more liquidity and big exchange support. XRP: After the SEC Win, What’s Next? XRP at $2.41. Source: CoinGecko XRP trades at around $2.41 , fresh off a big legal triumph. The SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple, removing a long-running legal cloud. CEO Brad Garlinghouse and legal chief Stuart Alderoty view it as more than a court success—it’s a turning point for clearer U.S. crypto regulation. In response, the SEC has changed its tone, dropping or pausing cases against several exchanges. Ripple also wrote a letter urging the SEC to develop clear guidelines instead of relying on random enforcement. Now that the legal pressure is gone, many see XRP as ready for a new phase. Some watchers even say an XRP ETF might be next. Whether it hits $100 or not, the removal of legal uncertainties could spur bigger institutional interest in XRP. Remittix (RTX): The Simple Path to Riches While Pi and XRP have big communities, Remittix (RTX), at $0.0734, takes a more direct route by solving real-world remittance problems. Already $14 million has poured in, with 521 million tokens sold—proof that many believe in RTX’s plan. Families, freelancers, and small stores can avoid costly wire fees by converting crypto (BTC, ETH, or others) into local currency, usually within a day, depositing the money into a standard bank account. Think of a mom in Kenya receiving funds from her kid in Canada—no need for advanced steps or heavy fees. Observers say if Remittix secures major e-commerce ties or payroll integrations, daily use could surge, driving the token’s price far above its modest starting point. The token uses locked reserves and an audited contract, helping calm fears of a scam. For those wanting to turn $1,000 into a potential fortune, a practical coin like Remittix might outshine more hype-driven projects in the long run. Conclusion: Which Coin Could Make You a Family Crypto Pioneer? Pi Coin, Remittix (RTX), and XRP each offer a distinct path to wealth. Pi aims at mainstream adoption but needs stronger liquidity and listings to push higher. XRP overcame the SEC lawsuit, clearing a big hurdle and reigniting hopes of major partnerships. Yet Remittix (RTX), at $0.0734 with $14 million raised, solves an everyday concern—fast, affordable cross-border payments—and might see rapid growth if normal people embrace it. If your goal is to be the first crypto millionaire in your family, picking the coin that best tackles a huge real-world need could be your winning ticket. Ready to Give Remittix a Go?

Publicly available data shows that GCash, which is similar to China's Alipay or WeChat Pay, does over $65 billion (3.8 trillion Philippine Pesos) in annual transaction volume. Filipino remittances reached a record $38.3 billion in 2024, and account for approximately 8%-10% of the country's GDP. Alipay owner-Ant Group, Ayala Corporation and Manilla-based Globe Telecom's 917Ventures own GCash operator Mynt. GCash offers crypto services via its GCrypto subsidiary, which has partnered with locally licensed crypto exchange PDAX. In total GCrypto offers 39 different assets to trade on its platform, including Paypal's PYUSD stablecoin. Stablecoin-based transfers are growing as a share of the market but remain relatively small, with less than 5% of all inbound remittances using crypto rails. Recently, Bloomberg reported that GCash could seek an IPO valuation of at least $8 billion by the end of 2025. The company, reportedly, is in no rush to go public as it recently completed a funding round that raised its valuation to $5 billion, giving it enough capital and flexibility to wait for favorable market conditions.",Markets|USDC|Jeremy Allaire|Philippines,EN,0,0,USDC|MARKET|ASIA|EXCHANGE|PYUSD,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-24 05:32:49

As attention shifts toward altcoins and early-stage projects, sentiment is increasingly influenced by speculation, technical indicators, and forecasts of what might fuel the next wave of growth. Among the coins under scrutiny, Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching a key technical test, while at the same time, emerging presale projects like The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) are gaining traction and attracting bullish sentiment from analysts. Dogecoin Tests Resistance at $0.21 – Will It Hold or Break? Dogecoin has hovered in the $0.16 to $0.18 range in recent days, with $0.21 acting as a significant resistance level. This price point has served as a ceiling that DOGE is struggling to break through. Analysts suggest that a decisive move above $0.21 could validate a bullish breakout and potentially push the price toward $0.25 or beyond. So far, attempts to clear this zone has been met with selling pressure, revealing a lack of strong conviction among traders. If the asset fails to break this level, a period of sideways movement or a retracement toward $0.15 remains possible. While Dogecoin still enjoys strong brand recognition and community backing, its reliance on social media hype and the absence of major development updates continues to raise questions about its long-term viability. As a result, some investors are beginning to explore more utility-driven alternatives that offer not just speculative upside, but also real-world use cases and token utility. Investors Rotate into High-Upside Presales Historically, crypto presales have offered some of the best opportunities for outsized returns, allowing investors to enter projects at discounted prices before wider market exposure. In 2025, this trend remains strong, especially as market participants look for the “next big thing” beyond the top 20 coins. As capital rotates out of larger, slower-moving assets like DOGE, early-stage projects that integrate real utility and tap into fast-growing sectors are gaining momentum. Among these, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) is quickly emerging as a standout. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) – Where Gaming and Crypto Investing Converge The Last Dwarfs is pioneering a new model in crypto with its Play-to-Invest system, an evolution of the traditional play-to-earn concept. Instead of simply rewarding users with tokens for game participation, TLD allows players to mine resources, upgrade characters, and earn crypto by engaging with the platform. These in-game actions directly increase the farming of the $TLD token, which acts as an alternative to traditional staking. Through its Gamified Launchpad, players also gain early access to vetted blockchain projects, turning the act of gaming into an interactive and strategic investment experience. This approach makes The Last Dwarfs a fully-fledged crypto investment ecosystem. Unlike most presales, The Last Dwarfs already has a live platform and a user base of over 300,000 players. It’s also natively integrated with Telegram and the TON blockchain, offering one of the most frictionless Web3 onramps available today, ideal for both crypto veterans and newcomers alike. Stage 2 of the $TLD Presale is Live – Still Early, But Not for Long Following a successful Stage 1 sellout, the $TLD presale has moved into Stage 2, with tokens currently priced at $0.00852. This tiered system rewards early participants and builds organic demand ahead of listings. Investors can also benefit from: An exclusive Ref2Earn program which grants 15% bonus tokens for every referred purchase 300% APY Staking Rewards As the platform continues to scale and its token utility expands, many analysts see $TLD as one of the most promising early-stage tokens in 2025. Final Thoughts – From Meme Coins to Ecosystem Tokens Dogecoin’s future now hinges on whether it can finally break and hold above the $0.21 resistance level. While it remains popular, the lack of new development or broader use cases limits its growth potential. In contrast, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) offers a novel and sustainable model. With analysts forecasting that $TLD could potentially reach $0.50 or even $1 over the next market cycle, the project is gaining attention not just as a presale opportunity, but as a high-utility altcoin that could lead the next wave of growth in Web3 gaming and crypto investing.

Since formally embracing Bitcoin as a key part of its business, Metaplanet has quickly grown its holdings to become the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder in Asia.

In March alone, Metaplanet redeemed ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) in bonds ahead of schedule and raised another ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) through a new bond issuance . This strategy has allowed the company to continue buying Bitcoin without taking on debt with interest.

As the crypto market continues to expand, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is turning heads with its groundbreaking presale rewards and soaring investor interest. While Turbo and Dogwifhat have captured attention with their strong market performance, Arctic Pablo Coin is making waves with its high-yield staking, ultra-low presale price, and jaw-dropping ROI potential. This article will cover the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Turbo, and Dogwifhat, with a special focus on Arctic Pablo Coin’s thrilling presale momentum. Arctic Pablo Coin Offers 66% APY Staking During Presale – Earn While You Hold For investors looking to maximize their holdings, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an unmatched opportunity: a 66% APY staking reward during its presale phase. This feature allows holders to grow their tokens passively even before the coin is officially launched. With staking rewards this high, early investors can capitalize on the presale gains while earning additional tokens. Meme coins rarely provide such an incentive, making Arctic Pablo Coin stand out as one of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. As interest surges, early adopters are locking in their APC tokens, ensuring they benefit from both price appreciation and staking rewards. The question is—will you secure your APC before the presale ends? Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Reaches Nippy Nook – Time is Running Out! The Meme Coin presale has officially reached Nippy Nook, the 15th phase of its journey. At this stage, 1 APC is priced at just $0.000079, making it a golden entry point for investors before the price climbs higher. The potential ROI from Nippy Nook to the launch price of $0.008 is an astonishing 10,027.85%. This means a $100 investment today would secure 1,265,686 APC tokens, which could be worth $10,125.49 at launch. With over $1.96 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is gaining momentum fast. However, as each presale phase progresses, the price increases—meaning those who wait could be buying at a significantly higher price later. The current entry price is among the lowest available before Arctic Pablo Coin hits major exchanges. With supply tightening and demand skyrocketing, securing APC tokens now could be a strategic move for investors looking to maximize gains. Turbo Sustains Robust Market Performance in Meme Coin Arena Turbo continues to demonstrate resilience and strong market activity, currently trading at $0.002236 per TURBO/USD. The meme coin has achieved a substantial market capitalization of USD 154.28 million, reflecting its growing prominence in the cryptocurrency landscape. Bolstered by an impressive 24-hour trading volume of $31.84 million, Turbo showcases significant liquidity and investor enthusiasm. With steady momentum and sustained trading interest, the coin remains a formidable contender in the competitive meme coin space. As of March 19, 2025, Turbo’s consistent performance underscores its appeal among traders and crypto enthusiasts alike. Dogwifhat Solidifies It’s Standing in the Meme Coin Market Dogwifhat is currently priced at $0.480656 per WIF/USD, reflecting its strong presence in the cryptocurrency market as of March 19, 2025. With an impressive market capitalization of USD 480.10 million, the coin demonstrates significant value and widespread recognition. Its 24-hour trading volume of USD 160.86 million underscores robust investor engagement and exceptional liquidity, key indicators of its popularity. As demand continues to surge, Dogwifhat is cementing its status as a leading contender in the dynamic meme coin ecosystem, attracting attention from traders and enthusiasts seeking high-potential digital assets. Final thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Way for Meme Coin Investments The meme coin market is heating up, and investors are looking for the next big opportunity. Turbo and Dogwifhat continue to hold strong in the market, but Arctic Pablo Coin is creating a frenzy with its high APY staking, ultra-low presale price, and immense ROI potential. With APC priced at just $0.000079 in the Nippy Nook phase, early investors have the opportunity to lock in massive gains before prices rise. Over $1.96 million has already been raised, proving that investor confidence in Arctic Pablo Coin is surging. For those searching for the top new meme coins to buy for 2025, Arctic Pablo Coin is an unmissable opportunity. With the presale moving fast and prices set to increase, the time to secure APC at the lowest possible price is now.

In a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm announced plans to create a blockchain-based version of its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX). This move aims to tap into the rapidly growing tokenized asset market and use blockchain for more efficient transfers. FYHXX Fund Set to Launch on Ethereum FYHXX is an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills, which was launched late last year. The fund’s OnChain class currently operates on the Ethereum (ETH) network, with plans to expand to other blockchains in the future. The registration is pending regulatory approval, and the product is expected to launch on May 30. The filing comes amid a growing trend where global banks and asset managers are adopting blockchain technology to tokenize traditional financial assets like government bonds, credit, and funds. This shift, known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), offers the potential for enhanced operational efficiency, reduced costs, and the ability to settle transactions around the clock. Fidelity, with $5.8 trillion in assets, is the latest financial giant to dive into the booming tokenized U.S. Treasuries market. Previously, BlackRock, in collaboration with Securitize, launched the BUIDL tokenized T-bill fund last March, quickly dominating the market with $1.5 billion in assets. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton’s 2021 on-chain money market fund has gathered $689 million. Over $3.3 billion worth of real-world assets (RWAs) have been tokenized on the Ethereum network, with Stellar following at $465.6 million. BlackRock’s head of crypto, Robbie Mitchnick, recently stated that Ethereum is the “natural default” for traditional finance (TradFi) firms looking to tokenize RWAs. The entire tokenized U.S. Treasury market is booming, now worth $4.77 billion—a staggering 500% growth in just one year. Besides, Fidelity is also a leading issuer of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the U.S., with its FBTC ETF valued at $16.5 billion and FETH ETF at $780 million, based on SoSoValue data. BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund Sparks Confidence Amid Regulatory Shift The U.S. regulatory environment held back the growth of tokenized securities for years, with crypto seen as too risky by banks. However, things are changing quickly with Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies. BlackRock’s launch of the BUIDL fund marked a turning point, giving other firms the confidence to dive into the space. Fidelity and others, like Visa and Mastercard, are now embracing tokenization, with Visa launching a platform for banks and Tether introducing its own tokenization platform. Mastercard is also using blockchain for business payments. The Boston Consulting Group predicts tokenized assets could hit $600 billion by 2030, a major jump from the current $2 billion. Besides, even the CFTC is exploring new guidelines for tokenized assets as collateral.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 05:49:33
42248217,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142538,1742795434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Surge of Hope? Crypto Fear & Greed Index Climbs to 45, Still Cautious Market Mood",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-climbs/,"Cryptocurrency markets are known for their wild swings, keeping investors on their toes. One crucial tool to gauge these emotional shifts is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Imagine a barometer for crypto sentiment, swinging between extreme fear and unbridled greed. Recently, this index has shown a notable shift, sparking conversations among traders and analysts alike. Let’s dive into what this movement signifies for the current state of the crypto market. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, is not just another metric; it’s a composite gauge designed to reflect the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple 0-100 scale: 0-25: Extreme Fear – This zone suggests investors are excessively worried, often indicating a potential buying opportunity. 26-49: Fear – While still cautious, the market is less panicked than in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. 50-75: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic, potentially leading to market rallies. 76-100: Extreme Greed – This signals excessive optimism, which can be a warning sign of a potential market bubble or correction. Understanding this index is vital because market emotions—fear and greed—are powerful drivers in the volatile crypto world. High fear can lead to undervaluation and potential buying opportunities, while extreme greed can inflate prices beyond sustainable levels, often preceding market corrections. The Latest Shift: A 15-Point Jump in Crypto Sentiment As of March 24th, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stood at 45. This marks a significant 15-point increase from the previous day. This jump is noteworthy, suggesting a considerable shift in crypto sentiment . Think of it as the market taking a collective, slightly deeper breath. However, despite this positive movement, it’s crucial to note that the index remains in the “Fear” zone. This situation presents a mixed bag. On one hand, the rise indicates that the extreme pessimism might be easing. On the other hand, the persistent “Fear” zone suggests that underlying anxieties and uncertainties still dominate the market sentiment . Decoding the Components: What Drives the Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t based on a single data point. It’s a weighted average of several factors, providing a holistic view of market emotions. Here’s a breakdown of the components: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with average values to gauge market uncertainty. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares current market momentum and volume against recent averages to assess buying or selling pressure. Social Media Sentiment 15% Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit to understand public perception of the crypto market. Surveys 15% Periodic surveys (currently paused) gauging investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance can sometimes indicate a risk-off sentiment, while a falling dominance might suggest higher risk appetite in altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries to understand general public interest and attention. Analyzing the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Context While the index is often referred to as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , it’s heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and sentiment due to Bitcoin’s market dominance. Therefore, understanding the Bitcoin Fear and Greed dynamic is crucial for interpreting the overall index. The recent increase to 45, while still in fear, could be influenced by several factors related to Bitcoin, such as: Bitcoin Price Movements: Positive price action in Bitcoin can naturally reduce fear and nudge the index upwards. Bitcoin News and Developments: Positive news, like institutional adoption or regulatory clarity, can improve sentiment. Broader Market Conditions: Macroeconomic factors and global financial market sentiment also impact Bitcoin and, consequently, the index. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Analysis and You? For traders and investors, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index serves as a valuable supplementary tool for crypto market analysis . Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Investing: Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have sometimes presented opportunities to buy crypto assets at potentially lower prices, betting on a market rebound. Conversely, ‘Extreme Greed’ can be a signal to exercise caution and potentially take profits. Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm your own market analysis. If your fundamental analysis is bullish, but the Fear and Greed Index is showing ‘Extreme Fear’, it might be a signal of strong underlying opportunity. Risk Management: Be aware of the prevailing market sentiment. High greed environments might warrant tighter risk management strategies. Not a Standalone Indicator: Remember, the Fear and Greed Index is just one indicator. It should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for informed decision-making. Navigating the Fear Zone: A Cautious Glimmer of Hope? The 15-point rise in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is indeed a positive signal, indicating a lessening of extreme fear in the cryptocurrency market. However, the index firmly remaining in the ‘Fear’ zone serves as a reminder that caution is still warranted. The crypto market remains sensitive to various factors, and while sentiment has improved, significant uncertainties persist. This upward tick could be the beginning of a sustained positive trend, or it might just be a temporary reprieve in a longer period of market anxiety. Keeping a close watch on the index, alongside other market indicators and news developments, will be crucial for navigating the crypto landscape in the coming days and weeks.

WLFI purchased about 3.54 million MNT for nearly $3 million USDC for an average purchase price of 84 cents, according to data sources Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence . The recent purchase has increased WLFI's coin holdings, which include tokens like ETH, WBTC, TRX, LINK, AAVE, ENA, and others, to over $340 million. However, the Trump family-backed outlet still faced a paper loss of $111 million as of writing. MNT is the native cryptocurrency of the Mantle Network, serving as a utility token for gas fees and a governance token for the layer 2 ecosystem focused on scaling Ethereum. The Mantle Mainnet hard fork, or backwards-incompatible upgrade, took effect on March 19, activating EigenDA on the network. EigenDA is a secure, high-throughput, decentralized data availability service on Ethereum. The EigenDA integration is said to boost Mantle Network's scalability without hitting data rate limits, reportedly resulting in a 15 MB/s throughput. In other words, the network can process more transactions per block. Additionally, the upgrade has made the Mantle Network better compatible with Ethereum's impending Pectra upgrade.

She pointed out that more than half of people under 45 now own digital currencies but have no investments in stocks, a trend she believes could harm both individual wealth and the economy in the long run. The Importance of Stock Market Growth She said that stocks are crucial for company growth. Unlike cryptocurrencies, stocks provide funding for businesses, creating jobs, driving innovation, and contributing to the economy through taxes. “Cryptocurrencies are non-productive assets and don’t help the real economy,” she said. Gordon argues that while crypto may offer speculative gains, it lacks the tangible economic benefits that stocks provide. To address this, Gordon suggests reducing the 0.5% stamp duty on London-listed stocks and applying a similar tax to cryptocurrency transactions. She believes this could encourage more investment in traditional assets that support economic growth. Urging Action for the UK’s Financial Future As a member of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce, Gordon also called for better public understanding of capital markets to boost economic growth. While acknowledging the current challenges in the market, Gordon remains positive about the UK’s role as a financial hub. She urges the government to take action to attract more investments back into UK markets, which she believes is essential for maintaining London’s competitiveness in the global financial sector. The Cooling UK Stock Market Investment interest in stocks has been declining, with many investors turning to cryptocurrencies. According to a report from EY, only 18 companies were listed on the London Stock Exchange last year, while 88 companies either delisted or moved elsewhere.

There is no reason to build an L2. L1s can be faster, cheaper, and more secure. They aren’t slowed down by a glacially moving L1 data availability stack, or have to compromise security with complex fraud proofs and upgrade multisigs. https://t.co/Ov3YAfz9U4 — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) March 23, 2025 Yakovenko claimed that L2s heavily depend on the L1 scale for data availability and may entail intricate fraud proofs and multi-signature updates. He explained that Solana does not face such problems because it has separate execution and data layers on an efficient base layer. Yakovenko reacted negatively to Solana’s data generation, referring to it as “measly” at 80 terabytes per year while arguing that L1s cannot scale because of storage. He also warned users against creating baseless L2s, as he said at the beginning of this month, “You can skip creating a valueless L2 and just launch a token.” Solana competes with all Ethereum L2s, not Ethereum itself Yakovenko states that Solana’s architecture enables it to rival every Ethereum L2 solution directly, unlike Ethereum itself. He noted that there are many L2s, but it should not be like that because, ideally, there should be an L2 that can meet the present need and at the same time has the potential to fulfil all the functions thanks to the design. “There is no point to multiple L2s … if a single L2 can handle parallel execution, then it can use up all the blobspace and run every use case.” – Yakovenko His comments align with the perspective that only a few important smart contracts exist, hence the apparent overproduction of L2s. He further claimed that L2s act parasitically since they perpetuate their language ecosystems to the detriment of the L1. Ethereum’s strategy faces questions as L2 networks multiply Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has also recently taken the opposite view. While addressing the Digital Asset Summit, Lubin stated that Ethereum’s future is in L2 scaling networks. He said that one of the most significant accomplishments of Ethereum was Linea, a product of ConsenSys. He also mentioned MegaETH, which is planned to be further developed, implying faster and cheaper operations. Lubin pointed to Ethereum’s security and the readiness of L2s to create their basis on that platform as its main benefits. However, an upgrade in March 2024 caused the Dencun transaction fees to reduce by 95%, which raised some questions. While it was beneficial for L2s, Ethereum base-layer revenue declined by 99% to the end of the year. More than 140 scaling solutions and 60 roll-up networks are currently on Ethereum, causing concern for fragmentation and value capture on the top chain. Ethereum users have also criticized the blockchain for lacking permission-less characteristics. Naveen Spark, a commentator on X, said that Ethereum is permissioned as of now since new entrants into the network have to invest in know-your-customer (KYC) checks to acquire ETH. He also notes that privacy tools are not pre-built-in, leaving new users in what he called a ‘surveillance world.’ However, another user, rip.eth, was quick to counter the argument, stating that Ethereum is still permissionless and enhances different levels of privacy. However, Naveen maintained that the beginning has shifted for new users since Ethereum has switched to proof-of-stake. Ethereum faces support test Ethereum is close to a key support zone, and more than 3 million addresses hold 6.12 million ETH at a price range of between $1,886 and $1,944. As a tweet from ali_charts pointed out, this range has become the main barrier to a deeper decline so far. The current ETH price is at $2,003, just above the support band, which focuses much on whether the buyers will hold this level. According to the on-chain data, 70.43% of all ETH can be classified as “in the money,” with 29.08% in loss. More than 99.5% of ether holders are at breakeven, which means they have yet to make a profit. Finally, the support cluster has very high buying signals, which means that prices will likely react at these levels. Ethereum balance on exchanges. Source: ali_charts on X A sudden decline in exchange balances has raised a new significant factor in the market during the past few weeks. In the last 48 days, more than 1,200,000 ETH has been moved out of exchanges. Data obtained from Glassnode reveals that centralized exchange reserves of ETH reduced from 18,155,000 in early February to about 16,967,000 on March 22nd.

The winds of institutional adoption are blowing stronger than ever. In a monumental leap for digital assets, BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) has just smashed through the $1 billion mark in Ethereum (ETH). This isn’t just another number; it’s a powerful statement about the growing confidence and significant capital flowing into the crypto space, spearheaded by one of the world’s largest asset managers. Let’s dive deep into what this explosive milestone means for the future of finance and Ethereum. Why is BlackRock BUIDL’s $1 Billion ETH Milestone a Big Deal? Reaching $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) is a significant achievement for any fund, but for BUIDL, it’s particularly noteworthy for several reasons: Institutional Validation: BlackRock, a traditional finance behemoth, venturing deeper into crypto sends a resounding message to the market. It signals that institutional investment in digital assets is not just a fleeting trend but a serious and growing area of interest. Tokenization Taking Center Stage: BUIDL is a tokenized fund on a public blockchain. Its success underscores the increasing appeal and practicality of tokenization – representing traditional assets on the blockchain for enhanced efficiency and accessibility. Ethereum’s Expanding Ecosystem: The fact that BUIDL holds over $1 billion in ETH directly benefits the Ethereum ecosystem. It demonstrates institutional demand for ETH and contributes to the network’s growth and maturity. Broader Market Impact: This milestone can act as a catalyst, encouraging other institutional investors to explore and allocate capital to crypto assets, further fueling market growth and innovation. Decoding Tokenized Funds: What Exactly is BUIDL? For those still wrapping their heads around tokenization, let’s break down what BlackRock’s BUIDL fund represents: Traditional Finance Meets Blockchain: BUIDL is essentially a bridge connecting traditional financial products with the world of blockchain. It’s a fund managed by BlackRock, but its units are issued as tokens on a public blockchain. USD-Denominated and Stable: As the name suggests, BUIDL is a USD-denominated fund. This likely aims to offer stability and reduce volatility compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies, appealing to more risk-averse institutional investors. Liquidity and Accessibility: Tokenization can enhance liquidity and accessibility. Tokenized fund units can potentially be traded more easily and efficiently than traditional fund shares, especially in a 24/7 global market. Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology provides transparency and efficiency benefits. Transactions and holdings of tokenized funds can be publicly verifiable on the blockchain, fostering trust and potentially reducing operational costs. Institutional Investment in Crypto: Why Now, and Why Ethereum? The increasing institutional interest in crypto, exemplified by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, is driven by several converging factors: Maturing Crypto Market: The crypto market has matured significantly over the years. While volatility remains, the infrastructure, regulatory clarity (in some regions), and range of investment products have improved, making it more palatable for institutions. Demand for Diversification: Institutional investors are constantly seeking diversification to optimize portfolio returns and manage risk. Crypto assets, with their relatively low correlation to traditional markets, offer a compelling diversification avenue. Potential for Higher Returns: Despite the risks, crypto assets have demonstrated the potential for significant returns, attracting institutions looking for alpha generation opportunities in a low-yield environment. Ethereum’s Smart Contract Advantage: Ethereum’s role as the leading platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) makes it particularly attractive for institutional investment. Tokenized funds like BUIDL often leverage Ethereum’s infrastructure. Benefits and Challenges of Tokenized Funds like BUIDL Tokenized funds like BUIDL offer a range of potential benefits, but also come with certain challenges: Benefits Challenges Increased Efficiency: Streamlined processes, faster settlement, and reduced administrative overhead. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for tokenized securities is still evolving globally, creating uncertainty. Enhanced Liquidity: Potential for 24/7 trading and fractional ownership, improving market liquidity. Security Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities and custody risks associated with digital assets. Greater Accessibility: Potentially opens up investment opportunities to a wider range of investors. Interoperability Issues: Challenges in seamless interaction between different blockchain platforms and traditional systems. Transparency: Blockchain’s inherent transparency enhances trust and auditability. Adoption Hurdles: Requires education and adoption from both traditional financial institutions and investors. Examples of Other Institutional Crypto Moves BlackRock’s BUIDL success is part of a broader trend of institutional adoption in crypto. Here are a few other examples showcasing this growing interest: Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the US marked a watershed moment, providing a regulated and accessible way for institutions and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Holdings: MicroStrategy, a publicly traded company, has famously adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, holding billions of dollars worth of BTC. Institutional Custody Solutions: Companies like Coinbase Custody and Fidelity Digital Assets are providing secure custody solutions specifically tailored for institutional investors holding digital assets. Pension Fund Investments: While still nascent, some pension funds and endowments are starting to cautiously allocate a small percentage of their portfolios to crypto assets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? The rise of BlackRock’s BUIDL and broader institutional interest in crypto offers several actionable insights: Keep an Eye on Tokenization: Tokenization is poised to revolutionize various industries beyond finance. Understanding its potential applications can be valuable. Ethereum’s Continued Relevance: Ethereum remains a critical infrastructure layer for the crypto ecosystem and institutional adoption, solidifying its long-term relevance. Institutional Crypto is Here to Stay: The involvement of major players like BlackRock signals that institutional crypto investment is not a fad but a long-term trend. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While institutional interest is encouraging, always conduct thorough research before investing in any crypto asset. Understand the risks and potential rewards. Conclusion: A Billion-Dollar Bet on the Future of Finance BlackRock’s BUIDL fund surpassing $1 billion in ETH is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful indicator of the evolving landscape of finance. It underscores the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the crypto world, with tokenization and Ethereum playing pivotal roles. As institutions like BlackRock continue to explore and invest in digital assets, the future of finance is undeniably becoming more decentralized, transparent, and accessible. This is a journey just beginning, and the $1 billion mark is simply one giant leap in what promises to be an explosive evolution.

Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), said in a March 21 note that Trump administration officials, including Elon Musk, have floated using a blockchain to track US gold and government spending — an idea supported by crypto executives. “Here’s the thing about blockchains. They’re not very smart,” Cipolaro said. “They’re limited in the information they convey. For example, Bitcoin has no idea what the price of Bitcoin is or even the current time.” He said the tokenization or tracking of gold reserves on a blockchain could help with audits and transparency but would still “rely on trust and coordination with central entities” compared to Bitcoin, which “was designed to explicitly remove centralized entities.” Cipolaro added that tokenization and blockchain-tracking ideas aren’t competitive with the crypto market and might help to increase awareness of it, which “could ultimately benefit Bitcoin.” It comes amid calls from some for an independent audit of the United States’ gold reserves. Republican Senator Rand Paul last month seemingly called on Musk’s federal cost-cutting project to investigate the US government’s gold stash at the Bullion Depository in Fort Knox, which the US Mint says holds around half of the country’s gold. The Treasury audits and publishes reports on gold holdings at Fort Knox and other locations across the US every month, but President Donald Trump and Musk have both parrotted decades-old conspiracy theories about the gold and questioned whether it’s all still there. Source: Elon Musk Related: Who’s running in Trump’s race to make US a ‘Bitcoin superpower?' They have both pushed for an independent audit of Fort Knox. The vaults were last opened in 2017 for Trump’s then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to view the gold and before that, in 1974 to a congressional delegation and a group of journalists. The Mint’s website says that no gold has gone in or out of Fort Knox “for many years,” except for “very small quantities” used to test the gold’s purity during audits. Trump’s Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said last month that Fort Knox is audited every year and “all the gold is present and accounted for.” Magazine: Elon Musk’s plan to run government on blockchain faces uphill battle",,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-24 05:57:01

But now things are changing, Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana saw strong gains early Monday as reports suggested that the upcoming Trump tariffs on April 2 might not be as aggressive as previously feared. This shift in expectations helped improve market sentiment, leading to a rally in both equities and cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Solana Lead the Charge Following the news, Bitcoin climbed 2.7% in the last 24 hours, trading around $86,500, while Solana (SOL) jumped nearly 6% to $138. XRP also moved higher, rising 2.5% to $2.44, holding above its 50-day moving average after two weeks of positive price action. The rally came as U.S. stock futures, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, saw a 0.5% boost, while the VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, dropped 2.5%. Trump’s Tariffs: A Softer Approach? Initially, concerns over Trump’s planned tariffs had sent markets lower, with Bitcoin dropping nearly 17.6% in February. However, recent reports indicate that the tariffs could be more targeted than previously expected. Some countries may be exempt, and the additional levies on steel and other metals might not be cumulative. This news has calmed investors, sparking optimism across financial markets. Federal Reserve and Market Outlook The Federal Reserve recently updated its outlook, raising inflation expectations but sticking to its plan for two interest rate cuts this year. It also dismissed worries that tariffs would cause lasting inflation, calling the impact temporary. This has boosted confidence in riskier investments like Bitcoin. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, believes Bitcoin will hit $110,000 before dropping to $76,500 again. He argues that the Fed’s shift from tightening to easing policies will keep the crypto market strong despite inflation fears. Will it Backfire? While the news has improved sentiment, analysts warn that unexpected developments or a tougher stance from Trump could still impact markets in the coming days. Crypto expert Peter Schiff criticized Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff plan, arguing that instead of restoring America’s wealth, it will expose the country’s deep reliance on global productivity and savings. He suggests that the U.S. is no longer as strong as it once was and that these tariffs may highlight economic weaknesses rather than solve them. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Robert Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin Warning: Fear of Mistakes Is Costing You Wealth , Key Events to Watch All eyes are now on two key events that could shape market sentiment in the coming days.

Meanwhile, Friday’s PCE reading, the Fed’s go-to inflation measure, will offer more insights into future monetary policy. With tariff worries easing and the Fed staying accommodative, the crypto market is regaining momentum, hinting at more upside in the near term. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After reaching a local peak in December, LINK faced significant selling pressure. However, a new structure is now forming on a broader time frame, suggesting a potential shift in momentum, according to the analyst firm. The analyst firm has identified the following as key levels to watch in the LINK price: $16.5 – $17.3: Current test zone, aligned with previous support and intersecting with the downtrend line. $20.2 – $21.7: A strong resistance area, a break above this level could open the way to LINK’s upper trading range. $12.6: A key support level that marks the lower uptrend line. Holding this level could be a bullish sign. At the time of writing, LINK is trading at $14.34. According to the analytics firm, Chainlink is currently at a crossroads balancing between structural support and a potential breakout. The range around $17 remains the key short-term turning point that could determine whether LINK continues its uptrend. *This is not investment advice.

Leading crypto exchange Bybit has just announced a significant expansion to its trading platform. Mark your calendars for March 24th because Bybit is set to list new spot trading pairs featuring USDQ, a stablecoin with a unique regulatory edge. This move is generating buzz among traders and investors alike. Let’s delve into what this exciting development means for you and the crypto market. What’s the Buzz About Bybit Listing USDQ Pairs? Bybit, renowned for its robust trading infrastructure and diverse offerings, is continuously evolving to meet the demands of the dynamic cryptocurrency market. The upcoming listing of USDQ/USDT and BTC/USDQ pairs is a testament to Bybit’s commitment to providing users with access to innovative and compliant digital assets. Specifically, the introduction of USDQ stablecoin pairs opens up new avenues for trading and portfolio diversification. But what makes USDQ stand out? According to Bybit’s official announcement, the listing schedule is as follows: USDQ/USDT Spot Pair: Launching at 08:00 UTC on March 24 BTC/USDQ Spot Pair: Launching at 09:00 UTC on March 24 This staggered launch provides traders with a phased entry into these new markets, allowing for careful observation and strategic positioning. The addition of these pairs signifies Bybit’s proactive approach to incorporating regulated stablecoins into its ecosystem, potentially attracting a broader range of users who prioritize compliance and stability. Understanding USDQ Stablecoin and MiCA Compliance The spotlight is undoubtedly on USDQ. It’s not just another stablecoin; it’s designed with a keen eye on regulatory frameworks, particularly Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). This is a crucial detail because MiCA is poised to become a landmark regulatory framework for the crypto industry in Europe, setting standards for transparency, consumer protection, and operational integrity. Being designed to comply with MiCA from the outset gives USDQ stablecoin a distinct advantage in the evolving regulatory landscape. Here’s a breakdown of why USDQ’s MiCA compliance is noteworthy: Regulatory Foresight: USDQ’s proactive approach to MiCA compliance demonstrates a forward-thinking strategy, anticipating future regulatory requirements rather than reacting to them. Enhanced Trust: Compliance with regulations like MiCA can boost investor confidence in USDQ, as it signals a commitment to operating within established legal frameworks. European Market Access: Being MiCA compliant could potentially facilitate easier access to the European market for USDQ, opening up opportunities for wider adoption and usage within the EU. Dutch Regulation: USDQ is licensed under Dutch regulation, adding another layer of credibility and oversight to its operations. In essence, USDQ is positioning itself as a regulated and reliable stablecoin option, particularly for users and institutions seeking to navigate the increasingly regulated crypto space. This focus on compliance could be a major draw for traders looking for stablecoins that prioritize legal clarity and operational transparency. Exploring BTC/USDQ Pair and Spot Trading Opportunities The introduction of the BTC/USDQ pair alongside USDQ/USDT presents exciting new spot trading opportunities for Bybit users. Spot trading, in its essence, is the direct buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery. This differs from futures or derivatives trading, where contracts are traded rather than the underlying assets themselves. Let’s examine the potential benefits of spot trading these new pairs: Direct Exposure to USDQ: Spot trading allows traders to directly acquire and hold USDQ, providing exposure to this MiCA-compliant stablecoin. Diversification: The BTC/USDQ pair offers an alternative trading avenue for Bitcoin holders, allowing them to diversify their trading strategies beyond traditional fiat or major stablecoin pairings. Hedging Opportunities: In volatile market conditions, USDQ could serve as a hedging instrument against Bitcoin price fluctuations, particularly for users who believe in the stability and regulatory advantages of USDQ. Arbitrage Potential: The launch of new pairs can sometimes create arbitrage opportunities across different exchanges, although these are often short-lived and require rapid execution. For traders familiar with spot trading , the addition of USDQ pairs expands the trading landscape on Bybit, offering fresh instruments for portfolio management and market participation. It’s crucial to understand the dynamics of spot trading and the specific characteristics of USDQ to effectively leverage these new opportunities. Why Crypto Exchange Listings Matter for Traders Listings on prominent crypto exchanges like Bybit are pivotal events in the lifecycle of any cryptocurrency or token. These listings can significantly impact a digital asset’s visibility, liquidity, and accessibility. For traders, exchange listings often translate into a range of benefits and considerations. Here’s why exchange listings are so important: Benefit Description Increased Liquidity Listing on a major exchange like Bybit typically leads to a surge in trading volume, enhancing the liquidity of the listed pairs. Higher liquidity means tighter spreads and easier order execution for traders. Enhanced Visibility Exchange listings expose the asset to a wider audience of traders and investors. Bybit’s user base will now have direct access to USDQ and BTC/USDQ trading, boosting its market presence. Price Discovery Listings contribute to price discovery by facilitating more trading activity and market participation. The interaction of buyers and sellers on a reputable exchange helps establish a more transparent and market-driven price for the asset. Accessibility Listing on a user-friendly platform like Bybit makes the asset more accessible to a broader range of traders, including both retail and institutional participants. For USDQ, being listed on Bybit is a significant step forward in its journey to broader adoption and market recognition. For Bybit users, it means more trading options and the opportunity to engage with a stablecoin that is proactively addressing regulatory requirements. Navigating Spot Trading on Bybit: A Quick Guide If you’re keen to explore spot trading of USDQ/USDT and BTC/USDQ pairs on Bybit, here’s a quick guide to get you started: Account Setup: Ensure you have a verified account on Bybit. If you’re new to Bybit, the registration process is straightforward. Fund Your Account: Deposit USDT or other cryptocurrencies supported by Bybit into your spot account to trade USDQ/USDT, or deposit BTC to trade BTC/USDQ. Navigate to Spot Trading: Once logged in, navigate to the ‘Spot’ trading section on the Bybit platform. Select Trading Pair: Search for ‘USDQ/USDT’ or ‘BTC/USDQ’ in the trading pair selection. Place Your Order: Choose your order type (limit, market, etc.), enter the amount you wish to trade, and execute your trade. Monitor Your Trades: Keep an eye on your open orders and positions in the ‘Orders’ and ‘Positions’ sections. Bybit offers a user-friendly interface for both beginners and experienced traders, making it easy to navigate the spot trading environment. Remember to always conduct your own research and understand the risks involved in cryptocurrency trading before engaging with new trading pairs. Conclusion: Embrace the New USDQ Trading Era on Bybit Bybit’s decision to list USDQ/USDT and BTC/USDQ spot trading pairs marks an exciting development for both the exchange and the broader crypto community. The introduction of USDQ stablecoin , with its focus on MiCA compliance and Dutch regulation, adds a layer of regulatory assurance to the stablecoin landscape. For traders, this means new opportunities for portfolio diversification, spot trading strategies, and exposure to a potentially groundbreaking stablecoin. As March 24th approaches, the crypto market eagerly anticipates the launch of these new pairs, ready to explore the possibilities they unlock.

Notably, marketing lead Lucie revealed key factors that make the dog-themed meme coin a perfect fit for an ETF product. In the wake of recent broader global pro-crypto shifts, traders and investors anticipate a SHIB price rally to kick off, given this feat actually happens. Simultaneously, a phenomenal +8000% surge in the dog-themed coin’s burn rate intraday solidified bullish market sentiments about price. Is Shiba Inu ETF Filing Possible? Lucie’s Post Sparks Optimism According to a recent X post by Lucie , the dog-themed meme coin shows strong characteristics that make it a good pick for a Shiba Inu ETF. Lucie reveals that the meme coin is available on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs, including all the top crypto trading platforms. In the wake of this aspect, the marketing lead calls the crypto an absolute pick for an ETF product due to its global accessibility. “Because SHIB isn’t just a meme—it’s decentralized, community-driven, and built to last,” she concluded. Primarily, these statements gained significant traction across the broader market in sync with the recent optimistic waves generated by crypto-backed ETF filings. CoinGape reported that Canary Capital recently filed an S-1 for SUI ETF approval with the U.S. SEC. Also, the odds of a DOGE ETF approval soared as the US SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for it previously. The speculations of a Dogecoin ETF filing by BlackRock also remain on the rise amid broader crypto-ETF filings. Altogether, these developments inject significant optimism towards the odds of a Shiba Inu ETF filing ahead. SHIB Burn Rate Surge Adds Market Optimism A staggering 8454% surge in the SHIB burn rate this Monday added to investors’ bullishness on price. Slightly over 1 billion coins were burnt in the past 24 hours, dealing a massive hit to the meme coin’s circulating supply. In turn, bullish investor sentiments about price prevail, abiding by the law of supply and demand. For context, the burn mechanism permanently reduces the meme coin’s supply by sending tokens to a null address. As a result, market sentiments about future price action take a paradigm bullish shift. Source: Shibburn site The total circulating supply after the massive blow was evaluated as 584.35 trillion coins. When coupled with the Shiba Inu ETF filing speculations, these developments signal that a price rally looms. SHIB Price Overview Today As of press time, SHIB price witnessed a 1% increase in value, closing in at $0.00001303. The coin bottomed and peaked at $0.0000128 and $0.00001309 in the past 24 hours. Notably, the rising action falls in line with the recent burn rate surge and soaring optimism for an ETF filing ahead. Simultaneously, Coinglass data underscored rising market interest in the asset. Shiba Inu futures OI was up by 3.5% to $121.69 million. Also, the derivatives volume spiked by 24% to $71.18 million. Overall, the current sentiment for the meme coins appears to be bullish amid recent advancements, such as a burn rate surge and Shiba Inu ETF odds on the rise.

The digital asset world is buzzing with news of a colossal 250 million USDC minted directly from the USDC Treasury. This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a significant injection into the stablecoin ecosystem, and naturally, the ever-watchful eyes of the crypto community are trying to decipher what this means. Was this a planned move? Does it signal increased institutional demand? Or is there something else brewing beneath the surface? Let’s dive deep into this intriguing development and explore the potential ripples across the crypto landscape. What’s the Buzz About USDC Minting? First things first, for those newer to the crypto space, let’s quickly break down what USDC is and why minting it is a noteworthy event. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Think of it as a digital dollar designed for the internet age. It’s issued by Circle, a reputable financial technology company, and Centre, a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins like USDC aim to maintain a stable value, making them ideal for transactions, trading, and as a safe haven in the often turbulent crypto market . Minting , in the context of stablecoins, is the process of creating new tokens. When demand for USDC increases, or when Circle anticipates future demand, they can ‘mint’ more USDC. This process is usually backed by reserves of fiat currency (in this case, US dollars) held in custody, ensuring that each USDC token is indeed equivalent to one US dollar. The recent whale alert from transaction trackers indicates a substantial increase in the USDC supply, prompting questions and speculations across the crypto community. Decoding the 250 Million USDC Mint: Why Should You Care? So, 250 million USDC is a large number – but what does it actually mean for you, the average crypto user or investor? Here’s a breakdown of potential implications: Increased Market Liquidity: A larger supply of USDC generally translates to increased liquidity within the crypto market. More USDC available means more capital readily available for trading and investment across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized platforms. This can lead to tighter spreads and smoother trading experiences. Potential Indicator of Bullish Sentiment: Large mints of stablecoins are sometimes seen as a precursor to increased buying activity in the broader crypto market. Traders and investors often move funds into stablecoins like USDC when they anticipate deploying capital into other cryptocurrencies. This massive mint could suggest that significant players are preparing to increase their positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. However, it’s crucial to remember correlation doesn’t equal causation, and other factors could be at play. Growing Institutional Interest?: Large USDC mints can also indicate growing institutional adoption of stablecoins and the crypto space in general. Institutions often require stable and regulated on-ramps and off-ramps to the crypto market, and USDC, with its regulatory compliance and backing, is a popular choice. A 250 million USDC mint might suggest a significant institutional player is entering or expanding their crypto holdings. Operational Needs of Circle: It’s also important to consider that this mint could simply be for Circle’s operational needs. They might be anticipating increased redemption requests or preparing for partnerships and integrations that require a larger USDC reserve. While less market-moving than the other points, it’s a plausible explanation. USDC vs. Other Stablecoins: What’s the Difference? The stablecoin landscape is becoming increasingly crowded, with USDT (Tether), BUSD (Binance USD), and DAI (Dai) being some of the other major players. So, why does USDC stand out, and why is its minting so closely watched? Here’s a quick comparison: Feature USDC USDT (Tether) BUSD (Binance USD) DAI (Dai) Issuer Circle & Centre Tether Limited Binance & Paxos MakerDAO (Decentralized) Peg USD USD USD USD (Algorithmic) Transparency & Audits Regular audits, transparent reserves Historically less transparent, improving transparency Audited, transparent reserves Transparent on-chain, decentralized governance Regulatory Compliance Strong focus on compliance Facing regulatory scrutiny Regulated, issued by Paxos Trust Company Decentralized, less regulatory clarity USDC is often perceived as a more regulated and transparent stablecoin compared to some of its competitors, particularly USDT. This focus on compliance and transparency makes it attractive to institutions and users who prioritize security and regulatory clarity. Therefore, significant movements in USDC supply, like this 250 million mint, often garner more attention and are interpreted with a greater degree of seriousness by the market. Whale Alert : Following the Big Crypto Moves The news of this USDC minting originated from Whale Alert , a popular service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. These ‘whale alerts’ are invaluable for understanding the movements of significant players in the crypto market. Large transactions can often foreshadow market trends, shifts in sentiment, or strategic maneuvers by institutions or wealthy individuals (‘whales’). Following whale alerts related to stablecoin mints, especially USDC, can provide early signals of potential market activity. While not every large mint translates to immediate price action, it’s a crucial data point to consider alongside other market indicators. For instance, monitoring inflows and outflows of USDC to and from exchanges, as tracked by whale alert systems, can offer insights into buying and selling pressure. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights So, what should you do with this information about the 250 million USDC mint? Here are some actionable insights: Keep an Eye on Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts in the coming days and weeks. Does Bitcoin or Ethereum see a price surge? Are altcoins gaining momentum? While the USDC mint isn’t a guaranteed predictor, it’s a potential catalyst to watch. Monitor USDC Supply and Circulation: Track the total supply of USDC and its circulation across exchanges and DeFi platforms. Significant increases in circulating supply following a mint can indicate actual deployment of these funds into the market. Stay Informed with Whale Alerts: Continue to follow services like Whale Alert for further insights into large crypto transactions, including stablecoin movements and significant transfers of other cryptocurrencies. This real-time data can help you stay ahead of potential market shifts. Diversify Your Research: Don’t rely solely on one data point. Combine information about USDC mints with other forms of market analysis, including technical analysis, on-chain metrics, and fundamental research, for a well-rounded understanding of the crypto market. Conclusion: A Massive Mint and the Crypto Market’s Next Chapter The shocking 250 million USDC mint is undoubtedly a significant event in the stablecoin and broader crypto market narrative. Whether it’s a signal of impending bullish momentum, institutional accumulation, or simply operational adjustments by Circle, it warrants close attention. By understanding the nuances of USDC , minting processes, and utilizing tools like whale alerts , you can navigate the dynamic crypto landscape with greater awareness and make more informed decisions. The crypto world never sleeps, and developments like this USDC mint keep the story constantly evolving, offering both opportunities and challenges for those who dare to participate.

The total crypto market cap has edged 1 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $2.94 trillion on Monday, March 24, during the early European session. Last week’s gold price rally to a new all-time high of above $3k has significantly boosted the bullish sentiment for the wider crypto market. Moreover, global markets have largely factored in the U.S.-led tariff wars. What to Expect of Bitcoin this Week Bitcoin price opened earlier today with a bullish outlook after closing the last two weeks in the green. The renewed interest in Bitcoin from whale investors, as shown by the declining supply of BTC on centralized exchanges and notable cash inflows of U.S. spot BTC ETFs, helped the flagship surge to nearly $87k at the time of this writing. From a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin price is aiming for $91k in the coming days after piercing through a previously established falling logarithmic trend. However, Bitcoin price must consistently close above $87k in the coming days to invalidate a potential selloff below $80k. Ethereum Price Prediction According to on-chain data, the overall demand for Ethereum remains low compared to Bitcoin. However, Ether’s price has a high correlation with Bitcoin, based on historical trends. Moreover, Ether’s price gained over 7 percent last week to trade at about $2,048 on Monday. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $247 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $10 billion, has also signaled a possible momentum reversal. After closing last week with a bullish outlook, Ether’s price is likely to regain $2,100 as a support level by the end of this week. XRP Price Forecast Following the closure of the Ripple vs SEC case last week , XRP price has signaled the onset of the second bullish trend toward price discovery.
