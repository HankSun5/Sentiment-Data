42227728,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104036,1742763908,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Tron Considering Bitcoin Inspired Halving — Will TRX go Above $0.4 in the Next Bull Phase?,https://zycrypto.com/tron-considering-bitcoin-inspired-halving-will-trx-go-above-0-4-in-the-next-bull-phase/,"Tron founder Justin Sun recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to raise public awareness regarding the digital currency’s proposed block reward halving. He drew parallels with Bitcoin’s much-touted 4-year halving cycle, in which the premier cryptocurrency undergoes a major bull phase followed by a bearish cooldown before starting things all over again in the ensuing couple of years. Sun wants TRX to eventually settle down on a similar halving cycle because it showcases the maturity of the digital asset. He tweeted : “….As the Bitcoin network grew, block rewards gradually decreased. In the early days, higher rewards were necessary for bootstrapping the network. However, as Bitcoin’s price surged, block rewards were lowered, and the halving cycle played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s long-term sustainability—aligning with Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision….” The New TRX Block Reward Halving Proposal On paper, following BTC seems like a straightforward proposal: periodically decrease the block reward halving to mimic the top cryptocurrency, and it can follow the same trajectory. However, in reality, it is easier said than done. Many other digital currencies have tried to come up with a similar model but failed to maintain a strong periodic foothold in the market like Bitcoin. However, Sun is very enthusiastic about the proposal currently being analyzed by the Tron community. The suggestion titled “Reduce TRX block rewards #738” presents several deflationary tactics, like reducing the block reward by 50% to 1.5-2% per year. Currently, it is set at 1%, which is apparently not enough to kickstart a BTC-like halving cycle. However, the Tron community has not provided definitive word on this proposal, but it is expected to be put to a vote soon. Sun tweeted: “Ultimately, this decision rests with the TRX community!” TRX to Rise to $0.4? Here is the TRX/USD graph from the last 4 months: Image Source: TradingView TRX is the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It has been able to cling to this coveted position during the last few months, especially during a time of turmoil in the markets. But, like the rest of the crypto market cap, it has experienced significant losses in dollar terms. It recorded an All-Time High (ATH) of $0.44 at the end of November 2024 but has since lost 50% against the greenback and has struggled to remain above $0.24 for long periods. A $0.4 valuation is very much in the realm of possibility, but a major market rebound or a successful block reward halving will be needed to supercharge the cryptocurrency’s market position. The Future While TRX’s long-term future depends on the larger cryptocurrency market, it can also make its way if it offers the perfect tokenization recipe. The network is resurgent and its growing use case in the sprawling meme coin economy has breathed new life into the digital network.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Tron News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRX|MARKET|TRADING|MINING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-23 21:05:08

Cosmos and Algorand Gain Strength,https://thecoinrise.com/can-qubetics-testnet-launch-secure-its-spot-as-the-best-crypto-presale-to-invest-this-week-cosmos-and-algorand-gain-strength/,"Crypto markets are heating up again, but not all eyes are on the usual suspects this time. With presale stages creating buzz, discerning participants are searching for the best crypto presale to invest this week. Amid the noise, a few projects stand out—not for hype, but for their robust ecosystems, technology, and real-world use cases. Qubetics has emerged as a top contender, gaining momentum with its successful testnet launch. Alongside it, Cosmos and Algorand continue to prove their worth with unique innovations in blockchain interoperability and financial-grade applications. These projects offer compelling reasons to watch closely, especially for those seeking quality beyond the speculative frenzy. Qubetics Testnet Go Live: Setting a New Standard for the Best Crypto Presale to Invest This Week Qubetics takes a giant leap forward by activating its TestNet —a major step from its alpha testnet phase. This launch is not just ceremonial. It provides a secure environment where developers, validators, and community members can engage directly with the platform, testing features without risking financial loss. Performance tuning, enhanced security protocols, and smooth transaction testing pave the way for a robust mainnet rollout. What sets Qubetics apart is its advanced Qubetics Wallet , designed to streamline complex financial operations for businesses, professionals, and individual users. The wallet eliminates reliance on third-party custodians by enabling complete control over digital assets. This user-centric approach enhances security while simplifying DeFi participation, token management, and smart contract execution. Strategic alliances with industry heavyweights such as 1inch , SWFT , and CertiK further boost Qubetics’ credibility. CertiK’s auditing prowess is widely respected, while 1inch and SWFT ensure liquidity and efficient cross-chain transactions. Together, these partnerships reinforce Qubetics’ mission to deliver a secure, reliable, and highly functional ecosystem. Qubetics Presale and ROI Projections With over 502 million $TICS tokens sold to 23,500 holders, the crypto presale has already raised $15.3 million in its 26th presale stage. At $0.1181 per token, Qubetics presents a prime opportunity for early buyers aiming for long-term rewards. Analysts project impressive potential returns: $1 post-presale — 746.05% ROI $5 post-presale — 4,130% ROI $6 post-presale — 4,976% ROI $10 post-presale — 8,360% ROI $15 post-mainnet launch — 12,590% ROI These forecasts, though exciting, come with the usual crypto market risks. Still, such metrics solidify Qubetics as the best crypto presale to invest this week. Cosmos Powers Ahead: Breaking Barriers and Bearish Trends Cosmos (ATOM) has seen a sharp turnaround after enduring a grueling stretch that pushed its price from $10 to $3.62 by March 10. However, with a 22% surge in the last week, ATOM now stands at $4.67—and momentum continues to build. Technical indicators point toward sustained strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) readings are bullish, confirming heightened buying pressure. Social dominance has risen to 0.27%, signaling growing market buzz around Cosmos. A recent breakout from a descending triangle pattern invalidated the bearish outlook. ATOM now trades above the 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a classic sign of trend reversal. Additionally, the Bull Bear Power (BBP) remains in positive territory, affirming bullish control. Cosmos could soon break the $5 resistance if momentum holds, potentially climbing toward $6.21, aligning with the golden ratio Fibonacci level. While risks persist, Cosmos reclaims its spot as a blockchain worthy of attention this week. Algorand’s Strategic Moves: Is It Joining the Best Crypto Presale to Invest This Week Club? Algorand (ALGO), currently trading near $0.2480, is turning heads in 2025 for reasons beyond price action. Algorand’s tech is gaining real-world relevance, especially through its DeRec Alliance partnership with Hedera and Ripple. This collaboration focuses on decentralized asset recovery standards—a critical need in the evolving Web3 landscape. Further strengthening its use case, Algorand plays a key role in Sweden’s central bank CBDC trials, showcasing its technology in large-scale financial applications. These developments underline Algorand’s commitment to providing scalable and secure blockchain solutions, elevating its status among top-performing projects this year. With increasing demand for interoperability and institutional-grade infrastructure, Algorand’s strategic advancements make it a prime watchlist candidate. While not a presale token, ALGO’s steady growth aligns it with those projects drawing strong community and enterprise support. Final Thoughts Choosing the best crypto presale to invest this week requires more than hype-chasing. Projects like Qubetics, Cosmos, and Algorand demonstrate why fundamentals matter, especially in volatile markets. Qubetics stands tall with its testnet success, strategic partnerships, and a presale model offering substantial ROI potential. Its wallet features, real-world business focus, and rigorous testing regime place it at the center of market attention. Cosmos has defied bearish expectations, flashing strong technical signals and renewed social dominance. Algorand’s practical applications in national financial systems and decentralized asset recovery make it a standout for 2025. While crypto remains inherently risky, these three projects show the traits of long-term players. Qubetics, in particular, emerges as the best crypto presale to invest this week, backed by innovation, community momentum, and a clear roadmap.

42228152,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104038,1742764690,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"US Treasury Uses Discretionary Powers to End Sanctions Against Tornado Cash, says “Innovation” Benefits Americans",https://zycrypto.com/us-treasury-uses-discretionary-powers-to-end-sanctions-against-tornado-cash-says-innovation-benefits-americans/,"The U.S. Treasury has ended its sanctions on Tornado Cash , a prominent mixing service, by removing addresses associated with the token, including Ethereum addresses. Under the U.S. Treasury, the department responsible for this decision is the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The list of banned addresses is referred to as the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. However, the Treasury Department maintains sanctions on one of Tornado’s founders, Roman Semenov. In 2022, OFAC blacklisted Tornado Cash allegedly for facilitating money laundering on its platform. Lazarus, a North Korean hacking group, had used the service to anonymize their stolen money, totaling millions of dollars in stolen tokens. Tornado Cash is a mixer service for Ethereum and allows users to anonymize their coins by randomly mixing them with other coins. Tornado users sued the Treasury when the service was blacklisted. Coinbase financially backed the lawsuit. The Treasury made an official announcement about the delisting of the crypto service: “Based on the Administration’s review of the novel legal and policy issues raised by the use of financial sanctions against financial and commercial activity occurring within evolving technology and legal environments, we have exercised our discretion to remove the economic sanctions against Tornado Cash as reflected in Treasury’s Monday filing in Van Loon v. Department of the Treasury”. Tornado Cash is a tool that allows users to make their transactions more private. It combines different transactions, making it more difficult for people to track them. Privacy advocates see the service as vital for protecting one’s anonymity and financial security. However, many governments see it as a tool used by hackers to disguise their transactions. In November 2024, a judge from the Fifth Circuit ruled that a piece of automatic software cannot be classified as property and, therefore, cannot be sanctioned by OFAC. Tornado supporters are celebrating the decision by OFAC to drop the blacklisting. They argue that banning Tornado because Lazarus is misusing the service is like banning the internet because Lazarus is using the web to hack crypto wallets. The Treasury, however, further stated that it is still concerned about money laundering, particularly the Lazarus group stealing billions from various crypto wallets. It plans to strike a balance between cutting back on crime and giving people room to make critical innovations. “Digital assets present enormous opportunities,” said Scott Bessent, secretary of the Treasury, “for innovation and value creation for the American people. Securing the digital asset industry from abuse by North Korea and other illicit actors is essential to establishing U.S. leadership and ensuring the American people can benefit from financial innovation and inclusion”. Roman Storm, Tornado Cash co-founder, still faces a criminal trial in July for creating protocols and smart contracts. Storm’s lawyer tried to get the case dropped after the November 2024 ruling. However, Judge Katherine Failla denied the request in February, stating that Storm still defied the sanctions list, regardless of the November ruling. Coinbase helped finance Tornado Cash’s legal defense, claiming the allegations were unreasonable. Brian Armstrong has argued that open source technology benefits citizens and should therefore not be banned.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|ETH|EXCHANGE|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-23 21:18:10

42228938,https://coinpaprika.com/news/coinbase-stops-major-hack-attempt-on-ai-crypto-tool,1742766054,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/42228938.jpeg,Coinbase Stops Major Hack Attempt on AI Crypto Tool,https://coinpaprika.com/news/coinbase-stops-major-hack-attempt-on-ai-crypto-tool,"Coinbase has successfully blocked a supply chain cyberattack aimed at its open-source AI toolkit, agentkit . The attacker tried to exploit GitHub permissions to add harmful code into the project’s automated build system (CI/CD pipeline). Thanks to a fast response from Coinbase and help from security professionals, no major damage occurred. The issue was first made public on March 23, when Yu Jian, the founder of the security firm SlowMist, shared a post on X. He referred to a detailed report from Unit 42, the security research team at Palo Alto Networks. The hacker targeted Coinbase’s open-source tool agentkit , which helps create blockchain-based AI agents. They also attacked another related toolkit, onchainkit , both hosted on GitHub. By forking these repositories, the attacker inserted dangerous code into the automation process. This malicious activity was detected on March 14, 2025 . Unit 42 explained that the goal was to take advantage of the public CI/CD flow in agentkit. The hacker used GitHub’s broad “write-all” permissions, which allowed them to plant harmful payloads into the automated workflows. This could have exposed sensitive data or opened the door to further compromises. Fortunately, the injected code did not include highly dangerous features like remote control tools or reverse shell exploits. Instead, it was built to gather internal data quietly. Still, the risk was serious. Coinbase moved quickly. Working closely with cybersecurity experts, the company isolated the threat and applied key protections. Their quick action stopped the attack before it could reach deeper systems or cause lasting harm. This incident comes at a time when Coinbase holds a critical role in the crypto world, especially as the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. and a main custodian for spot Bitcoin ETFs . A successful breach could have created serious problems in the wider industry, similar to Bybit’s recent $1.4 billion hack. Although this attack failed, the same threat actor is now believed to be part of a larger cyber campaign that is gaining global attention. In response, Yu Jian urged developers to carefully review their GitHub setups. He specifically warned those using tools like reviewdog or tj-actions to double-check their systems and make sure no sensitive information has leaked. “If your company uses reviewdog or tj-actions, do a thorough self-examination,” he advised on X.

42230932,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61406,1742766188,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Role of Blockchain in the Digital World,https://timestabloid.com/the-role-of-blockchain-in-the-digital-world/,"Blockchain technology has emerged as one of the most transformative innovations of the 21st century. It has revolutionized industries ranging from finance to healthcare, creating new opportunities for secure and decentralized digital transactions. While initially known as the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchain has expanded beyond digital currencies, shaping various sectors and redefining how data is stored and verified. In this article, we will explore how blockchain is influencing the world and the many ways it is being integrated into different industries. Understanding Blockchain Technology At its core, blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that records transactions across multiple computers. This system ensures transparency, security, and immutability, making it nearly impossible to alter or hack data once it has been recorded. Unlike traditional centralized databases, blockchain does not rely on a single authority to manage or validate information. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that work together to maintain the integrity of the ledger. Each block in a blockchain contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, forming a continuous chain. This structure enhances security and prevents tampering, making blockchain a reliable tool for digital record-keeping. Key Features of Blockchain 1. Decentralization One of the most important aspects of blockchain technology is decentralization. Unlike traditional financial systems that depend on central banks or governments, blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network. This means that no single entity has control over the entire system, reducing the risks of fraud and manipulation. 2. Security and Transparency Blockchain networks use cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions, making them highly resistant to cyber threats. Additionally, all transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust among users. 3. Immutability Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or deleted. This immutability ensures that records remain accurate and unaltered, which is particularly valuable in industries that require verifiable data integrity, such as healthcare and supply chain management. Applications of Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrency Although blockchain gained popularity through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, its potential extends far beyond digital money. Here are some of the key areas where blockchain is making a significant impact: 1. Finance and Banking Blockchain has transformed the financial sector by enabling faster, more secure, and cost-effective transactions. Traditional banking processes often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and high transaction fees. Blockchain eliminates these middlemen, allowing direct peer-to-peer transactions. Moreover, smart contracts – self-executing agreements stored on the blockchain – streamline processes like loan approvals and cross-border payments. 2. Supply Chain Management Blockchain enhances transparency and traceability in supply chains by providing an immutable record of goods as they move through various stages of production and distribution. Companies can use blockchain to track product origins, prevent counterfeiting, and improve inventory management. 3. Healthcare and Medical Records The healthcare industry benefits greatly from blockchain’s ability to store and secure patient records. Blockchain ensures that medical histories remain accurate, up-to-date, and accessible only to authorized individuals. This reduces errors, prevents data breaches, and improves patient care. 4. Real Estate and Property Transactions Real estate transactions often involve complex paperwork and lengthy verification processes. Blockchain simplifies this by creating digital property ownership records, reducing the need for intermediaries, and minimizing fraud risks. Smart contracts also automate property sales, ensuring smooth and transparent transactions. 5. Voting Systems Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize voting systems by ensuring secure and tamper-proof elections. With blockchain-based voting, each vote is recorded on a decentralized ledger, preventing fraud and ensuring transparency in the electoral process. 6. Intellectual Property and Digital Rights Artists, musicians, and content creators can use blockchain to protect their intellectual property rights. By registering their work on a blockchain, they can create a verifiable proof of ownership, preventing unauthorized use and ensuring fair compensation. 7. Education and Credential Verification Blockchain can be used in the education sector to verify academic credentials. Universities and employers can use blockchain to ensure that diplomas, certificates, and degrees are authentic and tamper-proof, reducing fraud in academic qualifications. 8. Decentralized Identity Verification Identity theft and data breaches are major concerns in today’s digital world. Blockchain offers a solution by enabling decentralized identity verification, allowing individuals to control their own digital identities securely. This eliminates the need for centralized databases that are vulnerable to hacking. 9. Energy Trading and Sustainability Blockchain technology is being integrated into the energy sector to enable peer-to-peer energy trading. Homeowners with solar panels can sell excess energy directly to others without the need for intermediaries. This creates a more efficient and sustainable energy distribution system. The Future of Blockchain Blockchain technology continues to evolve, and its adoption is expected to grow across multiple industries. Innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain-based identity verification are paving the way for a more secure and decentralized digital future. However, challenges remain, including regulatory uncertainty, scalability issues, and energy consumption concerns. Governments and organizations worldwide are working to address these challenges to ensure the responsible development and integration of blockchain technology. Conclusion Blockchain is more than just a buzzword; it is a groundbreaking technology with the potential to reshape numerous industries. From finance and healthcare to real estate and digital rights management, blockchain’s decentralized and secure nature is revolutionizing how data and transactions are handled. As technology continues to evolve, its impact on the world will only grow, offering endless possibilities for innovation and efficiency. Businesses and individuals looking to stay ahead in the digital era should embrace blockchain technology and explore its benefits. Whether it’s through secure financial transactions, transparent supply chains, or tamper-proof voting systems, blockchain is set to become a fundamental pillar of the future digital landscape.

42229812,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=697835,1742767200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42229812.jpeg,Solana (SOL) Holder Abruptly Sells Huge SOL Stake for New Coin Currently Under $0.03,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-holder-abruptly-sells-huge-sol-stake-for-new-coin-currently-under-0-03/,"One of the largest Solana (SOL) investors has cashed in a huge amount of their bag in the crypto market to purchase Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending token that is in presale and is currently valued at less than $0.03. It follows the turbocharged presale of Mutuum Finance, with Phase 3 already 60% full after raking in $4.5 million and 6,400 holders. Despite currently sitting at $0.02, on its next stage, MUTM will rise to $0.025 — a 25% increase — fostering an urge to buy MUTM to prevent a gap formed with the next price range. The token is said to have artificially induced buy pressure mechanisms and real-world use cases in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, which analysts are looking to as catalysts for its explosive potential. Presale Ramps Up For Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting immense demand as a first to market with its unique lending model and profit-sharing ecosystem. The project’s presale has already surpassed $4.5 million, with Phase 3 tokens being snapped up quickly in advance of an exchange listing at $0.06. In fact, those who snatch the token up now at the $0.02 price will be able to see a return of 200% when MUTM hits the public markets. An exciting post-launch price prediction based on tokenomics is also strongly propelling optimism – $1.50 would imply a 7,400% ROI and has established MUTM as a genuine breakout candidate in terms of DeFi due diligence across 2025. A share of protocol income flows into the platform’s “buy-and-distribute” system, directly purchasing MUTM tokens for distribution among stakers. This mechanism maintains demand and prevents sell offs which creates a self-reinforcing cycle of scarcity and value increase. Moreover, Mutuum’s overcollateralized lending pools and peer-to-peer borrowing services provide real utility that distinguishes it from speculative competitors. Shift In Investors On Solana Reflects The Confidence In The Market The Solana (SOL) investor’s move to Mutuum Finance is part of a larger trend of capital flowing toward projects with tangible use cases. Despite being one of the leading blockchains, Solana has faced challenges in recent months — including price fluctuations and network congestion — which have motivated some investors to seek additional opportunities among newer tokens, such as MUTM. The presale mechanics of Mutuum with progressive price increases between phases is a hook for many looking for asymmetric returns. The $0.02 barrier to entry of Phase 3 in particular is well considered. Over half of the allocation has already been taken, so the window to secure tokens at this tier is closing. By buying now ahead of Phase 4, investors not only secure themselves a 25% gain, but place themselves in prime position for even more exponential growth after listing. In contrast, Solana’s 2025 estimates fall short of MUTM’s potential, given the latter’s strategic integrations with DeFi and token burns designed to escalate its market presence. Security and Long-Term Vision The development team of Mutuum Finance has started a security audit with CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm. The results of the audit will be made public, and behind it, transparency. This preventive measure is in line with the project’s dedication to risk mitigation and keeping users’ funds and platform operations safe from exploits. The protocol’s roadmap involves the launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin, which would add to the diversity of its DeFi offerings. By minting stablecoins against pooled deposits, Mutuum plans to improve liquidity while keeping things decentralized — a direct challenge to centralized stablecoin masters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is changing what it means to have value, revolutionizing lending and incentivizing investors. With the presale gaining momentum and exchange listings on the horizon, the $0.02 price point could mark a brief window of opportunity for the project. Those early adopters will be able to enjoy life-changing returns that would be a mirror image of the foresight shown by the Solana whale who bet on MUTM. With Phase 3 almost full, waiting will cost you the final low-price entry before the flood of price increases irreversibly begins.

Perhaps basking in the landmark win, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, says the company will continue to push for fair regulations. Victory over SEC Sparks Renewed Push for Fair Rules In an interview with CNBC , Alderoty maintained that Ripple will lead the quest for “clear and fair crypto regulation.” This stance comes after Ripple announced that the U.S. regulatory body has decided not to pursue its controversial appeal against it. The SEC did not only drop its case with Ripple; other crucial cases were also tossed off. Some of those cases included the SEC’s case against American crypto exchange Coinbase, Kraken, and OpenSea . The development comes amid the shift in aggressive crypto enforcement the SEC has been known for under its former Chair, Gary Gensler. Interestingly, despite the SEC dropping its lawsuit, Ripple has remained silent about the cross-appeal it filed. The company has not made its stance known as to whether it would continue with the case or withdraw it. In a recent interview, Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO, stated that it has not yet reached a decision yet. Ripple’s Legal Battle and Its Market Impact Ripple’s victory over the SEC is a testament to the firm’s resilience. According to Alderoty, “Ripple stands alone as the company that fought back and won on essential legal questions.” Notably, the SEC filed a suit against the company four years ago, accusing it of raising over one billion dollars from XRP sales. The regulatory body argued that Ripple failed to register XRP as a security. XRP, launched in 2012, is one of the first altcoins in the cryptocurrency space. It became the native currency of Ripple Labs. Future of Crypto Regulation Post-Ripple Case The asset has remained resilient throughout the legal drama and witnessed an 11% increase after the news of the legal battle hit the market. As of this writing, XRP is changing hands at $2.41, a 1.72% increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. With the legal hurdle over, many analysts anticipate XRP’s value to soar. Interestingly, Ripple’s executives predict that crypto assets could record explosive growth this year.

Coinbase Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Paul Grewal has taken swipes at the US Treasury for its “botched” attempt at waiving the need for a final judgment. Coinbase CLO Pokes Holes In US Treasury’s Latest Court Filing In a strongly worded post on X , Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal railed against the US Treasury’s handling of Tornado Cash’s delisting from the sanctions list. According to Grewal’s disclosure, the US Treasury filed a pleading to moot the need for a final judgment on the matter. In legal terms, a party to dispute can apply to moot a final judgment, arguing that the issue at hand is no longer significant or actionable. Following Tornado Cash’s removal from the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list, the US Treasury’s latest filing seeks to waive a final judgment on the case. Tornado Cash users have been in court, challenging the US Treasury’s decision to place the mixer on the SDN list. However, Grewal argues that the filing runs contrary to established legal processes in the US. He notes a proper filing follows only if the defendant can show that the “practice cannot reasonably be expected to recur.” The Coinbase CLO cited several legal precedents involving law enforcement agencies removing sanctions and not moving a case. He argues that without a final court judgment, law enforcement can review their decision to impose fresh sanctions at a future date. “Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again,” said Grewal. A Protracted Legal Battle Against Authorities The road toward the lifting of Tornado Cash’s sanctions was long and winding. A raft of Tornado Cash users headed to court to protest the placing of the mixer on the SDN list. US authorities say the mixer played a principal role in laundering nearly $500 million worth of stolen digital assets by North-Korean backed Lazarus Group. After notching a series of small wins in Court, Grewal criticized the US Treasury for failing to comply with a court ruling clarifying the status of Tornado Cash’s smart contract. The court ruled that the smart contract did not form property under the IEEPA as it is non-erasable. Tornado Cash has received support from Coinbase with the Ethereum Foundation supporting the legal defense of lead developer Alexey Pertsev.

Prosecutors allege that he misused $11 million from a major streaming service, meant for his science fiction television series “White Horse,” on crypto trading. The $11M Fraud According to the indictment, Rinsch reached a deal with the streaming platform in 2018, securing $44 million to complete the production of White Horse. In 2019 and early 2020, he requested an additional $11 million, which was transferred to his company on March 6, 2020. In a statement , acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said: “As alleged, Carl Erik Rinsch orchestrated a scheme to steal millions by soliciting a large investment from a video streaming service, claiming that money would be used to finance a television show that he was creating. But that was fiction.” Instead of using the funds as intended, he moved them through various accounts before storing them in a personal brokerage account. He then engaged in speculative securities trading but lost more than half of the funds within two months. Rather than redirecting the remaining money back into the show, Rinsch allegedly shifted to crypto trading and continued making extravagant personal purchases. Prosecutors say he spent nearly $1.8 million on credit card payments, $1 million on legal fees for lawsuits against the streaming service and his divorce, and $395,000 on luxury hotel stays and rental properties. Further, the Netflix director spent $3.8 million on furniture and antiques, including $638,000 on two mattresses and $295,000 on luxury bedding. His purchases also included five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari totaling $2.4 million and $652,000 on designer watches and clothing. The Charges Against Rinsch The 47-year-old has been indicted with one count of wire fraud, one count of money laundering, and five counts of engaging in financial transactions involving criminally gotten property. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison for wire fraud, 20 years for money laundering, and 10 years for each financial transaction charge. This is not Rinsch’s first encounter with controversy. In 2023, the “Conquest” director reportedly took $4 million from the show’s budget to invest in Dogecoin, earning a $27 million return. Much like the current case, his crypto profits were followed by a lavish spending spree. Rinsch allegedly spent nearly $9 million on luxury purchases, including high-end furniture, designer clothing, a $380,000 watch, and luxury vehicles.

Concurrently, BlockDAG’s latest AMA delivered a wealth of updates, especially thrilling the community with a major announcement: an upcoming beta testnet launch accompanied by a generous 10,000 testnet token airdrop. These distinct developments reflect significant momentum for both projects, each impacting investor sentiment uniquely. For XRP, traders focus on its technical strength and legal milestones. For BlockDAG , investor enthusiasm builds on ambitious testnet plans and community incentives. This combination of XRP’s steady progress and BlockDAG’s strategic community engagement sets a compelling scene for crypto observers this quarter. XRP Holds Steady, Targets a New High XRP traders watched carefully as the cryptocurrency bounced from its critical support at $2.30, positioning itself for a potential move toward $3. Recently, XRP’s stability at this support level boosted market optimism significantly. Technical indicators highlighted a successful defense against bearish pressures, showing strength amid market volatility. Analysts identified the $2.42 resistance level as the key barrier before XRP can successfully break toward its ambitious $3 target. This current range ($2.30-$2.42) remains closely monitored as traders await clear directional signals. Adding further fuel to the bullish sentiment, XRP recently celebrated a pivotal legal milestone. The protracted lawsuit involving Ripple Labs and the SEC concluded favorably, significantly alleviating regulatory pressures that had long cast shadows over XRP. The resolution of this lawsuit dramatically improved market sentiment, giving XRP bulls additional confidence to maintain buying pressure at current support levels. This optimism is further supported by XRP’s broader adoption trajectory, with Ripple’s growing cross-border payment partnerships continuing to strengthen the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals. As Ripple expands globally, demand for XRP’s liquidity solutions steadily grows, underpinning bullish arguments beyond mere technical analyses. Traders and investors alike are thus hopeful that these combined factors can push XRP confidently toward the much-anticipated $3 price point in the near term. BlockDAG AMA Highlights Robust Community Initiatives On the other hand, BlockDAG continues capturing investor interest through proactive community-building strategies. The project’s latest AMA session unveiled detailed updates, significantly elevating enthusiasm within its community. Perhaps most notably, BlockDAG announced an imminent beta testnet launch coupled with an ambitious 10,000 testnet token airdrop to each of its 110,000 investors. This significant initiative aims to amplify community engagement while thoroughly testing network capacity, usability, and stability. During the AMA, the BlockDAG team emphasized the meticulous preparations for this testnet phase, detailing extensive improvements implemented since the previous alpha phase. Upgrades include enhanced node installation processes, streamlined documentation, and significantly improved network explorers. New capabilities like contract verification, node explorer functionalities, and real-time token views further bolster the testnet’s appeal, setting clear benchmarks for transparency and user-friendliness. Additionally, the AMA outlined a compelling incentive program designed explicitly to boost participation. The top 30 participants across various engagement metrics—including active wallets, miner participation, and token balances—stand to receive substantial rewards totaling $60,000, distributed in real BDAG tokens post-launch. This strategy highlights BlockDAG’s determination to foster an active and involved community, creating valuable feedback loops that improve network functionalities ahead of the mainnet launch. Beyond short-term excitement, BlockDAG also provided crucial clarifications on token vesting schedules, enhancing investor clarity. Presale investors will receive 40% of their tokens immediately upon the Token Generation Event (TGE), followed by evenly paced releases over subsequent months. Bonuses and miner rewards involve structured lock-ups extending from one to five years, underscoring BlockDAG’s commitment to sustainable growth and market stability post-launch. These details revealed transparently in the AMA, reinforce investor confidence, showcasing long-term planning and fiscal responsibility from the project’s leadership. The AMA also spotlighted significant strategic partnerships, including a prominent alliance with Inter Milan. This high-profile partnership offers substantial marketing potential, blending crypto innovation with traditional global sports appeal. Exclusive fan experiences, branded merchandise, and stadium tours were detailed as elements of this partnership, designed explicitly to extend BlockDAG’s global reach beyond crypto-native audiences. Additionally, BlockDAG’s participation in significant blockchain events—like ETHDenver, ETHPanama, and upcoming Token2049 summits in Dubai and Singapore—reflects the project’s coordinated strategy to bolster visibility and credibility within the broader crypto and blockchain sectors. Key takeaways As XRP maintains bullish ambitions, BlockDAG’s transparent AMA and community-first strategies continue driving meaningful investor engagement. Both cryptocurrencies stand poised for significant developments, each with clearly defined catalysts. XRP’s near-term path hinges on overcoming resistance, supported by robust fundamentals and favorable legal outcomes. For BlockDAG, the imminent testnet launch, significant airdrop incentives, structured vesting policies, and high-profile partnerships paint a clear and exciting trajectory. These clear, milestone-driven developments position both XRP and BlockDAG attractively within the broader market. However, BlockDAG’s raging presale with over $206M in presale, carefully structured community incentives, thorough transparency, and strategic event participation underline a particularly appealing narrative for long-term-oriented investors seeking sustainable value. Investors assessing crypto opportunities today would be wise to closely monitor both projects, though BlockDAG’s meticulous preparation and long-term vision distinctly set it apart.

The star of this trend? Remittix (RTX) , a $0.0734 altcoin that has already raised over $14 million and sold more than 520 million tokens. Some traders are calling it “XRP 2.0” thanks to its focus on low-cost, near-instant remittances. There’s also chatter that RTX could surge past $5 by 2025, an enormous leap from its current price. Below, we unpack how the PayFi narrative is gaining traction, why Remittix leads the pack, and how high it might climb in the next bull market. Why PayFi Is Booming PayFi tokens like Remittix are aimed at making payments simpler, cheaper and more user-friendly. Traditional wire transfers can be expensive and slow, a hassle for families, freelancers or small shops dealing with international clients. Remittix addresses this pain point directly, letting users convert crypto (BTC, ETH or others) into local cash and send it to a bank account in around 24 hours. This sets PayFi apart from advanced DeFi or NFT platforms, appealing to people who need to move money across borders without crazy fees. With the global remittance market worth trillions, PayFi tokens might have a huge real-world audience ready to jump in. As cross-border payments remain a daily challenge for countless people, the simplicity of PayFisolutions often wins them over. Someone who struggles with wire transfers or expensive remittance apps wants a no-fuss way to convert digital assets to local currency. That’s why PayFitokens like Remittix are attracting fresh interest, as they marry the benefits of crypto (speed and low fees) with the familiarity of regular bank deposits. Remittix (RTX): The ‘XRP 2.0’? While XRP famously tackled cross-border finance for banks, Remittix focuses on everyone else's families, gig workers and small businesses. Priced at $0.0734, RTX has pulled in over $14 million in funding, with 520+ million tokens sold in presale, showing strong initial backing. The team aims to keep things user-friendly, automating the entire conversion process so recipients don’t have to wrestle with crypto wallets or advanced steps. Observers believe that if Remittix (RTX) secures deals with major payroll systems or e-commerce companies, daily usage could skyrocket, pushing the token well beyond its current valuation. That’s why some analysts see it as “XRP 2.0,” but with a more direct approach to real people’s needs. Could RTX Really Pass $5 by 2025? At first glance, jumping from about $0.07 to over $5 sounds wild yet fans note that similar leaps happened when tokens like XRP or early DeFi coins caught mainstream attention. If Remittix(RTX) does become a go-to solution for cross-border transfers, its daily transaction volume could spike rapidly. Each new user has friends or family who might also switch, creating a chain reaction of adoption. Of course, hitting $5 demands big partnerships, consistent network stability and a supportive crypto market cycle. But given how large the international remittance market is, some experts say the goal is possible especially if PayFi becomes the next hot niche. Conclusion: Why Remittix Might Outpace XRP’s Old Record While XRP still plays a major role in cross-border banking, Remittix aims to capture everyday payments. At $0.0734 with over $14+ million raised, its potential user base (from freelancers to families) could drive a bigger, faster adoption wave than older tokens reliant on big institutional deals. If PayFi momentum continues, RTX has a big chance of surpassing $5 in the next bull run delivering life-changing gains for early buyers. Remittix stands as a prime example of how focusing on an everyday problem can catapult a token from obscurity to stardom, even in a crowded crypto landscape. Ready to Give Remittix a Go?

It also vowed to consider talking points raised by the Virtual Asset Committee, a government advisory body that answers to the FSC. The BOK, meanwhile, is more “reluctant” to act.

Unlike traditional online casinos, where a central authority controls operations, these blockchain-based platforms use smart contracts to automate payouts and ensure transparency. Web3 casinos represent a fundamental shift in gambling, reducing the risk of manipulation or fraud through verifiable randomness and immutable transaction records. The marriage of cryptocurrency and gambling creates a powerful combination that addresses long-standing issues in the industry. Through token ownership, players can verify game fairness, enjoy faster withdrawals, and participate in casino governance. These platforms are building what some call ""GambleFi"", an ecosystem where betting becomes community-centric and tokenised. As blockchain technology matures​​, the trajectory of Web3 gambling points toward increased democratisation and player control. The concept of rolling the decentralised dice goes beyond just playing games, it represents a new paradigm in which gamblers become stakeholders in the platforms they use. This shift from mere consumers to active participants may fundamentally restructure the £100+ billion online gambling industry for decades to come. The Advancement of Decentralised Gaming Platforms Decentralised gaming platforms have transformed the gambling industry by introducing transparency, security, and user ownership. These platforms leverage blockchain technology to create a more fair and accessible gambling environment. Evolution from Traditional to Decentralised Gambling “Traditional online casinos operate under centralised control, requiring players to trust the operator to maintain fair games and handle funds properly. Web3 gambling changes this dynamic by using blockchain to create trustless environments where outcomes are verifiable,” said UK online casino website JeffBet . The shift began with simple decentralised betting applications that processed payments using Bitcoin. These primitive platforms demonstrated the potential for removing intermediaries from gambling transactions. Today's Web3 casinos offer sophisticated experiences comparable to conventional online gambling sites. Without lengthy verification processes, players can now use digital wallets to deposit and withdraw various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Solana. User ownership represents a critical advancement. Players can verify game fairness through distributed ledgers rather than relying on opaque algorithms controlled by a single entity. Technological Underpinnings of Web3 Casinos Blockchain technology, smart contracts, and digital currencies are the foundation of Web3 casinos. Together, these elements create transparent, secure, and user-controlled gambling platforms. Smart contracts, self-executing agreements with rules written in code, automatically determine game outcomes and distribute winnings. This automation eliminates the need to trust a centralised casino operator to pay out winnings. Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and game results are recorded immutably. Players can independently verify that games run fairly by checking the distributed ledger. Security benefits extend beyond fair play. Digital wallets provide enhanced protection against fraud compared to traditional payment methods. Players maintain control of their funds until they actively place bets. Interoperability between blockchains is improving, allowing gamblers to use their preferred digital currency. Whether using Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, or emerging currencies, the increasing flexibility makes Web3 gambling more accessible. Benefits and Opportunities of Dice Gaming on the Blockchain Blockchain technology offers unique advantages for dice games that traditional online casinos simply cannot match. These innovations reshape the player experience through verifiable fairness, economic incentives, and unmatched security. Providing Fair Systems and Transparency The most compelling feature of blockchain-based dice games is their provably fair system. Unlike traditional online casinos where algorithms remain hidden, Web3 dice games use cryptographic methods to verify each roll's fairness. By examining the blockchain record, players can independently check that outcomes weren't manipulated. This verification happens through cryptographic hash functions and publicly visible smart contracts. The transparency extends beyond individual dice rolls. Casino profit margins (house edge) are coded directly into smart contracts, making them immutable and visible to all players. This openness builds unprecedented trust. Players who know with mathematical certainty that games aren't rigged develop stronger confidence in the platform. Many decentralised dice games publicly display transaction histories and dice roll outcomes on the blockchain, creating a permanent, tamper-proof record that regulatory bodies and players can audit. Tokenomics: Earning and Spending in Web3 Web3 dice games introduce innovative economic models through tokenised systems. Players often earn native platform tokens through gameplay, staking, or participation. These tokens serve multiple functions. They act as in-game currency for placing bets and grant governance rights in decentralised platforms. Token holders may vote on house edge percentages or new game implementations. Loyalty programmes in blockchain dice games offer free spins and bonuses based on token holdings rather than centralised decisions, creating a more equitable reward structure. Players can earn passive income by staking their tokens to provide liquidity to the dice game's betting pool. This makes players partial ""house owners"" who share in platform profits. The interoperability of tokens means winnings from dice games can be used across the broader Web3 ecosystem, creating greater utility than closed casino systems. Enhanced Security and Player Autonomy Blockchain dice games dramatically improve security through cryptographic protection and eliminating central points of failure. Funds remain in player-controlled wallets rather than casino accounts. Smart contracts automate payouts instantly when winning conditions are met. This removes the withdrawal delays and arbitrary limits common in traditional online casinos. Instant withdrawals via cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin allow players to access their winnings whenever they choose, without waiting for approval from centralised authorities. Players maintain full custody of their funds until they place a bet. This self-custody model eliminates the risk of casino insolvency affecting player deposits. KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements are often minimised or eliminated, protecting player privacy while maintaining responsible gambling standards through blockchain verification. Implications for the Online Gambling Ecosystem The rise of decentralised dice platforms forces traditional gambling operators to reconsider their business models. Many are now incorporating blockchain elements to remain competitive. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to accommodate these new models. Some jurisdictions now recognise blockchain's inherent protections and are creating specialised licensing for Web3 gambling operations. Rolling the decentralised dice represents more than technological change, it signals a philosophical shift towards player-centric gambling experiences. Cross-chain compatibility allows dice games to operate across multiple blockchains, reaching broader audiences and providing flexibility in cryptocurrency choice for betting. The community-governed nature of these platforms ensures that development priorities reflect actual player needs rather than purely profit-driven motives.

According to the company, the number of active altcoins listed on CoinMarketCap dropped by 400, indicating a decrease in public interest. This decline is largely attributed to the significant decline in altcoin trading volume on exchanges, which currently averages $100 billion, much lower than the $400 billion recorded in December 2024. Despite this, Alphractal suggests that decreasing trading volumes will not necessarily prevent future price increases in altcoins. Historical trends show that altcoins have reached all-time highs even when trading volume has not peaked, as seen in 2021. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson stated that new incentives are needed in the cryptocurrency market. Wedson stated that, unlike the peak enthusiasm in 2017 and 2021, the current market is facing slow growth and lack of investor confidence. Wedson also identified the significant decline in investments in Web3 startups as a major contributing factor: 2021: $33 billion worldwide 2022: $7.1 billion raised despite “crypto winter,” signaling an early slowdown. 2023: Less than $7 billion raised, a 74% decrease from 2021. According to Crunchbase, $1.7 billion was raised in the first quarter alone, the lowest amount since late 2020. This decline in Web3 investments outpaced the downturn in the overall Venture Capital (VC) market, which saw a 38% decline between 2021 and 2023. Wedson pointed out several key reasons for the market slump: The collapse of FTX and the resulting loss of confidence in the industry. Regulatory uncertainties in major cryptocurrency markets. Shifting investor focus to Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is set to attract around $50 billion by 2023. Despite these challenges, Wedson remains optimistic about the potential for a resurgence in crypto investment, believing that the combination of AI, crypto, and gaming-themed cryptocurrencies could be the next big driver of institutional capital. Alphractal’s latest observations show that Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) have accumulated more long positions than short positions over the past week, suggesting that the market could experience higher volatility early next week. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency world now focuses on Remittix as the token projected to surpass both Solana and Cardano in 2025 market performance. The market has shown its desire for straightforward payment options by allowing Remittix to sell more than 521 million tokens at $0.0734 each which resulted in $14 million raised. Solana’s Strong Momentum and ETF Speculation Source: tradingview . SOL’s current price is $133.27. The price of Solana regularly undergoes substantial changes. High growth rates and quick processing combined to make Solana renowned until obstacles such as network failures and negative market changes appeared. Recent attention on Solana news revolves around developing a Solana ETF just like traditional investors utilized for Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs. Such an ETF approval would enhance SOL's standing while offering an opportunity for new capital inflow from hedge funds alongside institutional participants. Solana could establish itself permanently in the cryptocurrency industry thanks to additional institutional support. Meme coin developers choose Solana because of its affordable transaction costs which allows them to deploy new tokens on its chain thus increasing on-chain action. The increase in transactions generates both short-term popularity and enhances the speed of operations in the network. The proposed exchange-traded fund could create institutional backing for Solana if its hopes materialize. Cardano’s Choppy Waters and Possible Recovery Since its inception Cardano (ADA) followed a step-by-step development process while relying on research reviewed by peers together with network upgrading layers. The coin experiences unstable performance during the latest week. The crypto market experiences significant challenges as analysts detect a “ Death Cross ” technical indicator that signals a bearish pattern following a 37% value decrease during this month. At its current price of $0.71 the ADA coin remains close to its essential support value at $0.70 . If the price drops below $0.62 it will strengthen the current bearish market sentiment. Source: tradingview . ADA’s death cross pattern. Although Cardano maintains fans who focus on its long-term development. Pioneers expect ADA to retrace to $1 after it successfully rises above $0.77 and maintains upward momentum. ADA along with the entire cryptocurrency market continues to give Charles Hoskinson hope as he suggests 2025 will mark their breakthrough year. Large holders continue to envision ADA growth potential based on their recent purchases of approximately 190 million tokens in the span of 48 hours. The signals point in different directions at present while new heavy buying spells the start of significant market advancement. Remittix: The Altcoin Forecasted to Outperform The direct everyday functionality of Remittix enters the market as settled competitors Solana and Cardano face scaling issues together with uncertain market sentiment alongside upcoming price barriers. The project obtained $14 million in funding through selling 521 million tokens at $0.0734. Through its swift crypto shortcode method Remittix enables users to make instant digital asset conversions that lead to easy spending and transferring capabilities. Numerous experts predict Remittix will deliver market successes because they believe today's consumers are seeking user-friendly practical solutions over multilayered platforms or delayed system updates. The incoming merchant partnerships, remittance services and e-commerce deals have the potential to create significant demand for Remittix tokens. Many experts consider Remittix the leading altcoin to dominate market gains during 2025 because it appeals to both crypto veterans and introductory users seeking simple payment methods. Why Remittix Could Eclipse Solana and Cardano Remittix distinguishes itself from Solana and Cardano with its straightforward link between cryptocurrency and regular bank funds while Solana focuses on developer needs and Cardano drives their development through research. The user bases continue supporting both coins but institutional money could potentially choose projects offering solutions for instant everyday needs. The rumored ETF for Solana holds promise along with potential improvements for Cardano yet these outcomes depend on directed and gradual project developments. Conclusion Analysts predict that both Solana and Cardano will experience partial price gains as certain market players continue to show enthusiasm for well-recognized platforms. New alternatives to Bitcoin are earning widespread approval as they address routine challenges in the year 2025. Near-instant payment solutions form the key priority of Remittix in its market leadership. The market recommends Remittix's direct payment solutions for its clear approach to delivering everyday utility ahead of methodical roadmap-driven projects like Cardano and prospectively successful projects like Solana.

Fidelity’s March 21 filing with the US securities regulator said “OnChain” would help track transactions of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX) — an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills. While OnChain is pending regulatory approval, it is expected to take effect on May 30, Fidelity said. Fidelity’s filing to register a tokenized version of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund. Source: Securities and Exchange Commission The OnChain share class aims to provide investors transparency and verifiable tracking of share transactions of FYHXX, although Fidelity will maintain traditional book-entry records as the official ownership ledger. “Although the secondary recording of the OnChain class on a blockchain will not represent the official record of ownership, the transfer agent will reconcile the secondary blockchain transactions with the official records of the OnChain class on at least a daily basis.” Fidelity said the US Treasury bills wouldn’t be directly tokenized. The $5.8 trillion asset manager said it may also expand OnChain to other blockchains in the future.

That’s why many now focus on other coins that show better speed, utility, or smart tech upgrades. In this article, we’ll take a close look at four top trending cryptos in 2025—BlockDAG, Litecoin, Mantra, and XRP. These coins offer unique value with their strong tech and market plans. Each project is expected to make a big move in the coming year. Let’s explore how they work and what makes them special in today’s fast-growing space. BlockDAG: Most Advanced Layer-1 Crypto BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining a lot of attention due to a fast-moving presale that has raised more than $205 million while selling over 18.8 billion coins. Starting at just $0.001 in its first batch, the price has now climbed to $0.0248 in batch 27—a growth of 2,380%. This steady climb shows strong backing from the crypto crowd and explains why BDAG is one of the top trending cryptos in 2025. With plans to list on 10 centralized exchanges (CEXs) in 2025, BlockDAG will become easier to access globally, making buying and trading smoother. Alongside this, its awaited mainnet launch will take the system live, offering real use of its peer-to-peer setup. This move can help shape the future of decentralized tech use. The presale is getting closer to its goal of $600 million, and with only a few batches left, demand is growing. Prices are set to rise with each batch, so those waiting too long might miss a better deal. BlockDAG’s fast growth, mainnet launch, and CEX plans explain why it leads among the top trending cryptos in 2025. Litecoin: Trusted Digital Coin with Fast Transactions Created by ex-Google engineer Charlie Lee in 2011, Litecoin (LTC) was built to improve transaction speed while using less data space than Bitcoin. It now holds a market value of $8.61 billion and trades at $114.46 per coin, proving its steady and reliable track record. The coin’s quick transfer times and lower cost make it a solid pick among top trending cryptos in 2025. It is known for handling daily use cases well, making it ideal for fast digital payments. Its steady support and active use in the crypto scene keep it relevant. LTC”s history of long-term use and simple network function gives it an edge. Keeping watch on Litecoin’s progress may help those tracking coins with proven value and function. Mantra: Bringing DeFi Closer to Traditional Finance Mantra (OM) is a platform that mixes decentralized finance (DeFi) with more familiar banking ideas. It offers services like lending, staking, and community voting, all managed on a blockchain-based setup. The OM coin helps run these services while also giving users voting rights. Priced at $7.38 currently, Mantra has shown a 92.71% price jump in 2024. This performance makes it one of the top trending cryptos in 2025. Yet beyond numbers, it’s also working on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and forming new links in both crypto and finance sectors. People looking at Mantra will want to study its growth path, active user role, and wider adoption before making any long-term move. Its mix of features and ties to DeFi and real finance could make it a strong pick going forward. XRP: Designed for Fast Global Transactions XRP helps move money across borders quickly and with fewer fees. It’s the base of RippleNet, a payment system made for speed and scale. Unlike banks using slow tools like SWIFT, XRP allows faster and cheaper transfers between countries. Its system is built differently from most cryptocurrencies, which has led to talks about how it should be classified. Still, XRP’s tech works well for solving real problems in global payments, which keeps it high on the list of top trending cryptos in 2025. Open-source coding and a clear goal to ease money movement across countries make XRP a project worth watching. For those following coins focused on global use, XRP may be a clear option. Which Top Trending Crypto to Buy Right Now? The crypto space offers many choices, but a few stand out due to strong use cases and clear paths forward. Litecoin has stood the test of time by offering fast and affordable transfers, making it a trusted pick. Mantra takes a smart step by combining DeFi tools with the finance world people already know. Its growth in RWA and service features give it a long-term appeal. XRP’s role in changing how global payments are made gives it solid ground in the top trending cryptos in 2025. Even with these strong names, BlockDAG may have the biggest leap ahead. Its presale passing $205 million, major exchange plans, and upcoming mainnet make it one to watch closely. Few batches remain, and with each one, the price is expected to rise. This mix of timing and strong tech places BlockDAG firmly among the t op trending cryptos in 2025 .

Pseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 244,300 followers on the social media platform X that he expects meme tokens to eventually take center stage, highlighting that the crypto sector relies on trader attention. But while the analyst believes that memecoins will make a comeback, he says those that have been around longer than others will likely lead the surge. One asset on his radar is the Solana ( SOL )-based token Bonk ( BONK ). “Most memes got smashed overall but I think that they’ll eventually come back to some degree. Memes by nature are attention driven but I do think that some of the more ‘Lindy’ ones will have a better chance You probably just go off ecosystem. When SOL is hot, coins like BONK are going to be decent bets (along with some others like Fartcoin and WIF and others). BONK being down 85% from highs to lows probably makes it an ok bet down here (I have a bag of it).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X The trader is referring to the Lindy Effect, a concept suggesting that the longer something has survived, the longer it’s likely to keep surviving. At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.000012. Another memecoin on the trader’s roster is the Ethereum ( ETH )-based token Pepe ( PEPE ). “Feels like PEPE is also around a bottom, too. PEPE obviously an ETH beta but it’s also a good one if BTC starts going wild in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that PEPE would either rally to a high of $0.000015 or collapse to a new 2025 low of $0.000001. At time of writing, PEPE is trading for $0.000007.

With the evolution of the cryptocurrency sector, investors are now seeking new ICOs that demonstrate stronger growth potential together with practical real-world functions. Remittix (RTX) stands as one of the tokens that has gained popularity beyond Dogecoin and Pepe Coin through its utility-driven adoption strategies. The investor interest in Remittix comes from its real-world application of blockchain technology compared to Dogecoin and Pepe Coin. Currently though, the market price of DOGE and Pepe Coin is seeking to stabilize but Remittixis performing impressively as it has yielded over 300% returns for early investors positioning it as currently one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Dogecoin Price Is Struggling To Find Footing In 2025 While DOGE began as a joke crypto coin, the currency has cemented its longevity in the top 10 altcoin list by boasting a market capitalization of more than $25 billion. Now trading at $0.17 , Dogecoin has seen modest gains of 2% in the past 24 hours on the back of a broader market rebound following a few weeks of bearish downturns. Some technical analysts have observed that the price of Dogecoin shows downtrend potential under intense resistance causing bearish effects as its EMAs cross paths and trading volume declines rapidly. Other analysts think DOGE shows signs of an upcoming price increase through its formation of an ascending triangle pattern. The price is expected to increase based on the anticipated movement from point AB to point CD and should hit highs of $0.59 in Q3 2025. Overall, the consensus remains that DOGE's reliance on fan-driven hype makes it vulnerable to change in market sentiment and limits its long-term growth potential compared to utility-driven ventures like Remittix . Pepe Coin Is Riding The Meme Wave; Will It Outperform Utility Tokens Like Remittix? Pepe Coin has emerged as one of the most talked-about meme coins in recent weeks, following its 22% price surge in the past 14 days which was brought about by its nostalgic appeal and viral marketing campaigns. With a price of $0.0000073, Pepe Coin sits at number 42 on the list of cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $3 Billion. While analysts project Pepe to reach $0.000026 by mid-2025 should its user base continue to grow, its lack of tangible use cases taints its long-term viability. Like Dogecoin, the success of Pepe Coin relies on maintaining its meme coin value through hype while not offering functional solutions a stark contrast to what Remittix is set to offer the Defi space. Remittix: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments The predictions for Dogecoin price show growth potential while Pepe Coin maintains its position in meme coin speculation but Remittix stands as a unique investment option combining functional benefits with explosive profit. The main distinction of Remittix arises from its aggressive approach in applying blockchain solutions to concrete business utility by providing rapid international money transfers. In contrast to hype-dependent speculative meme coins, Remittix has innovation and utility embedded within it and is a distinctive project in today's saturated new ICO market. Remittixpresale has been nothing but phenomenal and has generated a staggering $13.9 million to date. Trading at $0.0734 per RTX token at the current stage, the presale is a worthwhile entry for those seeking early adopter exponential growth potential. Industry experts forecast the RTX token will see an exponential leap increasing up to 800% by the end of the token presale with further gains anticipated in subsequent months after release and listing on top crypto exchanges.

Bitcoin (BTC) Retakes $85,500 After Three-Day Consolidation After a prolonged consolidation phase, Bitcoin (BTC) made a major recovery bounce on Sunday. Following Trump’s appearance at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit, many short-term traders opted to take profits on their BTC holdings. Despite the decline, Bitcoin continues to find buyers, as the recent U.S. Fed rate pause announced on Wednesday prompted macro-sensitive capital to flow toward risky assets. Bitcoin price action, March, 24 2025 Bullish tailwinds from the Fed rate pause counteracted the downward pressure from profit-taking, leading to a three-day stalemate at the $84,000 level since Thursday. However, as sell-side pressure subsided, BTC price recorded a major breakout above $86,000 on Sunday, March 23. The chart above shows how BTC rose 2.6%, hitting a daily peak of $85,600. BTC Options Volume nears $800M as Whales Return After Fed Rate Pause Bitcoin price demonstrated remarkable resilience consolidating around $84,000 over the past three days, as macro-sensitive institutional investors reassess their stance on U.S. economic policies. Earlier this month, fears of inflationary pressure from Trump’s proposed tariffs triggered a cautious retreat from risk assets, including Bitcoin. However, with recent CPI and PPI reports showing inflation cooling and the Federal Reserve opting to pause rate hikes, large investors appear to be re-entering the market. This shift in sentiment is reflected in broader financial markets. The S&P 500 surged by 32 points following the Fed rate pause, signalling renewed risk appetite. As Bitcoin mirrors this trend, it has seen a sharp uptick in speculative trading activity from large investors. Validating this stance, Coinglass derivatives market data shows BTC’s options trading volume skyrocketed 24% in the last 24 hours, pushing total volume above $793 million. Bitcoin Derivatives Market Analysis, March 24 | Coinglass What Does 24% Options Trading Surge Mean for Bitcoin Price Action This Week? Options trading is a derivatives market strategy that allows traders to bet on the future price movements of an asset without directly purchasing it. This technique is particularly popular among institutional investors and whales because leverage enables traders to control large positions with relatively small capital, amplifying returns, especially during periods of market volatility. Given that options trading volume surged 24% over the last day, it suggests that whales and institutional investors are taking bullish positions on BTC’s near-term price movements. Why is BTC Options Volume Rising? The renewed interest in BTC options trading aligns with key macroeconomic narratives: Fed Rate Pause Fuels Risk Appetite – With the Fed pausing rate hikes, liquidity-sensitive assets like Bitcoin become more attractive. S&P 500 Rally Indicates Broader Market Confidence – TradFi investors reallocating capital to stocks may also be expanding exposure to BTC. Altcoin Season Rotation – With BTC holding steady above $85,000, traders are betting on volatility to capture short-term gains. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Data Supports Bullish Outlook, But $90K Flip Unlikely Beyond options trading, other key metrics reinforce a positive BTC outlook for the week ahead: Open Interest Rose 3.88% to $54.04B – A sign that new capital is entering the derivatives market. Long/Short Ratio at 1.28 on OKX & 1.2217 on Binance – Indicates more traders are placing long bets. Liquidations Favor Shorts – Over the last 12 hours, $14.2M in short positions were wiped out, compared to just $2.82M in longs. With Bitcoin showing strong demand above $86,000 and institutional investors actively positioning through options, a bullish breakout toward $90,000 remains a distinct possibility. However, signals on the daily Bitcoin price forecast charts below suggest the rally could face significant resistance below the $90,000 mark. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTCUSD Technical Indicators Signal $90,000 Resistance Despite these bullish signals, the technical chart presents a nuanced picture. While Bitcoin has reclaimed $85,600, the looming death cross—where the 50-day moving average trends below the 200-day moving average—remains a cause for concern. This bearish formation suggests that unless BTC can decisively break above $87,200, a retracement toward the $80,000 region remains plausible. Bulls must clear this key resistance zone to sustain momentum toward $90,000. If BTC fails to establish support above $87,200, bears could regain control, triggering a potential pullback.

Many experts say the current whale moves could boost SHIB value. Investors check the latest Shiba Inu price prediction to see if the coin will bounce back. At the same time, attention turns to a new DeFi project that offers real solutions to crypto payment challenges. It may help many people who struggle with traditional banking by offering faster, safer ways to send money. Many now call it one of the best cryptos to buy. Shiba Inu Price Prediction and Trends Recent data shows that SHIB has seen fluctuations over the past month. The current Shiba Inu price prediction reports a slight dip, but increased whale activity may signal a turn around soon. Technical indicators point to a potential rebound if the market finds a steady base. Analysts who follow Shiba Inu price prediction note that heavy selling by whales may soon turn to accumulation. Some Shiba Inu price prediction reports show that if whales buy more, SHIB could recover and even grow by 97.14% to $0.00002562 by March 28. The coin still enjoys a vibrant community and strong online interest, which many believe will help its price bounce back. Remittix: Solving Real Payment Problems Remittix is one that solves significant problems in crypto payments. Many individuals worldwide don't have access to having any bank account. Remittix addresses the issue directly. It provides a pathway through which the user can change crypto into fiat currency at extremely low transaction charges and quick processing.

Its DeFi coin value at the $0.0734 level holds as the most thought-of point of entry by most investors. Not only does the project raise prices, but also addresses a genuine pain point. Its use makes access to contemporary money possible for millions who would otherwise find regular banking prohibitive. Investors appreciate that Remittix closes the gap between managing crypto and regular money necessities. It shows that great tech exists for the purpose of fixing real issues.

Remittix' growth potential makes it one you should keep an eye on, especially if you are seeking both real-world usability and high returns. Why Remittix Stands Apart In a Competitive Market Shiba Inu price prediction suggests that the activity of whales may lead towards SHIB's rally sooner than later. All the investors are now looking towards Remittix. It offers the real-world solution for global payments by allowing the person to send money at less cost and faster pace.

Several positive indicators suggest a rise toward the $5,000 ETH price level. However, the path to this success faces challenges because experts predict Remittix (RTX) will perform better than Ethereum's most ambitious expectations. Retesting a Multi-Year Ascending Support Ethereum has displayed strong resistance over the years. Previous market surges of more than 1,400% and 270% from this technical structure have occurred following the LUNA collapse and the Bybit hack events. Observers of Ethereum's bullish sentiment have valid reasons to be optimistic due to the historical reliability of this trendline despite current market skepticism. This strong level serves as a launchpad which allows Ethereum to generate a positive technical indicator. Analysts predict that ETH overcoming mid-$2,000 resistance zones would enable a quick rising trend towards $3,000, $4,000 or even $5,000. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported during March that whale accumulation of ETH experienced a substantial boost as big players purchased 120,000 Ether worth approximately $236 million throughout three days. Another whale bought approximately 7,000 ETH worth $13.8 million. The large whale purchases indicate widespread enthusiasm because investors small and large view Ethereum as a platform that will persist into the future. Analysts from Standard Chartered predict that ETH may reach $4,000 by 2025 regardless of their previous $10,000 projection. The Road to $5K: Resistance Levels Ahead Despite the renewed optimism, Ethereum still faces stiff resistance at various price checkpoints. The price movement took ETH from 1,825 to 1,940 before reaching $2,061 but selling activity triggered a reversal below the $2,000 mark. The token is currently trading at $1,997. source: coingecko.com The price mechanics alone will not determine if or when ETH can begin its serious push for $5000 because broader market trends will also impact this situation. The crypto market experiences fluctuations driven by both macroeconomic factors and governmental changes that create quick changes in market sentiment. Why Remittix Could Outshine Ethereum’s Ambitions Remittix (RTX) has recently caught significant attention because researchers believe this project might generate superior returns than the upcoming Ethereum rally. Remittix has achieved a successful fundraising round that exceeded $14 million through selling 521 million coins at a price of $0.0734 each. This token addresses a worldwide market need of streamlining international payment systems which positions it to resolve problems affecting many global users while processing huge worldwide remittance flows. Remittix aims to reach an extensive market segment which Ethereum did previously when it established its blockchain applications during its early development phase. The company should succeed in delivering affordable digital remittance services supported by dependable performance to quickly acquire users from both retail and institutional client bases. RTX token prices should follow the pattern of initial Ethereum price growth during its period of rapid expansion. Remittix Holds the Real Key to Growth Despite Ethereum’s solid foundations supported by technology infrastructure and large investor presence there is still a chance new market entrants will seize a significant portion of investors' attention more quickly than Ethereum can achieve its potential $5,000 price target. Remittix(RTX) aims to transform the vast untapped remittance industry by focusing on a market that needs transformation. The main distinction between Remittix and Ethereum exists in its total dedication to address real-life problems rather than resolving consensus models or Layer-2 separation issues. Those who want to capitalize on upcoming crypto developments should consider investing in Remittixinstead of traditional Ethereum because the company represents exciting changes in blockchain technology.

TRX, which has recovered about 10% from its weekend low of $0.22; is still struggling with the $0.25 resistance level, last transferring at $0.232. Although during October prices rose but technical indicators suggest only weak buying as the On-Balance Volume (OBV) has not confirmed the recent price rise. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s almost-blank performance adds to the uncertainty, which could lead TRX to sink into a downward spiral. Investors are seeking alternatives as uncertainty surrounds the markets, and the decentralized lending ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been attracting significant interest, a sub-$0.05 token boasting presale momentum and a structured growth model. TRX’s Technical Ceiling Enhanced The inability of TRX to break through $0.25 is the result of two rejections at this psychological level. For weeks, the token has been stuck in an oscillation between $0.22 and $0.2745, where $0.248 is an obstinate point of resistance in the middle. Not even a swift 10% recovery on March 19th was enough to breach this ceiling, a sign that bullish conviction was waning. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains close to 50, indicating indecision, while liquidation heatmaps suggest $0.25 is a particularly high-risk area. A push toward this level TD maybe trigger the automated sell-off, bringing TRX back into its lower range. It risks being kicked out of the crypto elite if it fails to deliver a decisive breakout, analysts caution. Whales Shift Towards Presale Investments With TRX still stagnating, investors are diversifying into emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now in Phase 3 of its presale. Current token price of $0.02, growing to $4.5 million raised with over 6,400 holders and a massive +60% of Phase 3 tokens already claimed. Stage two will raise the price to $0.025 — a 25 percent increase — giving existing buyers an instant paper gain of 200 percent when it launches at $0.06. In addition to outlining their projections, analysts have predicted that with its revenue-sharing model and token buybacks, MUTM could be worth $3.50 or higher by late 2025. This potential 17,400% return stands in stark contrast to TRX’s stagnant outlook, which explains the accelerating capital shift. The Strategic Framework of Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance presents a self-reinforcing ecosystem. Its platform allows for decentralized lending, where users can deposit assets (such as ETH or stablecoins) in return for interest-yielding mtTokens. Some protocol fees go to automatic MUTM buybacks redistributing tokens to long-term stakers. This method minimizes the sell pressure while maintaining demand, creating a cycle of scarcity and appreciation. Moreover, the team is in the final stages of a smart contract audit with CertiK, a landmark step anticipated to enhance investor confidence. Results will be revealed through social channels, further aligning with Mutuum’s ethos around transparency. Timing the Presale Window The rapid sell-out in Phase 3 indicates urgency, with the $0.02 entry point evaporating with the tokens. By gaining early participation, investors can not only secure better rates but also prepare for the imminent launch, which will help pump the project’s visibility with listing exchanges. The project’s tokenomics — capped supply and buyback-driven scarcity — implies post-launch supply squeeze, a catalyst for rapid price discovery. For example, a $500 investment today could become $17,500 in junction price ($3.50) a potential if MUTM hits $3.50 — Something some compare to early adopters of Eth.

Its presale model and clear metrics such as the CertiK audit reduce speculative risk compared to memes and aged stalwarts. As to whales look for alternatives that can offer stability and exponential upside, MUTM´s sub-$0.05 valuation sets it up as the ideal entry point. Agility is the key to survival in the tireless evolution of the crypto market. TRX holders looking for diminishing returns now have a choice: stay in those for which returns are far from certain in 2025, or migrate to where this decentralized finance will be in 2025. While Mutuum Finance’s presale continues to be open to investors, the dwindling of Phase 3 suggests hitting the brakes on access to the lowest pricing in the tranches.

As look toward 2025, three meme coins— Arctic Pablo Coin , Dogwifhat, and Ponke—are generating significant buzz. Each offers distinct narratives and potential for investors seeking the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: Bridging Myth and Reality – One of the Best New Meme Coins to Buy for 2025 Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin presale ; it’s an adventurous journey inviting investors to explore the world’s hidden mysteries. As one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025, Arctic Pablo stands out with its unique blend of storytelling, financial potential, and an ever-growing community. At the heart of this project is the intrepid explorer Arctic Pablo, who embarks on expeditions to uncover mystical $APC coins. These shimmering tokens symbolize more than just currency; they represent a gateway to prosperity and potential, infused with the magic of forgotten lands. The presale structure of Arctic Pablo Coin is uniquely designed around Pablo’s travels. Instead of traditional stages, each presale phase is tied to a specific location, with the current being Nippy Nook, the 15th location. As of now, the price stands at $0.000079, with a final presale price set at $0.0008 and a launch price of $0.008. This structure not only adds an element of storytelling but also creates a sense of anticipation and excitement among investors. If you’re lucky enough to join now, you could be looking at a return on investment (ROI) of 10,027.85% once the coin hits the listing price of $0.008—just one of the reasons why it’s considered among the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Investing in Arctic Pablo offers significant potential returns. For instance, a $500 investment would yield approximately 6,328,430.00 APC tokens. Upon reaching the listing price of $0.008, this investment could balloon to $50,627.44 showcasing an impressive return on investment. With such high-profit potential, it’s no surprise that APC is gaining attention as one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. A deflationary mechanism is also in place, where unsold tokens are burned at the end of each week during the presale. This approach reduces the total supply, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens and fostering a deflationary environment. Arctic Pablo has strategically chosen the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for its robust platform, ensuring efficient and secure transactions. The project’s tokenomics are well-structured, with a total maximum supply of 221,200,000,000 APC tokens, allocated across presale, staking, ecosystem development, community rewards, and the team. In essence, Arctic Pablo combines an engaging narrative with solid financial incentives, making it a compelling choice for those seeking the best new meme coins to buy for 2025. Dogwifhat: The Viral Sensation in the Solana Ecosystem Dogwifhat (WIF) has become one of the most talked-about meme coins in the Solana ecosystem, riding the wave of hype and community-driven momentum. With a market cap exceeding $500 million and a 24-hour trading volume surpassing $248 million, WIF continues to capture the attention of traders and meme coin enthusiasts alike. As the crypto market sees renewed interest in meme coins, Dogwifhat’s impressive rally and cult-like following make it a standout contender. With its viral appeal and growing liquidity, many investors are eyeing WIF as a potential high-reward play in the ever-evolving meme coin landscape. The success of Dogwifhat can be attributed to its strong community engagement and viral marketing strategies. Leveraging social media platforms, the project has created a buzz that resonates with Gen Z and Millennials, particularly in Australasia. Memes, challenges, and interactive content have fueled its popularity, making it more than just a cryptocurrency but a cultural phenomenon. Ponke: The Underdog with Growing Momentum Ponke (PONKE) is a rapidly emerging meme coin on the Solana blockchain, boasting a market cap of $56.5 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $10.68 million. With a total and max supply of 555.55 million tokens, Ponke has demonstrated impressive volatility, surging over 4,411% from its all-time low of $0.002254.

For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQS 1. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025? Arctic Pablo Coin stands out due to its immersive storytelling, high ROI potential, and unique presale structure, where each phase is tied to Pablo’s adventurous journey through different mystical locations. With a strong deflationary mechanism, 66% APY staking rewards, and a presale price that increases weekly, APC offers a rare investment opportunity that blends excitement with strong tokenomics. 2. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale work, and what’s the current price? Unlike traditional presales, Arctic Pablo Coin doesn’t have stages—it progresses through locations. Right now, it’s at Nippy Nook, the 15th location, with a presale price of $0.000079. The price increases every week, and unsold tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply. Over $1.96 million has already been raised, and the listing price is set at $0.008, offering massive upside potential. 3. Is Dogwifhat (WIF) still a good investment in 2025? Dogwifhat has solidified its position as a leading meme coin on Solana, with a market cap exceeding $500 million and daily trading volumes surpassing $248 million. Its viral appeal and strong community keep it relevant, making it an attractive choice for investors looking for meme coins with liquidity, hype, and potential for further growth. 4. What is Ponke (PONKE), and why is it gaining traction? Ponke is an emerging meme coin on the Solana blockchain with a market cap of $56.5 million and a growing user base. Despite its price volatility, it has gained attention due to its 4,411% surge from its all-time low, strong community backing, and creative utilities like the “helmet” feature. It’s one of the most promising meme coins for those seeking under-the-radar gems. 5. How do token burns in Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale impact its value? Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary model ensures that unsold tokens are permanently burned every week during the presale, reducing the overall supply. This mechanism creates scarcity, increasing the potential value of APC tokens over time. After the presale, any remaining unsold tokens will also be burned, making the tokenomics even stronger for long-term holders. The post Low Price, High Gains!

The start of 2025 has been troubling, particularly in Europe, where Tesla saw a 45% drop in new registrations in January compared to the same period in 2024, with further declines in February. While the sales rose by 21% in the UK and Australia, shipments of Chinese-made cars in China fell by more than 49%. In March, a Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, Joseph Spak, published a research note predicting a decrease of 5% in Tesla’s sales around the world. Despite the 10% growth expectations, Spak’s forecast triggered a negative reaction in the stock market, causing Tesla’s share price to drop. There can be many other reasons for the fall in Tesla sales. People working with Tesla already expected this drop as the company headed toward the launch of the new Model Y with customers waiting for the latest version. However, research by Morning Consult Intelligence, a brand monitoring firm, says that Musk’s actions have harmed Tesla significantly in Europe and Canada. It also acknowledges the Chinese market remains crucial for Tesla’s success despite the backlash elsewhere. In reality, the recent decline only wiped out a huge rally Tesla experienced right after the election, which nearly doubled its market valuation. In the U.S., the situation seems a bit more complicated. Sure, a lot of consumers seem to be on board with DOGE cuts in government spending. But there’s a catch, “Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.” Tesla’s problems go way beyond how the public views Musk. Prof. Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University’s Centre for Automotive Industry Research told BBC “We’ve not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.” The competition is coming from all directions. Traditional carmakers have been pouring money into electric vehicles, with companies like Kia and Hyundai building a strong reputation for reliable, high-quality EVs. Meanwhile, China is making serious moves. Brands like BYD are expanding rapidly by offering well-performing cars at affordable prices. And then you have higher-end players like Xpeng and Nio, which are all about luxury and advanced tech. Judging from Musk’s comments during Tesla’s earnings calls, he seems much more focused on the robotaxi vision than anything else. Back in January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service up and running in Texas by June. But skeptics were quick to respond, pointing out that Musk has been making these kinds of promises for years. In 2019, he said that within a year, there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of working as robotaxis. Yet Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” package still requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and stay alert. “Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,” says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy. Tesla needs solid leadership, but Musk’s hands are clearly full. Apart from running Tesla, Musk is also deeply involved in his social media platform X, artificial intelligence firm xAI, and SpaceX, which has had a couple of setbacks with its massive Starship rocket recently. When Fox Business asked him how he was managing all these responsibilities, Musk admitted it was “with great difficulty.” “It’s hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,” says Prof. Wells. “If he’s making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.” Despite all this, Musk’s position at Tesla seems untouchable. He’s the company’s largest shareholder, owning about 13% of the stock, which is worth over $95 billion. That’s nearly the same amount held by investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock combined. Other financial players like State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley also have smaller stakes. Sure, Tesla’s recent drop in share price probably wasn’t fun for those investors. But if you look at the big picture, the stock is still about 30% higher than it was a year ago. In reality, the recent decline only wiped out a huge rally Tesla experienced right after the election, which nearly doubled its market valuation. Musk should hand over Tesla to new leadership. Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings. That’s way higher than other car companies like Ford, General Motors, or Toyota. And the reason? Shareholders are still banking on Tesla’s technological breakthroughs and explosive growth. For now, none of the big investors are calling for major changes. But Ross Gerber, a longtime shareholder who’s turned into one of Musk’s most outspoken critics, recently said Musk should step down. Analysts tend to agree that a leadership change could be beneficial. “A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,” says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research. “It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.” Prof. Wells adds, “I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalize the business. It needs a significant change of direction now.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

For the first time, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are officially recognized in global economic reports. However, this sparked a wave of discussion in the crypto community where many claimed that the IMF had referred to Bitcoin as “digital gold.”This quickly caught the attention of many in the space, fueling debates and speculation across social media. However, Dennis Porter, a well-known voice in the space, quickly questioned this interpretation, asking, “Can anyone point to exactly where the IMF says Bitcoin is ‘digital gold’?” Dennis Clarifies The Confusion After diving into the IMF’s statement , Dennis clarified the source of the confusion. The IMF actually referred to Bitcoin as a “new digital asset designed to be used as a means of payment or act as a store of value.” Ok I’ve tracked down why people are claiming the IMF said Bitcoin is digital gold. “new digital assets designed to be used as a means of payment or act as a store of value.” This is a massive stretch to jump to: “IMF says bitcoin is digital gold”. The key phrase is… https://t.co/2bWMbIdRgK pic.twitter.com/wEm7ht62CZ — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) March 23, 2025 He remarked that the phrase “designed to be” is crucial here and it doesn’t necessarily mean that the IMF is officially endorsing Bitcoin as “digital gold” or guaranteeing its stability or value like gold. It’s more about recognizing Bitcoin’s potential, not confirming it as a proven asset. The “store of value” idea for Bitcoin is debated due to its volatility. Unlike gold, which has a long history of stability, Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate significantly. IMF Provides Guidelines on Tracking Digital Assets The IMF’s latest update to the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7) now includes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) in its global economic framework. This is the first time the IMF has provided clear guidelines on how digital assets should be tracked in global financial stats, marking a big step for crypto in the financial world. Cryptos like Bitcoin are classified as non-productive capital assets, while stablecoins are treated as financial instruments. The update also changes how cross-border crypto transactions, staking, and mining are tracked, with mining and staking now recorded as services in a country’s computer services exports/imports. This update is a big step in officially recognizing digital assets as part of the global economy, helping to track and regulate them better in the future.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 01:42:36

One of the tokens currently drawing interest from both early-stage investors and analysts is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). While still in its presale phase, the protocol has already gained traction—not just for its fundraising numbers but for the potential upside that experts say could carry it all the way to the $1 mark. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that emphasizes non-custodial control and real on-chain functionality. The idea is simple: users deposit their crypto assets into liquidity pools, earning passive income while borrowers can access those funds by providing overcollateralized assets. All of this happens through smart contracts, with no need for intermediaries, and complete transparency at every step. What separates Mutuum from many early-stage tokens is the level of focus on functionality. The platform is set up to allow both passive earners and borrowers to engage in DeFi in a way that doesn’t compromise ownership. Lenders receive mtTokens in return for their deposits, which not only represent their share in the pool but also increase in value over time as interest accrues. These mtTokens are ERC20-compliant and can be transferred, traded, or used in other DeFi applications—offering flexibility for users who want more than just a locked position. Another key feature is the upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted directly through the Mutuum lending protocol, allowing users to access liquidity without selling their original assets. It adds another layer of utility while reinforcing demand for the platform itself. Since interest from these stablecoin loans feeds directly into the protocol’s treasury, it also supports long-term stability and value growth for the ecosystem. So why are experts increasingly bullish on MUTM’s price potential? A few reasons stand out. First, the presale momentum has been impressive—Mutuum has already raised over $4.5 million, and more than 6,300 holders have joined the project during its early stages. Currently, in Phase 3, the token is priced at $0.02 and will launch at $0.06. That alone offers early investors a 3x return out of the gate. But more than that, the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform around the time the token goes live. This is critical because it means the token’s utility won’t be based on future promises—it will be tied to an active product from day one. That alignment between launch and functionality is a major reason why many in the crypto space believe MUTM isn’t just another presale token—it’s a DeFi protocol with room to scale. Shortly after its launch, analysts expect the token to trade between $0.21 and $0.28, already showing strong price movement. But in the weeks that follow, projections go even further. Experts suggest that MUTM will reach $1 as the platform gains more traction and user adoption increases. For those buying in at the current $0.02 price, this would represent a 50x return—a rare opportunity in today’s more competitive and cautious market. The presale is expected to sell out quickly, especially given how fast earlier phases have progressed. With strong early adoption, clear communication from the team, and real utility backing the token, the demand isn’t surprising. It’s not just hype that’s driving attention—it’s the structure, the timing, and the execution. As more eyes turn to the DeFi space in search of projects that combine usability with growth, Mutuum Finance is making its case. With key milestones approaching and a working product on the horizon, the $1 prediction doesn’t feel out of reach—it feels like a matter of time.

This month, BlockDAG stands out with strong presale traction, a major beta testnet debut, and major alliances driving its rise toward top Layer 1 blockchain. BDAG has already crossed the $205 million mark with 18.8 billion coins sold. With the final target set at $600 million, those joining now could see some of the largest returns of the year. Here’s why March holds unique value for BDAG supporters. Why This Month May Offer the Best BDAG Price Crypto often delivers key moments when early action leads to the best outcomes. For BDAG, March brings several powerful shifts that strengthen its long-term future. Beta Testnet Arrives in March The beta testnet goes live this month, offering the first full test of BlockDAG’s parallel chain setup. Compared to slower platforms like Ethereum, BDAG’s design handles high traffic without delays. Backed by SpaceDev This partnership is more than a tech move. SpaceDev will support BDAG with advanced upgrades, aiming to improve system strength and user adoption. HackerEarth Hackathon Launched BlockDAG aims to grow a large developer base. Through major hackathons, it is bringing in global Web3 talent to create useful apps that will raise BDAG’s demand. Third Keynote Update After the success of the last two, the upcoming Keynote 3 is expected to unveil new roadmap plans. Previous keynotes have always sparked fresh interest—and this one could have a greater effect. Early BDAG Buyers Have Strong Return Potential Let’s look at the expected returns with clear numbers. BDAG sells for $0.0248 in batch 27. Some experts believe BDAG could reach $1 after it goes live—a 40x gain. Putting in $1,000 today would get roughly 40,000 BDAG. If BDAG reaches $1, that turns into $40,000. This reminds many of Solana, which started near $0.22 and jumped above $250. BDAG may follow a similar track but with quicker growth signals. Key Factors That May Push BDAG to $1 Over 10 CEX Listings—Access to major exchanges means more people can trade, pushing demand up. Limited Supply Structure—BDAG’s setup limits supply, so higher demand could drive price increases. Growing Crowd Interest—Both large-scale and casual buyers are getting involved, and broader attention could lift prices quickly. Final Words! Big updates this month give BDAG an edge, but the highest returns are likely for those who act early. The beta testnet, strong technical support, and near-future listings all signal major changes ahead. Waiting might mean paying 5x, 10x, or even 20x more per coin. For those watching closely, this could be the time BDAG breaks through—like Solana or Avalanche once did.

Qubetics Presale is Your Next Big Chance—Get in on the Top Altcoin Presale of 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bitcoin-cashs-boom-qubetics-presale-is-your-next-big-chance-get-in-on-the-top-altcoin-presale-of-2025/,"The cryptocurrency market has been an absolute rollercoaster lately. From Bitcoin hitting new highs to altcoins skyrocketing with innovative tech, it’s been a non-stop adventure. But here’s the kicker: not everyone caught the early train to profit-town. Whether it was too much uncertainty or simply missing the boat, opportunities have been missed, and some are left scrambling. If you’re feeling like you missed your shot at a big payday with some altcoins, you’re not alone. The truth is, many people passed on Bitcoin Cash, and now it’s too late to scoop up a massive return on that one. But don’t sweat it – there’s a new kid on the block. Qubetics ($TICS) is currently going through an exciting presale phase, and the buzz surrounding this project is something you don’t want to sleep on. Its presale is already in its 27th stage, and the response has been insane. Over 502 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $15.3 million with 23,500+ holders jumping on board. With analysts predicting massive returns after the presale, Qubetics might just be the chance to turn missed opportunities into winning ones. So, let’s dive in and take a look at why Qubetics is the altcoin presale that’s too good to ignore. Bitcoin Cash Coin: A Missed Opportunity Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had its time to shine. Back in 2017, it was one of the top contenders to become the go-to digital currency for everyday transactions. Bitcoin Cash split from Bitcoin due to disagreements over scaling solutions, and its goal was clear: make Bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. For a while, it seemed like BCH could potentially overtake Bitcoin itself, with many crypto enthusiasts touting it as the future of digital cash. However, as time passed, it became clear that Bitcoin Cash couldn’t quite live up to the hype. Its use case, while solid, didn’t evolve fast enough. Competing technologies like Ethereum and newer platforms started to steal the spotlight with their smart contract capabilities and scalability solutions. The market began to see Bitcoin Cash as a “nostalgic” crypto option, more of a historical token than a futuristic one. While BCH still has its place in the market, the window for massive gains is largely closed. It’s a missed opportunity for those who couldn’t jump on board when it was hot. In the crypto space, timing is everything. A few years ago, Bitcoin Cash had the potential for massive returns, but now, for the average crypto enthusiast, it’s like trying to catch lightning in a bottle. There are new projects on the horizon, and many are more innovative, adaptable, and prepared for the future of crypto than BCH ever was. And here’s where Qubetics comes in: it’s offering something Bitcoin Cash never could – real-world applications and huge ROI potential that’s far from tapped out. Qubetics: Still Available and Ready for Action You’ve probably heard whispers about Qubetics ($TICS), and now it’s time to get the lowdown. Right now, this altcoin is in the 27th stage of its presale, and analysts are hyping it up for good reason. As of now, $TICS is priced at $0.1300 per token. The presale is raking in serious money, with over $15.3 million raised and more than 23,500 holders jumping on board. But here’s the thing: there’s still time to get in early, and the price is expected to explode. The real kicker with Qubetics is the sheer promise it holds. Unlike many altcoins that are all talk and no action, Qubetics is set to revolutionize the world of Real World Asset Tokenization (RWAT). In simple terms, Qubetics is aiming to take real-world assets – like real estate, commodities, and even artwork – and tokenize them on the blockchain. This means individuals and businesses can buy, sell, and trade ownership in things like properties and valuable assets with the transparency and security of blockchain technology. So, what does this mean for everyday folks? Let’s break it down. Imagine you’re a small business owner looking to raise capital but don’t want to deal with the headaches of traditional financing methods. With Qubetics, you could tokenize your business’s assets, making it easier to access funding while providing more security and potential for future growth. Or think about the average person who wants to own a piece of luxury real estate but doesn’t have the full cash flow to buy a property outright. Qubetics lets them purchase fractional ownership in that property through tokenization. No more waiting for a miracle investment opportunity – Qubetics offers an affordable, secure, and efficient way to make significant investments possible for everyone. Now, consider the massive return potential of $TICS. Analysts predict that after the presale, the token could skyrocket to $1, giving early adopters a 669% ROI. But that’s not all – experts are predicting it could hit $5 post-presale, offering a jaw-dropping 3745% ROI. And the best part? Once the mainnet launches, the $TICS token could go as high as $15, offering a mind-blowing 11,436% return. The presale is moving fast, so if you’re still sitting on the sidelines, it’s time to get serious about your crypto future. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy in 2025: Qubetics is the One So, let’s face it – there are a ton of cryptos out there, and it can be tough to pick the right one to buy in 2025. From DeFi projects to meme coins, there’s no shortage of choices. But here’s the thing: not all of them have staying power. Many coins will fizzle out or fail to deliver on their promises. When it comes to identifying which altcoin presale is the real deal, it’s all about finding a project with a solid use case, scalability, and massive upside potential. That’s where Qubetics checks all the boxes. Think about it: the crypto space has seen some solid growth, but it’s still stuck in a lot of legacy thinking. Traditional investment options, like real estate, haven’t evolved to the same degree. The world is shifting toward tokenization, and Qubetics is right at the forefront of that shift. What makes this project stand out from others in the crypto presale space is its potential to solve real-world problems. Tokenizing assets like real estate and luxury goods isn’t just an idea; it’s a tangible solution that’s going to change the way people think about ownership and investment. Qubetics isn’t just some moonshot – it’s a project that addresses actual pain points in the global economy. People have been craving solutions to fractional ownership, transparency, and liquidity in the asset space, and Qubetics is answering that call. And when it comes to the presale, there’s still time to grab $TICS at a low price before it potentially shoots up after the mainnet launch. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Qubetics Presale If you’ve been sleeping on the idea of getting involved in a top altcoin presale , Qubetics ($TICS) is the one to wake up to. With its revolutionary approach to Real World Asset Tokenization, it’s positioning itself to be a major player in 2025 and beyond. The presale is in full swing, with over $15 million raised, and the $TICS token price is expected to soar once the presale ends. Analysts predict massive returns, and with real-world use cases that solve actual problems, there’s no reason to sit this one out. Now’s the time to act. Qubetics is poised for a breakout, and missing out on this presale could mean missing a huge opportunity. So, jump in while the price is still low, and don’t let another top altcoin presale slip through your fingers.

The scam involved the fraudsters contacting victims and earning trust before directing them to websites masquerading as legitimate crypto investment platforms, Virginia’s Eastern District US Attorney’s Office said in a March 21 statement. Once victims made a deposit, the funds were funneled through over 75 bank accounts under the names of shell companies, then sent abroad “deceptively characterized” as domestic wires, despite being transferred to a bank outside the US. Source: US Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of Virginia “The sites falsely represented to the victims that their investments were making sizeable gains,” Virginia’s US Attorney’s Office added in its statement. “When victims would attempt to make withdrawals, the perpetrators would coerce the victims to send even more money using tactics such as claiming the victims owed taxes on their purported profits.” The United States Secret Service seized some of the stolen funds from a foreign bank in 2023 and began the civil forfeiture action by filing a claim in a US District Court. However, the bank also made a claim against the cash, and the US authorities eventually reached a settlement agreement for $7 million of the seized funds. Victims of the scam have been urged to contact the Secret Service to petition to recover their losses.

Gordon added that a cut could sway people to put their savings into shares of local companies, which could then spark other firms to go public in the UK and help the economy. In comparison, she called crypto “a non-productive asset” that “doesn’t feed back into the economy.” “Equities provide growth capital to companies that employ people, innovate and pay corporation tax. That is a social contract. We shouldn’t be afraid of advocating for that.” The country’s Financial Conduct Authority said in November that crypto ownership rose to 12% of adults, equivalent to around 7 million people. A majority of crypto owners, 36%, were under the age of 55 years old. Gordon said that many had “shifted to saving rather than investing,” which she claimed “is not going to fund a viable retirement.” A 2022 FCA survey found that 70% of adults had a savings account, while 38% either directly held shares or held them through an account allowing nearly 20,000 British pounds ($26,000) of tax-free savings a year — around three in four 18-24 years olds held no investments. A quarter of 18-25 year olds and a third of 25-44 year olds held any investment in 2022. Source: FCA But in a follow-up survey, the regulator reported that in the 12 months to January 2024, the cost of living crisis had seen 44% of all adults either stop or reduce saving or investing, while nearly a quarter used savings or sold their investments to cover day-to-day costs. Gordon is a member of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce, a group of industry executives aiming to revive the local market, which Cavendish would benefit from as it advises companies on how to navigate possible public offerings.

Consulting giant EY reported in January that the London stock market had one of its “quietest years on record,” with just 18 companies listing last year, down from 23 in 2023. At the same time, EY said 88 companies delisted or transferred from the exchange, with many saying they moved due to “declining liquidity and lower valuations compared to other markets” such as the US. However, Gordon claimed the UK is a “safe haven” compared to markets such as the US, which has lost trillions of dollars in its stock markets due to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and fears of a recession. Crypto markets have also slumped alongside US equities, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) trading down 11% over the past 30 days and struggling to maintain support above $85,000 since early March. In the past 24 hours, at least, Bitcoin is up 2%, trading around $85,640.

In 2022, the Treasury blacklisted Tornado Cash for its role in laundering $455 million stolen by the Lazarus hacking group. The Move Sparks Criticism From Grewal But the move has sparked strong backlash. In a latest X post, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, has publicly criticized the U.S. Treasury for its handling of Tornado Cash’s delisting. He argues that the Treasury is wrongly trying to avoid a final court decision. Grewal is criticizing the U.S. Treasury for continuing legal actions against Tornado Cash, even after it was removed from the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. The Treasury now claims that a final court decision is unnecessary, but Grewal argues that this is against legal procedures. Relying on that decision, the Fifth Circuit rejected an agency’s argument that its withdrawal of a determination “unilaterally and avoid judicial review” did not moot the case, because the agency could decide to revisit the decision and issue a similar determination against the… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 23, 2025 He shared that this is only valid if the defendant can prove the issue won’t happen again. He also mentioned past cases where sanctions were lifted but the case stayed open, allowing them to be reimposed later. “Here, Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from the SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again. That’s not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,” noted Grewal. Grewal’s criticism comes during a long legal battle where Tornado Cash users challenged the Treasury’s decision to add the mixer to the SDN list. The users argued that the smart contract didn’t qualify as property under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because it’s non-erasable. Although the court sided with the users, clarifying the status of the Tornado’s smart contract, despite this, Grewal criticized the Treasury for not fully following the court’s ruling. Coinbase, Ethereum Foundation Back Tornado Cash Tornado Cash has been supported by groups like Coinbase and the Ethereum Foundation, which are backing lead developer Alexey Pertsev’s defense. The legal battle has been intense, with supporters claiming the Treasury’s actions were unfair and lacked clear legal grounds. Lifting the sanctions against Tornado Cash is an important step in the ongoing debate over how crypto mixers should be regulated. The Treasury lifted them after reviewing legal issues but still expressed concern over North Korea’s use of digital assets for hacking and money laundering.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|ETH|ASIA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 02:53:54

The Federal Reserve signaled in its March 18-19 meeting that it would also “look past short-term inflationary pressures, laying the groundwork for potential future easing,” Thielen added. “Powell’s mildly dovish tone suggests that the Fed's put remains intact, providing further support for a recovery in stock prices.” 10x Research’s Bitcoin reversal indicators have turned bullish as a result, with Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) 21-day moving average now at $85,200, Thielen noted. Bitcoin’s bottoming formations over the last two years. Source: 10x Research He said these weekly reversal indicators have pulled back to levels where past bull markets have resumed, such as in September 2023 — spurred on by the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund narrative — and August 2024 as the US election neared. “In short, the technical backdrop has now reset to a point where a renewed uptrend could plausibly unfold.” Thielen also noted that several altcoins are already breaking out of their downtrend channels and trading at more “attractive levels.” Bitcoin is currently trading at $85,720, up 2.1% over the last 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. Meanwhile, Ether ( ETH ), Tron ( TRX ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ) have rebounded 4.3%, 6.4% and 8.9% respectively over the last week. The crypto research analyst, however, expects to see “significant resistance” at the $90,000 mark for Bitcoin, should it reach that level. Despite the more positive outlook, “no clear catalyst exists for an immediate parabolic rally” is in sight, Thielen said. Related: Bitcoin ‘in position’ for first key RSI breakout in 6 months at $85K He initially said Bitcoin wouldn’t drop below $73,000 — thereby avoiding a “deep bear market” — because the largest sum bracket of Bitcoin holders (wallets with 100-1000 Bitcoin) are likely family offices and wealth managers who are invested in Bitcoin for the long term. He also noted that the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs returned inflows for the first time last week since the last week of January. “We expect Bitcoin ETF selling from arbitrage-focused investors to wind down, as the arbitrage opportunities have primarily been closed for weeks,” Thielen added.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC , Nabiullina told journalists at a press conference that she wants to “ban settlements made in cryptocurrencies between residents” outside the so-called experimental legal regime (ELR). Russian Crypto Ban – Still on the Table? The ELR, policed by the Central Bank, is a regulatory sandbox that the bank uses to allow certain Russian firms to buy and sell goods, using crypto as a payment tool. The Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina speaking to journalists on March 21, 2025. (Source: Bank of Russia/Screenshot) The bank also appears to want to use the ELR as a mechanism for Russian crypto miners to sell their coins to global buyers. In recent days, the bank has suggested that it is prepared to allow “qualified investors” to trade crypto within the confines of the sandbox . But Nabiullina’s recent comments suggest she has lost none of her famous crypto-skepticism . The long-serving Governor has previously called for total bans on crypto exchanges and token trading . The bank even drafted a bill calling for a total ban on all forms of crypto trading and ownership, as well as crypto mining. Sanctions regimes have forced her to change her stand, however. With Russian companies and banks forced out of the SWIFT messaging network and dollar-denominated trade, many companies now use tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to trade with overseas partners.

These echo her previous calls to keep “private cryptocurrencies” out “of the Russian economy.” The Russian Central Bank. (Source: Bank of Russia/Screenshot) ‘Criminal Liability’ Nabiullina told journalists that Moscow should introduce criminal “liability” for anyone caught “violating the ban.” “We maintain our old position that cryptocurrencies should not be allowed as a means of payment. So we propose introducing a ban on settlements in cryptocurrencies between residents [of Russia] outside the ELR. We don’t only propose introducing a ban, but also establishing liability for violating the ban.” Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina Nabiullina claimed, however, that “it was time to take a step forward” in “relations with cryptocurrencies.” She said that Moscow must “build a regulatory environment” that would give “particularly qualified” investors the right to “invest in cryptocurrencies on the Russian market.” In recent days, some have suggested that the ELR could team up with the Moscow Exchange to launch crypto trading products for these “particularly qualified” investors.

The Russian state-run media agency TASS reported that the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Alexander Shokhin, wants the government to “analyze the prospects for using cryptocurrencies” after US President Donald Trump’s decision to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve . Shokhin said: “It seems that it has been agreed [in Moscow] that crypto can be used in cross-border settlements.

By March 14, 2025, XRP is being exchanged at around $2.31. Despite the fact that experts are very positive about the prospects of its future, the highest price scale forecast varies from $3.40 to $15, and the situation in which as impressive a rally as that of 2017 would take place again seems very far away. .

According to a Mar. 23 press release , Titan operates as a layer above standard DEX aggregators like Jupiter ( JUP ) and DFlow. To ensure traders receive the best price with no fees, it aggregates quotes from all available DEX aggregators rather than just sourcing liquidity from different DEXs. In addition to aggregation , Titan introduces Talos, a proprietary routing algorithm that, according to the press release, outperforms competitors 80% of the time. Compared to current Solana ( SOL ) solutions, Talos analyzes more liquidity sources and optimizes routing at a granular level to enhance trade execution. Quote slippage caused by execution delays is a major problem with on-chain swaps. Because Solana transactions take around 10 seconds (25 blocks) to complete, the price may fluctuate before the trade is executed. Titan wants to address this issue by continuously updating quotes in real-time to provide traders with the most accurate pricing. “Titan’s aim is to provide DeFi traders with the best possible prices while abstracting away the complexity involved. Today, crypto trading lags behind traditional markets in its order placement design. It’s time for us to upgrade our infrastructure and close this gap, and that’s what Titan is designed to do.” — Chris Chung, CEO and co-founder of Titan You might also like: Solana ETF set to debut in the U.S Titan previously raised $3.5 million in a September 2024 pre-seed round, backed by Round13 Digital Asset Fund and Beluga Labs.

Solana continues to lead in DEX trading volume , which hit a record $258 billion in January before cooling off to $105 billion in February amid a broader market downturn. Impressively, the stablecoin market cap on the network has grown to $12.36 billion, a three times increase from December 2024, according to DefiLlama data . Despite this growth, SOL’s price has seen volatility. It peaked at $298.31 in January before dipping to $118 on Mar. 11. The price has rebounded to $133 as of press time. With rising institutional interest, analysts speculate SOL could push toward the $300 mark in the coming months.

The next key resistance is near the $2,040 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,068 swing high to the $1,936 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,040 level. A clear move above the $2,040 resistance might send the price toward the $2,120 resistance. An upside break above the $2,120 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,150 resistance zone or even $2,250 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,040 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,980 level.

The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made its decisions, and the long-running XRP lawsuit was finally resolved, bringing relief to the community. However, the Pi Network faced some tough challenges. The migration and Know Your Customer (KYC) process are now complete, but many users were unable to claim their tokens. As a result, Pi fell behind the market, leading to doubts about whether now is a good time to buy. Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Pi was the worst performer last week, losing more value than the rest. A big blow came when Binance refused to list Pi. They stated that any token not listed on the Binance Smart Chain is not eligible for a vote, disqualifying Pi from consideration. What’s Next For Pi Coin Price? The Pi token dropped below the $1 mark, after hitting an all-time high of $3 following its Open Network launch on February 20. It hit the lows of around $0.70, leaving many investors uncertain about the future. However, it has now bounced back, trading at around $0.96. Despite the downturn, analysts are spotting potential for a rebound and there are signs that a breakout could happen. If the support level holds strong, Pi could push back toward $2. The trading volume saw an initial spike but later declined, showing that sellers are currently in control, weakening the momentum of buyers. Ater a 3% drop, the price is approaching the critical $0.70 support level, and if this breaks, it could lead to further drops, potentially down to $0.50 or $0.10.

While some users are taking profit, others are adding more coins, expecting another price rally. Even with market dips, digital assets have often bounced back. However, only a few manage to recover fully. Picking coins with solid use, high trading volumes, and strong tech backing can help in the long run. Based on market study and performance, five top bullish cryptos to buy now are Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and BlockDAG. These coins show strong signs of growth. Let’s explore what makes each one stand out and how they could offer high returns. BlockDAG: Record-Breaking Presale with Huge ROI Potential By using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure instead of a typical blockchain, BlockDAG (BDAG) handles many transactions at once. This leads to faster and smoother operations. Its structure offers more safety and better scaling compared to others. These features place it among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Its presale is seeing massive support, with over $205 million raised and more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold. Currently, in Batch 27, the coin trades at $0.0248—jumping 2,380% from its $0.001 starting price. The quick sales show growing interest. With more batches selling fast, the $600 million target seems close, making it one of the biggest presales in years. The referral plan gives users 5% cashback in USDT when buying through shared links. With no caps on earnings or time limits, people are using it to earn rewards while getting BDAG coins. This helps keep buying active and adds more support to BDAG’s rise as one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Bitcoin: Key Player with Strong Market Role As the earliest digital currency, Bitcoin still leads with its tight network security and known role as a value holder. Though prices go up and down, its supply cap and name value keep it in demand. News of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve plan could affect future price changes. Bitcoin also plays a role in money transfers and shields from rising costs. Though newer tech options exist, Bitcoin’s strong hold and network trust keep it among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. BNB: Boosting DeFi Access and Trading Reach What began as Binance Coin has grown into a key part of the Binance system. It helps lower trading costs and unlocks special options on the platform. Beyond trading, BNB fuels dApps on Binance Smart Chain, offering quick service and low fees. New meme coins are gaining ground on BNB Chain, adding more use to the network. This boosts BNB’s status as a strong rival to Ethereum and Solana in the DeFi world. Because of its steady demand and wide reach, BNB holds a spot among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Solana: Fast Transactions Speeds Known for quick actions and cheap fees, Solana can handle thousands of steps every second. Its special Proof-of-History method gives it an edge in running smoothly and scaling well. Developers are turning to Solana thanks to its strong support for smart contracts and dApps. Even after network pauses, many still expect growth from Solana. There’s also talk of a spot ETF, which may boost its price. These signs make Solana one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Ethereum: Smart Contracts and Pectra Upgrade With strong use in smart contract building, Ethereum helps run many dApps today. Its shift to Proof-of-Stake in Ethereum 2.0 brings better speed and lower power use. This improves user and developer experience. The platform leads in DeFi and NFT growth, hosting thousands of active projects. While rivals like Solana and BNB grow, Ethereum’s strong base and planned Pectra changes help it keep its place. It stays one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Top Bullish Cryptos to Buy Now— Final Say! News of Bitcoin reserves, Ethereum’s Pectra update, BNB’s growing DeFi use, and Solana’s speed plus ETF hopes keep them among the top bullish cryptos to buy now. Still, BlockDAG stands out with its fast-rising presale and broad use of DAG tech. With $205 million already raised and a target of $600 million, it’s setting new records. The DAG setup, high-speed power, and rewarding system help push BDAG ahead. It’s gaining attention from those who seek the top bullish cryptos to buy now for better returns.

Sonic, a rebranded high-speed blockchain, is moving ahead with the development of a yield-generating algorithmic stablecoin despite lingering concerns following the Terra-Luna collapse. At the same time, Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser is predicting a shift toward gold-backed stablecoins, arguing they offer greater global trust and geopolitical neutrality than US dollar-pegged tokens. Sonic Blockchain Pushes Forward with High-Yield Algorithmic Stablecoin Amid Lingering Terra Ghosts The Sonic blockchain, a project that rebranded from the Fantom network and touts itself as the fastest Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain, is forging ahead with one of crypto’s most controversial innovations: an algorithmic stablecoin that promises yields of up to 23%. The bold move is reigniting conversations and concerns about the risks of such tokens, especially following the catastrophic collapse of TerraUSD (UST) nearly three years ago—a crisis that ushered in one of the longest crypto winters in history. The announcement came via Andre Cronje, co-founder of Sonic Labs and founder of Yearn.finance, who revealed in a March 22 post on X that a proof-of-concept (POC) for the stablecoin was showing promising yield results. “POC looks good. Yielding > 200% APR @ 10m TVL, around 23.5% APR @ 100m, steady at around 4.9% at 1bn+. Will scale up and get team for a full release,” Cronje wrote. Despite his optimism, Cronje didn’t shy away from admitting the emotional burden associated with algorithmic stablecoins . Just one day earlier, he confessed to experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the fallout from Terra’s failure. “Pretty sure our team cracked algo stable coins today, but previous cycle gave me so much PTSD not sure if we should implement,” he added. Algorithmic stablecoins differ from fiat-backed stablecoins by using code-based mechanisms to maintain their peg to the US dollar or other fiat currencies. These mechanisms often rely on incentivizing traders or burning and minting partner tokens to maintain equilibrium. While elegant in theory, they have proven dangerous in practice. In May 2022, TerraUSD (UST), once a rising star in decentralized finance, lost its peg during a liquidity crisis that rapidly spiraled out of control. The token, which offered a tantalizing 20%+ APY through the Anchor Protocol, crashed from $1 to as low as $0.30. Its sister token, LUNA, used to help stabilize UST, saw a catastrophic collapse of over 98%, plunging from $120 to less than a dollar. The $40 billion implosion of the Terra ecosystem rattled the entire industry, tanking investor confidence and drawing the attention of global regulators. It also left investors—both retail and institutional—holding worthless tokens and prompted a wave of lawsuits and investigations into Terraform Labs and co-founder Do Kwon. Unlike Terra, Sonic is attempting to address scalability and finality as foundational elements of its blockchain. The platform claims to be the fastest EVM chain, boasting a true 720 milliseconds (ms) finality—an industry record confirmed during its testnet launch on Sept. 8, 2024. Sonic’s revamped network has attracted considerable attention. Since rebranding from Fantom, its total value locked (TVL) has surged by 66% to $253 million. The network’s ability to finalize transactions faster than its competitors has positioned it as a promising infrastructure layer for high-frequency decentralized applications (dApps), including stablecoins. Now, with the development of a yield-generating algorithmic stablecoin, Sonic is once again pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance—this time, in more dangerous waters. The move comes at a time when regulatory bodies are actively cracking down on algorithmic stablecoins. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation will effectively ban the issuance of such tokens in the bloc, specifically citing the need to avoid repeats of the Terra-Luna disaster. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and other global regulators have similarly taken a cautious stance, noting the lack of collateral backing and the systemic risks these coins can pose to broader crypto markets. Despite this, interest in algorithmic stablecoins hasn’t completely faded. Speculators continue to trade Terra’s resurrected LUNA token. This enduring appetite for risk sheds light on a key challenge facing projects like Sonic: the allure of high yields remains powerful, even as memories of devastating losses linger. Can Sonic Break the Algorithmic Curse? Sonic’s team believes their new algorithmic stablecoin is fundamentally different from its predecessors, with a more sustainable yield curve and enhanced mechanisms to avoid death spirals. The estimated yield decreases as more capital flows in, designed to maintain long-term equilibrium and reduce the reliance on overly generous incentive programs. However, with Cronje himself expressing hesitation and PTSD from the last cycle, even insiders recognize that the ghosts of Terra still haunt this sector. Whether Sonic’s version of an algorithmic stablecoin can survive where others have failed remains an open question. For now, all eyes are on the upcoming release as the industry holds its breath—again. Gold-Backed Stablecoins Poised to Challenge Dollar Dominance, Says Bitcoin Maximalist Max Keiser In related news, the battle for the future of digital money is heating up—and it may be fought not in Bitcoin or the US dollar, but in gold. According to Bitcoin maximalist and prominent financial commentator Max Keiser, gold-backed stablecoins are poised to overtake US dollar-pegged alternatives on the global stage due to gold’s inflation-hedging properties, minimal volatility, and geopolitical neutrality. In a series of recent statements, Keiser criticized the push by US lawmakers to preserve global dollar dominance through fiat-backed stablecoins. Instead, he predicted a coming wave of gold-backed digital tokens led by countries that oppose US financial hegemony. “Russia, China, and Iran are not going to accept a U.S. dollar stablecoin. I predict they will counter the USD stablecoin with a gold one,” Keiser said, arguing that these nations see the dollar as a geopolitical weapon rather than a trusted reserve asset. “China and Russia have a combined 50,000 tonnes of gold — more than what is reported,” he added. Keiser’s comments bring attention to a growing ideological and strategic divide between Western and Eastern powers when it comes to the future of monetary systems. US officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller, have recently emphasized the importance of stablecoins pegged to the dollar as tools for maintaining US financial influence abroad. At the March 7 White House Crypto Summit, Bessent announced that the Trump administration would make dollar-pegged stablecoin development a top national priority, citing the need to ”protect the dollar's reserve currency status” and prevent the global financial system from fragmenting into competing digital zones. In contrast, many foreign governments are exploring or already piloting alternatives, including stablecoins backed by hard assets such as gold. These efforts reflect growing resistance to dollar-centric financial infrastructure and the sanctions power it enables. The rise of gold-backed stablecoins like Tether’s Alloy (aUSD₮), launched in mid-2024, marks a significant shift in how value is being collateralized in the digital age. Alloy is backed by Tether’s XAU₮, a token that offers a claim to physical gold held in reserve. Gabor Gurbacs, founder of PointsVille and former VanEck executive, argued that XAU₮ represents a return to the sound money principles that underpinned the dollar before it was taken off the gold standard in 1971. “Tether Gold is what the dollar used to be before 1971,” Gurbacs noted in a March 19 post on X. “XAU₮ is up 15.7% year-to-date, while the broad crypto market is in the red. Foundations and businesses should hedge their holdings with XAU₮.” Indeed, XAU₮ recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by a historic rally in the global gold market amid fears of economic stagflation, geopolitical instability, and waning trust in central banks. Keiser and other critics argue that dollar-pegged stablecoins, while convenient, carry inherent political baggage. Since they are ultimately backed by dollar-denominated assets and often governed by US regulations, adversarial nations are unlikely to adopt them for large-scale cross-border transactions. The introduction of gold-backed alternatives, therefore, could allow countries like Russia, China, and Iran to participate in the digital economy without exposing themselves to US surveillance or sanctions. “Gold doesn’t come with a central bank or a central government,” Keiser pointed out. “It’s been money for 5,000 years, and that credibility is not something the dollar can easily replicate—especially not in the form of a token.” Lawmakers Push for Stablecoin Regulation Despite these geopolitical headwinds, US policymakers are pressing ahead with legislative efforts to support dollar-based stablecoins. The Stable Act of 2025 and the newly proposed GENIUS Stablecoin Bill aim to establish clear guidelines for issuance, reserve requirements, and regulatory oversight. Proponents argue that without such a framework, the US risks losing control over the most important financial innovation of the 21st century. They see dollar-pegged stablecoins as a necessary tool for preserving dollar supremacy in an increasingly multipolar world. However, the rise of gold-backed alternatives threatens to upend these plans. As more investors, corporations, and even governments begin to hedge with digital assets backed by physical gold, the appeal of fiat-pegged coins may diminish—especially in regions where trust in the US financial system is already eroding. The stablecoin market is approaching a critical inflection point. On one side is the US-led vision of regulated, fiat-pegged stablecoins tightly integrated into the existing financial system. On the other is an emerging movement toward decentralized, hard-asset-backed tokens that reject centralized control and seek to restore monetary neutrality. With gold-backed tokens like XAU₮ gaining traction and central banks worldwide accumulating bullion at record pace, the digital gold standard may no longer be a fringe idea—it could be the foundation of the next global monetary order. And as Max Keiser sees it, the race is already on.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|LUNA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-24 05:00:00

The $5.9t asset management heavyweight on Friday filed to tokenize a share class of its US Treasury money market fund on Ethereum, marking its first major move into asset tokenization. Its filing , submitted to the US SEC on March 21, outlines Fidelity’s plan to launch an “OnChain” share class of its $80m Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX). The underlying assets — mainly US Treasury bills and cash — will stay in traditional custody. Investor share records, however, will also be logged on the Ethereum blockchain to improve transparency and traceability. The official ownership record will still be kept off-chain by Fidelity’s transfer agent. Blockchain entries will be reconciled with this official record on a daily basis. Source: US SEC TradFi Titans Embrace Tokenization to Modernize Markets Fidelity now joins a growing group of traditional finance giants exploring tokenization . Others in this space include BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. These firms see tokenization as a way to modernize financial infrastructure. It involves creating digital representations of real-world assets (RWAs) on a blockchain. The promise lies in real-time settlement, fractional ownership, improved transparency and broader access to financial products that were once difficult to reach. So far, that promise is catching on. According to data from rwa.xyz , the total market for tokenized US Treasuries has surged to $4.78b. Ethereum alone accounts for over $3.3b in value, far outpacing other blockchains like Stellar. BlackRock launched its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) just last year. It has already amassed $1.46b in tokenized assets. This shows that institutions are no longer just exploring blockchain. They are now actively building on it. Fidelity Experiments with Ethereum, Keeps Options Open Fidelity’s approach is cautious but deliberate. By keeping the core asset structure unchanged and only recording a secondary ledger on-chain, the firm can test blockchain benefits without disrupting regulatory compliance or investor expectations. The fund itself remains a conventional money market vehicle — focusing on capital preservation, income generation, and liquidity — but now with an optional tech-forward twist. Pending regulatory approval, the OnChain share class is expected to go live by May 30. Fidelity also noted that it may explore other blockchains beyond Ethereum in the future, signaling longer-term ambitions in the digital asset space.

The resolution has sparked optimism among XRP watchers, with analysts eyeing a potential climb to $10 by 2030, driven by regulatory clarity, the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and the possibility of a Ripple Labs IPO. Bitget’s Ryan Lee noted a breakout from the current trading range of $2.35 to $2.55 could lead to extensive moves in either direction. “Short-term price targets range from $2.00-$2.17 on the downside to $2.65-$3.00 on the upside,” Lee said, adding, “Long-term forecasts suggest $4.20-$10+ by 2030 if Ripple capitalizes on payment adoption, though $2.50 remains a pivotal level to watch for the next breakout or breakdown.” He attributed the medium-term range of $1.50-$5.89 to the SEC’s retreat and potential XRP ETF approvals, though technical indicators like a neutral RSI and bearish MACD suggest consolidation. The RSI, or relative strength index, is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale of 0 to 100, signaling overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions. MACD, or moving average convergence divergence, is a trend-following indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a price, with its signal line crossovers indicating bullish or bearish momentum shifts. Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, added relatively lesser volatility in XRP’s price-action was a further sign of sentiment leaning bullish: “XRP has fared well under the past months’ crypto selloff and has room to potentially continue upward, though momentum can be lost if U.S. macroeconomic factors and tariffs disrupt the industry.” The forecasts come as IPO chatter is heating up, which Garlinghouse mentioned was “possible” in a Wednesday interview last week, providing further cues for bullish positioning.",Markets|XRP|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-24 05:03:38

Meanwhile, the US is exploring innovative ways to fund Bitcoin purchases by using revalued gold certificates. In the private sector, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is preparing for another major BTC acquisition after raising $711 million. Pakistan Joins Global Crypto Wave Pakistan is making a bold move toward embracing cryptocurrency after Bilal Bin Saqib, the CEO of the newly-formed Crypto Council, proposed the use of the country’s surplus energy to mine Bitcoin. This proposal was brought forward during the council’s inaugural meeting on March 21, which signaled a major shift in the country's stance on digital assets. The meeting gathered high-profile figures, including lawmakers, the governor of the Bank of Pakistan, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and the federal IT secretary. The main goal of the initiative is to lay the groundwork for a robust crypto ecosystem in Pakistan, focusing on attracting foreign investment and establishing the nation as a major crypto hub. Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb praised the efforts, and stated that it was the start of a new digital era for the country, one that promotes transparency, economic empowerment, and technological leadership. This change in policy is especially interesting when considering the government's previously rigid opposition to cryptocurrencies. In May of 2023, then-Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Aisha Ghaus Pasha stated that crypto will never be legalized in Pakistan, due to concerns over anti-money laundering compliance under FATF guidelines. However, the tide turned on Nov. 4, 2024, when the government officially moved to regulate cryptocurrencies as legal tender. This was during the same time that elections were held in the United States. The global shift toward pro-crypto policies seems to have influenced Pakistan’s decision. After his re-election, President Donald Trump very quickly implemented several digital asset-friendly policies. On Jan. 23, 2025, he signed an executive order forming the Working Group on Digital Assets to explore broad regulatory reform. Donald Trump signing executive orders The same order also banned any government-led research or issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). In another show of support, Trump signed another executive order in March of 2025 to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve along with a digital asset stockpile composed of US-origin cryptocurrencies. Pakistan’s pivot seems to align with this emerging international trend. US Gold to Bitcoin Plan Gains Momentum The Trump administration is also exploring creative, budget-neutral ways to expand the United States’ Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to Bo Hines , the executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets. On the Crypto in America podcast, Hines revealed that one of the most promising strategies under consideration involves using the government's undervalued gold certificates. These certificates are currently priced at a statutory value of $42.22 per troy ounce, which is much lower than the current market price of gold, which exceeds $3,000 per ounce. Hines referenced Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025, which proposes revaluing these gold certificates to reflect their true market worth, thereby enabling the government to buy Bitcoin without it impacting taxpayers. The legislation recommends that Federal Reserve banks submit all outstanding gold certificates to the Treasury Secretary, who will then issue updated certificates based on the fair market value of the underlying gold. This mechanism could potentially unlock substantial funds for Bitcoin purchases, which certainly aligns with the Trump administration’s push for a strategic, fiscally responsible accumulation of digital assets. Currently, the US government holds approximately 207,000 BTC, primarily from seizures in criminal and civil cases. This makes it the largest known national holder of Bitcoin . According to Hines, the strategic reserve is being treated as a separate entity from the broader digital asset stockpile, a distinction driven by Bitcoin’s unique qualities as a commodity with no issuer and widely accepted status as a store of value. He stated that Bitcoin’s special status had been carefully defended by the administration, even as other digital assets were being considered for inclusion in the new national stockpile. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other officials agreed with this sentiment that Bitcoin occupies a privileged position in the administration’s digital asset framework. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is also making legislative progress on crypto-related policies, with bipartisan momentum building behind a stablecoin bill and a broader crypto market structure bill. Representative Ro Khanna is very optimistic that both measures could be passed this year. Strategy Signals More BTC Ahead It is not only countries interested in gathering more Bitcoin. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at yet another potential Bitcoin purchase after the company’s recent capital raise through a preferred stock offering. In a post on X , Saylor shared a Bitcoin price chart with the caption “needs more orange,” teasing the possibility of another BTC acquisition once markets reopen. According to SaylorTracker, the company’s last purchase took place on March 17, when it bought 130 BTC for approximately $10.7 million. This brought its total holdings to 499,226 BTC. Although it was a relatively small buy compared to its previous acquisitions, it followed a brief two-week pause in activity. On March 21, Strategy announced the pricing of a new tranche of preferred stock , sold at $85 per share with a 10% coupon, expected to generate about $711 million in revenue. This capital infusion may set the stage for another large-scale Bitcoin purchase, which is consistent with the company’s long-term accumulation strategy. Michael Saylor is still one of Bitcoin’s most vocal advocates, and he uses both financial and political channels to promote the asset. He also called for the US government to buy 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply by 2035, when almost all of the 21 million coins will have been mined. He also published a proposal titled “A Digital Assets Strategy to Dominate the 21st Century Global Economy,” urging the government to adopt a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. At the recent Blockworks Digital Asset Summit, Saylor delivered his “21 Truths of Bitcoin” address, in which he placed a lot of emphasis on Bitcoin’s superiority over traditional commodities. He argued that gold continues to underperform the S&P Index and claimed that Bitcoin is the only non-garbage investment commodity in human history. Despite recent volatility in the crypto markets, Strategy saw some very impressive returns on its Bitcoin holdings. The company is currently sitting on more than $9.3 billion in unrealized gains, with its investment up more than 28%.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-24 05:10:03

Investors are at a crossroads weather to invest, sell, or stay firm in the market. One expert blames it on a lack of education. Here’s an enigmatic eye-opener for those who are dealing with the fear of missing out. Robert Kiyosaki, the renowned author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has once again made a strong case for why some people remain financially stagnant while others build wealth. According to him, it’s not just Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) that holds people back, but something deeper—Fear of Making Mistakes (FOMM). He argues that this fear keeps many from taking advantage of life-changing financial opportunities, particularly Bitcoin. Bitcoin: The Greatest Wealth Opportunity? Robert Kiyosaki believes that many people invest blindly, relying on social media, friends, or financial news instead of doing proper research. He warns that this mindset turns investing into gambling, increasing the risk of losses. Hence, Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin as one of the biggest wealth-building opportunities in history, yet he believes many will hesitate due to FOMM. He predicts that as Bitcoin crosses $200,000 , skeptics will say, “It’s too expensive,” just as they did when it was at $10,000, $20,000, and beyond. Meanwhile, those who understand its long-term value position themselves for generational wealth. The Importance of Learning From the Right People Rather than simply urging people to buy Bitcoin, Kiyosaki encourages learning from both supporters and critics to form an educated perspective. He follows well-known Bitcoin advocates like Michael Saylor , Samson Mow, Max Keiser, and Raoul Pal, while also advising people to listen to Bitcoin skeptics. A major point in Kiyosaki’s argument is that traditional education conditions people to avoid mistakes, equating errors with failure. He compares this to how babies learn to walk—through falling and trying again. If schools taught babies, he jokes, they’d never learn to walk. This, he believes, is why many highly educated people remain financially poor despite their intelligence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Metaplanet Boosts BTC Holdings to 3,350 with Latest Purchase , Education Is Free—Take Advantage of It Kiyosaki emphasizes that the best financial education doesn’t come from schools or Wall Street but from free resources like YouTube and independent thinkers.

He is draining the swamp of filled with slithering Marxists. God bless him. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) March 6, 2025 Not all Agree With Him… Crypto Analyst CA Vivek Khatri pushes back against Kiyosaki’s view, arguing that poverty isn’t just about mindset but structural barriers. He points out that the poor often lack disposable income, work multiple jobs just to get by, and don’t have time or insider access to research investments. While Bitcoin made early adopters rich, he warns against selling false hope, emphasizing that not everyone can afford to take financial risks when survival is the priority. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In August 2022, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash after alleging the protocol helped launder crypto stolen by North Korean hacking crew the Lazarus Group , leading to a number of Tornado Cash users filing a lawsuit against the regulator. After a court ruling in favor of Tornado Cash, the US Treasury dropped the mixer from its sanctions list on March 21 , along with several dozen Tornado-affiliated smart contract addresses from the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, and has now argued “this matter is now moot.” Because Tornado Cash has been dropped from the sanctions list, the US Treasury Department argues there is no need for a final court judgment in the lawsuit. Source: Paul Grewal “Because this court, like all federal courts, has a continuing obligation to satisfy itself that it possesses Article III jurisdiction over the case, briefing on mootness is warranted,” the US Treasury said. However, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the Treasury’s hope to have the case declared moot before an official judgment can be made isn’t the correct legal process. “After grudgingly delisting TC, they now claim they’ve mooted any need for a final court judgment. But that’s not the law, and they know it,” he said. “Under the voluntary cessation exception, a defendant’s decision to end a challenged practice moots a case only if the defendant can show that the practice cannot ‘reasonably be expected to recur.’” Grewal pointed to a 2024 Supreme Court ruling that found a legal complaint from Yonas Fikre, a US citizen who was put on the No Fly List, is not moot by taking him off the list because the ban could be reinstated again at a later date. Source: Paul Grewal “Here, Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from the SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again. That’s not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,” Grewal said. Six Tornado Cash users led by Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon, with the support of Coinbase, sued the Treasury in September 2022 to reverse the sanctions under the argument that they were unlawful. Crypto policy advocacy group Coin Center followed through with a similar suit in October 2022 . In August 2023, a Texas federal court judge sided with the US Treasury, ruling that Tornado Cash was an entity that may be designated per OFAC regulations. On appeal, a three-judge panel ruled in November that Treasury’s sanctions against the crypto mixer’s immutable smart contracts were unlawful. US Treasury had a 60-day window to challenge the decision, which it did; however, the US court sided with Tornado Cash, overturning the sanctions on Jan. 21 and forcing the government agency to remove the sanctions by March. Related: US Treasury under Trump could take a different approach to Tornado Cash Its founders are still facing legal strife, however. The US charged Roman Storm and fellow co-founder Roman Semenov in August 2023, accusing them of helping launder over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash. Semenov is still at large and on the FBI’s most wanted list. Storm is free on a $2 million bond and expected to face trial in April. Meanwhile, Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was released from prison after a Dutch court suspended his “pretrial detention” as he prepared to appeal his money laundering conviction.

According to analysts, XRP’s market dominance is painting a more bullish picture for the cryptocurrency in 2025. The cryptocurrency has been experiencing a downward trend in market dominance since its peak in 2017. However, a recent break above this downward trend suggests a possible reversal. This could set XRP on a path to reclaiming higher market dominance, much like it did during the 2017 bull run. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World , XRP’s price on the 3-day chart, the market is still showing signs of a bearish divergence. This suggests that any significant bullish movement is unlikely in the near future. Over the past few months, this pattern has continued, with only occasional small price increases that don’t lead to any major rallies. Support and Resistance Levels to Watch In the short-term, XRP has solid support around $2.24 to $2.30, with additional support between $1.95 and $2.05. On the resistance side, there is a significant level just above $2.60, with stronger resistance between $2.65 and $2.80, and another key level around $3. Sideways Movement Expected Currently, XRP’s price is mostly moving sideways, bouncing between support and resistance levels. This range-bound action has been ongoing for the last month, which results in relatively slow and uneventful price movement. While the price action may seem boring, there are still opportunities for profit if the right strategies are applied. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is XRP’s Price Not Going Up After the SEC Lawsuit Win? , What’s Next for XRP?

Investor buzz has surrounded Pepe Coin, Sui, Litecoin, and a revolutionary new Defi project that has caught attention throughout the previous 2 months. Market volatility is compelling experienced investors to look for projects that demonstrate solid fundamentals and generate high potential value. The unique project Remittix continues to establish itself as an upcoming exponential growth project for 2025. Let us find out why. Pepe Coin: The Meme Coin That Continues to Surprise The cryptocurrency market still recognizes Pepe Coin among its most popular meme coins. Currently trading at $0.0000073, Pepe has risen by 9.3% over the past week amid renewed interest in meme coins across social media platforms. PEPE has staged a comeback from its established support area while establishing conditions to break out from its trading bracket between $0.00000722 and $0.00000724. The market participants with bullish positions are buying near the midpoint and expect PEPE to reach resistance at $0.00000739 in the short term. Analysts predict Pepe is able to reach $0.0000260 by Q2 2025 if it continues to ride its community hype and develop its ecosystem. While Pepe and other meme coins are required to go past mere speculative investments by creating genuine real-world applications, Remittix already possesses an advantage in this area. Sui: A New Contender in Layer-1 Blockchains The price of Sui stands at $2.26 with a 2% weekly gain because institutional investors along with developers show increasing interest. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) partnered with SUI to push its price toward $2.75 during the trading session after WLFI decided to add SUI tokens to its “Macro Strategy” token reserve and explore blockchain applications. The market predicts Sui will reach $7.9 by mid 2025 as its adoption expands across DeFi platforms and gaming platforms. The blockchain development field has chosen Sui as its top preference because developers seek practical solutions to enhance their projects. Litecoin: The Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold Litecoin remains one of the most experienced cryptocurrencies in the market, touted as “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” Currently trading at $92 , Litecoin has experienced steady gains in the past month, buoyed by its reputation as a stable and secure payments network. The upcoming LTC mining rate halving in August 2025 has also generated optimism about Litecoin’s price trajectory. At present the LTC market shows substantial liquidity accumulation across bidding zones and asking zones. Market makers make strategic position increases as they expect a forthcoming market movement. The LTC market promises an intense upward price movement when trading crosses above $94.6 as entry into the blue zone will trigger elevated trading activity and volatility. Analysts have projected that Litecoin could reach $150 by this time in 2026 if adoption among merchants and payment processors continues to rise. However, with newer projects with practical c features entering the arena, Litecoin is coming under increasing pressure to stay relevant among investors and users. Remittix: Changing the Game in Cross-Border Payments The Defi sector is eager to see Remittix solve global remittance system inefficiencies through blockchain technology which offer less expensive and transparent cross-border payment solutions that deliver faster results. Remittix distinguishes itself from speculative meme coins and older cryptocurrencies through its dual use case of payment and innovation which targets real world problems. Remittix presale activities have proven spectacular, as investors have contributed more than $14 million to the project demonstrating strong belief in its future potential. The ERC tokens have reached $0.0734 per token making sure early investors can access an entry point that provides vast potential for growth. The listing of Remittix on major exchanges including OKX and Binance and Coinbase will likely result in substantial profits during the first several months after public launch. Market analysts project Remittix tokens will increase by 10,000% in value by Q4 2025 due to partnerships between remittance operators combined with continuous technological improvements for global expansion. The single platform of Remittix combines the payment network excellence of Litecoin with the dApps scalability solutions of Sui to create an optimal solution for efficient and scalable remittance operations. The Remittix presale presents a once-in-a-lifetime chance to join the promising crypto project of 2025 so participate right now to achieve huge profits as the revolutionary platform accelerates its growth.

The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Trump said on Truth Social on March 23 at 2:33 am UTC. Source: Donald Trump Nearly $250 million was added to the TRUMP token’s $2.5 billion market cap by 3:11 am before the memecoin fell back down to $11.38 about 90 minutes later, CoinGecko data shows and is now trading at $11.82. Despite being the 53rd largest coin by market cap, Trump’s post contributed to it being the eighth most-traded token over the last 24 hours with $1.4 billion in trading volume. Not everyone who bought TRUMP walked away a winner on March 23. One whale who previously banked around $108 million on TRUMP lost $207,000 from a recent trade; blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain pointed out.

Source: CoinGecko Tornado Cash goes live on MegaETH testnet A largely unknown crypto developer who goes by the name “GUNBOATs” on X has launched crypto privacy mixer Tornado Cash on MegaETH testnet — a new Ethereum layer 2 blockchain looking to resolve Ethereum’s scalability issues. The crypto developer showed a command-line interface (terminal window) of the Tornado Cash smart contract “0x0cB…65142” deployed on the MegaETH testnet at block 1,397,845 — which was timestamped on March 21 at 5:41 pm UTC, according to the MegaETH explorer. Source: GUNBOATs The integration occurred shortly after the US Treasury Department removed Tornado Cash from its sanctions list on March 21 and two months after a US appeals court said the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control couldn’t sanction Tornado Cash smart contracts because they are not the property of a foreign national. MegaETH also launched its testnet on the same day the Tornado Cash sanction was lifted. While it isn’t clear if and when a full launch will occur, the company behind the MegaETH public testnet claims it offers “unparalleled performance” with 10 millisecond block times while processing around 20,000 transactions per second. Solo Bitcoin miner wins BTC block, banking $266K A solo Bitcoin miner believed to have been using a miner with less than one terahash per second (TS/s) has solved one of the blockchain’s blocks and earned a $266,552 reward. “Another solo miner found a block!! This time on a self hosted Public Pool. We can’t be sure but the guess is it was a miner with less than 1 TH/s,” Nerdminer Store said in a March 23 X post. The Bitcoin miner snared a total of 3.15 BTC for solving block 888,989, which was timestamped on March 23 at 1:30 am UTC, mempool.space data shows. That bounty included the current 3.125 Bitcoin subsidy and another 0.027 Bitcoin ($2,254) from transaction fees. If Nerdminer is correct in believing a miner with less than 1 TH/s was used to mine the block, the machine likely would have been a hand or pocket-sized rig that possesses a fraction of the hashrate that industrial-scale application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) have. Example of a pocket-sized Bitcoin mining rig that may have solved Bitcoin block 888,989. Source: ASIC Miner Value For context, the Bitcoin mining marketplace estimates that the odds of the 1.2TH/s rig mining a solo block on any day is one in 4.6 million chance. It comes after a 0.48 TH/s mining machine solved Bitcoin block 887,212 on March 10, banking $263,000 in total rewards. No, the IMF did not say Bitcoin is “digital gold” Bitcoin was mentioned several times in the International Monetary Fund’s seventh edition of its “Integrated Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual,” which was published on March 20 — but none of which referred to it as “digital gold,” contrary to some reports. The IMF provided classifications on “crypto assets” such as Bitcoin as a “medium of exchange” while stating that many new digital assets are designed to also act as a “store of value.” The IMF’s comment on digital assets was misinterpreted by members of the crypto industry. Source: IMF “This is a massive stretch to jump to: ‘IMF says bitcoin is digital gold,’” Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter said in a March 23 X post. “[It’s] a good sign that the IMF is recognizing this but definitely not an endorsement of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold.’” The IMF also distinguished fungible tokens from non-fungible tokens and classified the latter as either a token designed to act as a medium of exchange or as a security. Related: Who’s running in Trump’s race to make US a ‘Bitcoin superpower?' Bitcoin and “crypto assets” were among nine “major changes” to the seventh edition, which comprised 1,076 pages. The IMF’s seventh edition was released as it continues to negotiate with El Salvador over narrowing the scope of the country’s Bitcoin activities.

The auditing of Tether’s $143.5 billion worth of assets is expected to be more straightforward under US President Donald Trump, Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino reportedly said. The CEO of Pakistan’s Crypto Council, Bilal Bin Saqib, has proposed using the country’s runoff energy to fuel Bitcoin mining at the Crypto Council’s inaugural meeting on March 21.

Các mô hình nghiên cứu truyền thống thường bị bóp nghẹt bởi sự kiểm soát của các tổ chức lớn, cơ chế tài trợ cứng nhắc và rào cản chia sẻ kiến thức – làm chậm tiến độ khoa học. DeSci thay đổi điều này bằng cách sử dụng công nghệ blockchain và các tổ chức tự trị phi tập trung (DAO). Với DeSci, cộng đồng gồm nhà nghiên cứu, nhà tài trợ và người yêu thích khoa học có thể trực tiếp hỗ trợ các dự án mình quan tâm. Những lĩnh vực mới nổi như nghiên cứu tuổi thọ, y học AI hay robot mã nguồn mở giờ đây sẽ dễ dàng nhận được tài nguyên để phát triển. Ngoài ra, kho lưu trữ dữ liệu phân tán giúp loại bỏ phí, cho phép mọi người truy cập và xác minh thông tin một cách minh bạch. Vậy DeSci Thay Đổi Nghiên Cứu Khoa Học Như Thế Nào? DeSci là một phong trào mới mẻ tận dụng Web3 để biến đổi nghiên cứu khoa học. Nó phá vỡ hệ thống cũ kỹ bằng cách sử dụng tính minh bạch của blockchain, hợp đồng thông minh và DAO, tạo ra một hệ sinh thái nghiên cứu mở và công bằng hơn. Một trong những đột phá lớn nhất của DeSci là cơ chế tài trợ mới. Thay vì phụ thuộc vào tài trợ chính phủ hoặc tổ chức tư nhân, nhà nghiên cứu có thể nhận hỗ trợ từ DAO. Tại đây, bất kỳ ai – từ cá nhân, quỹ đầu tư mạo hiểm đến cộng đồng bệnh nhân – đều có quyền bình chọn chọn dự án họ muốn tài trợ. Hợp đồng thông minh cũng giúp việc giải ngân trở nên nhanh chóng, minh bạch và giảm thiểu thủ tục hành chính. Ngoài tài trợ, DeSci còn cải thiện khả năng tiếp cận dữ liệu khoa học. Kho lưu trữ phi tập trung cho phép nhà nghiên cứu xuất bản và chia sẻ công trình của mình mà không phải lo về chi phí cao ngất của tạp chí. Blockchain đồng thời cung cấp sổ cái bất biến để ghi nhận đóng góp, đánh giá ngang hàng và xác minh dữ liệu. Điều này tăng cường tính tái lập và đáng tin cậy cho nghiên cứu.

However, President Trump suggested there could be ""flexibility"" in the tariff plans, and recent reports indicate the scope might be narrower than expected, potentially exempting some industries from the full impact. Adding to market unease, tensions in the Middle East escalated as Israel resumed strikes targeting Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, investors also continue to monitor the impact of recently announced U.S. sanctions on Iran, which could further influence oil market dynamics. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.03% to above 37,700, while the Topix Index slipped 0.3% to 2,795 in mixed trading on Monday. The Japanese yen slipped toward 150 per dollar on Monday, extending losses from the previous session, as disappointing business activity data countered a hawkish Bank of Japan outlook. In March, Japan’s private sector activity contracted for the first time in five months, with the manufacturing downturn extending to a ninth month and services activity also turning negative. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.29% to below 3,360 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.4% to 10,645 on Monday, extending losses from last weekand, and the offshore yuan edges lower to around 7.26 per dollar, reaching its lowest level in two weeks, pressured by rising concerns over a potential escalation of US-China trade disputes as the deadline for Trump’s reciprocal tariffs approaches. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.02% were little changed in early trading on Monday, hovering around 23,686 after sharp losses in the prior two sessions. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.85% The HSBC India Services PMI fell to 57.7 in March 2025 from 59.0 in the previous month, marking the 44th consecutive month of growth in services activity, preliminary estimates showed. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.04% dipped 0.15% to around 7,920 on Monday, trimming last week’s gains. The Australian dollar climbed toward $0.63 on Monday, snapping a four-day losing streak, as upbeat private sector activity data boosted market sentiment. In March, the manufacturing sector saw its fastest expansion in over two years to 52.6 in March 2025 from 50.4 in February, while services sector growth also picked up to 51.3 in March 2025 from 50.6 in February. Australia will unveil its 2025 federal budget on Tuesday, March 25, with Treasurer Jim Chalmers emphasizing cost-of-living relief and economic resilience amid global uncertainty. Key measures include extending electricity bill subsidies until the end of 2025, costing AUD 1.8 billion, and expanding a shared equity scheme to help first-home buyers. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher as President Trump suggested some “flexibility” on tariffs, while several megacap stocks made a recovery. U.S. stock futures gapped higher on Monday as Wall Street looked to extend last week's gains, with investors seeking fresh market catalysts: Dow +0.56% ; S&P 500 +0.65% ; Nasdaq +0.81% .

Pi Coin just bounced 8% after a short dip. XRP claimed a historic legal win that may reshape U.S. crypto laws. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) stands at $0.0734, with over $14 million raised and 521+ million tokens sold—offering a straightforward path to cheaper, faster cross-border payments. Below, we explore why these three tokens might give you a strong chance to turn a $1,000 investment into life-changing profits. Pi Coin: Can It Stay Above $1? Pi Coin at $1. Source: CoinGecko Pi Coin, now at $1.00 , recently slipped to $0.86 before rebounding 8%. It remains popular thanks to its easy mining model and focus on mainstream adoption. However, unlocking more Pi tokens each month can put downward pressure on its price unless demand remains strong. A lot also hinges on official exchange listings— rumors of a Binance listing boosted Pi’s price before nothing materialized. If Pi’s upcoming events, such as PiFest 2025, successfully expand its real-world uses and push more developers to build on Pi’s platform, the token might maintain a solid floor above $1 or climb higher. But Pi’s future is uncertain without more liquidity and big exchange support. XRP: After the SEC Win, What’s Next? XRP at $2.41. Source: CoinGecko XRP trades at around $2.41 , fresh off a big legal triumph. The SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple, removing a long-running legal cloud. CEO Brad Garlinghouse and legal chief Stuart Alderoty view it as more than a court success—it’s a turning point for clearer U.S. crypto regulation. In response, the SEC has changed its tone, dropping or pausing cases against several exchanges. Ripple also wrote a letter urging the SEC to develop clear guidelines instead of relying on random enforcement. Now that the legal pressure is gone, many see XRP as ready for a new phase. Some watchers even say an XRP ETF might be next. Whether it hits $100 or not, the removal of legal uncertainties could spur bigger institutional interest in XRP. Remittix (RTX): The Simple Path to Riches While Pi and XRP have big communities, Remittix (RTX), at $0.0734, takes a more direct route by solving real-world remittance problems. Already $14 million has poured in, with 521 million tokens sold—proof that many believe in RTX’s plan. Families, freelancers, and small stores can avoid costly wire fees by converting crypto (BTC, ETH, or others) into local currency, usually within a day, depositing the money into a standard bank account. Think of a mom in Kenya receiving funds from her kid in Canada—no need for advanced steps or heavy fees. Observers say if Remittix secures major e-commerce ties or payroll integrations, daily use could surge, driving the token’s price far above its modest starting point. The token uses locked reserves and an audited contract, helping calm fears of a scam. For those wanting to turn $1,000 into a potential fortune, a practical coin like Remittix might outshine more hype-driven projects in the long run. Conclusion: Which Coin Could Make You a Family Crypto Pioneer? Pi Coin, Remittix (RTX), and XRP each offer a distinct path to wealth. Pi aims at mainstream adoption but needs stronger liquidity and listings to push higher. XRP overcame the SEC lawsuit, clearing a big hurdle and reigniting hopes of major partnerships. Yet Remittix (RTX), at $0.0734 with $14 million raised, solves an everyday concern—fast, affordable cross-border payments—and might see rapid growth if normal people embrace it. If your goal is to be the first crypto millionaire in your family, picking the coin that best tackles a huge real-world need could be your winning ticket. Ready to Give Remittix a Go?

Publicly available data shows that GCash, which is similar to China's Alipay or WeChat Pay, does over $65 billion (3.8 trillion Philippine Pesos) in annual transaction volume. Filipino remittances reached a record $38.3 billion in 2024, and account for approximately 8%-10% of the country's GDP. Alipay owner-Ant Group, Ayala Corporation and Manilla-based Globe Telecom's 917Ventures own GCash operator Mynt. GCash offers crypto services via its GCrypto subsidiary, which has partnered with locally licensed crypto exchange PDAX. In total GCrypto offers 39 different assets to trade on its platform, including Paypal's PYUSD stablecoin. Stablecoin-based transfers are growing as a share of the market but remain relatively small, with less than 5% of all inbound remittances using crypto rails. Recently, Bloomberg reported that GCash could seek an IPO valuation of at least $8 billion by the end of 2025. The company, reportedly, is in no rush to go public as it recently completed a funding round that raised its valuation to $5 billion, giving it enough capital and flexibility to wait for favorable market conditions.",Markets|USDC|Jeremy Allaire|Philippines,EN,0,0,USDC|MARKET|ASIA|EXCHANGE|PYUSD,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-24 05:32:49

As attention shifts toward altcoins and early-stage projects, sentiment is increasingly influenced by speculation, technical indicators, and forecasts of what might fuel the next wave of growth. Among the coins under scrutiny, Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching a key technical test, while at the same time, emerging presale projects like The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) are gaining traction and attracting bullish sentiment from analysts. Dogecoin Tests Resistance at $0.21 – Will It Hold or Break? Dogecoin has hovered in the $0.16 to $0.18 range in recent days, with $0.21 acting as a significant resistance level. This price point has served as a ceiling that DOGE is struggling to break through. Analysts suggest that a decisive move above $0.21 could validate a bullish breakout and potentially push the price toward $0.25 or beyond. So far, attempts to clear this zone has been met with selling pressure, revealing a lack of strong conviction among traders. If the asset fails to break this level, a period of sideways movement or a retracement toward $0.15 remains possible. While Dogecoin still enjoys strong brand recognition and community backing, its reliance on social media hype and the absence of major development updates continues to raise questions about its long-term viability. As a result, some investors are beginning to explore more utility-driven alternatives that offer not just speculative upside, but also real-world use cases and token utility. Investors Rotate into High-Upside Presales Historically, crypto presales have offered some of the best opportunities for outsized returns, allowing investors to enter projects at discounted prices before wider market exposure. In 2025, this trend remains strong, especially as market participants look for the “next big thing” beyond the top 20 coins. As capital rotates out of larger, slower-moving assets like DOGE, early-stage projects that integrate real utility and tap into fast-growing sectors are gaining momentum. Among these, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) is quickly emerging as a standout. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) – Where Gaming and Crypto Investing Converge The Last Dwarfs is pioneering a new model in crypto with its Play-to-Invest system, an evolution of the traditional play-to-earn concept. Instead of simply rewarding users with tokens for game participation, TLD allows players to mine resources, upgrade characters, and earn crypto by engaging with the platform. These in-game actions directly increase the farming of the $TLD token, which acts as an alternative to traditional staking. Through its Gamified Launchpad, players also gain early access to vetted blockchain projects, turning the act of gaming into an interactive and strategic investment experience. This approach makes The Last Dwarfs a fully-fledged crypto investment ecosystem. Unlike most presales, The Last Dwarfs already has a live platform and a user base of over 300,000 players. It’s also natively integrated with Telegram and the TON blockchain, offering one of the most frictionless Web3 onramps available today, ideal for both crypto veterans and newcomers alike. Stage 2 of the $TLD Presale is Live – Still Early, But Not for Long Following a successful Stage 1 sellout, the $TLD presale has moved into Stage 2, with tokens currently priced at $0.00852. This tiered system rewards early participants and builds organic demand ahead of listings. Investors can also benefit from: An exclusive Ref2Earn program which grants 15% bonus tokens for every referred purchase 300% APY Staking Rewards As the platform continues to scale and its token utility expands, many analysts see $TLD as one of the most promising early-stage tokens in 2025. Final Thoughts – From Meme Coins to Ecosystem Tokens Dogecoin’s future now hinges on whether it can finally break and hold above the $0.21 resistance level. While it remains popular, the lack of new development or broader use cases limits its growth potential. In contrast, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) offers a novel and sustainable model. With analysts forecasting that $TLD could potentially reach $0.50 or even $1 over the next market cycle, the project is gaining attention not just as a presale opportunity, but as a high-utility altcoin that could lead the next wave of growth in Web3 gaming and crypto investing.

Top 7 best cryptocurrency mining platforms in 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/how-to-choose-a-safe-and-reliable-cloud-mining-service-for-beginners-top-7-best-cryptocurrency-mining-platforms-in-2025/,"In today’s rapidly evolving digital economy, cloud mining has emerged as an efficient and convenient way to acquire cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional mining, it does not require purchasing expensive hardware or mastering complex technical skills, making it accessible to investors worldwide. However, as Bitcoin’s market volatility increases and mining difficulty continues to rise in 2025, investors are becoming more concerned about the profitability of cloud mining. Choosing a stable, secure, and consistently paying platform is the key to ensuring returns. Among the many cloud mining services, SpeedHash stands out as an industry leader, thanks to its high mining efficiency, flexible investment plans, and daily payouts, making it a preferred choice for miners worldwide.

This eliminates the need to purchase mining rigs and bear additional costs such as maintenance and electricity.

According to CoinMarketCap, the cloud mining industry grew by 25% in 2024, driven by increasing institutional interest and the demand for sustainable mining solutions.

Since formally embracing Bitcoin as a key part of its business, Metaplanet has quickly grown its holdings to become the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder in Asia. The company has used stock acquisition rights through EVO FUND and zero-coupon bonds to finance its acquisitions. In March alone, Metaplanet redeemed ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) in bonds ahead of schedule and raised another ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) through a new bond issuance . This strategy has allowed the company to continue buying Bitcoin without taking on debt with interest.

As the crypto market continues to expand, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is turning heads with its groundbreaking presale rewards and soaring investor interest. While Turbo and Dogwifhat have captured attention with their strong market performance, Arctic Pablo Coin is making waves with its high-yield staking, ultra-low presale price, and jaw-dropping ROI potential. This article will cover the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Turbo, and Dogwifhat, with a special focus on Arctic Pablo Coin’s thrilling presale momentum. Arctic Pablo Coin Offers 66% APY Staking During Presale – Earn While You Hold For investors looking to maximize their holdings, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an unmatched opportunity: a 66% APY staking reward during its presale phase. This feature allows holders to grow their tokens passively even before the coin is officially launched. With staking rewards this high, early investors can capitalize on the presale gains while earning additional tokens. Meme coins rarely provide such an incentive, making Arctic Pablo Coin stand out as one of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. As interest surges, early adopters are locking in their APC tokens, ensuring they benefit from both price appreciation and staking rewards. The question is—will you secure your APC before the presale ends? Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Reaches Nippy Nook – Time is Running Out! The Meme Coin presale has officially reached Nippy Nook, the 15th phase of its journey. At this stage, 1 APC is priced at just $0.000079, making it a golden entry point for investors before the price climbs higher. The potential ROI from Nippy Nook to the launch price of $0.008 is an astonishing 10,027.85%. This means a $100 investment today would secure 1,265,686 APC tokens, which could be worth $10,125.49 at launch. With over $1.96 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is gaining momentum fast. However, as each presale phase progresses, the price increases—meaning those who wait could be buying at a significantly higher price later. The current entry price is among the lowest available before Arctic Pablo Coin hits major exchanges. With supply tightening and demand skyrocketing, securing APC tokens now could be a strategic move for investors looking to maximize gains. Turbo Sustains Robust Market Performance in Meme Coin Arena Turbo continues to demonstrate resilience and strong market activity, currently trading at $0.002236 per TURBO/USD. The meme coin has achieved a substantial market capitalization of USD 154.28 million, reflecting its growing prominence in the cryptocurrency landscape. Bolstered by an impressive 24-hour trading volume of $31.84 million, Turbo showcases significant liquidity and investor enthusiasm. With steady momentum and sustained trading interest, the coin remains a formidable contender in the competitive meme coin space. As of March 19, 2025, Turbo’s consistent performance underscores its appeal among traders and crypto enthusiasts alike. Dogwifhat Solidifies It’s Standing in the Meme Coin Market Dogwifhat is currently priced at $0.480656 per WIF/USD, reflecting its strong presence in the cryptocurrency market as of March 19, 2025. With an impressive market capitalization of USD 480.10 million, the coin demonstrates significant value and widespread recognition. Its 24-hour trading volume of USD 160.86 million underscores robust investor engagement and exceptional liquidity, key indicators of its popularity. As demand continues to surge, Dogwifhat is cementing its status as a leading contender in the dynamic meme coin ecosystem, attracting attention from traders and enthusiasts seeking high-potential digital assets. Final thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Way for Meme Coin Investments The meme coin market is heating up, and investors are looking for the next big opportunity. Turbo and Dogwifhat continue to hold strong in the market, but Arctic Pablo Coin is creating a frenzy with its high APY staking, ultra-low presale price, and immense ROI potential. With APC priced at just $0.000079 in the Nippy Nook phase, early investors have the opportunity to lock in massive gains before prices rise. Over $1.96 million has already been raised, proving that investor confidence in Arctic Pablo Coin is surging. For those searching for the top new meme coins to buy for 2025, Arctic Pablo Coin is an unmissable opportunity.

In a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm announced plans to create a blockchain-based version of its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX). This move aims to tap into the rapidly growing tokenized asset market and use blockchain for more efficient transfers. FYHXX Fund Set to Launch on Ethereum FYHXX is an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills, which was launched late last year. The fund’s OnChain class currently operates on the Ethereum (ETH) network, with plans to expand to other blockchains in the future. The registration is pending regulatory approval, and the product is expected to launch on May 30. The filing comes amid a growing trend where global banks and asset managers are adopting blockchain technology to tokenize traditional financial assets like government bonds, credit, and funds. This shift, known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), offers the potential for enhanced operational efficiency, reduced costs, and the ability to settle transactions around the clock. Fidelity, with $5.8 trillion in assets, is the latest financial giant to dive into the booming tokenized U.S. Treasuries market. Previously, BlackRock, in collaboration with Securitize, launched the BUIDL tokenized T-bill fund last March, quickly dominating the market with $1.5 billion in assets. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton’s 2021 on-chain money market fund has gathered $689 million. Over $3.3 billion worth of real-world assets (RWAs) have been tokenized on the Ethereum network, with Stellar following at $465.6 million. BlackRock’s head of crypto, Robbie Mitchnick, recently stated that Ethereum is the “natural default” for traditional finance (TradFi) firms looking to tokenize RWAs. The entire tokenized U.S. Treasury market is booming, now worth $4.77 billion—a staggering 500% growth in just one year. Besides, Fidelity is also a leading issuer of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the U.S., with its FBTC ETF valued at $16.5 billion and FETH ETF at $780 million, based on SoSoValue data. BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund Sparks Confidence Amid Regulatory Shift The U.S. regulatory environment held back the growth of tokenized securities for years, with crypto seen as too risky by banks. However, things are changing quickly with Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies. BlackRock’s launch of the BUIDL fund marked a turning point, giving other firms the confidence to dive into the space. Fidelity and others, like Visa and Mastercard, are now embracing tokenization, with Visa launching a platform for banks and Tether introducing its own tokenization platform. Mastercard is also using blockchain for business payments. The Boston Consulting Group predicts tokenized assets could hit $600 billion by 2030, a major jump from the current $2 billion. Besides, even the CFTC is exploring new guidelines for tokenized assets as collateral.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 05:49:33

Crypto Fear & Greed Index Climbs to 45, Still Cautious Market Mood",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-climbs/,"Cryptocurrency markets are known for their wild swings, keeping investors on their toes. One crucial tool to gauge these emotional shifts is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Imagine a barometer for crypto sentiment, swinging between extreme fear and unbridled greed. Recently, this index has shown a notable shift, sparking conversations among traders and analysts alike. Let’s dive into what this movement signifies for the current state of the crypto market. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, is not just another metric; it’s a composite gauge designed to reflect the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple 0-100 scale: 0-25: Extreme Fear – This zone suggests investors are excessively worried, often indicating a potential buying opportunity. 26-49: Fear – While still cautious, the market is less panicked than in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. 50-75: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic, potentially leading to market rallies. 76-100: Extreme Greed – This signals excessive optimism, which can be a warning sign of a potential market bubble or correction. Understanding this index is vital because market emotions—fear and greed—are powerful drivers in the volatile crypto world. High fear can lead to undervaluation and potential buying opportunities, while extreme greed can inflate prices beyond sustainable levels, often preceding market corrections. The Latest Shift: A 15-Point Jump in Crypto Sentiment As of March 24th, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stood at 45. This marks a significant 15-point increase from the previous day. This jump is noteworthy, suggesting a considerable shift in crypto sentiment . Think of it as the market taking a collective, slightly deeper breath. However, despite this positive movement, it’s crucial to note that the index remains in the “Fear” zone. This situation presents a mixed bag. On one hand, the rise indicates that the extreme pessimism might be easing. On the other hand, the persistent “Fear” zone suggests that underlying anxieties and uncertainties still dominate the market sentiment . Decoding the Components: What Drives the Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t based on a single data point. It’s a weighted average of several factors, providing a holistic view of market emotions. Here’s a breakdown of the components: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with average values to gauge market uncertainty. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares current market momentum and volume against recent averages to assess buying or selling pressure. Social Media Sentiment 15% Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit to understand public perception of the crypto market. Surveys 15% Periodic surveys (currently paused) gauging investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance can sometimes indicate a risk-off sentiment, while a falling dominance might suggest higher risk appetite in altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries to understand general public interest and attention. Analyzing the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Context While the index is often referred to as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , it’s heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and sentiment due to Bitcoin’s market dominance. Therefore, understanding the Bitcoin Fear and Greed dynamic is crucial for interpreting the overall index. The recent increase to 45, while still in fear, could be influenced by several factors related to Bitcoin, such as: Bitcoin Price Movements: Positive price action in Bitcoin can naturally reduce fear and nudge the index upwards. Bitcoin News and Developments: Positive news, like institutional adoption or regulatory clarity, can improve sentiment. Broader Market Conditions: Macroeconomic factors and global financial market sentiment also impact Bitcoin and, consequently, the index. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Analysis and You? For traders and investors, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index serves as a valuable supplementary tool for crypto market analysis . Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Investing: Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have sometimes presented opportunities to buy crypto assets at potentially lower prices, betting on a market rebound. Conversely, ‘Extreme Greed’ can be a signal to exercise caution and potentially take profits. Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm your own market analysis. If your fundamental analysis is bullish, but the Fear and Greed Index is showing ‘Extreme Fear’, it might be a signal of strong underlying opportunity. Risk Management: Be aware of the prevailing market sentiment. High greed environments might warrant tighter risk management strategies. Not a Standalone Indicator: Remember, the Fear and Greed Index is just one indicator. It should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for informed decision-making. Navigating the Fear Zone: A Cautious Glimmer of Hope? The 15-point rise in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is indeed a positive signal, indicating a lessening of extreme fear in the cryptocurrency market. However, the index firmly remaining in the ‘Fear’ zone serves as a reminder that caution is still warranted. The crypto market remains sensitive to various factors, and while sentiment has improved, significant uncertainties persist. This upward tick could be the beginning of a sustained positive trend, or it might just be a temporary reprieve in a longer period of market anxiety. Keeping a close watch on the index, alongside other market indicators and news developments, will be crucial for navigating the crypto landscape in the coming days and weeks.

EigenDA is a secure, high-throughput, decentralized data availability service on Ethereum. The EigenDA integration is said to boost Mantle Network's scalability without hitting data rate limits, reportedly resulting in a 15 MB/s throughput. In other words, the network can process more transactions per block. Additionally, the upgrade has made the Mantle Network better compatible with Ethereum's impending Pectra upgrade.

She pointed out that more than half of people under 45 now own digital currencies but have no investments in stocks, a trend she believes could harm both individual wealth and the economy in the long run. The Importance of Stock Market Growth She said that stocks are crucial for company growth. Unlike cryptocurrencies, stocks provide funding for businesses, creating jobs, driving innovation, and contributing to the economy through taxes. “Cryptocurrencies are non-productive assets and don’t help the real economy,” she said. Gordon argues that while crypto may offer speculative gains, it lacks the tangible economic benefits that stocks provide. To address this, Gordon suggests reducing the 0.5% stamp duty on London-listed stocks and applying a similar tax to cryptocurrency transactions. She believes this could encourage more investment in traditional assets that support economic growth. Urging Action for the UK’s Financial Future As a member of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce, Gordon also called for better public understanding of capital markets to boost economic growth. While acknowledging the current challenges in the market, Gordon remains positive about the UK’s role as a financial hub. She urges the government to take action to attract more investments back into UK markets, which she believes is essential for maintaining London’s competitiveness in the global financial sector. The Cooling UK Stock Market Investment interest in stocks has been declining, with many investors turning to cryptocurrencies.

There is no reason to build an L2. L1s can be faster, cheaper, and more secure. They aren’t slowed down by a glacially moving L1 data availability stack, or have to compromise security with complex fraud proofs and upgrade multisigs. https://t.co/Ov3YAfz9U4 — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) March 23, 2025 Yakovenko claimed that L2s heavily depend on the L1 scale for data availability and may entail intricate fraud proofs and multi-signature updates. He explained that Solana does not face such problems because it has separate execution and data layers on an efficient base layer. Yakovenko reacted negatively to Solana’s data generation, referring to it as “measly” at 80 terabytes per year while arguing that L1s cannot scale because of storage. He also warned users against creating baseless L2s, as he said at the beginning of this month, “You can skip creating a valueless L2 and just launch a token.” Solana competes with all Ethereum L2s, not Ethereum itself Yakovenko states that Solana’s architecture enables it to rival every Ethereum L2 solution directly, unlike Ethereum itself. He noted that there are many L2s, but it should not be like that because, ideally, there should be an L2 that can meet the present need and at the same time has the potential to fulfil all the functions thanks to the design. “There is no point to multiple L2s … if a single L2 can handle parallel execution, then it can use up all the blobspace and run every use case.” – Yakovenko His comments align with the perspective that only a few important smart contracts exist, hence the apparent overproduction of L2s. He further claimed that L2s act parasitically since they perpetuate their language ecosystems to the detriment of the L1. Ethereum’s strategy faces questions as L2 networks multiply Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has also recently taken the opposite view. While addressing the Digital Asset Summit, Lubin stated that Ethereum’s future is in L2 scaling networks. He said that one of the most significant accomplishments of Ethereum was Linea, a product of ConsenSys. He also mentioned MegaETH, which is planned to be further developed, implying faster and cheaper operations. Lubin pointed to Ethereum’s security and the readiness of L2s to create their basis on that platform as its main benefits. However, an upgrade in March 2024 caused the Dencun transaction fees to reduce by 95%, which raised some questions. While it was beneficial for L2s, Ethereum base-layer revenue declined by 99% to the end of the year. More than 140 scaling solutions and 60 roll-up networks are currently on Ethereum, causing concern for fragmentation and value capture on the top chain. Ethereum users have also criticized the blockchain for lacking permission-less characteristics. Naveen Spark, a commentator on X, said that Ethereum is permissioned as of now since new entrants into the network have to invest in know-your-customer (KYC) checks to acquire ETH. He also notes that privacy tools are not pre-built-in, leaving new users in what he called a ‘surveillance world.’ However, another user, rip.eth, was quick to counter the argument, stating that Ethereum is still permissionless and enhances different levels of privacy. However, Naveen maintained that the beginning has shifted for new users since Ethereum has switched to proof-of-stake. Ethereum faces support test Ethereum is close to a key support zone, and more than 3 million addresses hold 6.12 million ETH at a price range of between $1,886 and $1,944. As a tweet from ali_charts pointed out, this range has become the main barrier to a deeper decline so far. The current ETH price is at $2,003, just above the support band, which focuses much on whether the buyers will hold this level. According to the on-chain data, 70.43% of all ETH can be classified as “in the money,” with 29.08% in loss. More than 99.5% of ether holders are at breakeven, which means they have yet to make a profit. Finally, the support cluster has very high buying signals, which means that prices will likely react at these levels. Ethereum balance on exchanges. Source: ali_charts on X A sudden decline in exchange balances has raised a new significant factor in the market during the past few weeks. In the last 48 days, more than 1,200,000 ETH has been moved out of exchanges.

The winds of institutional adoption are blowing stronger than ever. In a monumental leap for digital assets, BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) has just smashed through the $1 billion mark in Ethereum (ETH). This isn’t just another number; it’s a powerful statement about the growing confidence and significant capital flowing into the crypto space, spearheaded by one of the world’s largest asset managers. Let’s dive deep into what this explosive milestone means for the future of finance and Ethereum. Why is BlackRock BUIDL’s $1 Billion ETH Milestone a Big Deal? Reaching $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) is a significant achievement for any fund, but for BUIDL, it’s particularly noteworthy for several reasons: Institutional Validation: BlackRock, a traditional finance behemoth, venturing deeper into crypto sends a resounding message to the market. It signals that institutional investment in digital assets is not just a fleeting trend but a serious and growing area of interest. Tokenization Taking Center Stage: BUIDL is a tokenized fund on a public blockchain. Its success underscores the increasing appeal and practicality of tokenization – representing traditional assets on the blockchain for enhanced efficiency and accessibility. Ethereum’s Expanding Ecosystem: The fact that BUIDL holds over $1 billion in ETH directly benefits the Ethereum ecosystem. It demonstrates institutional demand for ETH and contributes to the network’s growth and maturity. Broader Market Impact: This milestone can act as a catalyst, encouraging other institutional investors to explore and allocate capital to crypto assets, further fueling market growth and innovation. Decoding Tokenized Funds: What Exactly is BUIDL? For those still wrapping their heads around tokenization, let’s break down what BlackRock’s BUIDL fund represents: Traditional Finance Meets Blockchain: BUIDL is essentially a bridge connecting traditional financial products with the world of blockchain. It’s a fund managed by BlackRock, but its units are issued as tokens on a public blockchain. USD-Denominated and Stable: As the name suggests, BUIDL is a USD-denominated fund. This likely aims to offer stability and reduce volatility compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies, appealing to more risk-averse institutional investors. Liquidity and Accessibility: Tokenization can enhance liquidity and accessibility. Tokenized fund units can potentially be traded more easily and efficiently than traditional fund shares, especially in a 24/7 global market. Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology provides transparency and efficiency benefits. Transactions and holdings of tokenized funds can be publicly verifiable on the blockchain, fostering trust and potentially reducing operational costs. Institutional Investment in Crypto: Why Now, and Why Ethereum? The increasing institutional interest in crypto, exemplified by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, is driven by several converging factors: Maturing Crypto Market: The crypto market has matured significantly over the years. While volatility remains, the infrastructure, regulatory clarity (in some regions), and range of investment products have improved, making it more palatable for institutions. Demand for Diversification: Institutional investors are constantly seeking diversification to optimize portfolio returns and manage risk. Crypto assets, with their relatively low correlation to traditional markets, offer a compelling diversification avenue. Potential for Higher Returns: Despite the risks, crypto assets have demonstrated the potential for significant returns, attracting institutions looking for alpha generation opportunities in a low-yield environment. Ethereum’s Smart Contract Advantage: Ethereum’s role as the leading platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) makes it particularly attractive for institutional investment. Tokenized funds like BUIDL often leverage Ethereum’s infrastructure. Benefits and Challenges of Tokenized Funds like BUIDL Tokenized funds like BUIDL offer a range of potential benefits, but also come with certain challenges: Benefits Challenges Increased Efficiency: Streamlined processes, faster settlement, and reduced administrative overhead. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for tokenized securities is still evolving globally, creating uncertainty. Enhanced Liquidity: Potential for 24/7 trading and fractional ownership, improving market liquidity. Security Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities and custody risks associated with digital assets. Greater Accessibility: Potentially opens up investment opportunities to a wider range of investors. Interoperability Issues: Challenges in seamless interaction between different blockchain platforms and traditional systems. Transparency: Blockchain’s inherent transparency enhances trust and auditability. Adoption Hurdles: Requires education and adoption from both traditional financial institutions and investors. Examples of Other Institutional Crypto Moves BlackRock’s BUIDL success is part of a broader trend of institutional adoption in crypto. Here are a few other examples showcasing this growing interest: Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the US marked a watershed moment, providing a regulated and accessible way for institutions and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Holdings: MicroStrategy, a publicly traded company, has famously adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, holding billions of dollars worth of BTC. Institutional Custody Solutions: Companies like Coinbase Custody and Fidelity Digital Assets are providing secure custody solutions specifically tailored for institutional investors holding digital assets. Pension Fund Investments: While still nascent, some pension funds and endowments are starting to cautiously allocate a small percentage of their portfolios to crypto assets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? The rise of BlackRock’s BUIDL and broader institutional interest in crypto offers several actionable insights: Keep an Eye on Tokenization: Tokenization is poised to revolutionize various industries beyond finance. Understanding its potential applications can be valuable. Ethereum’s Continued Relevance: Ethereum remains a critical infrastructure layer for the crypto ecosystem and institutional adoption, solidifying its long-term relevance. Institutional Crypto is Here to Stay: The involvement of major players like BlackRock signals that institutional crypto investment is not a fad but a long-term trend. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While institutional interest is encouraging, always conduct thorough research before investing in any crypto asset. Understand the risks and potential rewards. Conclusion: A Billion-Dollar Bet on the Future of Finance BlackRock’s BUIDL fund surpassing $1 billion in ETH is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful indicator of the evolving landscape of finance. It underscores the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the crypto world, with tokenization and Ethereum playing pivotal roles. As institutions like BlackRock continue to explore and invest in digital assets, the future of finance is undeniably becoming more decentralized, transparent, and accessible.

Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), said in a March 21 note that Trump administration officials, including Elon Musk, have floated using a blockchain to track US gold and government spending — an idea supported by crypto executives. “Here’s the thing about blockchains. They’re not very smart,” Cipolaro said. “They’re limited in the information they convey. For example, Bitcoin has no idea what the price of Bitcoin is or even the current time.” He said the tokenization or tracking of gold reserves on a blockchain could help with audits and transparency but would still “rely on trust and coordination with central entities” compared to Bitcoin, which “was designed to explicitly remove centralized entities.” Cipolaro added that tokenization and blockchain-tracking ideas aren’t competitive with the crypto market and might help to increase awareness of it, which “could ultimately benefit Bitcoin.” It comes amid calls from some for an independent audit of the United States’ gold reserves. Republican Senator Rand Paul last month seemingly called on Musk’s federal cost-cutting project to investigate the US government’s gold stash at the Bullion Depository in Fort Knox, which the US Mint says holds around half of the country’s gold. The Treasury audits and publishes reports on gold holdings at Fort Knox and other locations across the US every month, but President Donald Trump and Musk have both parrotted decades-old conspiracy theories about the gold and questioned whether it’s all still there. Source: Elon Musk Related: Who’s running in Trump’s race to make US a ‘Bitcoin superpower?' They have both pushed for an independent audit of Fort Knox. The vaults were last opened in 2017 for Trump’s then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to view the gold and before that, in 1974 to a congressional delegation and a group of journalists. The Mint’s website says that no gold has gone in or out of Fort Knox “for many years,” except for “very small quantities” used to test the gold’s purity during audits. Trump’s Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said last month that Fort Knox is audited every year and “all the gold is present and accounted for.” Magazine: Elon Musk’s plan to run government on blockchain faces uphill battle",,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-24 05:57:01

But now things are changing, Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana saw strong gains early Monday as reports suggested that the upcoming Trump tariffs on April 2 might not be as aggressive as previously feared. This shift in expectations helped improve market sentiment, leading to a rally in both equities and cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Solana Lead the Charge Following the news, Bitcoin climbed 2.7% in the last 24 hours, trading around $86,500, while Solana (SOL) jumped nearly 6% to $138. XRP also moved higher, rising 2.5% to $2.44, holding above its 50-day moving average after two weeks of positive price action. The rally came as U.S. stock futures, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, saw a 0.5% boost, while the VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, dropped 2.5%. Trump’s Tariffs: A Softer Approach? Initially, concerns over Trump’s planned tariffs had sent markets lower, with Bitcoin dropping nearly 17.6% in February. However, recent reports indicate that the tariffs could be more targeted than previously expected. Some countries may be exempt, and the additional levies on steel and other metals might not be cumulative. This news has calmed investors, sparking optimism across financial markets. Federal Reserve and Market Outlook The Federal Reserve recently updated its outlook, raising inflation expectations but sticking to its plan for two interest rate cuts this year. It also dismissed worries that tariffs would cause lasting inflation, calling the impact temporary. This has boosted confidence in riskier investments like Bitcoin. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, believes Bitcoin will hit $110,000 before dropping to $76,500 again. He argues that the Fed’s shift from tightening to easing policies will keep the crypto market strong despite inflation fears. Will it Backfire? While the news has improved sentiment, analysts warn that unexpected developments or a tougher stance from Trump could still impact markets in the coming days. Crypto expert Peter Schiff criticized Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff plan, arguing that instead of restoring America’s wealth, it will expose the country’s deep reliance on global productivity and savings. He suggests that the U.S. is no longer as strong as it once was and that these tariffs may highlight economic weaknesses rather than solve them. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Robert Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin Warning: Fear of Mistakes Is Costing You Wealth , Key Events to Watch All eyes are now on two key events that could shape market sentiment in the coming days.

Meanwhile, Friday’s PCE reading, the Fed’s go-to inflation measure, will offer more insights into future monetary policy. With tariff worries easing and the Fed staying accommodative, the crypto market is regaining momentum, hinting at more upside in the near term. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After reaching a local peak in December, LINK faced significant selling pressure. However, a new structure is now forming on a broader time frame, suggesting a potential shift in momentum, according to the analyst firm. The analyst firm has identified the following as key levels to watch in the LINK price: $16.5 – $17.3: Current test zone, aligned with previous support and intersecting with the downtrend line. $20.2 – $21.7: A strong resistance area, a break above this level could open the way to LINK’s upper trading range. $12.6: A key support level that marks the lower uptrend line. Holding this level could be a bullish sign. At the time of writing, LINK is trading at $14.34. According to the analytics firm, Chainlink is currently at a crossroads balancing between structural support and a potential breakout. The range around $17 remains the key short-term turning point that could determine whether LINK continues its uptrend. *This is not investment advice.

Leading crypto exchange Bybit has just announced a significant expansion to its trading platform. Mark your calendars for March 24th because Bybit is set to list new spot trading pairs featuring USDQ, a stablecoin with a unique regulatory edge. This move is generating buzz among traders and investors alike. Let’s delve into what this exciting development means for you and the crypto market. What’s the Buzz About Bybit Listing USDQ Pairs? Bybit, renowned for its robust trading infrastructure and diverse offerings, is continuously evolving to meet the demands of the dynamic cryptocurrency market. The upcoming listing of USDQ/USDT and BTC/USDQ pairs is a testament to Bybit’s commitment to providing users with access to innovative and compliant digital assets. Specifically, the introduction of USDQ stablecoin pairs opens up new avenues for trading and portfolio diversification. But what makes USDQ stand out? According to Bybit’s official announcement, the listing schedule is as follows: USDQ/USDT Spot Pair: Launching at 08:00 UTC on March 24 BTC/USDQ Spot Pair: Launching at 09:00 UTC on March 24 This staggered launch provides traders with a phased entry into these new markets, allowing for careful observation and strategic positioning. The addition of these pairs signifies Bybit’s proactive approach to incorporating regulated stablecoins into its ecosystem, potentially attracting a broader range of users who prioritize compliance and stability. Understanding USDQ Stablecoin and MiCA Compliance The spotlight is undoubtedly on USDQ. It’s not just another stablecoin; it’s designed with a keen eye on regulatory frameworks, particularly Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). This is a crucial detail because MiCA is poised to become a landmark regulatory framework for the crypto industry in Europe, setting standards for transparency, consumer protection, and operational integrity. Being designed to comply with MiCA from the outset gives USDQ stablecoin a distinct advantage in the evolving regulatory landscape. Here’s a breakdown of why USDQ’s MiCA compliance is noteworthy: Regulatory Foresight: USDQ’s proactive approach to MiCA compliance demonstrates a forward-thinking strategy, anticipating future regulatory requirements rather than reacting to them. Enhanced Trust: Compliance with regulations like MiCA can boost investor confidence in USDQ, as it signals a commitment to operating within established legal frameworks. European Market Access: Being MiCA compliant could potentially facilitate easier access to the European market for USDQ, opening up opportunities for wider adoption and usage within the EU. Dutch Regulation: USDQ is licensed under Dutch regulation, adding another layer of credibility and oversight to its operations. In essence, USDQ is positioning itself as a regulated and reliable stablecoin option, particularly for users and institutions seeking to navigate the increasingly regulated crypto space. This focus on compliance could be a major draw for traders looking for stablecoins that prioritize legal clarity and operational transparency. Exploring BTC/USDQ Pair and Spot Trading Opportunities The introduction of the BTC/USDQ pair alongside USDQ/USDT presents exciting new spot trading opportunities for Bybit users. Spot trading, in its essence, is the direct buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery. This differs from futures or derivatives trading, where contracts are traded rather than the underlying assets themselves. Let’s examine the potential benefits of spot trading these new pairs: Direct Exposure to USDQ: Spot trading allows traders to directly acquire and hold USDQ, providing exposure to this MiCA-compliant stablecoin. Diversification: The BTC/USDQ pair offers an alternative trading avenue for Bitcoin holders, allowing them to diversify their trading strategies beyond traditional fiat or major stablecoin pairings. Hedging Opportunities: In volatile market conditions, USDQ could serve as a hedging instrument against Bitcoin price fluctuations, particularly for users who believe in the stability and regulatory advantages of USDQ. Arbitrage Potential: The launch of new pairs can sometimes create arbitrage opportunities across different exchanges, although these are often short-lived and require rapid execution. For traders familiar with spot trading , the addition of USDQ pairs expands the trading landscape on Bybit, offering fresh instruments for portfolio management and market participation. It’s crucial to understand the dynamics of spot trading and the specific characteristics of USDQ to effectively leverage these new opportunities. Why Crypto Exchange Listings Matter for Traders Listings on prominent crypto exchanges like Bybit are pivotal events in the lifecycle of any cryptocurrency or token. These listings can significantly impact a digital asset’s visibility, liquidity, and accessibility. For traders, exchange listings often translate into a range of benefits and considerations. Here’s why exchange listings are so important: Benefit Description Increased Liquidity Listing on a major exchange like Bybit typically leads to a surge in trading volume, enhancing the liquidity of the listed pairs. Higher liquidity means tighter spreads and easier order execution for traders. Enhanced Visibility Exchange listings expose the asset to a wider audience of traders and investors. Bybit’s user base will now have direct access to USDQ and BTC/USDQ trading, boosting its market presence. Price Discovery Listings contribute to price discovery by facilitating more trading activity and market participation. The interaction of buyers and sellers on a reputable exchange helps establish a more transparent and market-driven price for the asset. Accessibility Listing on a user-friendly platform like Bybit makes the asset more accessible to a broader range of traders, including both retail and institutional participants. For USDQ, being listed on Bybit is a significant step forward in its journey to broader adoption and market recognition. For Bybit users, it means more trading options and the opportunity to engage with a stablecoin that is proactively addressing regulatory requirements. Navigating Spot Trading on Bybit: A Quick Guide If you’re keen to explore spot trading of USDQ/USDT and BTC/USDQ pairs on Bybit, here’s a quick guide to get you started: Account Setup: Ensure you have a verified account on Bybit.

Notably, marketing lead Lucie revealed key factors that make the dog-themed meme coin a perfect fit for an ETF product. In the wake of recent broader global pro-crypto shifts, traders and investors anticipate a SHIB price rally to kick off, given this feat actually happens. Simultaneously, a phenomenal +8000% surge in the dog-themed coin’s burn rate intraday solidified bullish market sentiments about price. Is Shiba Inu ETF Filing Possible? Lucie’s Post Sparks Optimism According to a recent X post by Lucie , the dog-themed meme coin shows strong characteristics that make it a good pick for a Shiba Inu ETF. Lucie reveals that the meme coin is available on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs, including all the top crypto trading platforms. In the wake of this aspect, the marketing lead calls the crypto an absolute pick for an ETF product due to its global accessibility. “Because SHIB isn’t just a meme—it’s decentralized, community-driven, and built to last,” she concluded. Primarily, these statements gained significant traction across the broader market in sync with the recent optimistic waves generated by crypto-backed ETF filings. CoinGape reported that Canary Capital recently filed an S-1 for SUI ETF approval with the U.S. SEC. Also, the odds of a DOGE ETF approval soared as the US SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for it previously. The speculations of a Dogecoin ETF filing by BlackRock also remain on the rise amid broader crypto-ETF filings. Altogether, these developments inject significant optimism towards the odds of a Shiba Inu ETF filing ahead. SHIB Burn Rate Surge Adds Market Optimism A staggering 8454% surge in the SHIB burn rate this Monday added to investors’ bullishness on price. Slightly over 1 billion coins were burnt in the past 24 hours, dealing a massive hit to the meme coin’s circulating supply. In turn, bullish investor sentiments about price prevail, abiding by the law of supply and demand. For context, the burn mechanism permanently reduces the meme coin’s supply by sending tokens to a null address. As a result, market sentiments about future price action take a paradigm bullish shift. Source: Shibburn site The total circulating supply after the massive blow was evaluated as 584.35 trillion coins. When coupled with the Shiba Inu ETF filing speculations, these developments signal that a price rally looms. SHIB Price Overview Today As of press time, SHIB price witnessed a 1% increase in value, closing in at $0.00001303. The coin bottomed and peaked at $0.0000128 and $0.00001309 in the past 24 hours. Notably, the rising action falls in line with the recent burn rate surge and soaring optimism for an ETF filing ahead. Simultaneously, Coinglass data underscored rising market interest in the asset. Shiba Inu futures OI was up by 3.5% to $121.69 million. Also, the derivatives volume spiked by 24% to $71.18 million. Overall, the current sentiment for the meme coins appears to be bullish amid recent advancements, such as a burn rate surge and Shiba Inu ETF odds on the rise.

The digital asset world is buzzing with news of a colossal 250 million USDC minted directly from the USDC Treasury. This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a significant injection into the stablecoin ecosystem, and naturally, the ever-watchful eyes of the crypto community are trying to decipher what this means. Was this a planned move? Does it signal increased institutional demand? Or is there something else brewing beneath the surface? Let’s dive deep into this intriguing development and explore the potential ripples across the crypto landscape. What’s the Buzz About USDC Minting? First things first, for those newer to the crypto space, let’s quickly break down what USDC is and why minting it is a noteworthy event. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Think of it as a digital dollar designed for the internet age. It’s issued by Circle, a reputable financial technology company, and Centre, a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins like USDC aim to maintain a stable value, making them ideal for transactions, trading, and as a safe haven in the often turbulent crypto market . Minting , in the context of stablecoins, is the process of creating new tokens. When demand for USDC increases, or when Circle anticipates future demand, they can ‘mint’ more USDC. This process is usually backed by reserves of fiat currency (in this case, US dollars) held in custody, ensuring that each USDC token is indeed equivalent to one US dollar. The recent whale alert from transaction trackers indicates a substantial increase in the USDC supply, prompting questions and speculations across the crypto community. Decoding the 250 Million USDC Mint: Why Should You Care? So, 250 million USDC is a large number – but what does it actually mean for you, the average crypto user or investor? Here’s a breakdown of potential implications: Increased Market Liquidity: A larger supply of USDC generally translates to increased liquidity within the crypto market. More USDC available means more capital readily available for trading and investment across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized platforms. This can lead to tighter spreads and smoother trading experiences. Potential Indicator of Bullish Sentiment: Large mints of stablecoins are sometimes seen as a precursor to increased buying activity in the broader crypto market. Traders and investors often move funds into stablecoins like USDC when they anticipate deploying capital into other cryptocurrencies. This massive mint could suggest that significant players are preparing to increase their positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. However, it’s crucial to remember correlation doesn’t equal causation, and other factors could be at play. Growing Institutional Interest?: Large USDC mints can also indicate growing institutional adoption of stablecoins and the crypto space in general. Institutions often require stable and regulated on-ramps and off-ramps to the crypto market, and USDC, with its regulatory compliance and backing, is a popular choice. A 250 million USDC mint might suggest a significant institutional player is entering or expanding their crypto holdings. Operational Needs of Circle: It’s also important to consider that this mint could simply be for Circle’s operational needs. They might be anticipating increased redemption requests or preparing for partnerships and integrations that require a larger USDC reserve. While less market-moving than the other points, it’s a plausible explanation. USDC vs. Other Stablecoins: What’s the Difference? The stablecoin landscape is becoming increasingly crowded, with USDT (Tether), BUSD (Binance USD), and DAI (Dai) being some of the other major players. So, why does USDC stand out, and why is its minting so closely watched? Here’s a quick comparison: Feature USDC USDT (Tether) BUSD (Binance USD) DAI (Dai) Issuer Circle & Centre Tether Limited Binance & Paxos MakerDAO (Decentralized) Peg USD USD USD USD (Algorithmic) Transparency & Audits Regular audits, transparent reserves Historically less transparent, improving transparency Audited, transparent reserves Transparent on-chain, decentralized governance Regulatory Compliance Strong focus on compliance Facing regulatory scrutiny Regulated, issued by Paxos Trust Company Decentralized, less regulatory clarity USDC is often perceived as a more regulated and transparent stablecoin compared to some of its competitors, particularly USDT. This focus on compliance and transparency makes it attractive to institutions and users who prioritize security and regulatory clarity. Therefore, significant movements in USDC supply, like this 250 million mint, often garner more attention and are interpreted with a greater degree of seriousness by the market. Whale Alert : Following the Big Crypto Moves The news of this USDC minting originated from Whale Alert , a popular service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. These ‘whale alerts’ are invaluable for understanding the movements of significant players in the crypto market. Large transactions can often foreshadow market trends, shifts in sentiment, or strategic maneuvers by institutions or wealthy individuals (‘whales’). Following whale alerts related to stablecoin mints, especially USDC, can provide early signals of potential market activity. While not every large mint translates to immediate price action, it’s a crucial data point to consider alongside other market indicators. For instance, monitoring inflows and outflows of USDC to and from exchanges, as tracked by whale alert systems, can offer insights into buying and selling pressure. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights So, what should you do with this information about the 250 million USDC mint? Here are some actionable insights: Keep an Eye on Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts in the coming days and weeks. Does Bitcoin or Ethereum see a price surge? Are altcoins gaining momentum? While the USDC mint isn’t a guaranteed predictor, it’s a potential catalyst to watch. Monitor USDC Supply and Circulation: Track the total supply of USDC and its circulation across exchanges and DeFi platforms. Significant increases in circulating supply following a mint can indicate actual deployment of these funds into the market. Stay Informed with Whale Alerts: Continue to follow services like Whale Alert for further insights into large crypto transactions, including stablecoin movements and significant transfers of other cryptocurrencies. This real-time data can help you stay ahead of potential market shifts. Diversify Your Research: Don’t rely solely on one data point. Combine information about USDC mints with other forms of market analysis, including technical analysis, on-chain metrics, and fundamental research, for a well-rounded understanding of the crypto market. Conclusion: A Massive Mint and the Crypto Market’s Next Chapter The shocking 250 million USDC mint is undoubtedly a significant event in the stablecoin and broader crypto market narrative. Whether it’s a signal of impending bullish momentum, institutional accumulation, or simply operational adjustments by Circle, it warrants close attention. By understanding the nuances of USDC , minting processes, and utilizing tools like whale alerts , you can navigate the dynamic crypto landscape with greater awareness and make more informed decisions. The crypto world never sleeps, and developments like this USDC mint keep the story constantly evolving, offering both opportunities and challenges for those who dare to participate.

The total crypto market cap has edged 1 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $2.94 trillion on Monday, March 24, during the early European session. Last week’s gold price rally to a new all-time high of above $3k has significantly boosted the bullish sentiment for the wider crypto market. Moreover, global markets have largely factored in the U.S.-led tariff wars. What to Expect of Bitcoin this Week Bitcoin price opened earlier today with a bullish outlook after closing the last two weeks in the green. The renewed interest in Bitcoin from whale investors, as shown by the declining supply of BTC on centralized exchanges and notable cash inflows of U.S. spot BTC ETFs, helped the flagship surge to nearly $87k at the time of this writing. From a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin price is aiming for $91k in the coming days after piercing through a previously established falling logarithmic trend. However, Bitcoin price must consistently close above $87k in the coming days to invalidate a potential selloff below $80k. Ethereum Price Prediction According to on-chain data, the overall demand for Ethereum remains low compared to Bitcoin. However, Ether’s price has a high correlation with Bitcoin, based on historical trends. Moreover, Ether’s price gained over 7 percent last week to trade at about $2,048 on Monday. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $247 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $10 billion, has also signaled a possible momentum reversal. After closing last week with a bullish outlook, Ether’s price is likely to regain $2,100 as a support level by the end of this week. XRP Price Forecast Following the closure of the Ripple vs SEC case last week , XRP price has signaled the onset of the second bullish trend toward price discovery. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $245 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $2.5 billion, closed the past two weeks on the green. In the past 24 hours, XRP price surged over 3 percent to trade at about $2.46 at the time of this writing. With the renewed interest in XRP by institutional investors, the altcoin is well-positioned to rally towards $2.9 by the end of this week. FAQs Is Bitcoin expected to reach new highs in 2025? Bitcoin is projected to surge past $91K in the short term, with long-term targets between $200K and $280K, depending on market momentum. Will Ethereum follow Bitcoin’s bullish trend? Ethereum’s price is closely correlated with Bitcoin, and analysts predict it could reach $7,500 or higher during this cycle. How is XRP performing after the SEC case resolution? XRP has seen renewed institutional interest, with predictions suggesting it may rally toward $5–$10 in the coming cycle.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|ETH|XRP|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 06:17:02

A stablecoin tied to the Korean won could give South Korea a stronger footing in the global stablecoin race, according to a recent report from think tank Hashed Open Research and Four Pillars. The report , published on Mar. 24, suggests that launching a won-based stablecoin might make the currency more practical for digital transactions while also bridging the gap between Korea’s crypto market and international digital asset ecosystems. According to the report, the introduction of a KRW stablecoin “could help address structural inefficiencies in the Korean crypto market,” as well as “serve as the foundation for various fintech industries that emerge from this ecosystem.” Hashed Open Research notes that the high liquidity of Korean exchanges could provide an advantage for a KRW stablecoin over alternatives like the yen or euro. You might also like: South Korean FIU unveils more AML restrictions in light of crypto crimes While boosting the use of won-pegged stablecoins, the report also highlights concerns over the rapid rise of dollar-based stablecoins, such as Tether ( USDT ) and USD Coin ( USDC ), which could be exacerbating capital outflows from the country. The report cautions that capital outflows from Korea’s crypto market could grow into a bigger issue, potentially impacting the country’s financial stability and the strength of the won. In the report, Hashed Open Research calls for a dedicated regulatory framework for stablecoins, saying these assets “possess characteristics of both payment instruments and investment assets, requiring a dedicated regulatory framework.” The report suggests allowing both banks and non-banks to issue stablecoins under strict licensing and security requirements. Additionally, it proposes that foreign-issued KRW stablecoins should be regulated domestically, while foreign stablecoins pegged to other fiat currencies should only be allowed if they meet equivalent regulatory standards.

The community’s attention has shifted to MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, over whether he could start diversifying his crypto portfolio with XRP. If this happens and Saylor sells half of MSTR’s Bitcoin holdings to buy Ripple, can XRP price reach $1,000? XRP Price Target If Michael Saylor Swaps $21B BTC to Ripple MicroStrategy, which was recently rebranded to Strategy, currently holds 499,096 BTC valued at $43 billion. The institution is the fourth-largest Bitcoin holder after Satoshi Nakamoto, Binance, and BlackRock. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Meanwhile, despite being a Bitcoin maxi, Saylor recently told CNBC that buying tokens such as XRP was a way of supporting US investments. This sparked speculation that Saylor could dip his toes in the Ripple ecosystem, possibly buying XRP. MicroStrategy’s most realistic portfolio diversification would be swapping half of its Bitcoin holdings for Ripple. This would mean that the institution buys $21 billion worth of XRP. If this purchase happens, the impact on XRP price would be phenomenal. Impact of $21B XRP Purchase on Price For context, XRP price today trades at $2.46. This means that Saylor’s $21 billion purchase would give the company 8.5 billion Ripple tokens. This is equivalent to 15% of the total XRP supply. The additional buying pressure and the reduction of the circulating supply considering Saylor’s HODL strategy for crypto holdings will easily propel XRP price to all-time highs. Ripple would reach $10 within a few hours of the purchase. A $100 price target could also be achieved within weeks. If Saylor buys XRP , the price could also easily shoot up to $1,000. Buying such a large number of tokens would spark massive retail trading activity, and see XRP outperform the rest of the crypto market. Is $1,000 a Realistic Target for XRP Price? A $1,000 price target for XRP is not impossible, but it is also not realistic under the current tokenomics. XRP has a supply of 58 billion tokens. This would mean that its market cap will reach $58 trillion if Saylor’s purchase pushed XRP price to $1,000. At a $58 trillion market cap, XRP would be worth more than the annual US GDP. This is also around 20 times higher than the current market cap of the entire crypto industry. Nevertheless, Ripple might choose to change its tokenomics to make a $1,000 XRP price target possible. The company can do this in two ways: placing more XRP tokens in escrow or conducting massive token burns. If the tokenomics change and the XRP supply dropped to 1 billion, it would attain a $1 trillion market cap and rival Bitcoin’s dominance. Ripple Technical Analysis Top market analyst and early Bitcoin advocate Davinci Jeremie has given a bullish XRP price prediction . He believes that Ripple will not only reclaim its $3 price target, but also rally to more than $20. “Although I hate XRP and I think it’s a bad idea as a cryptocurrency, I have to admit that according to technical analysis, it’s going a lot higher than $3. I think it will get as high as $20.” The analyst’s prediction comes as the four-hour XRP price chart revealed that bullish momentum was building. Ripple has been making a series of higher lows, as the RSI line also tips north. This confirms Jeremie’s bullish analysis that XRP could go higher than $20. XRP/USDT: 4-hour Chart To sum up, XRP price could go on a parabolic rally if Saylor swaps $21B BTC for Ripple.

TVL Crosses $10 Billion! The total value locked (TVL) in RWAs surpassed $10 billion, marking a growing trend towards tokenizing real-world assets for faster settlements, fractional ownership, and 24/7 trading. BUIDL- The Largest Tokenised RWA Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is gaining momentum , proving to be one of the most resilient sectors during the crypto market slump. Major players like Maker, BlackRock’s BUIDL, and Ethena’s USDtb each hold over $1 billion in TVL, with USDtb seeing a remarkable 1,000% TVL growth last month. BlackRock is now the largest tokenized RWA. Meanwhile, Hashnote, the issuer of a tokenized money market fund acquired by Circle in January, ranks second with nearly $900 million, showing the biggest one year change. Treasury-backed tokens hit a record $4.2 billion market cap in Q1, led by Ondo Finance’s OUSG and USDY, BlackRock and Securitize’s BUIDL, Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, and Superstate’s USTB. Tokenized commodities follow at $1.26 billion, with Paxos Gold leading at over $500 million in TVL. Key Developments The top RWA crypto projects are Mantra, which hit an all-time high on Feb. 23, and ONDO. PENDLE, once a top 100 player, has dropped to 131 in 2025. Crypto analyst rektdiomedes remains extremely bullish on RWAs, especially Maple Finance, predicting a major growth in securitization and capital market infrastructure within the crypto industry. If the trend continues, Maple Finance could benefit greatly, as it specializes in institutional credit and on-chain capital markets. Beesdies, key developments include partnerships like RWA Inc. and Novastro, which bring AI-driven solutions for better security and compliance. This shift is seen as a key moment for DeFi, making financial markets more accessible and efficient, with predictions that RWAs could become dominant in the sector. RWA Value Doubled In The Past Year The DeFi Investor also recently shared that the total value of RWAs has doubled in the past year, now surpassing $18 billion, with most of that value coming from Private Credit. The total RWA value doubled in the past 12 months alone.

On Mar. 21, the U.S. Department of the Treasury officially removed Tornado Cash and several associated smart contract addresses from its sanctions list, reversing the August 2022 sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Regulators had accused the platform of facilitating money laundering activities, including transactions linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. The move followed a November 2024 ruling by a federal appeals court, which found the Treasury had overstepped its authority in sanctioning the crypto mixer’s immutable smart contracts. Following the Mar. 21 ruling, the Treasury Department said in a statement that the case should now be considered resolved, arguing that because Tornado Cash and the related smart contracts had been delisted from the specially Designated Nationals list, the lawsuit was effectively “moot.” The US Treasury asserted that the court should assess whether it still has jurisdiction over the case, noting that, like all federal courts, it has a “continuing obligation to satisfy itself” on matters of Article III jurisdiction, and for that reason, “briefing on mootness is warranted.” Grewal, however, argued in a Mar. 24 X post that this approach doesn’t align with the law. “Power does not recede voluntarily. It’s gasps and it gasps until it no longer can After grudgingly delisting TC, they now claim they’ve mooted any need for a final court judgment. But that’s not the law, and they know it.” Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase You might also like: US Treasury lifts sanctions on Tornado Cash, allowing access for Americans According to Grewal, this is a textbook example of what’s known as voluntary cessation, a legal principle where a defendant ends a contested action in an attempt to avoid a court ruling. However, this only applies if there is clear assurance that the behaviour will not recur. In Grewal’s view, the Treasury has provided no such guarantee. He referenced a 2024 Supreme Court decision involving a U.S. citizen who had been removed from the No Fly List. The court found that the case was not moot, as the government had failed to offer any assurance that the individual would not be placed back on the list. While Tornado Cash may have been removed from the sanctions list, Grewal noted that the Treasury has given “no assurance” it won’t be added again. “That’s not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,” he added. Recent developments come a month after Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was released from prison under electronic monitoring after a Dutch court suspended his pretrial detention, allowing him to focus on appealing his conviction. Meanwhile, Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm is currently out on a $2 million bond and is expected to face trial in April. He was charged by U.S. authorities in August 2023, along with fellow co-founder Roman Semenov, for allegedly helping launder over $1 billion in cryptocurrency through the platform.

Analysts Have Identified These 2 Tokens,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trying-to-find-the-next-shiba-inu-shib-analysts-have-identified-these-2-tokens/,"SHIB enjoyed an astonishing surge from unknown status to dominate the meme coin realm while its initial investors amassed considerable wealth. Crypto fans currently question whether any new project could replicate the success that Shiba Inu (SHIB) achieved. Analysts highlight Neiro alongside Remittix as two upcoming tokens which pursue separate tokenization methods through AI meme energy capabilities and swift cryptocurrency network conversions. The Search for a New SHIB Few people anticipated Shiba Inu would experience an explosive rise after its initial launch. Present-day traders monitor projects that show identical powerful storytelling along with loyal community involvement. Neiro and Remittix have gained significant market attention because of their alliances between innovative approaches and high user participation coupled with effective promotions. The crypto market seeks new meme coins which resemble altcoins capable of making massive price rises. The two projects seem to match every classification category in unique ways. Neiro: An AI-Powered Meme Ecosystem Source: tradingview Neiro brings together artificial intelligence with meme coin playfulness according to their description. The August 2024 debut marked the launch of this platform where no part of its operation is centralized. The team behind the platform states that developers hold no tokens nor can they assess any fees during token transactions. Neiro operates through community-powered controls that consist of platform roadmap development and the activation of artificial intelligence creative functions. Neiro presents 420,690,000,000 tokens based on meme coin methodology though it distinguishes itself with AI implementation throughout. The main attraction of Neiro includes plans to build an AI-powered interactive meme world that adapts based on user participation. The project has released hints about an AI-produced NFT collection which brings together contemporary technological advancements with common internet memes. The possibility for short-term viewers to take interest in an AI-centric meme coin appears promising. Meme coins struggle to create buzz on their own which makes an original approach such as basing them on AI technology beneficial to market standing. When the core group of users share creativity and strong dedication the project will demonstrate characteristics similar to Shiba Inu during its early development phase. Remittix: The New Payments Token Remittix focuses on meeting customers’ direct need to perform swift cryptocurrency to fiat currency transfers while Neiro relies on meme power for success. So far Remittix has succeeded in raising $14 million+ and distributing more than 521 million tokens at a price of $0.0734 per token. Remittix serves users who need to convert digital assets into traditional money while Neiro focuses on providing the lighter side of Shiba Inu entertainment. The fundamental goal of Remittix is to provide users with an easy way to convert tokens into fiat currency before distributing funds to bank accounts within any global region. User support should increase when Remittix solves the complex problem of off-ramping coins. Those who exchange frequently or receive crypto-based payments through their work would strongly benefit from this system. The success of Shiba Inu grew exclusively from the large community that propelled its price changes. Remittix might succeed through providing daily utility to its users. The numerous traders and users dissatisfied with time-consuming cashout approaches may turn towards Remittix. The accumulated funds in presale demonstrate the confidence of people in the core business concept. A strong rising trend like SHIB could occur if Remittix manages to distinguish itself among payment coins. Evaluating Their Paths to “Next SHIB” Status Neiro, an AI-powered meme coin, highlights imaginative memes and community-driven governance. Remittix, on the other hand, focuses on user-friendly crypto payments with real-world usage. Neiro uses AI with viral memes for playful purposes but Remittix addresses off-ramp difficulties through its utility-based operations. Neiro will probably replicate Shiba Inu’s success by achieving massive social media recognition along with new NFT releases and continuous user retention. Remittix may achieve success through partnerships with remittance or e-commerce providers while continuously demonstrating that the system functions as intended. Both face a crowded market. The different core ideologies of Neiro and Remittix as creative meme generators and crypto-bank connector solutions could develop thriving business models together. Final Thoughts Traders intensely monitor emerging projects because they strive to discover assets similar to Shiba Inu. The meme ecosystem developed from artificial intelligence at Neiro represents its differentiating platform due to its aim to duplicate Shiba Inu’s viral success. The Remittix platform operates to connect cryptographic assets with standard financial systems through fast transaction processing scenarios. Numerous investors are focusing on Neiro and Remittix because they consider these two coins to be among the frontrunners for an upcoming altcoin breakthrough.

His latest venture, a startup called Vast Space, plans to launch Haven-1—the first commercial space station —by 2026. McCaleb, who earned billions from selling XRP, is expected to provide major financial backing for the project. Vast Space’s CEO, Max Haot, explained that the station is not meant for tourism. Instead, the goal is to create an environment focused on work, team efficiency, safety, and communication. The station is designed to support government astronauts as well as privately funded missions with serious objectives in orbit. If successful, Vast could even help replace the aging International Space Station and become a strong contender for NASA contracts. McCaleb, known for launching major crypto projects like Mt. Gox and Ripple, is fully committed to this mission. He admitted that he could lose up to $1 billion if things don’t go as planned, but said the long-term vision is worth the risk. He emphasized the need for people to support the idea of human life beyond Earth and believes few are willing to take that level of risk. The XRP community has mixed feelings about McCaleb’s move. After leaving Ripple in 2013 due to internal disputes, McCaleb sold off his XRP holdings from 2014 to 2022. His sales—totaling around $3.3 billion—sparked criticism from some XRP supporters who claimed he hurt the project’s value. McCaleb defended his actions, saying he was transparent about leaving Ripple before selling his tokens, giving others a chance to act first. He also reminded the community that he never forced anyone to switch to Stellar Lumens, though that option was available. “I didn’t do that at all. I told the ripple community I was leaving ripple and no longer believed in the project. I did that before I sold my XRP,” McCaleb said on X. “The intent was to let people front run me.” Despite the backlash, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has voiced support for the space initiative . He praised Vast as an example of American innovation and said he’s hopeful about its success. According to Larsen, this kind of bold ambition is something the country used to embrace. If Vast achieves its goals, it will serve as a powerful example of how crypto wealth can be used to fuel real-world advancements in science and technology—especially in areas as ambitious as space exploration.",,EN,0,0,XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-24 07:22:12

This surge breaks through the lower Bollinger Band region, indicating an attempt at reversal after a prolonged downtrend. However, the price remains beneath the middle band, implying that broader momentum is still bearish. The RSI value is at 46.44, climbing from oversold conditions but not yet entering bullish territory. While the breakout is significant, it must be sustained with higher volume and further closes above $0.038 to confirm a trend reversal. Caution is still advised.

However, the Balance of Power indicator is erratic and inconsistent, suggesting indecision between buyers and sellers. The MACD lines are relatively flat and close to zero, indicating weak momentum and a lack of strong directional bias.

On the 4-hour chart, volatility remains compressed with erratic Balance of Power readings, while MACD is flat, pointing to short-term indecision. Overall, while daily momentum looks slightly bullish, confirmation through volume and a break above $0.036 is needed for sustained upside. Is BRETT a good investment? BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis’s critical prediction, BRETT could reach $1 by 2030, with its potential high projected at $1.16. However, given earlier projections, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT’s near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.70 by 2027 and $1 by 2030, depending on market conditions and the adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

Kiyosaki’s Shocking Bitcoin Prediction Ignites Crypto Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kiyosaki-bitcoin-biggest-opportunity/,"Is Bitcoin the golden ticket to wealth in the 21st century? According to Robert Kiyosaki, the acclaimed author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” the answer is a resounding yes! He’s not just dipping his toes into the crypto waters; he’s diving headfirst, declaring the current Bitcoin price as nothing less than the “biggest opportunity in history.” Let’s delve into why Kiyosaki is so bullish on Bitcoin and what this could mean for you. Robert Kiyosaki’s Bold Bitcoin Prediction: A Historic Investment Opportunity In a recent buzz-generating post on X (formerly Twitter), Kiyosaki didn’t mince words. He stated emphatically that Bitcoin represents a monumental investment opportunity . He even took a jab at the potential future FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) crowd, predicting, “If history is any indicator the FOMM crowd will wait till Bitcoin passed $200 k this year and say ‘Bitcoin is too expensive.'” This statement highlights Kiyosaki’s belief in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory and the tendency of many to jump in only after significant price appreciation. [img]Image of Robert Kiyosaki holding ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ book with Bitcoin chart in the background[/img] But why is Kiyosaki so convinced about this opportunity ? It boils down to his long-held investment philosophy and his understanding of Bitcoin’s unique value proposition in today’s economic landscape. He views Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and the potential devaluation of fiat currencies. In a world grappling with economic uncertainties, Bitcoin, with its decentralized and limited supply, stands out as a potentially safe haven asset. Why Bitcoin Now? Understanding the Crypto Investment Landscape Kiyosaki’s endorsement isn’t just a fleeting opinion; it’s rooted in a deeper understanding of the crypto market and Bitcoin’s role within it. Here’s a breakdown of why now might indeed be a significant time for Bitcoin, according to proponents like Kiyosaki and others he recommends: Scarcity: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins is a fundamental aspect driving its value. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed at will, Bitcoin’s scarcity is mathematically enforced, potentially making it an effective store of value. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates outside the control of central banks and governments. This decentralization is a key appeal for those seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems, especially in times of economic instability. Growing Institutional Adoption: We are witnessing increasing interest and investment in Bitcoin from institutional players. This institutional adoption lends further legitimacy and stability to the Bitcoin market. Hedge Against Inflation: With inflation rates rising globally, many investors are looking for assets that can preserve their purchasing power. Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital gold, offering a hedge against inflationary pressures. Navigating the Crypto World: Insights from Bitcoin Experts While Kiyosaki’s enthusiasm is contagious, he wisely advises a balanced approach to crypto investing. He urges his followers, “Don’t take my word for it,” encouraging them to seek diverse perspectives. He specifically recommends listening to prominent Bitcoin proponents: Jeff Booth: Known for his deep understanding of monetary policy and Bitcoin’s role in a changing financial system. Booth often emphasizes Bitcoin’s potential to fix the flaws in the current monetary order. Michael Saylor: The Chairman of MicroStrategy, a publicly traded company that has heavily invested in Bitcoin. Saylor is a vocal advocate for Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset and speaks extensively on its long-term value proposition. Samson Mow: A Bitcoin maximalist and CEO of Jan3, a Bitcoin technology company. Mow is known for his strong conviction in Bitcoin’s superiority over other cryptocurrencies and its potential to become the global reserve currency. By listening to these experts, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the bullish arguments for Bitcoin and the factors driving its potential growth. The Skeptic’s Corner: Considering the Challenges of Bitcoin Investment To make truly informed decisions, it’s equally crucial to consider the counterarguments. Kiyosaki wisely suggests listening to Bitcoin skeptics as well. What are some potential challenges and risks associated with Bitcoin investment ? Challenge Description Volatility Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Significant price swings can occur rapidly, which can be unsettling for some investors. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact Bitcoin’s price and adoption. Security Risks While the Bitcoin network itself is secure, exchanges and individual wallets can be targets for hacking and theft. Secure storage and practices are essential. Complexity Understanding the technology and economics behind Bitcoin can be complex for newcomers. Education and due diligence are necessary. Acknowledging these challenges is not about dismissing Bitcoin’s potential but about approaching investment with realistic expectations and a clear understanding of the risks involved. FOMO and Bitcoin: Are You Ready for the Ride? Kiyosaki’s mention of FOMO is particularly relevant. The “fear of making mistakes” (FOMM), as he cleverly puts it, can often lead investors to hesitate and miss out on potentially significant opportunities. His prediction that people will only jump in when Bitcoin hits $200k highlights this common investor behavior. Are you going to be part of the FOMO crowd, or will you take a proactive approach to understanding and potentially investing in Bitcoin now? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Educate Yourself: Dive deep into understanding Bitcoin, blockchain technology, and the crypto market. Resources are abundant online, from articles and videos to courses and communities. Start Small: You don’t need to invest a fortune to begin. Start with a small, manageable amount that you’re comfortable with losing. This allows you to learn and gain experience without significant risk. Diversify (Wisely): While Kiyosaki is bullish on Bitcoin, diversification is generally a sound investment strategy. Consider how Bitcoin fits into your overall portfolio. Secure Your Holdings: If you do invest in Bitcoin, prioritize security. Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for long-term storage. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Stay updated on market trends, news, and regulatory developments. Conclusion: Seizing the Bitcoin Opportunity with Informed Confidence Robert Kiyosaki’s declaration of Bitcoin as the “biggest opportunity in history” is a powerful statement from a respected voice in the financial world. While his enthusiasm should be considered alongside a balanced perspective, his core argument about Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainties is compelling. By educating yourself, understanding the risks and rewards, and listening to diverse viewpoints, you can position yourself to potentially benefit from what many, including Kiyosaki, believe is a transformative asset class. The future of finance is evolving, and Bitcoin is undoubtedly a key player in this revolution. Are you ready to explore this exciting frontier?

The move aims to help Pi Coin better reflect its true market value, instead of being influenced by third-party platforms that reportedly distort its price through artificial activity. PiDaoSwap is now in the final stages of development and is expected to launch soon on the Pi Network mainnet. According to community sources, including Pi Network VietNames, the DEX will allow the PI token to trade based on actual market supply and demand, without interference from centralized exchanges. The platform is currently waiting for Know Your Business (KYB) approval from the Pi core team before it can officially launch. Supporters argue that some exchanges and price tracking platforms use bots and fake data to manipulate Pi’s market perception. These alleged activities have led to frustration in the Pi Network community, which claims that these distortions hurt the project’s reputation and adoption. A recent report from BeInCrypto highlighted concerns about suspicious bot activity affecting Pi’s listed value on platforms like CoinMarketCap. Despite growing support for Pi Coin, Binance has yet to list it, further fueling community disappointment. In the meantime, PiDaoSwap has secured verification status on Twitter, showing that the project is gaining momentum even before its official launch. However, the Pi Network team has clear rules when it comes to branding. The project’s intellectual property policy restricts the use of names and domains containing “Pi” or “Pi-related” references without permission. As a result, the developers behind PiDaoSwap may need to consider a name change or rebranding to meet those guidelines. The team has reached out to the Pi core developers to clarify whether their current naming and domain can remain or must be adjusted. The platform’s goal is to support a more transparent and community-led financial system. By removing dependency on third-party exchanges, PiDaoSwap hopes to provide an accurate pricing system for Pi Coin and restore trust among its users. As the launch nears, the Pi Network community remains focused on pushing forward, despite regulatory hurdles and branding restrictions. If successful, PiDaoSwap could become a key tool in preserving the integrity of Pi Coin’s value within its native ecosystem.",,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BNB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-24 07:25:41

On March 17 alone, the market experienced its strongest daily gain in over a month, with notable interest from institutional players suggesting that confidence may be returning to the crypto space. The reversal comes after a tough period in February when ETFs saw over $5 billion in outflows, much of it due to institutional sell-offs during volatile market conditions and uncertain macroeconomic signals. March, however, has brought signs of recovery, as more capital has flowed back into Bitcoin-focused funds over six consecutive trading days. Leading the rebound is BlackRock’s ETF product, which saw particularly strong buying activity, while Grayscale’s GBTC continued to show outflows, marking a contrast in institutional behavior between ETF providers. Although some platforms remained flat, the overall movement reflects growing interest from large investors. Crypto figure Zia ul Haque highlighted this shift, suggesting that institutional accumulation may point to behind-the-scenes developments. He noted that many large players sold off earlier in March, contributing to market panic and price dips, but are now quietly accumulating again—a move he sees as a positive sign. While the inflow trend is encouraging, not all market observers believe this signals a full recovery. Some analysts argue that the recent surge in ETF interest may be linked more to arbitrage strategies than genuine long-term investment. These strategies often involve using the price differences between spot ETFs and futures markets to make low-risk gains, which may inflate the appearance of true demand. Kyle Chasse, a well-known analyst, explained that while the demand for ETFs is real, a portion of it was purely tactical. Without actual long-term buyers, market volatility could persist, despite the strong inflow numbers. According to him, until committed investors step in, the market may remain uncertain. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs have continued on a negative trend, posting over two weeks of consistent outflows. This contrast highlights differing investor sentiment between the top two cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin currently viewed as the more stable and favored asset in the eyes of institutions. Bitcoin’s price has not responded significantly to the influx of ETF investments and remains just below key psychological levels. While investor behavior is shifting, the broader market has yet to show clear signs of a sustained rally. Still, the current movement of funds may hint at changing dynamics ahead.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-24 07:28:40

During the period, almost all the top ten cryptos, including Bitcoin, have experienced growth . The Bitcoin market has witnessed a significant surge of 3.5%. Currently, the BTC price stands at $87,178.13 – nearly 3.43% above where the market was at the beginning of this month. However, analysts predict a possible pullback. Here is what traders should watch out for. Market Sentiment Restored After Liquidations At a point on March 20, the Bitcoin market touched $87,452.17. Unfortunately, on the same day, the market plummeted by nearly 3.03%. In fact, between March 20 and 22 alone, the market slipped by over 3.51%. However, yesterday, the trend overtuned, as the market rebounded by nearly 2.65%. Currently, the Bitcoin price remains at nearly 2.30% above where the market was at the start of March 23. This indicates that people’s confidence in Bitcoin has been restored. Short-Term Pullback Expected in 1-2 Weeks A post on X by CrypNuevo suggests that the Bitcoin market may experience a retracement within the next one or two weeks. $BTC Sunday update: Market sentiment has been restored after hitting the short liquidations at $87.1k. Now, it could be a good opportunity for the MM to shake out the market again. We may see a pullback from here over the next 1-2 weeks, a retrace of this recovery. ↓ (1/5): pic.twitter.com/ahMmA11IVF — CrypNuevo (@CrypNuevo) March 23, 2025 Pointing out certain crucial patterns observed by him in the one-week chart of Bitcoin, the crypto analyst asserts that the overall bullish trend in the market remains intact. The 50-day EMA of Bitcoin in its one-week chart is $77,726.95. Recently, the BTC market retested this level. Staying above this level is very crucial for Bitcoin, as it is an extremely important bull market support level of this market. The analyst states that as long as the BTC market stands above this support level of $77K, the bullish trend of Bitcoin remains valid. He also warns that if the BTC price drops below this level, the market could experience deeper corrections. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Ethereum and XRP Price Prediction for This Week , Support Trendline Exist, But Stop-Losses Below It CrypNuevo notes that there exists a support trendline. He shares the one-hour chart of Bitcoin to justify his argument. Source : CrypNuevo X Post However, he warns that there are also a lot of stop-losses below it. This increases the likelihood of a price dip to trigger liquidations. In conclusion, Bitcoin remains bullish in the long term, but traders should be cautious about a short-term pullback. A key level to watch is $77K. If the support holds, the bull run continues, but failure could lead to deeper corrections. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This New Token Could Be a Safer Bet",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-xrp-price-mirrors-its-2017-pattern-turning-point-or-new-lows-this-new-token-could-be-a-safer-bet/,"Ripple (XRP) is showing a price pattern eerily similar to its legendary 2017 run, leaving investors wondering if it will this be a major turning point or a signal for new lows. Back then, XRP surged from under $0.01 to an all-time high of $3.92, currently at $2.47 and has struggled to gain momentum amid regulatory uncertainty and market headwinds. Meanwhile, some investors are turning to a newer, high-upside token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It launched its third phase of funding during its altcoin presale where investors bought it at $0.02 while contributing over $4.5 million. More than 6400 investors have entered at the current price levels of $0.025 because they expect a projected 25% price surge before the upcoming stage. The launch price at $0.06 gives investors who enter during this period the potential to receive a 200% profit. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance attracts significant investor attention because it implements decentralized finance solutions for crypto loans together with decentralized finance funding mechanisms for its financial service development. The project grows steadily because it acquired more than $4.5 million from investors and now engages a growing number of 6400 investors. Investors face limited entry choices given a $0.02 Phase 3 token price because an approaching 25% price boost will finalize available early investment opportunities. Over 60% of the phase has already been sold out showing that investors have limited time before the window closes. Investors who participate in the current presale period will receive 200% profits from their investment because the platform already set a future price at $0.06. Mutuum Finance steers the Decentralized market market ahead using its innovative lending solution and its established market position. The Dual-Model System of Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance operates a contemporary lending platform which combines Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models to enable better access to assets and transparency for user empowerment. Smart contract pools benefit from Peer-to-Contrast model users who supply their stablecoins for instant borrowing access by platform users and receive passive income. Thanks to automated interest rate modification through smart contracts both lenders get better earnings and borrowers experience less expense in borrowing. The P2P model enables users to form decentralized lending relationships without middlemen while obtaining full negotiation freedoms. The transparent system allows borrowers and lenders to build customized loan arrangements for transactions so they can achieve better user-friendly options. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is actively expanding its community by offering lucrative incentives. A million-dollar giveaway will distribute $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens to 10 lucky participants, while an innovative referral program rewards users for introducing new investors. Early adopters also benefit from exclusive staking pools, governance privileges, and VIP updates, reinforcing long-term engagement with the platform. Transforming Crypto Lending The Mutuum Finance stablecoin operates through Ethereum to maintain price stability through USD fund deposits. This stablecoin system operates through a resistant structure to prevent algorithmic stability problems that are necessary for financial transactions. Mutuum Finance achieves decentralized finance development potential through its integration of advanced financial lending practices with strong infrastructures. Ripple (XRP) maintains market attention through 2017-styled price movements although investor doubt persists between market fluctuations and regulatory uncertainties. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers better opportunities through its successful presale phase resulting in 6,400 investor participation and a total funding of $4.5 million. Mutuum Finance presents itself as an appealing chance in decentralized finance which markets find promising. Hurry to invest now to take advantage of the current price momentum which might rise further before the following price increase. Investors should join Mutuum Finance presale operations right now to obtain their stake prior to the window’s closure.

CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed that discussions are ongoing, aiming to meet requirements expected under upcoming U.S. stablecoin regulations . These regulations would mandate independent audits as a condition for stablecoin issuers looking to operate in the American market. Ardoino emphasized that securing an audit is now a top priority for the company, especially with rising interest from the U.S. government in integrating stablecoins into the financial system. His comments follow a recent statement from former President Donald Trump , who spoke about stablecoins as a way to strengthen the U.S. dollar's global role. Ardoino suggested that this high-level support could push major auditing firms to take Tether’s request more seriously. Despite this, community skepticism remains high. Tether has made similar promises in the past but has never followed through with a full, independent audit. While internal reports are published regularly and a new CFO has taken over, critics argue these moves fall short of true transparency. Some believe Tether may seek a limited audit focused only on its reserves, but full audits are expected under the proposed GENIUS Act, which outlines strict rules for stablecoin issuers. Under the GENIUS Act, companies issuing stablecoins would be required to undergo external audits and maintain reserves in secure assets like U.S. Treasury bonds. Tether claims it already holds a significant amount in such assets, reporting $33 billion in Treasury purchases last year. However, most of these assets are held by Cantor Fitzgerald , a financial firm closely connected to Tether. This link has raised concerns, especially since Cantor Fitzgerald’s former CEO, Howard Lutnick, recently became the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. Critics like Jason Calcanis argue that Tether’s reputation and political ties warrant stronger oversight. He insists Tether should not be allowed to hold U.S. Treasuries until it passes an in-depth audit going back to its early operations. Tether made massive profits last year, suggesting it has the resources to fund a full audit. Still, doubts remain about whether the company is willing to undergo the level of scrutiny required. Without compliance, Tether’s ability to operate in the U.S. may be at risk, despite its strong positioning and influence. The crypto community is watching closely to see whether Tether will finally deliver on its audit promise. As stablecoin regulations move forward, passing a proper audit will be crucial for the company to secure its future in the regulated U.S. market and potentially form partnerships with government entities .",,EN,0,0,USDT|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-24 07:31:42

If completed, this move could dramatically expand Coinbase’s presence in the crypto trading space, especially in the high-volume derivatives market. Deribit recorded close to $1.2 trillion in total trading volume last year across options, futures, and spot products. In comparison, Coinbase has seen limited activity in derivatives, despite launching Coinbase Derivatives in 2021. A successful acquisition would provide Coinbase access to a new and highly profitable market segment. This development follows a period of growth and expansion for Coinbase, particularly after the SEC ended its legal action against the exchange. Coinbase has since introduced new features like verified liquidity pools aimed at both institutional and retail traders. According to a recent Bloomberg report, talks with Deribit are ongoing, though no deal has been finalized. The potential merger is being viewed by some in the industry as a turning point that could help transform Coinbase into a global crypto powerhouse . Market watchers note that derivatives trading offers much higher volumes and revenue opportunities than regular spot markets. In January, Deribit was reportedly in acquisition talks with Kraken, with an estimated valuation of $5 billion, but that deal did not move forward. If Coinbase closes the deal, it could mark one of the most significant mergers in the recent history of the crypto sector. Social media commentators have taken notice of Coinbase’s strategy. Analyst Zach Humphries pointed out that Coinbase is building a “crypto empire,” especially by targeting the growing derivatives space. He noted that this market is where most of the volume — and opportunity — exists. At the same time, Deribit has faced some operational setbacks. Last month, it exited the Russian market due to EU sanctions , impacting its regional reach. A deal with Coinbase, a publicly traded company in the U.S., could bring stability and open up new pathways for growth. There are still no public details about the acquisition price or timeline. However, if the deal goes through, it would give Coinbase an immediate foothold in a space where it has previously lacked scale — positioning the company to compete more aggressively with global players in the derivatives space. As interest in crypto derivatives continues to grow, Coinbase's potential acquisition of Deribit may signal a broader trend of consolidation and expansion in the crypto industry, with derivatives becoming a key revenue driver for leading platforms.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-24 07:34:09

Increased Trust: Partnering with a major traditional bank like KB Kookmin Bank can boost confidence in Bithumb and the crypto exchange industry as a whole. Why is Banking for Crypto Important in South Korea? South Korea is a hotbed for cryptocurrency activity. However, navigating the regulatory landscape and securing reliable banking partnerships has been a persistent challenge for crypto exchanges. Traditional banks have often been hesitant to fully embrace the crypto sector due to regulatory uncertainties and perceived risks. This reluctance has sometimes led to hurdles for users trying to fund their crypto accounts or cash out their crypto holdings into fiat currency. The partnership between Bithumb and KB Kookmin Bank is significant because it signals a growing acceptance and integration of crypto within the traditional financial system in South Korea. It suggests that regulatory frameworks might be becoming clearer, encouraging established financial institutions to collaborate with crypto exchanges.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/top-analyst-says-xrp-mathematically-points-toward-10/,"Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker), a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, recently shared his insights on XRP’s potential price trajectory in a new market cycle. The analyst linked to a YouTube video where he used historical data, Fibonacci extensions, and the XRP-to-Bitcoin ratio, to outline a possible path for the altcoin to reach between $8 and $10, noting that the chart mathematically points toward this target range. XRP Price Chart Mathematically Points to $8-10 with XRPUSD and XRP vs Bitcoin https://t.co/R81AaGowVF — Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker) March 21, 2025 Price Target Based on Fibonacci Extensions According to Blockchain Backer’s analysis, XRP’s price movements align with historical Fibonacci extensions observed in past market cycles. In previous rallies, assets such as Ethereum and Litecoin have followed similar patterns, reaching 4.236 Fibonacci extensions from key breakout levels. Applying this method to XRP suggests a price target of approximately $8.68 to $10.40 at the next peak. The projection relies on a key assumption: Bitcoin’s price movement will guide XRP’s trajectory. If Bitcoin reaches an estimated cycle top of $127,000, then XRP achieving 8,200 sats (its value relative to Bitcoin) would result in a price of $10.40. If Bitcoin instead tops out at $116,800, the expected XRP price would be $9.57. Bitcoin’s Influence on Market Performance Bitcoin’s market cycle has historically dictated the performance of altcoins. However, Blockchain Backer pointed out that altcoins typically do not peak at the same time as Bitcoin but rather during its retracement phase. This means the XRP’s highest price would likely occur when Bitcoin is cooling off from its peak, rather than during Bitcoin’s all-time high. Furthermore, XRP’s price has followed a pattern of strong rallies when Bitcoin dominance begins to decline . This pattern suggests that the altcoin’s next major breakout could occur in a post-peak Bitcoin environment, as capital flows from Bitcoin into altcoins. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Realistic Expectations A significant factor in evaluating XRP’s potential is its market capitalization. Blockchain Backer emphasized that without an extreme Bitcoin rally beyond $200,000 to $300,000, XRP exceeding $10.40 is unlikely. The digital asset is currently trading at $2.28, and the projected increase of over 300% aligns with the historical altcoin cycle, making the $8–$10 range a reasonable target based on past performance. Notably, other analysts have also shared similar targets for the digital asset. If Bitcoin surpasses expectations and reaches significantly higher prices, XRP’s upper limits could expand. However, based on the current market structure and previous cycles, the $8–$10 range remains the most probable outcome.

However, he later realized he shared the news ‘too early.’ On Mar. 24, Chen apologized to users after admitting that he had revealed the news about the standalone wallet app “too early.” This is because the app is not yet available in some regions and devices. Moreover, he does not mention which regions are able to access the app during this time nor does he reveal when the app will be available for all users. “It may not be available for users in some regions and devices. Please be patient. My colleagues in the marketing department are going to scold me,” wrote Chen in a translated post . In a previous X post , Chen revealed to his followers that the crypto exchange has launched an independent app for its wallet service. According to Chen’s post, users can download the application by searching for it on the Google Play Store. “The bull is coming back fast! Open the app market and search for OKX Wallet to download the standalone OKX Wallet app,” said Chen, adding that it is not yet available on Apple’s App Store.

He also hints that “bigger features are on the way” for OKX Wallet.

42252850,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=717240,1742802307,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42252850.jpeg,"Dogecoin Is ‘Ready For The Next Big Move,’ Warns Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-ready-for-the-next-big-move/,"In a fresh market update shared on X, crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) presented a weekly DOGE/USD chart suggesting that Dogecoin could be nearing what he describes as a pivotal inflection point. He stated, “My Dogecoin Community it is about that time where I must provide you the Alpha you all desire. If we take a look at DOGE on the weekly time frame we can see that we received a weekly demand candle last week at the ‘Last line of bull market support’ that I pointed out a couple of weeks ago.” Analyst Sees Big Move Coming For Dogecoin He emphasized the significance of $0.139, calling it vital that Dogecoin maintain this level and explaining that, in his opinion, this zone represents a rare opportunity with “phenomenal” risk-reward potential. He noted, “It will continue to be absolutely vital that Dogecoin hold this level while it resets higher time frame indicators like the 3 Day MACD, Weekly Stoch RSI and 2W Stoch RSI all of which are getting very close to being fully reset.” By referencing these oscillators, Kevin underscored that Dogecoin’s momentum profile seems to be approaching a state in which downward pressure could dissipate and bullish forces could resurface. He explained that the Weekly Stoch RSI, for example, is already fully reset, and that the 3-Day MACD is “getting closer to fully resetting,” while the Two-Week (2W) Stoch RSI may still need around another month before it is aligned with the lower, reset region. This combination of technical conditions often attracts traders who regard such convergences as signals that a market may be primed for a marked price move. Related Reading: Whales Accumulate Over 120 Million Dogecoin In Past Week – Analyst Kevin framed his outlook by saying, “In my opinion this continues to be a spot where the risk reward ratio on Doge is absolutely phenomenal given that if we lose $0.139 durable on weekly closes you can cut your trades/losses but your upside potential outweighs your downside risk by miles.” In essence, he is placing the onus on Dogecoin’s ability to remain above $0.139 on a weekly closing basis, because in the event of a sustained break below that line, the bullish thesis could be nullified and traders would likely reduce or exit long positions. Kevin also tied the coin’s fate to the broader crypto landscape, making it clear that a resilient Bitcoin price would be critical if Dogecoin is to maintain its footing near $0.139. He stated, “As long as BTC holds these levels and does not lose 70K then I absolutely love this spot on DOGE,” which reveals his assumption that a weakening Bitcoin would threaten bullish altcoin setups. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces 1929-Style Reckoning, Bloomberg’s McGlone Warns Even so, he said, “If I were ever looking to properly allocate into Doge then I would definitely take advantage of this spot from a trade perspective,” reflecting his belief in the coin’s potential to remain stable in this range and potentially rally once those higher time frame indicators fully reset. This does not guarantee an imminent Dogecoin rally, but it underscores why Kevin believes the current market structure could allow for greater upside than downside, and why many traders and on-chain enthusiasts are closely monitoring these specific conditions. In summarizing his view of what may come next, Kevin explained, “From a holders perspective it is pretty simple. You have to hold $0.139 while these higher time frame indicators reset and get ready for the next big move.” This sentiment hinges on the notion that once these key momentum and trend-following signals swing from reset levels back toward an upswing, a rally could unfold if external factors (particularly Bitcoin’s performance) remain supportive. He has thus labeled the $0.139 zone as a make-or-break support level—one that, if breached on the weekly chart, could invalidate his bullish stance. If it holds, however, Kevin believes Dogecoin is “ready for the next big move.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.17534.

42252924,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142542,1742802327,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling Stablecoins: The Powerful Force Second Only to Bitcoin in Digital Assets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoins-second-bitcoin-digital-assets/,"In the ever-evolving world of digital currencies, where new projects and technologies emerge almost daily, it’s easy to get lost in the noise. But amidst this whirlwind of innovation, some voices cut through the static, offering clarity and insight. Recently, Dennis Porter, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community and co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, made a statement that’s resonating across the crypto sphere: stablecoins are second only to Bitcoin (BTC) in their importance within the digital asset realm. This bold declaration prompts us to delve deeper into why stablecoins are garnering such high praise and what it means for the future of crypto adoption and the continued rise of Bitcoin. Why are Stablecoins Considered Second Only to Bitcoin? Dennis Porter’s statement, shared on X, wasn’t just a casual remark. It’s a reflection of the growing recognition of stablecoins as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the often-volatile cryptocurrency market. To understand why they hold such significance, let’s break down the key aspects: Stability in a Volatile Market: The name itself gives it away. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This stability is a stark contrast to the price fluctuations often seen with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. On-ramp to Crypto: For many newcomers, the volatility of cryptocurrencies can be daunting. Stablecoins offer a less intimidating entry point. Users can familiarize themselves with digital assets without the immediate fear of dramatic price swings. Facilitating Global Transactions: Stablecoins enable faster, cheaper, and more efficient cross-border transactions compared to traditional banking systems. This is especially crucial in regions with limited access to banking infrastructure. Fueling DeFi and Web3: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Web3 ecosystems heavily rely on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, trading, and various other applications. Their stability is essential for the smooth functioning of these innovative platforms. Porter emphasized that wider access to dollar stablecoins could unlock the door for billions of people to participate in the digital economy. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about providing individuals worldwide with tools for financial inclusion and empowerment. The Dollar Stablecoin Advantage: A Gateway for Billions The focus on dollar stablecoins is particularly noteworthy. The US dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, and its widespread acceptance makes dollar-pegged stablecoins instantly recognizable and trustworthy for a global audience. Imagine the implications: Global Accessibility: For individuals in countries with unstable local currencies or limited access to US dollars, dollar stablecoins offer a readily available and reliable alternative. Simplified International Commerce: Businesses can use dollar stablecoins for international payments, reducing exchange rate risks and transaction costs. Remittances and Cross-border Payments: Migrant workers can send remittances back home more efficiently and affordably using stablecoins, bypassing traditional and often expensive channels. Savings and Investment: In regions with high inflation, dollar stablecoins can serve as a store of value, protecting savings from devaluation. They also provide a pathway for individuals to start saving and planning for future investments, including, as Porter points out, Bitcoin. How Stablecoins Positively Impact Bitcoin and Crypto Adoption Porter’s statement highlights a crucial link between stablecoins and Bitcoin. He suggests that increased access to dollar stablecoins is a positive development for BTC. But how exactly do these two digital assets complement each other? Enhanced Bitcoin Investment Strategy: For those looking to invest in Bitcoin, stablecoins provide a valuable tool for strategic planning. Investors can hold stablecoins during periods of market volatility and easily deploy them to purchase BTC when they see an opportune moment. Reduced Friction in Bitcoin Purchases: Using stablecoins to buy Bitcoin can be more efficient and cost-effective than using traditional fiat currencies in many cases. This streamlined process can encourage greater participation in the Bitcoin market. Expanding the Bitcoin User Base: As more people become comfortable with using stablecoins, they are more likely to explore other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Stablecoins act as a gateway, introducing a wider audience to the potential of the entire digital asset ecosystem. Dollar Users and Bitcoin Demand: Porter specifically mentions “dollar users” as major buyers of Bitcoin. By providing easier access to dollar-pegged stablecoins, the crypto market can tap into a vast pool of potential Bitcoin investors who are already familiar with and trust the US dollar. In essence, stablecoins are not just about their own utility; they play a vital role in fostering broader crypto adoption and strengthening the Bitcoin network. They create a more accessible, stable, and user-friendly environment for everyone to participate in the digital asset revolution. Navigating the Challenges: Regulation and Trust in Stablecoins While the potential of stablecoins is undeniable, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and concerns surrounding them. The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is still evolving, and issues of transparency, reserves, and potential risks need careful consideration. Key Challenges Include: Challenge Description Regulatory Uncertainty Lack of clear and consistent regulations across different jurisdictions creates uncertainty for stablecoin issuers and users. Reserve Transparency Ensuring that stablecoin issuers hold sufficient and high-quality reserves to back their pegs is crucial for maintaining trust. Centralization Risks Some stablecoins are centralized, raising concerns about censorship and single points of failure. Algorithmic Stablecoin Risks Algorithmic stablecoins, which rely on algorithms rather than reserves to maintain their peg, have faced stability challenges in the past. Addressing these challenges is paramount for the long-term success and widespread acceptance of stablecoins . Ongoing dialogue between regulators, industry players, and the crypto community is essential to develop responsible and effective frameworks. The Future is Stable and Bright for Digital Assets Dennis Porter’s assertion that stablecoins are second only to Bitcoin in importance is a powerful statement that underscores the transformative potential of these digital assets. They are more than just a stable alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies; they are a critical infrastructure component for the entire digital asset ecosystem. By providing stability, accessibility, and a bridge to traditional finance, stablecoins are paving the way for mass crypto adoption and unlocking new opportunities for individuals and businesses worldwide. As the regulatory landscape clarifies and trust in stablecoins grows, their role in the digital economy is only set to become more prominent, further solidifying their position as a cornerstone of the future of finance, right alongside the pioneering force that is Bitcoin.

With the Bitcoin price closing the weekly trade above the 200-day MA at $85,058, the altcoins have also gained immense strength. As a result, Ethereum price eyes a bullish close above $2500 while XRP is marching towards $2.5. With the top 3 cryptos gaining strength, here’s what’s expected from BTC, ETH, and XRP prices in Q2 2025. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for April 2025 From a wider perspective, the Bitcoin price has been maintaining a steep ascending trend regardless of the short-term pullbacks. The price is trading within a rising parallel channel and is trying hard to rise above the average bands of the channel. However, the bearish influence over the token has dropped to a large extent, which suggests a strong bullish continuation for the BTC price rally. The weekly chart of BTC shows the price has triggered a rebound before testing the previous highs close to $72,000. This indicates the prices were allowed to drop to accumulate at the bottom, and as a result, the star token underwent a strong bullish action. The weekly RSI has triggered a bullish divergence, while the weekly MACD shows a drop in the selling pressure after 6 consecutive weeks. This suggests the BTC price is gearing up for massive bullish action, aiming to form a new ATH. Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction for April 2025 Ethereum price has rebounded from a pivotal support zone around $1800, which mounted some confidence among the market participants. However, the bulls are trying to push the price within a crucial resistance zone between $2067 and $2169, which may validate a rise above the bearish influence. Meanwhile, the technicals trigger a bullish divergence but fail to validate it. Therefore, the upcoming monthly close is expected to be a pivotal one. As seen in the above chart, the ETH price has rebounded from the lower support of the decisive symmetrical triangle. The RSI has flipped from the lower threshold, while a rise above the MA may validate a rise from the bearish influence. On the other hand, the CMF has dropped and is about to test the crucial range at ‘0’, as a drop below the range may validate a bearish trend. Hence, the upcoming monthly close could have a large impact, as a close above $2300 may lay a strong foundation for an extended bullish trend towards upper targets. Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction for April 2025 The XRP price has been consolidating above the gains within a parallel channel after a magnificent rise of over 300%. The price is displaying massive strength and is trying to surpass the crucial threshold above $2.5, which could elevate the levels within a bullish zone. However, the technicals do support a bullish narrative as the XRP price is gearing up for another 300% rise and will mark a double-digit figure soon. The weekly chart of XRP suggests the token is consolidating within a bullish flag and the latest rebound from the support hints at a strong presence of bulls. Previously, the price remained consolidated for over 24 months and hence the price is expected to remain within an accumulated range for a few more days. The RSI continues to form lower highs and lows, while the DMI flashes no clear signals. Therefore, the XRP price remains within a bullish scope but may continue to remain consolidated below $3 for some time and later undergo a massive breakout beyond the range.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|ETH|XRP|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 07:46:02

With the crypto losing the brief $1 support, speculations are high among market watchers over the future performance of the asset. Amid this, a renowned expert has how Pi Coin might retain the $1 support. Pi Network Price Slips Below $1 Pi price today has traded at $0.9432, down 6.3% from yesterday and its one-day volume rose 12% to $284.36 million. Notably, the crypto has managed to soar past the $1 mark today in the last 24 hours, while dropping to a low of $0.9109. Besides, a Pi price prediction indicates that the crypto might slip to $0.71 in April. Notably, it appears that the recent decline comes due to a lack of any positive catalysts in the market. For context, the leading crypto exchange Binance hasn’t confirmed the listing on its platform, which has dampened the investors’ confidence. On the other hand, the lack of any major announcement from the Pi Core team has further weighed on the sentiment. What’s Next For The Crypto? According to Pi Coin enthusiast Dr Altcoin on X , the recent influx of unlocked Pi coins on centralized exchanges (CEXs) has led to a surge in circulating supply. To counter this, the Pi Team may need to burn an additional 60-100 million coins in the coming days. This move, which Dr Altcoin believes, could help drive Pi Network price back to the $1 mark. While investors remain cautious, Dr. Altcoin’s prediction offers a glimmer of hope for Pi Coin’s future. However, with the upcoming token unlocks and other factors, he urged investors to exercise due diligence before putting their bets into the asset. Pi Network Unlock Looms: Here’s All With the upcoming token unlocks, market watchers are speculating over the future trajectory of the Pi Coin. For instance, a total of 97.65 million Pi, worth around $93 million at the current price, will be unlocked over the next 30 days. The average unlock stands at 3.25 million tokens a day and the highest unlock will be around 6.8 million Pi coin on April 3. On the other hand, PiScan data showed that 115.57 million tokens will be unlocked in April, followed by 182 million and 222 million in May and June, respectively. Having said that, these massive unlocks might continue to add pressure on the token’s future performance. But, as Dr Altcoin suggested, if the Pi Core Team decides to conduct the token burns, it could help offset the pressure on the Pi Network price.

His optimism stems from expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon shift from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE), a move that could inject more liquidity into risk assets.

42253280,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142540,1742802953,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Guide: Key US Economic Events This Week,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/key-economic-events-crypto-impact/,"Are you ready for another week of potential market shifts? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, staying ahead of the curve means not just watching Bitcoin charts, but also keeping a close eye on broader economic indicators. This week is packed with crucial US economic events that could ripple through the crypto market . From Federal Reserve speeches to vital GDP and inflation data, let’s dive into what you need to watch out for to navigate the volatile crypto landscape. Decoding This Week’s Key Economic Events: Why They Matter for Crypto Why should crypto investors care about traditional economic events ? The answer is simple: interconnectedness. The cryptocurrency market, while operating on its own unique principles, is increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors. Decisions made by the Federal Reserve, for example, directly impact the dollar’s strength, inflation expectations, and overall investor sentiment – all of which can trigger significant movements in crypto prices. Understanding these events provides a crucial edge in making informed trading decisions. Federal Reserve Speakers: Gauging the Pulse of Interest Rates This week features a series of speeches from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. These aren’t just routine talks; they are opportunities to glean insights into the Fed’s current thinking on monetary policy, particularly regarding interest rates . Here’s a breakdown of who’s speaking and when: Monday, March 24 17:45 UTC: FOMC Member Bostic Speaks 19:10 UTC: Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Barr Speaks Tuesday, March 25 12:40 UTC: FOMC Member Kugler Speaks 13:05 UTC: FOMC Member Williams Speaks Wednesday, March 26 14:00 UTC: FOMC Member Kashkari Speaks Thursday, March 27 20:30 UTC: FOMC Member Barkin Speaks Friday, March 28 16:15 UTC: Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Barr Speaks 19:45 UTC: FOMC Member Bostic Speaks What to Watch For: Pay close attention to the tone and key phrases used by these speakers. Are they leaning hawkish (suggesting potential rate hikes to combat inflation) or dovish (indicating a preference for maintaining or lowering rates to support growth)? Hawkish comments can sometimes lead to a stronger dollar and potentially dampen risk assets like crypto, while dovish remarks might have the opposite effect. Keep an ear out for any hints about future policy direction, as this can significantly influence market sentiment. Thursday’s Double Whammy: GDP and Initial Jobless Claims Thursday, March 27th, is a day circled in red on many economists’ calendars, and it should be on yours too. At 12:30 UTC, two critical data points for the US economy are released simultaneously: GDP (QoQ) (Q4): This is the second estimate for the fourth quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. It’s a broad measure of the US economy ‘s health. Initial Jobless Claims: This weekly report indicates the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. It’s a timely gauge of the labor market’s strength. Why These Matter: GDP: A strong GDP reading can signal a robust economy, potentially leading to increased investor confidence in risk assets, including crypto. Conversely, a weaker-than-expected GDP could raise concerns about economic slowdown and trigger risk-off behavior. Initial Jobless Claims: Rising jobless claims might suggest a weakening labor market, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider a more dovish stance on interest rates . Falling claims indicate a strong labor market, potentially supporting a hawkish stance. Actionable Insight: Compare the released figures against economists’ forecasts. Significant deviations from expectations are what usually trigger the biggest market reactions. For example, a surprisingly strong GDP print combined with lower jobless claims could be interpreted positively for the US economy and potentially for crypto, at least in the short term. Friday’s Inflation Focus: Core PCE Price Index Wrapping up the week on Friday, March 28th, at 12:30 UTC, we get the Core PCE Price Index for February. This is a key inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve. Core PCE Price Index (Feb.): The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index measures the prices paid by people for domestic purchases. The “core” reading excludes volatile food and energy prices, giving a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends. Inflation and Crypto: Inflation is a critical factor influencing the value of fiat currencies. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often touted as a hedge against inflation. Higher-than-expected inflation figures could reinforce this narrative, potentially driving demand for cryptocurrencies as investors seek to preserve their purchasing power. Conversely, if inflation data comes in lower than expected, it might ease concerns about aggressive interest rate hikes and could still be viewed positively by the market , though the immediate “inflation hedge” narrative might weaken slightly. The Fed’s Stance: The Core PCE is arguably the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. If this data shows persistent or rising inflation, it strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to maintain or even increase interest rates . Conversely, easing inflation could give them room to pause or even consider future rate cuts. The market reaction will heavily depend on how this data aligns with, or deviates from, prevailing expectations. Navigating the Week Ahead: Key Takeaways for Crypto Traders This week presents a dynamic landscape for crypto traders. By carefully monitoring these economic events , particularly the Federal Reserve speakers, GDP, jobless claims, and the Core PCE inflation data, you can gain a significant advantage in understanding potential market movements. Remember: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on economic news releases and analyst commentary throughout the week. Context is Key: Don’t just look at the numbers in isolation. Understand how they fit into the broader US economy and global economic picture. Prepare for Volatility: Economic data releases and Fed speeches can trigger increased volatility in the crypto market . Manage your risk accordingly. Long-Term Perspective: While these events can cause short-term fluctuations, remember to maintain a long-term perspective on your crypto investments. By staying informed and understanding the interplay between traditional economic events and the crypto market , you can navigate this week with greater confidence and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities.

Keep your eyes peeled on the token unlock schedule as a significant amount of tokens are set to enter circulation. Notably, a massive token unlock event is on the horizon, with over $154 million worth of GT tokens leading the charge. Let’s dive into the details of this week’s key crypto unlocks and what they might mean for the market. Decoding This Week’s Token Unlock Schedule: What You Need to Know Token unlocks are a crucial aspect of cryptocurrency tokenomics . They represent the release of previously restricted tokens into the circulating supply. These events can impact a token’s price and market dynamics, making it essential for investors and traders to stay informed. This week, from March 24th to 30th, several projects are scheduled to unlock tokens, with GateToken (GT) taking center stage due to the sheer value and percentage of its circulating supply being released. According to data from DropsTab, here’s a breakdown of the significant token unlocks to watch this week: Worldcoin (WLD): 5.02 million tokens ($4.16 million) will be unlocked on March 25th at 00:00 UTC. This represents 0.42% of the circulating supply. Celestia (TIA): 998,404 tokens ($3.55 million) are scheduled for unlock on March 26th at 18:00 UTC, accounting for 0.19% of the circulating supply. GateToken (GT): The highlight of the week! A whopping 6.67 million GT tokens ($154 million) will be unlocked on March 26th at 00:00 UTC. This substantial release constitutes 7.77% of the current circulating supply. Axelar (AXL): 12.46 million tokens ($5.2 million) will be unlocked on March 27th at 05:00 UTC, representing 1.33% of the circulating supply. GRASS: 3.68 million tokens ($5.09 million) are set to unlock on March 28th at 00:00 UTC, which is 1.34% of the circulating supply. MAV: 54.31 million tokens ($4.4 million) will be unlocked on March 28th at 00:00 UTC, a significant 10.79% of the circulating supply. Echelon Prime (PRIME): 910,248 tokens ($3.44 million) are scheduled for unlock on March 30th at 00:00 UTC, representing 1.62% of the circulating supply. Optimism (OP): Rounding out the week, 32.21 million OP tokens ($27.54 million) will be unlocked on March 31st at 00:00 UTC, accounting for 1.99% of the circulating supply. Why is the GT Token Unlock a Big Deal? Among all the scheduled unlocks, the GT token unlock stands out due to its sheer size. A $154 million unlock is not insignificant in the crypto world, especially when it represents almost 8% of the circulating supply. Such a large influx of tokens can potentially exert downward pressure on the price of GT. Why? Because unlocked tokens are often distributed to early investors, team members, or advisors, who may choose to sell a portion of their newly acquired tokens to realize profits. However, it’s not always a straightforward negative scenario. Here’s a balanced perspective: Potential Price Impact: Increased supply can lead to selling pressure, potentially causing a short-term price dip. Traders should be aware of this possibility and exercise caution. Long-Term Vision: Token unlocks are often pre-planned and are part of the project’s tokenomics strategy. They can be designed to gradually decentralize token ownership and incentivize long-term participation in the ecosystem. Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment surrounding GateToken and the broader crypto market will also play a crucial role. A bullish market might absorb the increased supply more easily than a bearish one. Use Case and Adoption: If GateToken continues to demonstrate strong use cases and adoption within the Gate.io ecosystem, the market might view the unlock as a sign of growth and development, potentially mitigating negative price impacts. Navigating Crypto Unlocks: Actionable Insights So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights to consider when navigating crypto unlocks : Stay Informed: Keep track of upcoming token unlocks using resources like DropsTab and other crypto data providers. Do Your Research: Understand the tokenomics of the projects you are invested in. Know the unlock schedules and the reasons behind them. Manage Risk: Be mindful of potential price volatility around unlock events, especially for tokens with significant unlock percentages like GT and MAV this week. Consider adjusting your trading strategies accordingly. Long-Term Perspective: Don’t solely focus on short-term price fluctuations. Evaluate the long-term potential of the project and whether the unlock is a part of a healthy, sustainable token distribution strategy. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in the Crypto Game This week’s token unlock schedule presents both opportunities and potential risks in the cryptocurrency market.

On Mar. 23, Binance founder and former CEO opened a 24.7x leveraged long position on Mubarak (MUBARAK) with 0.04 BNB as collateral on APX Finance. The transaction was reported on X by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, to which CZ replied “Doing a little on-chain testing on Sunday, as usual. Nothing to be excited about.” Despite CZ’s downplaying, ai_9684xtpa reported that in the 7 minutes since opening the position, APX (APX) surged by 26%, from $0.64 to $0.081, while MUBARAK rose by 5.5%, from $0.146 to $0.154. The trade was conducted using a public donation address and the position has now been closed. https://twitter.com/ai_9684xtpa/status/1903851756364415027 This market reaction aligns with a familiar trend—whenever CZ trades or tweets, buying pressure follows. Recently, Zhao purchased 20,150 MUBARAK for 1 BNB (valued at $600 at the time), which sent MUBARAK surging , briefly claiming the top spot on BNB Chain’s memecoin rankings by market cap and trading volume soaring past $180 million, as reported by Root Data . However, Zhao’s perpetuals trade on MUBARAK was conducted as a test, as he later explained in his post on X, stating “Just trying the experience, also trying to see how if there is still MEV.” https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1903858760256307322?t=Bu9LhwnyUz5X6cFSFyVsdA&s=19 You might also like: New memecoin on BNB Chain MUBARAK up over 100% over the week, buoyed by CZ’s support Zhao has yet to share any findings from his testing related to Maximal Extractable Value. His perpetuals test follows his Feb. 7 poll on X, where he asked whether BNB Chain should eliminate or significantly reduce MEV issues. Although MEV is more commonly associated with the Ethereum ( ETH ) network, BNB Chain users have also faced significant losses due to MEV—where validators reorder or rearrange transactions waiting to be included in the block to maximize their profits. In 2024 alone, BNB users reportedly lost around $1.5 billion due to MEV.

XRP price is up 5% over the last seven days, rising 31% above its local low of $1.89 reached on March 11, as most crypto prices flashed green amid improving market sentiment. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: CoinTelegraph/ TradingView Let’s look at the factors behind XRP’s bullishness today. XRP rises in tandem with the crypto market The bullish sentiment was not only exclusive to XRP as crypto prices also rose across the board, buoyed by Bitcoin’s weekly close above $86,000 on March 23. Key points: Bitcoin ( BTC ) led the gains and was up 2.3% on the day to trade around $87,300. Ether ( ETH ) had gained more than 1.7% over the last 24 hours to trade just above $2,000. Other top-cap cryptocurrencies such as Solana ( SOL ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Cardano ( ADA ) also posted significant gains, as shown in the chart below. The global crypto market capitalization had increased by 2.85% to $2.84 trillion at the time of writing. 24-hour performance of top-cap cryptocurrencies: Source: Coin360 This performance is accompanied by a significant improvement in market sentiment over the last month.

Increased trading volume (up 54% on March 24) and buyer activity today underscore this sentiment shift, pushing XRP’s price higher. While not yet in ""greed"" territory, this improvement suggests the market is warming up, boosting XRP. Expectations of legal clarity after SEC appeal drop Perhaps the most significant catalyst for XRP’s price increase today is the positive impact of the SEC dropping its case against Ripple. This is it – the moment we’ve been waiting for. The SEC will drop its appeal – a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it. The future is bright. Let's build. pic.twitter.com/7WsD0C92Cm — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) March 19, 2025 In the protracted lawsuit , which began in 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security. This overhang suppressed XRP’s price and adoption for years as exchanges delisted the token. However, a pivotal development emerged when Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on March 19, 2025, that the SEC intends to drop its appeal . This news, widely discussed across crypto communities, has sparked optimism that the cloud of regulatory uncertainty could finally lift. Regulatory clarity would affirm XRP’s status as a non-security for retail sales—consistent with prior court rulings —and pave the way for broader institutional adoption and potential spot XRP ETF approval . Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the decision “provides a lot of certainty for Ripple” and that the case is effectively over. As reported by Cointelegraph, the SEC’s decision to drop the Ripple case provides no legal precedent , and the industry still has no legal framework it desires.

42253714,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142541,1742803527,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Alert: Altcoin Season Index Plummets – Bitcoin Dominance Surges!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-bitcoin-dominance-6/,"Is the crypto tide turning? If you’re navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency investments, you need to pay close attention to a key market indicator: the Altcoin Season Index . The latest reading is flashing a clear signal, and it’s pointing towards a significant shift in power within the crypto sphere. Buckle up, because we’re diving deep into what this means for you and your portfolio. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: What’s the Buzz? The Altcoin Season Index might sound like complex jargon, but it’s actually a straightforward and incredibly useful tool for understanding the ebb and flow of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a crypto weather vane, telling you which way the winds are blowing – towards Bitcoin or towards altcoins. This crucial metric, provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), helps traders and investors gauge whether Bitcoin is outperforming alternative cryptocurrencies, or vice versa. And right now, the index is shouting one thing loud and clear: it’s Bitcoin Season . Let’s break down the mechanics of this fascinating index: What it measures: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, to give a pure view of market sentiment. Timeframe: It looks at the performance of these coins over the past 90 days. This longer timeframe provides a more stable and less volatile view of market trends, filtering out short-term pumps and dumps. The Benchmark: Bitcoin ($BTC). The index essentially compares how well altcoins are performing against the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. The Scoring System: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. Index Score Market Season Condition 75 – 100 Altcoin Season At least 75% of the top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. 1 – 25 Bitcoin Season 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index stands at a mere 17, as of 00:30 UTC on March 24th. This is a clear indicator, according to the index’s methodology, that we are firmly in Bitcoin Season . The index even dropped a point from the previous day, strengthening this signal. Why Does Bitcoin Season Matter to the Crypto Market? Understanding whether we are in Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season is more than just market trivia; it’s a crucial piece of the puzzle for strategic crypto investing. Here’s why it’s so important: Portfolio Allocation: Knowing the prevailing market season can significantly influence your portfolio strategy. In Bitcoin Season , investors might lean towards increasing their Bitcoin holdings, anticipating Bitcoin’s potential dominance and stronger performance relative to altcoins. Risk Management: Altcoins are generally considered riskier assets compared to Bitcoin. During Bitcoin Season , the risk associated with holding altcoins might increase as they tend to underperform. Being aware of this allows for more informed risk management and potentially reducing exposure to higher-risk altcoins. Trading Strategies: Traders often adjust their strategies based on market seasons. In Bitcoin Season , strategies focused on Bitcoin trading or Bitcoin-paired trades might be favored. Conversely, Altcoin Season might see a shift towards altcoin-focused trading and exploring opportunities in smaller cap cryptocurrencies. Market Sentiment Analysis: The Altcoin Season Index serves as a broader gauge of market sentiment. A strong Bitcoin Season might indicate a flight to safety, with investors preferring the perceived stability of Bitcoin during times of market uncertainty or volatility. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Dominance: Actionable Insights With the Altcoin Season Index firmly in Bitcoin Season territory, what should crypto enthusiasts and investors actually do ? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Take a hard look at your current crypto holdings. Are you heavily weighted in altcoins? If so, consider rebalancing your portfolio to increase your Bitcoin allocation, especially if you believe Bitcoin Season will persist. Focus on Bitcoin Analysis: Now is the time to sharpen your Bitcoin analysis skills. Stay updated on Bitcoin price predictions, Bitcoin news, and factors influencing Bitcoin’s price movements. Understanding Bitcoin’s trajectory is key in a Bitcoin Season . Exercise Caution with Altcoins: While opportunities can still arise in altcoins, approach them with increased caution during Bitcoin Season . Thorough research and due diligence are more critical than ever. Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals and real-world use cases if you choose to invest. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: If you’re a long-term believer in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Season can present an opportune time to accumulate more Bitcoin through dollar-cost averaging. This strategy helps mitigate risk by averaging your entry price over time. Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto market is incredibly dynamic. Keep a close watch on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators. Be prepared to adjust your strategies as market conditions evolve. Challenges and Considerations During Bitcoin Season While Bitcoin Season presents certain advantages and strategic shifts, it’s also important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Altcoin Opportunities Still Exist: Even in a Bitcoin Season , promising altcoin projects can still emerge and thrive. Don’t completely disregard altcoins, but be selective and focus on quality over hype. Innovation and disruptive technologies can still be found within the altcoin space. Market Cycles are Inevitable: Crypto markets are cyclical. Bitcoin Season won’t last forever. Understanding market cycles and preparing for the eventual return of Altcoin Season is crucial for long-term success. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen events can dramatically shift market dynamics. Geopolitical events, regulatory changes, or major technological breakthroughs can disrupt even the most established trends. Remain vigilant and adaptable. Emotional Investing: Market seasons can trigger emotional responses. Fear of missing out (FOMO) during Altcoin Season and fear of losses during Bitcoin Season can lead to impulsive decisions. Stick to your strategy and avoid emotional trading. The Power of the Altcoin Season Index: A Summary The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful tool that provides valuable insights into the prevailing dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Currently signaling a definitive Bitcoin Season with a score of just 17, it underscores the present dominance of Bitcoin and the relative underperformance of altcoins. For crypto investors, understanding and leveraging this index can lead to more informed portfolio decisions, strategic risk management, and a more nuanced approach to navigating the ever-evolving crypto landscape. By staying informed and adaptable, you can position yourself to thrive, regardless of whether the crypto winds favor Bitcoin or altcoins.

Unfortunately, the bloated experiences that resulted from their well-intentioned integration of DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and gaming confused users and reduced interest. Originally promoted as a metaverse for social, gaming, and virtual real estate experiences, Decentraland’s attempt to integrate play-to-earn, DAOs, and NFTs led to a convoluted and slow user interface. In a similar vein, the Sandbox attempted to integrate social interactions, NFT-based assets, play-to-earn gaming, and land ownership. Although it was successful in creating hype, the technological complexity and learning curve made it unaffordable for the general public. When NFTs, staking, and edge computing were added, Theta’s original goal of decentralized video streaming was abandoned. Although Steemit presented the novel idea of a blockchain-based social media platform, users were eventually overwhelmed by its intricate staking procedures and curation incentives. Flow was intended by Dapper Labs to be a one-stop shop for decentralized apps (DApps), gaming, and NFTs. But developer uptake was poor, and the environment was disjointed. The “Ethereum killer” EOS, which attempted to support DeFi, DApps, and other things, is the last example. Although it had some success, its governance mechanism was still difficult to operate, and staking made it difficult to manage resources like CPU and RAM. Where did they go wrong? These platforms were characterized by poor user experiences and interfaces, a steep learning curve, excessive features, an unsuccessful attempt to offer an all-in-one Web3 solution or a combination of these downsides. Trying to be a marketplace, a game, a DAO, and a DeFi hub at once leads to scattered focus. Overly complex interfaces make engagement difficult, and mainstream users tend to struggle with concepts like staking, governance, and tokenomics. Web3 platforms that succeed hone in on a single, well-defined use case before expanding. They are full-featured, robust solutions that focus on a specific problem. A mission to simplify and improve user experience SONEX , an AI-powered decentralized exchange hub, was founded to simplify and improve users’ experience with top DeFi , making the segment more accessible across ecosystems. SONEX optimizes AI integration and provides automated trading and predictive analytics, giving users a more effective and potentially lucrative trading experience. With cross-chain integration, flexible solutions, and a ZK coprocessor, it achieves its goal. The modular solutions are designed for developers, guaranteeing uptake, while the coprocessor improves DeFi smart contract hooks for security, performance, and scalability. With data-driven insights, AI-driven strategies will maximize return and capital efficiency. By combining multichain assets with ease, SONEX strengthens its standing as a cutting-edge DeFi aggregator and fosters innovation. Beyond fulfilling its main purpose, SONEX’s status as the AI-powered DeFi hub on Sony’s Soneium blockchain allows it to benefit from the conglomerate’s vast resources, global presence, and technical expertise. Soneium has been dubbed “the entertainment blockchain” and combines blockchain tech with Sony’s entertainment portfolio to create more demand and markets for DeFi services. SONEX combines DeFi and GameFi , enabling users to trade digital assets while enjoying blockchain games, and the hub also hopes to become the leading memecoin launchpad on Soneium. Addressing complexity, security, and regulatory uncertainty While some Web3 platforms have done well for themselves, mass adoption of Web3 technologies will largely remain an uphill battle. Blockchain, as a super-complex technology, undergirds Web3. Cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and digital wallets are concepts that are not unfamiliar anymore, so they remain somewhat intimidating. This complexity spills over into the UI. In Web2, you just buy something online with a few clicks and your credit card information. In Web3, you buy cryptocurrency, load it on a digital wallet, and manage it there. That whole process is something only a highly tech-savvy person would be able to pull off. Uncertainties in regulation deter companies from investing in the adoption of Web3 technologies, as they fear change or complexity in law. Cryptocurrencies are at the center of any transaction in Web3, but with extreme volatility, they come with price fluctuations that have deterred many from using them. According to analysts, Trump has announced the intention of establishing a strategic government-backed crypto reserve to facilitate more effective regulation, thereby stabilizing the market rather than damaging it recently. This stability might be extended to crypto prices, as well.a Security remains a concern. The FBI recently accused North Korean-linked hackers of stealing Ethereum worth $1.5 billion from Dubai-based exchange Bybit. The theft was perpetrated by distributing cryptocurrency trading apps infected with malware. In a changing world of cyber threats, effective protection of digital assets requires the secure communication solution. Decentralized backup systems, which do not use mnemonics instead of phone number or email for authentication. End-to-end encryption ensures full security and privacy, preventing third-party access, including the security solution itself. Centralized systems hold undeniably sensitive content that removes the possibility of abuse and secures it from another centralized platform’s surveillance. Thus, all third parties are kept from accessing the content within the encrypted layer, including the security solution itself. Further, cryptocurrencies require different wallets, setting up a barrier to interactivity across ecosystems. Shared communication and common environment that allow interoperability are given by Polkadot and Cosmos. The development of interoperability enhances scale efficiency across systems, as many blockchains struggle with scale. Low scalability is majorly limiting for any technology aiming toward mass adoption, as it severely restricts the performance when handling high volumes of transactions. Thus, it is expected that the drop of transaction fees with Layer-2 integration like Soneium will open the availability of network use to more projects and ordinary users. According to a survey by Deloitte, 86% of senior executives believe blockchains are broadly scalable and will eventually go mainstream. Private and consortium blockchains are currently more scalable than public ones. The scalability of PBFT-based (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) blockchains is limited, while those utilizing delegated PoS enable scalable governance. Operators can simulate high-volume transactions (e.g., over 10,000) using Hyperledger Caliper or a similar tool to assess scalability.

The firm has been accelerating its acquisitions throughout 2025, adding 1,288 BTC in the first 11 weeks of the year. Details From the Latest Purchase According to a March 24 statement posted on X, the Japanese investment firm purchased the Bitcoin at an average price of $83,801 each. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin acquisition cost to $278.8 million, with an average purchase price of $83,224 per BTC. Metaplanet tracks its performance using BTC Yield, a metric that measures the growth of its Bitcoin holdings relative to its fully diluted shares. After surging 309.8% in Q4 2024, the metric has reached 68.3% so far in Q1 2025. The outfit has financed its purchases through stock acquisition rights via EVO FUND and zero-interest bonds. In March alone, it redeemed ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) in bonds ahead of schedule and issued another ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) in new bonds. This was used to fund multiple purchases, including 156 BTC on March 3, 497 BTC on March 5, 162 BTC on March 12, and 150 BTC on March 18. The goal is to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by 2026, a milestone that would make it the holder of 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. Market Reaction and Developments Reacting to the latest development, Google Finance data shows that Metaplanet’s stock is trading at ¥5,060, recording a 6.98% increase in the past 24 hours. The company also recently achieved a milestone, becoming Asia’s largest publicly listed Bitcoin holder and ranking among the top 10 publicly listed Bitcoin holders globally. Last week, it announced the formation of an advisory board, appointing Eric Trump as its first member. While it did not disclose specific details about Trump’s role, CEO Simon Gerovich stated that the board will consist of influential figures committed to advancing Bitcoin adoption. He described Trump’s appointment as a major step toward the goal of becoming one of the world’s leading Bitcoin treasury companies. The investment firm’s growth coincides with Japan’s shifting stance on crypto regulation. On March 6, the country’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) proposed lowering crypto capital gains taxes from 55% to 20%, marking a 35% reduction. The plan also seeks to classify crypto as its own asset class, separate from securities, under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.

On Monday, March 24, the CEX revealed plans to update the collateral ratios for CRV, UNI, ALGO, KSM, XTZ, and XEC crypto under ‘Portfolio Margin.’ As a response, market watchers speculate whether the assets’ prices are bracing for an impact amid modified trade offerings on one of the top trading platforms. Binance Modifies Trade Offerings For 6 Crypto; Here’s Everything To Know In a recent official announcement from the crypto exchage , Binance highlighted its plans to update the collateral ratio for the tokens mentioned above. Starting March 28 at 06:00 UTC, users are poised to witness a reduced collateral ratio for these assets: The New New Collateral Ratios For 6 Tokens: CRV – 85% to 80% UNI – 85% to 80% ALGO – 85% to 75% KSM – 80% to 70% XTZ – 75% to 60% XEC – 70% to 55% Binance further revealed that the update will conclude in approximately an hour from the mentioned time. Primarily, the updated collateral ratios induce lower borrowing power for traders and investors. This could in turn usher lower market interaction with these assets, igniting price concerns about long-term prospects. Also, the top crypto exchange notified users that the Collateral ratio will affect the Unified Maintenance Margin Ratio (uniMMR). Overall, the update promptly captured market attention as traders and investors looked to capitalize on any emerging opportunity within the sector. How Are The Crypto’s Performing? The abovementioned crypto assets trade dominantly in the gree, sparking speculations in tandem with Binance’s announcement. Curve DAO (CRV) price was up nearly 4% as of press time, reaching $$0.5137.

It’s the perfect time to dive back in, and Dawgz AI is leading the charge. As more traders from the Reddit community look for their next big play, this meme coin stands out with its AI trading and staking benefits that keep you engaged while earning. One investor recently shared, ""I didn’t just buy meme coins for fun, I bought Dawgz AI, and it's paying off!"" Top 3 Meme Coins With so many top meme coins emerging in 2025, it can be hard to pick the best meme coin to buy. While some are fueled by hype and community support, others, like Dawgz AI, stand out with true innovation and real earning potential. In this section, we’ll look at three meme coins currently grabbing attention, Dawgz AI, Bonk, and Dogwifhat, and why Dawgz AI is the one you should consider adding to your portfolio. 1. Dawgz AI: The Ultimate Meme Coin to Buy When it comes to meme coins with a twist, Dawgz AI stands out as a clear winner. Many meme coins are based solely on speculation, but Dawgz AI offers genuine value with its constantly running AI trading bots, which ensure that you're investing in a currency that will optimize your profits rather than just a meme.

Priced at $0.00001146, Bonk enjoys a market capitalization of $893.01 million. While it has a dedicated community, especially on Reddit, it lacks the innovative features of coins like Dawgz AI.

In a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, officials say they have recovered and cleared the title to $7 million of investment fraud proceeds using civil asset forfeiture. The Justice Department (DOJ) says that the government will now begin inviting the victims of the fraud to submit petitions to have those funds returned to them. Citing court documents, the DOJ says it uncovered a fraud scheme in which perpetrators used social engineering to lure victims into investing in crypto assets using websites that mirror legitimate platforms. “The social engineering involved the perpetrators getting to know the victims and earning their trust before introducing them to cryptocurrency investment ideas through the spoofed websites. These websites were set up to mimic legitimate cryptocurrency investment platforms, but funneled victim funds to the perpetrators through over 75 bank accounts in the names of shell companies. The sites falsely represented to the victims that their investments were making sizeable gains. However, when victims would attempt to make withdrawals, the perpetrators would coerce the victims to send even more money using tactics such as claiming the victims owed taxes on their purported profits.” The DOJ did not name any individual or organization involved in the case. US authorities began seizing some of the investment fraud’s proceeds from a bank account set up with a foreign bank in June of 2023. The US subsequently filed a complaint with a District Court to start the civil forfeiture process against the seized funds. The government ultimately reached a settlement, freeing up $7 million of the seized funds so it could be forfeited to the United States and given back to the victims.

According to the recent announcement, the firm has listed Bitcoin Core ETP (CBTC), the Solana Staking ETP (ASOL), and the XRP ETP (AXRP) on Nasdaq Stockholm. 21Shares Expands Reach With New Crypto ETPs 21Shares has expanded its European foothold with the listing of three crypto exchange-traded products on Nasdaq Stockholm. The asset manager, with more than $7.5 billion in assets under management, announced the listing, sparking market interest. According to the announcement, the products include low-cost Bitcoin ETP, a Solana staking ETP, and XRP ETF, which are primarily designed for both retail and institutional traders. The firm’s Head of Financial Product Development has lauded the update, highlighting this expansion as a key milestone for the firm. Meanwhile, she also noted that 2024 marks a crucial year for crypto adoption in Europe, driven by regulatory clarity under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Mandy Chiu stated : “As institutional adoption of cryptoasset ETPs accelerates and regulatory clarity strengthens across Europe, we remain committed to expanding our product offerings to meet growing investor demand.” A Closer Look Into 21Shares Crypto ETPs Bitcoin Core ETP (CBTC) As per the announcement, CBTC comes with one of the lowest management fees in Europe, standing at just 0.21%. This cost-effective approach might help attract more investors seeking direct BTC exposure. Solana Staking ETP (ASOL) ASOL offers a unique staking model, allowing investors to earn staking rewards while maintaining exposure to Solana. Solana’s blockchain innovations in gaming, finance, and identity security make it a valuable asset. Having said that, this ETP helps investors tap into the benefits of staking without the technical complexities. XRP ETP (AXRP) AXRP is fully backed by XRP, providing transparent and regulated exposure to Ripple’s native assets. Meanwhile, as XRP continues to play a vital role in cross-border payments, this ETP presents an accessible way for European investors to gain exposure. 21Shares: A Leading Name In US Crypto Sphere Apart from the European expansion, 21Shares has gained notable traction in the US. With the shifting regulatory stance in the US amid the global push for digital assets, the firm has gained notable traction from investors. Recently, Nasdaq has submitted 19-4 filing for 21Shares Polkadot ETF with the US SEC, which has caught the eyes of the investors. Besides, this latest announcement also comes as investors’ focus on the crypto products has regained momentum. For context, the US Spot Bitcoin ETF recorded an inflow of $785 million last week, after gloomy trading during the broader market retreat. Having said that, these new offerings might drive more investment and attract more traders into the digital assets space from the European region.

The country is keen on the digital assets market and is creating special tariffs to attract more crypto developers. Pakistan will use the surplus power, available at marginal costs, to build crypto data centers. The Energy Department of Pakistan has contacted various stakeholders to implement the plan. The country wants to attract more investors but needs to balance the power supply so that it will be in a good position to boost the crypto industry. Bitcoin alone is a power-intensive operation, using proof-of-work mining, estimated to consume 130 terawatts per hour (TWh), a rate greater than that used by some countries such as Argentina and the Netherlands. Pakistan has an estimated 20 million active crypto users and $20 billion in transactions. Its relatively young workforce has a lot of potential for Web3 development and a growing market for tech-savvy young entrepreneurs. The potential for growth in this market is promising and could be enhanced with governmental support. Awais Leghari, Federal Minister of Energy, met with Bilal Bin Saqib, executive of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), to discuss how crypto mining could use Pakistan’s excess electricity. Bitcoin mining can only work if electricity is affordable. The process consumes a lot of energy and reportedly consumes 60% of a miner’s income. Pakistan could offer attractive tariffs to bring down the cost of electricity. This move may attract more investors worldwide to invest in the new industry. 2021 China banned the mining industry, citing concerns about power consumption and environmental impacts. Many countries, such as China, have noticed Bitcoin’s high energy consumption and have introduced tariffs or banned the technology outright. In October 2024, Teheran faced multiple blackouts for weeks, with many citing mining operations as the cause. Iran offers electricity discounts for crypto miners but frequently shuts down operations with high electricity demand. Pakistan has a young working population, 60% of the 240 million population under 30 years old. The blockchain industry is popular amongst younger workers and may provide more job opportunities for people. The government wishes to engage with the PCC and get them to reach out to all crypto stakeholders in Pakistan, providing access to key individuals in the industry and creating a space for public officials to work directly with the private sector. The Pakistani government wishes to collaborate with the sector and encourage teamwork. “This is the beginning of a new digital chapter for our economy,” said a government official. We are committed to building a transparent, future-ready financial ecosystem that attracts investment, empowers our youth, and puts Pakistan on the global map as a leader in emerging technologies.“ Muhammad Aurangzeb, Pakistan’s Finance Minister, presided over the discussions, presenting the idea of leveraging the nation’s excess electricity with Bitcoin, converting liabilities into assets. Various ministers attended the meeting, including ministers for IT and law. In December 2024, Pakistan reported a $582 million account surplus, doubling the previous year’s surplus. Pakistan now wants to boost its economy even further by leveraging excess electricity. It wants to convert wasted electricity into economic wealth. However, it will need to strike the right balance between good regulation, energy supply, and well-built infrastructure. The World Bank, from the 2020 index, ranks Pakistan 108 out of 190 countries, citing excessive red tape, corruption, and inefficient regulation. Pakistan will need to create a fair playing field for crypto entrepreneurs so startups will succeed with minimal interference. In August 2024, Russia created a new law legalizing crypto mining. Russia has an abundance of natural gas, making crypto mining affordable. Individuals and businesses must register with the Russian Ministry of Digital Development before mining crypto. However, if the amount of energy consumption is below a certain threshold, an individual can mine without registering their operations.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|pakistan,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|MARKET|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-24 09:16:22

She encouraged Britons to invest their savings into shares instead of cryptos. Gordon described crypto investing as “a non-productive asset”. “It doesn’t feed back into the economy,” she said, according to The Times report . “It should terrify all of us that over half of over-45s own crypto and no equities.” Further, she said that the UK should tax crypto buyers and scrap taxes on stock purchases in order to boost the economy. “I would love to see stamp duty cut on equities and applied to crypto.” UK’s Rapid Crypto Adoption Rate Per FCA research, more than seven million UK adults – roughly 12 per cent of the adult population – now own crypto, with both awareness and average portfolio values increasing year-over-year. Bivu Das, UK general manager at Kraken noted that the UK is “on the brink of mass crypto adoption,” after the crypto exchange recently secured an EMI license with the UK regulator. The UK jumped from 14th place in 2023 to 12th place in 2024, per Chainalysis’ crypto adoption index , despite the Financial Conduct Authority’s scrutiny of digital asset service providers in the country.

According to a statement shared with Cointelegraph, Dohrnii Labs deposited 12,649.99 Dohrnii (DHN) tokens — valued at more than $500,000 — with Blynex. On March 23, the company said it used 8,650 of those tokens as collateral for a 30-day loan in exchange for 80,000 Tether’s USDt ( USDT ). Dohrnii claims the exchange never delivered the USDT. Furthermore, the team said Blynex liquidated its entire 8,650 DHN position on Uniswap, receiving 149,151 USDT and causing a drop in the token’s market value. Attempts to withdraw the remaining 4,000 DHN tokens were unsuccessful, the company said. Source: Dohrnii Labs Blynex claims it was automated risk management Blynex co-founder Mike Baskes told Cointelegraph the incident was part of their “automated risk management system.” Baskes claimed their system detected a high risk that the collateral would drop significantly in the event of liquidation. The Blynex executive said that when the tokens were sold, it only generated 145,000 USDT instead of its original amount. He noted that DHN token liquidity was limited, estimating just $315,000 available at the time of the transaction. The executive claimed Blynex took action to prevent financial losses: “Given this liquidity constraint, the system recognized a high risk of further loss if the collateral wasn’t liquidated immediately, as the tokens would be difficult to sell at a favorable price in the current market.” Dohrnii Labs has challenged that explanation, calling Blynex’s justification “misleading” and alleging that the exchange liquidated collateral worth nearly double the value of the loan. Related: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization project Dohrnii Labs threatens legal action against Blynex In response, Dohrnii Labs filed the police report in the UAE and threatened to take legal action against the crypto exchange. A Dohrnii Labs representative told Cointelegraph that the police report was only a “first step.” The representative said if Blynex ignored their communications, they would legally escalate the matter: “Since the project and the individuals responsible are based in the UAE, we are also getting in touch with local regulators, including VARA, ADGM, and other relevant authorities. Furthermore, we’re in contact with other affected projects and are actively exploring the possibility of joint legal action.” The team said they want to ensure accountability through the legal system and regulatory oversight. Dohrnii told Cointelegraph that Blynex attempted to settle the matter by offering them 80,000 USDT and allowing the withdrawal of 4,000 DHN tokens. However, the exchange added a condition that the platform would drop all legal action. “That is unacceptable,” Dohrnii Labs said. “The 4,000 DHN tokens in question are user deposits — not negotiable assets. The right to withdraw these funds should never be up for discussion,” Dohrnii Labs added.

Giza’s automated financial strategies Unlike traditional automated strategies, Giza’s agents do not merely follow instructions prepared in advance; rather, they make independent decisions based on the available data to optimize liquidity flows and financial strategies in real time. The impact of this model is already visible, with over $6 million in transaction volume being generated through these agents — a 6.08x increase in capital productivity index. Likewise, more than 21,400 users are already leveraging personalized treasury managers to replace the one-size-fits-all vaults decentralized finance ( DeFi ) has traditionally been known for. Finally, nearly 40,000 on-chain transactions have been executed without human oversight and with no security incident. The future of liquidity on Giza Giza is building a future where static liquidity is replaced by intelligent capital that enables decentralized systems to operate automatically and democratize finance . To realize this vision, Giza will rely on liquid restaking token (LRT) agents to optimize restaking strategies in real time as well as adapt to yield curves and risk thresholds. Memecoin agents, on the other hand, will act as hyper-responsive market participants to mitigate volatility and provide more structured liquidity. In addition, delta-neutral agents will be responsible for market-making and hedging strategies across fragmented venues, while protocol-specific agents will automate complex financial primitives. Ecosystem agents will embed intelligence directly into rollups, appchains, and layer-2 ( L2 ) networks to ensure sustainable market activity. The future of Giza Tech Giza’s broader vision for the future thus revolves around a decentralized economy characterized by autonomous financial intelligence. In other words, agent-native wallet integrations will replace traditional dashboards and manual inputs to remove the need for constant execution micromanagement. As a result, DeFi solutions will become more accessible, with a network of autonomous agents working behind the scenes to address all complexity issues.

42256753,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142642,1742808292,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Signs: Bitcoin Trend Reversal Unleashed as Selling Pressure Eases – Matrixport Analysis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-trend-reversal-analysis/,"Exciting developments are brewing in the crypto sphere! Are you feeling the market jitters lately? Bitcoin, the king of cryptocurrencies, might just be on the cusp of a significant shift. Leading crypto service provider Matrixport suggests that after a period of persistent downtrend, Bitcoin (BTC) is showing compelling signs of a potential Bitcoin trend reversal . Let’s dive into the factors fueling this optimistic outlook and what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. Is a Bitcoin Trend Reversal Truly on the Horizon? According to a recent report from JinSe Finance, Matrixport points towards a confluence of factors that are working in Bitcoin’s favor. These elements suggest that the relentless selling pressure that has characterized recent market activity might be finally abating, paving the way for a possible upturn. But what exactly are these factors? The Dovish Stance of the U.S. Federal Reserve One of the primary drivers cited by Matrixport is the evolving stance of the U.S. Federal Reserve. In recent times, the Fed has adopted a more ‘dovish’ approach to monetary policy. What does this mean for Bitcoin? A dovish Fed generally implies: Lower Interest Rates: A less hawkish stance often translates to maintaining or even lowering interest rates. Lower rates can make riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher returns compared to traditional fixed-income investments. Increased Liquidity: Dovish policies can inject more liquidity into the financial system. This increased liquidity can find its way into various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, potentially boosting demand for Bitcoin. Weaker Dollar: A dovish Fed can sometimes lead to a weaker U.S. dollar. As Bitcoin is often priced against the dollar, a weaker dollar can make Bitcoin relatively more appealing to investors holding other currencies. In essence, a dovish Federal Reserve can create a more favorable macroeconomic environment for Bitcoin to thrive. This shift in macroeconomic winds is a significant tailwind for a potential Bitcoin trend reversal . Trump’s Tariff Adjustments: An Unexpected Catalyst? Another intriguing factor highlighted by Matrixport is the impact of President Donald Trump’s targeted tariff adjustments. While seemingly unrelated to crypto, these adjustments can have ripple effects across global markets, indirectly influencing Bitcoin. How so? Economic Uncertainty: Tariffs can create economic uncertainty and volatility in traditional markets. In times of uncertainty, investors often look for alternative assets to hedge against risk. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature, can be perceived as a safe haven asset in such scenarios. Dollar Volatility: Tariff policies can impact the strength of the U.S. dollar. As mentioned earlier, dollar fluctuations can directly influence Bitcoin’s price dynamics. Geopolitical Tensions: Trade disputes and tariffs can escalate geopolitical tensions. These tensions can drive investors towards decentralized and borderless assets like Bitcoin as a store of value, away from traditional assets more susceptible to political risks. While the connection might seem indirect, Trump’s tariff adjustments introduce an element of global economic and political uncertainty that can inadvertently bolster Bitcoin’s appeal and contribute to a potential Bitcoin trend reversal . Easing Selling Pressure: The End of the Downtrend? Beyond macroeconomic factors, Matrixport points to internal market dynamics within the crypto space itself that are signaling a change. Specifically, they mention the easing of selling pressure. What does this entail? Quarter-End Arbitrage Selling Subsides As the end of financial quarters approaches, institutional investors and arbitrage traders often engage in selling activities to rebalance portfolios or realize profits. This quarter-end selling pressure can contribute to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. However, Matrixport notes that as the current quarter nears its end, this arbitrage-driven selling pressure is beginning to subside. This reduction in sell-side pressure can remove a significant headwind for Bitcoin, allowing for potential upward movement and a crypto market analysis indicating a shift in momentum. Low Funding Rates: A Sign of Reduced Bearish Sentiment? Funding rates in perpetual futures markets provide insights into market sentiment. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying short positions, suggesting bullish sentiment, while negative funding rates indicate the opposite. Matrixport highlights that funding rates are currently low. This can be interpreted as: Reduced Bearish Bets: Low funding rates can suggest that fewer traders are aggressively betting against Bitcoin. This diminished bearish sentiment can reduce selling pressure and create a more conducive environment for price appreciation. Potential for Short Squeezes: Low or negative funding rates can also set the stage for potential short squeezes. If positive catalysts emerge and the price starts to rise, short sellers might be forced to cover their positions, further amplifying upward price momentum. Low funding rates, therefore, are another indicator suggesting that the intense selling pressure might be waning, supporting the narrative of a possible Bitcoin trend reversal . Reduced Sell-offs: Are We Seeing Capitulation? Matrixport also notes a reduction in sell-offs. Large and rapid sell-offs often indicate panic selling or capitulation – a point where sellers have exhausted themselves, and the market might be poised for a turnaround. A decrease in these dramatic sell-offs could signify: Weak Hands Have Sold: Reduced sell-offs might suggest that the ‘weak hands’ – those more prone to panic selling – have already exited the market. This leaves behind a base of more resilient holders, reducing the likelihood of further sharp downward moves. Accumulation Phase: A period of reduced sell-offs can sometimes precede an accumulation phase, where strategic investors start to accumulate Bitcoin at lower prices, anticipating future gains. The observed reduction in sell-offs, according to Matrixport, adds another layer of evidence to the argument that selling pressure is easing, and the market might be transitioning towards a more positive phase, potentially leading to a BTC price outlook improvement. Will These Factors Trigger a New All-Time High? While Matrixport suggests that these improved market conditions might not be enough to propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high immediately, they do indicate a significant improvement in the overall landscape. It’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective. A crypto market analysis needs to be realistic. Table: Factors Supporting Potential Bitcoin Trend Reversal Factor Potential Impact on Bitcoin Dovish U.S. Federal Reserve Increased liquidity, lower interest rates, potentially weaker dollar – favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin. Trump’s Tariff Adjustments Increased economic uncertainty, dollar volatility, geopolitical tensions – can drive investors to Bitcoin as a hedge. Easing Quarter-End Arbitrage Selling Reduced sell-side pressure, allowing for potential price recovery. Low Funding Rates Reduced bearish sentiment, potential for short squeezes. Reduced Sell-offs Sign of potential capitulation, stronger holder base, possible accumulation phase. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what does this mean for you as a crypto investor? Here are some actionable insights based on Matrixport’s analysis and the current market conditions: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic developments, especially pronouncements from the Federal Reserve and global trade policies. These factors can significantly impact the crypto market. Monitor Funding Rates: Pay attention to funding rates in Bitcoin perpetual futures markets. Sustained low or negative funding rates, coupled with positive price action, can signal potential upward momentum. Analyze On-Chain Data: Track on-chain metrics like exchange flows and whale activity. Significant reductions in exchange inflows and accumulation by large holders can be positive indicators. Manage Risk: While the outlook might be improving, the crypto market remains volatile. Practice sound risk management principles, diversify your portfolio, and avoid over-leveraging. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, consider employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy to gradually build your position, especially during periods of perceived market bottoming. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Bitcoin? Matrixport’s analysis offers a hopeful perspective on Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. The combination of a potentially more dovish Federal Reserve, the unpredictable influence of global trade policies, and easing internal selling pressure within the crypto market presents a compelling case for a potential Bitcoin trend reversal . While the path to new all-time highs might still be some distance away, the signs of improved market conditions are undeniable. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, this could signal a crucial turning point – a moment to reassess, strategize, and potentially capitalize on the evolving dynamics of the crypto market analysis . Keep your eyes peeled on market movements and stay nimble – the crypto landscape is ever-changing, and opportunities often arise when least expected.

42256964,https://coinpedia.org/?p=436278,1742808561,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Key US Economic Events This Week: How They Could Impact Crypto & Stocks,https://coinpedia.org/news/key-us-economic-events-this-week-how-they-could-impact-crypto-stocks/,"The post Key US Economic Events This Week: How They Could Impact Crypto & Stocks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The US market is expected to witness several important economic events this week. Considering the fact that there are only nine more days to go before the activation of Trump’s reciprocal tariff plan, this week’s economic events will explain how prepared the US economy is to absorb the impact of the aggressive policy. Let’s analyze the top economic events of the week and how they will impact the cryptocurrency market. Ready? Top Economic Events in the US This Week S&P Global Manufacturing PMI On Monday, March 24, the US S&P Global Composite PMI Flash, S&P Global Manufacturing PMI Flash and S&P Global Services PMI Flash indices will be released. The Global Composite PMI Flash index slipped from 52.7 to 51.6 in February. The Manufacturing PMI index surged from 51.2 to 52.7, and the Services PMI dropped from 52.9 to 51 in the same month. The expectation is that the Composite index would drop to 51.5, the Manufacturing index would decline to 52.1, and the Services index would grow to 51.1. CB Consumer Confidence Data The Conference Board Consumer Confidence index, which measures the level of confidence consumers have in the economy, will be released on Tuesday, March 25. In the previous month, the index was around 98.3. The expectation is that it would decrease from 98.3 to 94.4 or even 94. A drop in consumer confidence can negatively impact stock markets, which could then spill over into the crypto market. New House Sales On Tuesday, March 25, the market will also witness some other impactful events as well. The release of the US New House Sales index is a prominent one that demands attention. In January, the index declined from 734K units to 657K units. The market consensus expects that the index would rise from 657K to either 660K or even 680K. Strong housing sales reflect a healthy economy, and a healthy economy can create a climate where investors feel more comfortable investing in riskier assets like crypto. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Up Today: Bitcoin, Altcoins Recover from Trump’s Tariff Shock , US GDP Growth Rate The US GDP Growth Rate QoQ Final will be released on Thursday, March 27. The market consensus expects that it would decline from 3.1% to 2.3% in Q4. A lower GDP growth rate indicates a slowing economy. This can trigger fears of a recession or economic instability. If the economy slows down, people are less likely to invest in risky assets. PCE Price Index The US Core PCE Price Index MoM, which tracks the changes in prices of goods and services purchased by consumers in the US (excluding food and energy costs), will be released on Friday, March 28. In January, it grew from 0.2% to 0.3%. The market consensus expects that the index would remain unchanged this time. In conclusion, these key US economic events will influence the cryptocurrency market through market sentiment and liquidity shifts. A drop in consumer confidence or GDP growth could trigger risk-off sentiment, reducing demand for crypto. However, strong housing sales and stable inflation data may encourage risk appetite, benefiting Bitcoin and altcoins. Investors should watch for market reactions to economic reports, as volatility could rise depending on actual data versus expectations. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While major institutions continue to embrace Ethereum for asset tokenization, on-chain data suggests a cooling in network usage — raising questions about how the protocol balances long-term utility, value capture, and its role amid the growing prominence of Layer 2 solutions. Fidelity Joins Blockchain Race with Ethereum-Based Tokenized Money Market Fund Fidelity Investments, one of the world’s largest asset managers with $5.8 trillion under management, is making a significant leap into blockchain technology by filing to tokenize one of its money market funds on Ethereum. This move aligns Fidelity with other financial giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton in a growing trend that is reshaping the traditional finance landscape through blockchain-based asset tokenization. In a March 21 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fidelity revealed plans to introduce an Ethereum-based tokenized share class — dubbed “OnChain” — for its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), an $80 million vehicle invested predominantly in US Treasury bills. The OnChain class aims to provide transparent, verifiable tracking of share transactions via Ethereum’s public blockchain, without altering the official record-keeping process maintained by traditional means. While regulatory approval is still pending, Fidelity noted that the OnChain share class is expected to launch on May 30, 2025. The OnChain initiative is not a direct tokenization of the underlying US Treasury bills themselves. Instead, it represents a blockchain-based layer of transactional transparency — akin to a mirror ledger — allowing stakeholders to trace movements of shares while maintaining the original ownership records through book-entry systems. Fidelity emphasized that the blockchain entries will not replace the official ownership ledger. Rather, a transfer agent will reconcile the blockchain data with official records on a daily basis, ensuring accuracy and regulatory compliance. The strategic embrace of Ethereum by Fidelity further cements the blockchain’s position as the network of choice for institutional adoption. Ethereum already hosts over $3.3 billion worth of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) — by far the largest share among all blockchain networks, according to analytics from rwa.xyz. Tokenization of real-world assets, particularly US Treasury bills, bonds, and private credit, has become a growing focus among asset managers in recent years. The market for tokenized Treasury products now stands at $4.78 billion, led by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which alone holds $1.46 billion in tokenized value. Franklin Templeton, another early mover in this space, has also made headlines by tokenizing parts of its money market funds. Fidelity’s entry into this arena not only validates the movement but also adds immense credibility to the thesis that blockchain technology is becoming integral to modern asset management infrastructure. Fidelity also hinted at future expansions of the OnChain platform to other blockchains, though Ethereum remains the centerpiece for now. Ethereum: The “Natural Default” for TradFi Tokenization The dominance of Ethereum in the tokenized asset space was recently reaffirmed by Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Crypto. Speaking at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on March 20, Mitchnick stated unequivocally that Ethereum was the obvious choice for launching tokenized financial products. “There was no question that the blockchain we would start our tokenization on would be Ethereum, and that’s not just a BlackRock thing, that’s the natural default answer,” Mitchnick said. He cited Ethereum’s credibility, decentralization, and security as key factors that give it a competitive edge in institutional adoption. His remarks signal a growing consensus in the traditional finance sector — Ethereum is not just a speculative asset platform, but the foundational layer for the next generation of financial infrastructure. Fidelity’s move may serve as a catalyst for more widespread institutional adoption of blockchain-based financial products. As trust builds around the technology’s transparency and efficiency, more funds — ranging from Treasuries to corporate debt and private equity — could find their way onto blockchains. Moreover, tokenized funds offer numerous benefits to investors, such as near-instant settlement, 24/7 trading, and improved liquidity, all of which contrast starkly with the friction-prone nature of traditional financial markets. As of now, the OnChain class is not available for direct trading on decentralized exchanges. However, the infrastructure being laid out by firms like Fidelity and BlackRock suggests that a future where tokenized assets are freely tradable across global markets — both institutional and retail — may not be far off. Ethereum Burn Rate Hits Historic Low as Network Activity Slumps In other news, Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, is showing signs of significantly reduced demand as network activity declines across the board. The amount of ETH burned on Saturday as part of Ethereum’s transaction fee mechanism hit an all-time low of just 53.07 ETH — a stark indicator of waning usage of Ethereum’s blockspace. This dramatic slowdown in ETH burning reflects broader declines in on-chain activity, with key metrics such as active addresses, transaction volumes, and new address creation all trending downward in recent weeks. The ETH burning mechanism was introduced with EIP-1559 in August 2021, a pivotal update that restructured Ethereum’s transaction fee model. Under the new system, users pay a base fee for each transaction, which is algorithmically adjusted based on network demand. Crucially, this base fee is burned — permanently removing ETH from circulation — with the intent to offset inflation and, during high usage, potentially make Ethereum a deflationary asset. However, the effectiveness of this mechanism is heavily dependent on network activity. The more transactions occur, the more ETH is burned. Conversely, during periods of low demand, the burn rate drops — and that's exactly what’s happening now. According to data from Ultrasound.money, based on current burn rates, Ethereum’s supply is now projected to grow by 0.76% annually — signaling a return to net inflationary dynamics. The low burn rate is just one symptom of Ethereum’s recent malaise. The seven-day moving average of active addresses has fallen to its lowest level since October 2024. Similarly, new address creations, daily transaction counts, and on-chain volume have all seen marked declines throughout March. These metrics point to a broad cooling-off period for Ethereum’s mainnet, despite the proliferation of Layer 2 solutions — scaling platforms built atop Ethereum to reduce congestion and fees. Layer 2s Gaining Traction — at Ethereum’s Expense? One factor in Ethereum’s on-chain slowdown may ironically be the success of its Layer 2 ecosystem. Platforms such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base (developed by Coinbase) have grown rapidly in scale and adoption, siphoning off transactions that would have otherwise been processed directly on Ethereum’s base layer. This shift has led some analysts to question the long-term economic impact on Ethereum’s mainnet. Notably, Standard Chartered recently slashed its Ethereum price target for 2025 from $10,000 to $4,000, citing the rise of Layer 2s and their increasing control over Ethereum’s transaction flow. While some see the decline in activity as temporary — perhaps a result of broader market cooldowns or anticipation of future upgrades — others view it as a structural shift in Ethereum’s role within its own ecosystem. As more users and developers migrate to faster, cheaper Layer 2 chains, the base layer risks becoming a low-volume settlement layer rather than a vibrant hub of decentralized activity. Still, Ethereum’s core developers have long anticipated this shift and continue to prioritize upgrades that will optimize the network’s role as a secure, decentralized foundation for scalable blockchain applications. The question now is whether Ethereum can continue to deliver enough economic value to support its long-term bullish thesis — particularly as competitors like Solana and Avalanche push forward with their own low-cost, high-speed networks. Ethereum’s burn mechanism was hailed as a game-changer in 2021, with early post-EIP-1559 burn rates triggering speculation about ETH becoming a “ultrasound money.” But as this past weekend’s record-low burn shows, the mechanism’s power is tied directly to user demand — and that demand appears to be fading, at least for now. Unless usage picks up, either via a broader crypto market rally, major application launches, or a new wave of institutional interest, Ethereum’s supply may continue to inflate — challenging a key pillar of the bullish ETH narrative.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-24 09:30:00

When ETH launched in 2015 at $0.75, it took years before skyrocketing to over $4,800, rewarding patient holders. Now, Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum after launching its presale. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale has sold over 60% and continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $4.5 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 6400 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06 while future forecast estimates predict a value surge past $5 in the near future. MUTM could be the fastest wealth-building opportunity in less than 5 months. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 6400 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $4.5 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $1 million to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. Ethereum’s early investors waited years for exponential gains, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an opportunity to achieve life-changing returns in a fraction of the time. With over 6,400 investors, $4.5 million raised, and a presale price set to rise from $0.02 to $0.025 before launching at $0.06, early adopters stand to gain up to 200%. Don’t miss out, join the Mutuum Finance presale today and secure your share before the next price increase.

33767162,[object Object],1742808638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto Watchlist: Key Coins And Catalysts To Watch This Week,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-watchlist-coins-catalysts-this-week/,"As the crypto market enters the final stretch of March, several pivotal events and developments loom large. From macroeconomic indicators to significant protocol upgrades and regulatory deadlines, here are the key points to watch in the week ahead. #1 Crypto Awaits February PCE Inflation Data – Friday All eyes in the crypto sphere remain on macroeconomic signals, with the release of February’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation figures scheduled for Friday, March 28. This metric is widely recognized as the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, and analysts say it could prove critical for short-term price action across digital assets. Economists predict core PCE (which excludes food and energy) to register between 0.3% and 0.4% month-over-month, translating to an annualized rate potentially near 2.6%–2.8%. As for headline PCE, forecasts suggest a year-over-year range of 2.5%–2.7%, with a monthly gain of around 0.3%. These projections come on the heels of January’s data (2.5% headline, 2.6% core) and reflect ongoing inflationary pressures spurred by, among other factors, tariff policies championed by US President Donald Trump. Should the PCE print higher than expected, it may bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to keep its policy rate elevated—signaling a potentially delayed timeline for any rate cuts beyond June. #2 Grayscale’s Spot Solana ETF – Monday Regulatory clarity around crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues to be a focal point for investors , especially in the altcoin arena. Two weeks ago, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponed decisions on several Solana (SOL) ETFs (including those by 21Shares, Canary, and VanEck). Now, the next deadline for the Commission to act on Grayscale’s proposed spot Solana ETF (GSOL) arrives on March 23. Grayscale filed in December 2024 to convert its existing Grayscale Solana Trust into an ETF, and NYSE Arca intends to list the product under the ticker “GSOL.” The SEC acknowledged an amended 19b-4 filing on February 6, which appeared in the Federal Register on February 18. #3 AAVE Buybacks Rumored To Start Decentralized finance (DeFi) mainstay Aave could see heightened price activity if rumors of impending crypto token buybacks pan out. Marc Zeller, founder of the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI), revealed that the governance proposal to revamp the Aave protocol’s tokenomics—known as Aavenomics—has passed quorum.Zeller said: “If the implementation, review & AIP vote is done on time, SAAVE buybacks will likely start this month.” The Aavenomics framework introduces a “fee switch,” enabling the protocol to share part of its revenue with staked token holders. A core component is a “Buy & Distribute” process, which, according to the proposal, would allocate $1 million from Aave’s excess revenue every week for six months to buy back AAVE tokens. These tokens would then be distributed to participants who have staked or locked their AAVE. Community support has been overwhelming, with over 813,000 votes in favor of the proposal against just three votes opposing it. Aave co-founder Stani Kulechov described the initiative as a “fee switch on steroids,” and Zeller called it the “most important proposal in ACI history.” Traders are now eagerly awaiting an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) vote for final implementation. #4 Ethereum’s Pectra Activates On Hoodi – Wednesday Ethereum developers continue their march toward enhanced scalability and functionality with the Pectra upgrade, scheduled to go live on the newly launched Hoodi testnet on March 26. Last week, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko confirmed the details: “A new testnet, Hoodi, has been launched to help wrap up Pectra testing. Stakers, this is your new testing ground Pectra will activate on it next Wednesday (March 26). Holesky will be maintained until September. It still works to test everything, except for validator exits.” Pectra , a combination of the Prague and Electra upgrades, aims to bring several significant features, including transaction batching, crypto gas fee payments in ERC-20 tokens, sponsored transactions, a higher staking limit, and blobspace expansion to improve scalability. If Hoodi’s fork is successful, mainnet activation could follow roughly 30 days later, potentially as early as April 25. #5 XRP Lawsuit – All Eyes On Ripple In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to drop its appeal against Ripple as of March 24, 2025, attention now turns to Ripple’s cross-appeal . Filed in October 2024, this cross-appeal seeks to overturn both the $125 million fine and the ruling that institutional XRP sales constituted securities offerings. With the SEC’s appeal off the table, Ripple must decide whether to proceed with its own challenge. If it does, its response brief is due by April 16, 2025. Should Ripple continue, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals will review the penalty and institutional sales ruling. If the crypto firm chooses to withdraw, the August 2024 judgment becomes final—meaning a $125 million fine stands, but no securities violation for programmatic sales. At press time, BTC traded at $87,330.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Crypto Watchlist|cryptocurrencies|Weekly Crypto Preview|Weekly Crypto Watchlist,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-24 09:30:38

Although Cardano (ADA) has long been regarded as a powerful competitor, its delayed price action and continuous network development issues make it less tempting than newly developing alternatives. Instead, three tokens— Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tron (TRX)—are offering profitable prospects. Now at less than $0.50, each of these cryptocurrencies could explode 34x, transforming a $1,200 investment into an astounding $40,800 before ADA ever targets $5. Rexas Finance (RXS) – The Top Pick for a 34x Surge Leading the charge among low-priced tokens, Rexas Finance (RXS) is drawing interest as a new platform bridging the digital and real-world asset (RWA) markets. With only a few clicks, the initiative lets users tokenize almost any real-world asset—from real estate and intellectual property to commodities and art—enabling worldwide ownership. This unique value proposition has attracted much investor interest, hence its presale, which is propelled through several stages with exponential expansion. Rexas Finance (RXS) has jumped over 6x from its starting price, generating an impressive $47.15 million. It is currently in its last presale stage at $0.20. RXS is scheduled to open at $0.25 on June 19, 2025; it has already sold at about 91.15% of the present stage. Experts estimate that given the fast demand, RXS will soar 34x post-launch and reach over $6.80. This makes a $1,200 investment prime potential for exponential development since it would become $40,800. Rexas Finance (RXS) has more legitimacy since Certik has thoroughly audited it, boosting investor confidence. The ongoing $1 million giveaway on its site, which already draws over 1.64 million entries, shows the project's increasing appeal even more. Rising in the vanguard of the RWA revolution and scheduled for a significant gathering, RXS is the best token to watch in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) – The Memecoin with a Strong Community After a minor decline, Dogecoin (DOGE) currently trades at about $0.19. Based on past price movements, DOGE can significantly increase during optimistic cycles. DOGE's expansion depends on its general acceptance and encouragement by influential people. DOGE payments are becoming increasingly integrated into companies, and as the crypto market picks up positive momentum, its price might skyrocket. Strong breakouts over critical resistance levels—about $0.26—could set off a 34x rally that would drive DOGE's price past $6.70. DOGE is still an excellent choice for investors seeking a well-known but very explosive asset. Although ADA's slow ascent toward $5 could take longer, DOGE's volatility offers quick returns that might turn a $1,200 investment into $40,800 should the historical trend repeat. Tron (TRX) – The Blockchain Powerhouse with Steady Growth TRX has established a firm basis with actual use cases, unlike other cryptocurrencies that primarily rely on hype, especially in the digital entertainment and decentralized finance (DeFi) industries. TRX, which is currently trading at $0.24, has maintained a positive trend and increased by 7.84% over the week. It's growing acceptance and almost $700 million of 24-hour trading activity indicate great market confidence. Tron's blockchain's rising usage for DeFi protocols and stablecoin transactions highlights its long-term viability even more. Under appropriate market conditions, TRX might have a breakout that increases its price 34x, above $8.10. This would reflect the spectacular rises of past bull runs, enabling investors to turn a $1,200 investment into an impressive $40,800. With its solid technical basis and continuous advancements, TRX is a potential cryptocurrency worth looking at for significant returns. Conclusion Although Cardano (ADA) has the potential to reach $5, its slower growth rate makes it less tempting to investors looking for quick gains. For a 34x surge in the near term, Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tron (TRX) stand out as the best choices. Among these, Rexas Finance (RXS) is the most exciting because of its creative real-world asset tokenizing approach, excellent presale performance, and forthcoming launch at $0.25. RXS provides the best chance to turn a $1,200 investment into $40,800 since professionals estimate a jump over $6.80. Securing holdings in these three tokens before their expected breakouts will help those wishing to profit from the forthcoming crypto bull run maximize returns.

Bitcoin Surpasses $87,000 as Trump Tariff Concerns Ease Bitcoin (BTC) rose 3.29% to $87,300, reaching its highest level since March 7. Ethereum (ETH) also gained 3.2% to cross the $2,000 threshold and trade at $2,079.

The administration’s softened stance has eased fears of an all-out trade war, providing support for risk assets including cryptocurrencies and stocks. “Crypto markets are rallying as investors respond positively to Trump’s more cooperative stance on tariffs set to go into effect on April 2 and the Federal Reserve’s focus on long-term inflation trends,” said Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research. Economic Data Boosts Investor Confidence Recent economic indicators have also reassured investors that the U.S. economy remains resilient despite concerns about tariffs. Key data highlights include: US Jobless Claims: Increased slightly by 2,000 to 223,000, indicating that the labor market remains strong. February Inflation Data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed inflation slowing to 2.8%, a positive sign for Federal Reserve policy expectations. *This is not investment advice.

The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” wrote Trump in his recent post. Not long after Trump published his post, the token spiked more than 10%, hitting a high of $12.25. The token had previously been in a slump, only managing to reach around $10 in the days leading up to the spike. However, the high did not last long. The token retreated below $12 not long after the hype died down. During this decline, a whale lost $207,000 after spending $5 million USDC ( USDC ) to buy a large chunk of $TRUMP tokens, only to sell them an hour later, according to on-chain data from Lookonchain. The whale is well-known in the crypto community for making a profit of $108 million in the early days following the Trump token’s launch, when it bought 5.97 million $TRUMP worth $1.09 million USDC. Last week, Trump delivered a virtual address at Blockworks’ Digital Assets Summit in New York. In his speech, he talked about the importance of stablecoin regulations, the strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, and the negative impact of crypto debanking.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-flashes-td-sequential-buy-signal-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst Ali recently highlighted a TD Sequential buy signal on XRP’s four-hour chart, signaling a potential short-term price rebound. The appearance of a buy signal suggests that the ongoing downward momentum may be weakening, which could lead to a recovery. Ali shared a chart of XRP/USDT on Binance, showcasing the formation of the buy signal and hinting that the asset might be preparing for a bounce. He stated that this could mark the beginning of a short-term uptrend, drawing attention from traders monitoring XRP’s price movements. $XRP just flashed a TD Sequential buy signal on the 4-hour chart. This could be the start of a short-term rebound pic.twitter.com/PXERVCxbPI — Ali (@ali_charts) March 22, 2025 Market Reactions Remain Divided Despite the technical buy signal, the reaction from the crypto community was mixed. Some traders were skeptical, arguing that XRP has struggled to sustain meaningful rallies and that selling pressure remains a major hurdle. One user pointed out that XRP often experiences short-lived price increases but usually vanishes within 48 hours, making it difficult for the asset to maintain an upward trajectory. They also mentioned that significant supply above the $2.50 level acts as strong resistance, limiting XRP’s ability to break higher. Others echoed concerns about the broader market environment, emphasizing that current conditions do not support an explosive bull run. They argued that XRP’s price movements have become highly volatile, resembling a pattern of quick spikes followed by equally rapid declines. This sentiment reflects a broader uncertainty among traders regarding whether XRP can sustain any recovery soon. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ali responded to the skepticism by pointing to XRP’s historical price performance, reminding traders that the asset had previously surged from $0.40 to $3.40. He suggested that such a price increase was a clear example of an explosive rally, contradicting claims that XRP no longer has the potential for strong upward moves. Current Market Conditions and Outlook Despite the TD Sequential buy signal, XRP has not shown any strong signs of a reversal. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is currently trading at $2.36, reflecting a 1.69% decline in the last 24 hours. The price action remains subdued, with the asset hovering around a key support level. While some traders see the TD Sequential signal as a reason for optimism, others remain cautious, noting that XRP has struggled to break through resistance in recent weeks. The broader market sentiment could aid in determining whether XRP can sustain any potential rebound. If Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies fail to maintain strength, XRP could face continued pressure. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Ripple is making waves again, but some investors are turning their attention to Remittix, a next-gen payment solution promising faster transactions, lower fees, and a potential 5000% rally. Table of Contents Ripple: Is the long-awaited breakout finally coming? Remittix redefines cross-border transactions Investors secure their RTX tokens Ripple (XRP) is back in the headlines, with analysts throwing out bold predictions of a surge to $9 or even $10 in 2025. With legal clouds clearing and payment adoption rising, XRP finally seems poised for a serious breakout. But as hype builds, many investors are looking past Ripple and eyeing what some are calling its more scalable, next-gen rival: Remittix (RTX). With faster transactions, lower fees, and a PayFi model designed for practical real-world use, Remittix is aiming to leap ahead. And with talk of a potential 5000% rally, it might just pull it off. Ripple: Is the long-awaited breakout finally coming? Ripple has been hovering in the shadows for a while, but it might be ready to step into the spotlight after a 4.8% lift in the last week. After clearing most of its legal mess with the SEC, Ripple is starting to look like a legit comeback story. It’s still trading well below its all-time high, but analysts over at FXStreet recently pointed to a bullish setup that could send XRP flying toward the $9–$10 range in 2025, especially if macro trends stay in its favor. On the tech side, Ripple is doubling down on cross-border payment infrastructure with enhanced Liquidity Hub integrations and CBDC collaborations, aiming to make XRP the go-to bridge asset for institutional money. They’re also working on upgrading the XRPL’s smart contract capabilities to compete more directly with Ethereum and Solana. If those features roll out smoothly and adoption picks up, Ripple might finally deliver on the potential it’s been teasing for years. Still, with competition heating up, it’s now or never.

Remittix redefines cross-border transactions Crypto has long been marketed as the future of money, yet spending digital assets remains inconvenient and costly. That’s where Remittix is doing things differently. By providing instant crypto-to-FIAT conversion, Remittix allows users to send funds directly to any bank account without delays, hidden costs, or unnecessary complications. For Luis, a freelancer in Argentina, these issues meant that his stablecoin salary from international clients was stuck in processing before he could access it in Pesos. Now, with Remittix, he receives his funds instantly, avoiding the wait and hidden fees. Similarly, Rachel, an expat in Germany, previously had to pay high remittance fees just to send money back home to her family in the Philippines. With Remittix, she now transfers stablecoins, and her family receives Pesos in their bank account within hours, without losing a large chunk to intermediaries. With financial institutions increasing their grip on transaction monitoring, more users are seeking ways to move their money securely and privately. Remittix provides a solution that prioritizes user control. When transactions are processed through Remittix, the recipient receives a standard bank deposit with no visible connection to cryptocurrency, allowing for greater financial privacy without interference. For individuals in regions with heavy banking restrictions, this feature offers a valuable way to maintain control over personal finances. Investors secure their RTX tokens With over $14 million already raised, the Remittix presale is moving quickly, and RTX tokens remain available at $0.0734 for now. Analysts anticipate an 800% increase before the presale concludes, with a further rally expected after the launch. As blockchain payments become a mainstream necessity, Remittix is primed to capitalize on this shift, providing a frictionless bridge between crypto and real-world finance. For investors hoping to stay ahead of the curve, this certainly isn’t a project to overlook in 2025. To learn more about Remittix, visit its website and socials.

Crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto recently highlighted this development , pointing out that XRP is on track to complete a Full Body Candle formation for the quarterly close. If this scenario unfolds as predicted, it will mark a significant moment in XRP’s price history, signaling strong bullish momentum. EGRAG Crypto’s analysis is based on a linear regression framework applied to a logarithmic scale. It forecasts potential price targets for XRP between $6.4 and $27.5 by March or November 2025. This projection is rooted in technical indicators such as Fibonacci retracement levels, historical price movements, and momentum shifts in the broader cryptocurrency market. #XRP – Quarterly Close: In the next 7 days, #XRP is on track to complete a Full Body Candle formation for the quarterly close (Q1 2025), marking its first-ever all-time high in the history of #XRP ! ………………. and you wonder why I’m so #bullish ! #XRPFamily STAY… pic.twitter.com/HM6pmPKi9w — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 23, 2025 XRP’s Current Market Performance As of report time, XRP trades around $2.46, with intraday price swings between $2.39 and $2.47. This upward momentum aligns with EGRAG Crypto’s previous forecasts, suggesting that XRP could enter a significant price discovery phase. The cryptocurrency market, particularly assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, has witnessed renewed bullish activity, further strengthening the case for XRP’s continued growth. As capital flows into the market, XRP’s ability to sustain its bullish trajectory will depend on various factors, including investor sentiment, liquidity, and technical support levels. Key Factors Driving XRP’s Bullish Momentum Regulatory Clarity and Legal Developments: One of the most significant drivers behind XRP’s bullish momentum is its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple, the company behind XRP, has been engaged in a high-profile lawsuit regarding whether XRP should be classified as a security. Recent legal victories for Ripple have improved market confidence. Technological Advancements and Ecosystem Growth: Beyond legal battles, XRP’s technological evolution is another major factor influencing its price trajectory. Ripple launched RLUSD , a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar on the XRP Ledger. This move will enhance liquidity, facilitate cross-border payments, and improve XRP’s utility within the crypto ecosystem. Furthermore, the XRP Ledger’s continued development—including enhancements to on-chain liquidity, smart contracts, and interoperability with other blockchain networks—positions XRP as a key player in the digital finance landscape. These advancements could further solidify XRP’s role as a bridge asset for global financial institutions. Market Sentiment and Institutional Interest The broader cryptocurrency market has seen a resurgence in institutional interest, with major firms increasing their exposure to digital assets. XRP, in particular, has attracted attention due to its unique use case in cross-border payments. Historically, XRP has been recognized for its ability to facilitate fast, low-cost international transactions, making it a valuable asset for financial institutions seeking efficient payment solutions. With increasing global adoption of blockchain-based financial services, XRP’s value proposition is becoming more attractive to institutional investors.

Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite recent legal victories, the regulatory landscape for XRP remains uncertain. Any unexpected setbacks in Ripple’s legal proceedings could negatively impact price momentum. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and price fluctuations are common. A sudden shift in market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, or Bitcoin’s price action could influence XRP’s trajectory. Competitive Landscape: While XRP holds a strong position in the payment sector, competition from emerging blockchain projects could impact its adoption rate and market dominance. A Defining Moment for XRP As XRP approaches its Q1 2025 quarterly close, it stands on the verge of making history with its first-ever all-time high at a quarterly level. EGRAG Crypto’s projections, supported by technical analysis, regulatory progress, and ecosystem growth, suggest that XRP could be poised for a transformative phase. However, while the technical indicators and market conditions point toward a bullish scenario, investors should remain cautious and well-informed. Given cryptocurrencies’ inherent volatility, conducting thorough research and maintaining a balanced investment approach is essential. Whether XRP successfully closes the quarter with a full-body candle and reaches new price heights remains to be seen. But one thing is sure—this moment could be a turning point in XRP’s history.

On-chain indicators are also showing strength with ETH exchange supplies falling significantly. Ethereum Price Recovery Very Soon? Renowned crypto analyst Crypto Patel stated that Ethereum’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached extreme oversold levels. Previously, only on two such occasions, the ETH RSI has hit these low levels. “This oversold signal has consistently preceded massive multi-week rallies,” Patel noted in a recent statement. Source: Crypto Patel As Ethereum continues to trade below key resistance levels, this historical trend suggests the potential for a substantial price rebound in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the analyst has advised investors to buy every dip ahead. “Accumulate every dip between $2,000 and $1,300,” Patel advised. He said that this range provides a significant buying opportunity for long-term investors. Thus, he laid out a bullish roadmap for Ethereum price, targeting a price of $12,000. ETH On-Chain Metrics Show Strength The strength in ETH’s on-chain metrics has helped the Ethereum price reclaim $2,000 levels recently. As of press time, ETH price is trading at $2,082 with daily trading volumes surging 60.6% to over $10.89 billion. Furthermore, the Coinglass data shows that the ETH futures open interest has surged 6.66% to $21.61 billion. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has reported a significant surge in Ethereum (ETH) whale activity. Over the past week, large investors have accumulated approximately 470,000 ETH, reflecting strong confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. This surge in the whale accumulation shows heightened interest in Ethereum among institutional players. Source: Ali Martinez Additionally, Martinez also stated that more than 1.2 million ETH coins have left exchanges over the past 48 days. This comes amid the heightened demand for ETH staking in recent times. ETH Downside Remains Protected On the other hand, the downside for Ethereum remains protected amid heavy accumulation for the altcoin. On-chain data reveals that more than 3 million investors have accumulated 6.12 million Ethereum (ETH) in the price range of $1,886 to $1,944. This activity establishes this range as a critical support level for Ethereum price. Markets analyst have shared an ETH price prediction expecting ETH to flirt above $2,000 for the next month before any decisive rally ahead. Source: Ali Martinez Market analysts are closely monitoring the ETH/BTC pair for signs of a rebound. Interestingly, flipping the chart reveals a potential Adam & Eve pattern forming. If this pattern is confirmed, the ETH/BTC pair could target 0.0019 Bitcoin per Ethereum, said Martinez.

42257562,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142607,1742809536,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Concerns Emerge: Korea’s Opposition Flags Crypto Exchange Delisting Power as Conflict of Interest,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/korea-crypto-exchange-delisting-concerns/,"Is the power to delist cryptocurrencies too concentrated in the hands of exchanges? In South Korea, this question is sparking a heated debate, with the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), stepping into the ring. They’re raising serious red flags about the potential conflict of interest inherent in crypto exchanges’ ability to remove tokens from their platforms. Let’s dive into why this is a crucial issue for the Korean crypto market and what it could mean for investors. Unpacking the Controversy: Crypto Exchange Delisting Power Under Scrutiny At the heart of the matter is the significant authority wielded by crypto exchanges in South Korea. DPK lawmaker Min Byoung-dug voiced these concerns directly at a National Assembly meeting on March 24th, emphasizing that the power to delist tokens raises fundamental questions about the fairness and transparency of exchange operations. This isn’t just about theoretical concerns; it’s about real-world impact on investors and the integrity of the Korean crypto market . Here’s a breakdown of the key points raised by the DPK: Conflict of Interest: The core argument is that exchanges, by having the power to delist tokens, might be influenced by their own financial interests or biases, potentially harming investors who hold those tokens. Lack of Transparency: The criteria and processes for delisting tokens are often opaque, leading to uncertainty and a lack of accountability. Market Dominance: The concentration of power in a few major exchanges amplifies these concerns, as their decisions can have a disproportionate impact on the entire market. Lawmaker Kang Jun-hyeon further highlighted the structural imbalance within the Korean crypto landscape. He pointed out that while crypto investments are primarily accessible to individuals, the real power lies firmly with the exchanges. This creates a scenario where retail investors are potentially vulnerable to decisions made by centralized entities. This imbalance is a critical aspect of the ongoing discussion around South Korea crypto regulation . Why is Crypto Exchange Delisting a Problem? Delisting isn’t just a procedural matter; it can have significant consequences for token holders. Imagine investing in a cryptocurrency, only to find out it’s being delisted from a major exchange. What could happen? Price Crash: Delisting often triggers a sharp decline in the token’s price as investors rush to sell before trading ceases on the exchange. Liquidity Issues: Once delisted, it becomes harder to trade the token, leading to liquidity problems and making it difficult to sell at a fair price. Loss of Investment: In extreme cases, especially for smaller or less liquid tokens, delisting can lead to significant or even total loss of investment for holders. Erosion of Trust: Frequent or seemingly arbitrary delistings can erode trust in the crypto market and exchanges themselves. These potential downsides underscore the importance of clear, fair, and transparent delisting processes. It’s not just about protecting investors financially; it’s about fostering a healthy and sustainable opposition party crypto ecosystem. What’s Next for Crypto Regulation in South Korea? The DPK’s criticism signals a growing political awareness of the issues within the crypto sector in South Korea. This could be a precursor to more stringent South Korea crypto regulation aimed at: Enhanced Transparency: Demanding exchanges to publicly disclose their delisting criteria and processes. Independent Oversight: Exploring the possibility of an independent body to oversee delisting decisions, reducing potential conflicts of interest. Investor Protection Measures: Implementing stronger safeguards to protect investors from the negative impacts of delisting. Fair Market Practices: Promoting fair competition and preventing excessive concentration of power within the crypto exchange industry. The debate around crypto exchange delisting power is part of a broader global conversation about regulating the cryptocurrency industry. As crypto adoption grows, governments worldwide are grappling with how to balance innovation with investor protection and market stability. South Korea, being a major player in the crypto space, is at the forefront of these discussions. The stance taken by the opposition party indicates a potential shift towards stricter oversight, aiming to create a more equitable and trustworthy environment for crypto in the nation. The coming months could be pivotal for the future of Korean crypto market regulation. Whether the DPK’s concerns will translate into concrete policy changes remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the spotlight is now firmly on crypto exchange practices, and the pressure for greater transparency and accountability is mounting.

He built a company in the ‘80s, gave his product away for free, turned that into a fortune, walked away, and then spent decades running from governments, building private compounds, hacking police, dodging assassination attempts, and predicting his own death. On June 23, 2021, Spanish authorities found him dead in a prison cell after the United States requested his extradition for tax evasion. He was 75. Johnny was born in 1945 in England and raised in Virginia, where his father, a violent alcoholic, died by gunshot when John was 15. John found the body himself. The story people don’t tell is that some believe John pulled the trigger. Nobody could prove it. What’s confirmed is that he was already brilliant. In the 1960s, NASA brought him on to work on the Apollo missions. While others were just learning to type, John was coding software that helped launch astronauts to the moon. McAfee created antivirus, became rich, then disappeared In the 1980s, John was working at Lockheed Martin, drinking hard but still ahead of his peers in tech. In 1986, when the world’s first computer virus, called Brain, started spreading, John locked himself in his apartment, cracked it, and built a tool to destroy it. He named it McAfee Antivirus. He gave it away for free, knowing companies would pay to keep using it. By the early 1990s, 67% of the world’s biggest corporations were using it. They were paying millions. By 47, Johnny was a multimillionaire. At his peak, Johnny made Forbes’ Top 100 list with a net worth of $100 million. He left the company in 1994, selling all his shares. Then, he vanished from the corporate world. He used his fortune to buy properties, luxury cars, and a helicopter he used to fly to work. He moved to Belize, where he built a private compound guarded by ex-soldiers, equipped with its own surveillance network and personal drug lab. According to John, people in power were after him. That paranoia led him to hack police radios, monitor government offices, and create systems to spy on everyone. By the mid-2000s, locals in Belize were scared of him. Rumors began spreading that Johnny was testing drugs, experimenting with weapons, and possibly involved in human trafficking. John David McAfee. Source: John McAfee X/Twitter Then, his neighbor was shot in the head. John was the main suspect. He ran. He took his girlfriend, who had originally been hired to assassinate him. Instead, she fell in love and joined him. While on the run, Johnny sent free laptops to government workers—each rigged with spyware. He claimed to have hacked into multiple government systems, including Hillary Clinton’s office. He told people he had information that could bring powerful figures down. When Guatemalan police arrested him in 2012, he faked a heart attack to stall for time, then escaped. When asked why he was running, John said, “If they catch me, they’ll kill me.” Johnny used the growing Bitcoin market to rebuild his wealth. He endorsed crypto projects, pumped coins, and posted nonstop on Twitter. He claimed to be a Bitcoin billionaire. He also said, “I haven’t paid taxes in 10 years because I blackmailed the U.S. government.” He got into politics, fled on a yacht, and warned the world about his death In 2016, John ran for U.S. President under the Libertarian Party. He ran again in 2020. His campaign was focused on ending government surveillance, legalizing drugs, and stopping what he called “the war against freedom.” His slogan was, “Privacy is freedom.” By 2019, U.S. authorities filed federal charges for tax evasion. He didn’t show up. Instead, he boarded a yacht in the Caribbean, posted videos of himself surrounded by prostitutes and armed bodyguards, and mocked the government. He refused to cooperate. He was wanted in three countries and didn’t care. In 2021, he was arrested by Spanish police. Facing 30+ years in prison if extradited to the U.S., he was found hanging in his cell on June 23, 2021. Before his death, Johnny had tweeted: “Know that if I hang myself, it will be no fault of mine.” He also had a tattoo that read “$WHACKD.” Hours after his death, a photo of a black “Q” was posted to his Instagram account, a clear reference to QAnon. Some people still believe he faked his death. John didn’t just build products. He built stories. His life was a non-stop stream of surveillance, paranoia, crypto, and media stunts. In 1994, he also started Tribal Voice, a company that built one of the world’s first instant messaging platforms called PowWow. By August 2009, John’s net worth had dropped to $4 million, down from $100 million. The 2008 crash wiped out his investments. But in 2016, he became CEO of MGT Capital Investments, a tech holding firm. The company planned to rename itself John McAfee Global Technologies, but Intel blocked it because of trademark issues. So, the company pivoted to cybersecurity. John said, “Antivirus software is dead, it no longer works,” and pushed a new product called Sentinel, which was supposed to stop hackers before they could attack. Soon after, Johnny said his team had found a flaw in Android that let him read encrypted WhatsApp messages. When Gizmodo found out he had sent out infected phones, John responded: “Of course the phones had malware on them. How that malware got there is the story, which we will release after speaking with Google. It involves a serious flaw in the Android architecture.” John then moved MGT into Bitcoin and crypto mining to make money and to gain experience with blockchain technology. In August 2017, he stepped down as CEO and took a new role as “chief cybersecurity visionary.” In January 2018, he cut ties with the company entirely. He said he wanted to focus on crypto full-time. MGT claimed investors had pressured them to distance from him. On August 13, 2018, he became CEO of Luxcore, a company focused on enterprise-level crypto products. By July 2017, Johnny made another wild statement. He tweeted that Bitcoin would reach $500,000 in three years. Then, in 2019, he raised the prediction to $1 million by the end of 2020. He said if it didn’t, he’d “eat his own dick on national television.” But in January 2020, John tweeted that the prediction was fake. He called it “a ruse to onboard new users and added that Bitcoin had limited use and was “an ancient technology.” “I understand Bitcoin completely. I was the world’s 6th largest Bitcoin miner in 2016 while running MGTi. If you think Bitcoin has value then you are the one who understands nothing.” – John McAfee So there you have it. John McAfee spent his life building, running, hacking, tweeting, and surviving. His story didn’t end with the company that still bears his name. It ended with a body in a Spanish prison and a tattoo that warned the world it would happen. Whether he’s dead or not, John changed how people saw privacy, surveillance, and crypto. He made enemies, millions, headlines, and chaos, which is just how he wanted it. And now, nearly four years after he died—or maybe didn’t—President Trump is back in office, crypto is still alive, and McAfee’s name keeps popping up. Some men disappear. Others turn themselves into a myth. And oh, Johnny’s Twitter account is still active.

Crypto trading firm DWF Labs is launching a $250 million Liquid Fund to support mid and large-cap crypto projects, saying it aims to accelerate adoption and expansion in the industry. In a March 24 blog announcement , DWF Labs said that the fund will provide investment sizes ranging from $10 million to $50 million per project. The firm says it has already committed $25 million and $10 million to two undisclosed projects, with more deals expected in the coming months. Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs, says the firm is looking to expand its efforts in accelerating web3 adoption, emphasizing that the team believes “strategic capital, coupled with hands-on ecosystem development, is the key to unlocking the next wave of growth for the industry.” DWF Labs suggests that the fund will go beyond traditional investments as each deal will include a tailored growth strategy, which may involve stablecoin liquidity support, lending market development, and marketing efforts.

In a March 23 interview with The Times, Gordon argued that the growing preference for crypto over traditional stock investments poses a threat to the UK economy. “It should terrify all of us that over half of under-45s own crypto and no equities,” Gordon said. She proposed applying stamp duty to crypto transactions—similar to the 0.5% tax currently levied on shares listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE)—while simultaneously reducing the same tax on equities. Currently, the LSE stamp duty generates around £3 billion ($3.9 billion) in annual tax revenue. Gordon believes that by reducing this tax and shifting the burden to crypto , more people would be incentivized to invest in local companies, boosting capital markets and potentially prompting more firms to go public. Concerns Over Crypto’s Economic Impact Gordon dismissed cryptocurrencies as “non-productive assets” that fail to contribute to the broader economy. In contrast, she emphasized that equities fund companies that “employ people, innovate, and pay corporate taxes”, reinforcing the economic social contract. Her remarks come as crypto ownership in the UK continues to rise. According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), around 12% of British adults—roughly 7 million people—now own crypto, with the majority being under 55 years old. The FCA also revealed that 44% of UK adults reduced or stopped saving or investing altogether in the 12 months leading up to January 2024, largely due to the cost-of-living crisis. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of Brits used their savings or sold investments to cover daily expenses. In November 2024, Bloomberg reported that the FCA was planning to finalize its crypto regulation laws by 2026, with key focus on trading platforms, crypto lending, and stablecoins. Slumping Markets Gordon’s plea comes at a time when the London stock market is struggling to attract new listings. According to consulting firm EY, only 18 companies listed on the LSE in 2024, down from 23 the previous year. In contrast, 88 companies delisted or transferred from the exchange, citing declining liquidity and lower valuations compared to rival markets like the US. While Gordon acknowledged the challenges, she still believes the UK offers stability compared to the US , which she claims has become more volatile due to former President Trump’s tariff threats and recession fears.

In South Korea, a legislative proposal that could mandate the reporting of personal crypto wallets has ignited a firestorm of protest. Crypto enthusiasts and privacy advocates are banding together, and their collective voice is getting louder. An online petition challenging this controversial bill has not only gained traction but has officially crossed the threshold for parliamentary review. This means the South Korean government must now seriously consider the concerns raised by its citizens regarding crypto wallet reporting . What’s Fueling the Crypto Privacy Uproar in South Korea? The heart of the matter lies in a bill proposed by Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) lawmaker Ahn Do-geol. This bill seeks to amend existing legislation in a way that would require individuals to report their personal cryptocurrency wallets to the government. The petition, launched on February 25th, argues that this move could grant the South Korean government unprecedented and potentially intrusive access to monitor personal crypto wallets around the clock. Think about it – the inherent transparency of blockchain, while beneficial in many ways, could be weaponized to track and monitor citizens’ financial activities in the digital realm. This has sparked significant concerns about privacy violations and government overreach within the burgeoning South Korean crypto community. Let’s break down why this is such a hot topic: Round-the-Clock Monitoring: The petition highlights the fear that this bill could enable continuous surveillance of personal crypto wallets. Imagine every transaction, every holding, potentially under the government’s watchful eye. Privacy Erosion: For many crypto users, privacy is a fundamental principle. The idea of mandatory cryptocurrency privacy reporting clashes directly with this ethos. It raises questions about the extent to which governments should have access to individuals’ financial data, especially in a decentralized and often pseudonymous space like cryptocurrency. Potential for Misuse: The petition voices apprehension about the potential for government misuse of this information. While proponents might argue for regulatory oversight and combating illicit activities, critics worry about mission creep and the erosion of civil liberties. Impact on Innovation: Some argue that such stringent regulations could stifle innovation within the South Korean crypto sector. The country has been a hotbed for crypto activity, and overly restrictive rules could push talent and investment elsewhere. The Power of Petition: How Did the Crypto Community Respond? The response from the South Korean crypto community has been swift and decisive. The online petition platform became a battleground for digital rights. To trigger a parliamentary review, a petition needs to garner the support of at least 50,000 citizens within 30 days. This threshold wasn’t just met; it was surpassed, demonstrating the strong public sentiment against the proposed bill. This achievement underscores the power of collective action and the determination of the crypto community to safeguard their financial privacy. South Korea Crypto Regulation: A Balancing Act? South Korea has been at the forefront of South Korea crypto regulation globally. The government has been grappling with how to regulate this burgeoning industry while fostering innovation and protecting consumers. On one hand, regulations are essential to combat money laundering, tax evasion, and other illicit activities often associated with cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, overly burdensome rules can stifle growth, drive innovation underground, and infringe upon individual liberties. The proposed crypto wallet reporting bill is a clear example of this tension. The government likely sees it as a necessary step to enhance transparency and control within the digital asset space. However, the crypto community views it as an overreach that could have detrimental consequences for privacy and innovation. The parliamentary review triggered by the petition now presents an opportunity for dialogue and a potential recalibration of the regulatory approach. Parliamentary Review: What Happens Next? The fact that the petition has reached the threshold for parliamentary review is a significant victory for the crypto community. It means that relevant parliamentary committees will now be obligated to examine the petition and the concerns it raises. This process typically involves: Committee Review: The petition will be reviewed by the relevant standing committees within the National Assembly. This could involve committees focused on legislation, justice, or technology. Public Hearings: Committees may choose to hold public hearings to gather input from stakeholders, including petitioners, government officials, industry experts, and privacy advocates. Debate and Deliberation: Parliamentarians will debate the merits of the petition and the proposed bill. This could lead to amendments, revisions, or even the withdrawal of the bill. Recommendations: The committees will issue recommendations based on their review, which will then be considered by the full National Assembly. While the review process doesn’t guarantee the bill will be scrapped or significantly altered, it does provide a crucial platform for the crypto community’s voice to be heard at the highest levels of government. It’s a chance to advocate for a more balanced approach to digital asset monitoring – one that protects legitimate users and fosters innovation while addressing genuine concerns about illicit activities. Beyond Petition: What Can Crypto Users Do? The South Korean petition serves as a powerful example of how collective action can influence policy. But what can individual crypto users and the broader community do to safeguard their privacy and advocate for responsible regulation? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in your jurisdiction and globally. Understanding the proposed rules and their potential impact is the first step. Engage with Policymakers: Participate in public consultations, contact your elected representatives, and make your voice heard. Petitions are one tool, but direct engagement is also crucial. Support Advocacy Groups: Organizations dedicated to digital rights and crypto advocacy play a vital role in shaping policy. Support their work through donations or volunteer efforts. Educate Others: Spread awareness about the importance of crypto privacy and the potential implications of intrusive regulations. The more people understand, the stronger the collective voice becomes. Utilize Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: Explore and utilize privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and tools that can enhance transaction anonymity and protect personal data (while being mindful of legal compliance in your region). The Fight for Crypto Privacy: A Global Movement? The situation in South Korea is not isolated. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. The push for greater transparency and control is a global trend, and so is the pushback from privacy advocates and the crypto community. The Korean petition could be a bellwether, signaling a growing global movement demanding a more balanced approach to cryptocurrency privacy and regulation. The outcome of this parliamentary review will be closely watched, not just in South Korea, but around the world, as it could set a precedent for how governments engage with the crypto industry and address the crucial issue of digital privacy in the years to come. The fight for digital privacy in the crypto space is far from over. It’s a continuous dialogue, a push and pull between regulators and innovators, between control and freedom. The South Korean petition is a powerful reminder that the crypto community is not just a passive observer; it’s an active participant in shaping its own future. And as the digital world becomes increasingly intertwined with our daily lives, the principles of privacy and individual liberty are more vital than ever.

Up until now, only Berachain’s ( BERA ) native exchange, BEX, was used to distribute rewards. Other decentralized applications will be able to apply for incentives through new reward vaults starting on Mar. 24, according to Berachain’s official announceme nt . This will help them expand by drawing liquidity. https://twitter.com/berachain/status/1902854165883167167?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Liquidity pools from multiple decentralized finance platforms have been included in the initial set of vaults, with more to be added later. This has opened up a more transparent system where users have more control over how incentives are allocated and projects vie for rewards. With Berachain’s PoL model, assets remain active in DeFi, in contrast to traditional proof-of-stake blockchains, where users lock up tokens for security. Network activity is limited in PoS systems because staked tokens are frequently not available for lending or trading. You might also like: Unichain, Berachain, and Iota lead blockchain growth in active users The system used by Berachain ensures that validators send back some rewards to the network rather than keeping them. Applications that boost activity on the blockchain and aid in its growth receive these rewards. The governance token, BGT, gives holders the ability to vote on which validators and projects receive support, thereby determining how these rewards are distributed. The first approved vaults focus on DEX liquidity pools, which allow users to swap tokens easily. These pools were selected based on their liquidity, security, and importance to the network. Liquidity pairs on BEX, Kodiak, Beradrome, and other protocols featuring key assets like BERA, HONEY, and BGT, as well as major stablecoins, are among the first approved vaults. Berachain has grown rapidly since launching its mainnet on Feb. 6. The platform now has $3.1 billion in total value locked and almost $1 billion in circulating stablecoins. The trading volume in February alone was $1.9 billion, according to DefiLlama data . Following launch , BERA hit an all-time high of $18.82 before falling to its present range of $6.03–$6.93. The network has a fully diluted volume of $3.37 and a $728 million market capitalization as of Mar. 24. The new governance initiative is expected to attract more users and contribute to further growth of the blockchain.

One particularly exciting area is the development of AI ‘agents’ – intelligent systems designed to automate tasks online. Navigating the web, a seemingly simple task for humans, presents a significant hurdle for these agents. Enter Browser Use, a groundbreaking tool that’s making waves by simplifying website navigation for AI agents. This innovative startup has just announced a significant milestone: a seed funding round of $17 million, signaling strong investor confidence in their vision to streamline browser automation . Decoding Browser Use: Simplifying Website Navigation for AI Agents While the precise definition of an AI agent is still under debate, the ambition to create tools that empower these agents to perform online tasks autonomously is undeniable. Browser Use is at the forefront of this movement, capturing the attention of both developers and investors with its unique approach. Instead of relying on complex, often unreliable, vision-based systems, Browser Use transforms websites into a format that AI agents can readily understand – a text-like structure that breaks down website elements into digestible components. This dramatically improves the efficiency and reliability of AI agents when interacting with the web. Here’s how Browser Use is changing the game: Text-Based Website Representation: Browser Use moves away from screenshot-based navigation, converting website elements into a text format. This allows AI agents to ‘read’ and interpret websites more effectively, similar to how humans process text-based information. Enhanced Reliability and Cost-Efficiency: By understanding the underlying structure of websites, AI agents powered by Browser Use are less likely to encounter errors and breakdowns during navigation. This leads to more consistent task execution and reduced operational costs. Open-Source Foundation: Born from an open-source project, Browser Use encourages community collaboration and innovation. This approach has fostered rapid development and widespread adoption within the AI community. The $17 Million Seed Funding: Fueling the Future of Browser Automation The impressive $17 million seed funding round, led by Felicis and backed by prominent investors like Paul Graham and Nexus Venture Partners, underscores the immense potential of Browser Use. This financial injection will enable the company to further develop its technology, expand its team, and solidify its position as a foundational layer for web-navigating AI agents. The funding round, previously unreported, highlights the quiet but significant progress Browser Use has made in a short time. Key Investors in Browser Use Seed Round: Investor Firm Notable Participants Felicis Astasia Myers (Lead Investor) Individual Investors & Firms Paul Graham, A Capital, Nexus Venture Partners From ETH Zurich to Y Combinator: The Genesis of Browser Use The story of Browser Use began at ETH Zurich’s Student Project House accelerator, founded by Magnus Müller and Gregor Zunic. Their journey, starting in 2024 during their master’s degrees in data science, reflects a blend of academic rigor and entrepreneurial spirit. Müller’s prior experience in web scraping combined with Zunic’s data science expertise proved to be a potent mix. Their breakthrough idea was to leverage data science principles to guide browser actions, effectively teaching AI agents how to interact with websites programmatically. The rapid development of a Browser Use demo in just five weeks, followed by its open-sourcing, speaks volumes about the team’s capabilities and the immediate appeal of their solution. Being part of Y Combinator’s prestigious Winter 2025 batch further validates their innovative approach and potential for growth. The Viral Impact of Manus: Showcasing Browser Use’s Capabilities Browser Use gained significant traction thanks to its integration into Butterfly Effect’s viral Manus tool. This Chinese startup leveraged Browser Use to power Manus, showcasing the practical applications and effectiveness of the technology in real-world scenarios. The virality of Manus significantly amplified awareness of Browser Use, propelling it into the spotlight and attracting wider developer interest. Addressing the Challenges of Dynamic Websites: LinkedIn Example One of the core challenges in browser automation is dealing with frequently changing websites. Platforms like LinkedIn, known for their dynamic updates, often break vision-based AI agents. Browser Use offers a robust solution to this problem. By understanding the underlying structure rather than relying on visual elements, it can adapt to website changes more effectively, ensuring consistent and reliable navigation even on dynamic platforms. Investor Perspective: Why Felicis is Betting Big on Web AI Agents Astasia Myers from Felicis highlights the strategic rationale behind their investment in Browser Use. Felicis has been closely monitoring the AI agents space for several years, recognizing its potential to revolutionize automation. Browser Use stood out due to its founding team, its open-source ethos, and its groundbreaking technology. Myers emphasizes the crucial role of web AI agents as a “dynamic bridge” connecting static AI models with the ever-changing digital landscape, enabling true end-to-end automation of human tasks. The Future is Agentic: Browser Use as a Foundational Layer Magnus Müller envisions Browser Use becoming a “fundamental layer” for the burgeoning field of web-navigating AI agents. With an increasing number of companies seeking to integrate AI agents into their workflows, the need for reliable and efficient website navigation tools is paramount. Browser Use is poised to meet this demand, providing a crucial infrastructure for the next generation of AI-powered applications. The fact that over 20 companies in the current Y Combinator batch are already utilizing Browser Use underscores its immediate relevance and widespread appeal within the tech ecosystem. In conclusion, Browser Use’s $17 million seed funding is not just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful validation of their vision to transform how AI agents interact with the web. By simplifying website navigation through their innovative technology, Browser Use is paving the way for a future where AI agents can seamlessly automate a vast array of online tasks, unlocking unprecedented levels of efficiency and productivity. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, Browser Use is strategically positioned to be a cornerstone of this transformative journey.

The meme coin has flipped resistance at $0.0000128, and speculation is now rife among traders about whether it will maintain the bullish trajectory and attract high buy volumes. In this article, we dive into how high SHIB will go if it records $50 billion to $100 billion in daily buy volumes. Impact of Volumes on Shiba Inu Price Trading volumes tend to have a major impact on the price. Each time buy volumes are high, the price reacts by trending higher while sell volumes push the price lower. Tradingview data highlights the correlation between buy volumes and Shiba Inu price. Whenever there is an uptick in buying activity, the ADX rises higher, indicating a strong bullish trend. Additionally, past trends show that high buying volumes have stirred gains of as high as 1,300% within days as seen on the SHIB weekly chart. SHIB/USDT: 1-week Chart This data suggests that if traders were to buy between $50 billion and $100 billion worth of SHIB, the resulting price rally would be parabolic. SHIB Price Potential with $50B or $100B Buy Volume If Shiba Inu attracted $50B to $100B daily buying volumes, the meme coin could attain the highly anticipated $0.01 SHIB price target . Here’s how: Scenario 1: SHIB attains $50B in daily buy volumes For context, SHIB’s daily trading volumes stand at around $138M at press time, which is 1.78% of the current Shiba Inu market cap of $7.76 billion. Assuming a direct relationship between volume and market cap, a 362% rise in trading volumes to $50B would push SHIB’s new market cap to $2.78 trillion. With this market cap and a supply of 589 trillion, 1 SHIB token will be worth $0.0047. Scenario 2: SHIB attains $100B in daily buy volumes On the other hand, to attain $100B in daily buy activity, this top meme coin would have to record a 724% rise in volumes, This would push its market cap to $5.55 trillion, where the price of 1 SHIB token will be worth $0.0094. This is close to the coveted $0.01 price target. Reasons Why SHIB May Not Attain These Targets in the Near Term Attaining $50 billion to $100 billion in buying volumes would push Shiba Inu to between $0.004 and $0.01. However, this Shiba Inu price prediction cannot be attained in the near term due to several reasons. The first is that with a market cap of between $2.7 trillion and $5.5 trillion, SHIB would surpass Bitcoin. This cannot be achieved in the near term because unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and other top altcoins, Shiba Inu has yet to see a surge in institutional interest. Secondly, attaining daily buy volumes of between $50B and $100B is not realistic under the current market conditions. Bitcoin’s current daily volumes stand at $21 billion. For SHIB to attract more interest than Bitcoin and record an over 362% rise in volumes it would have to achieve high utility and intense adoption. Nevertheless, this price target can be achieved if there is a reduction in the total Shiba Inu supply through SHIB token burns . The filing of Shiba Inu ETF and the subsequent approval could also aid in increasing volume, making the $0.004 and $0.01 price targets achievable. Summary Shiba Inu price could rally to between $0.004 and $0.01 if daily buy volumes reached $50 billion to $100 billion. However, to attain such high volumes, the SHIB meme coin would have to record a massive surge in usage, adoption and institutional interest.

The altcoins have followed suit, led by AVAX’s impressive surge. In contrast, Pi Network’s PI token continues to bleed out. BTC Reclaims $87K The previous business week was quite eventful in terms of news, but not so much when it comes down to BTC price movements. The most volatile day turned out to be Wednesday, which was expected to an extent as the US Fed concluded its second meeting for the year. Although it refused to change the interest rates, bitcoin went on the move by going up and down by a few grand within hours. The fluctuations were also influenced by the statement from Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, that the SEC would drop its lawsuit against his company. BTC flew to $87,500 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session but was quickly halted and pushed south by several grand. Nevertheless, it recovered most of the lost ground and returned to $84,000, where it spent most of the weekend. It went on the offensive late last night but kept climbing earlier today and surpassed $87,000. It even briefly tapped $87,600 (on Bitstamp) for the first time in over two weeks. Although it has retraced slightly since then, BTC still trades above $87,000. Its market cap has jumped to $1.730 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is up to 58.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView AVAX Runs Wild As mentioned above, most alts are well in the green today. Ethereum is close to $2,100 after a 3.5% daily surge, XRP has surpassed $2.45 following a similar increase, while SOL, LINK, and SUI have marked gains of somewhere between 5-7%. Avalanche has stolen the show, though, charting a substantial 12% surge in the past day. As a result, AVAX has neared $22 for the first time in weeks. In contrast, PI continues to bleed out, dumping by another 6% in the past 24 hours to well below $1. The total crypto market cap has added around $80 billion since yesterday and is up to $2.960 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Adding to the woes, the Pi Network has seen its price dip below the crucial $1 mark from its all-time high of $3, leaving many Pioneers questioning its long-term potential. Despite efforts to expand the ecosystem with projects like PiDaoSwap and the launch of .pi domains, concerns over the network’s structure have overshadowed its progress. Now, fresh scrutiny over its SuperNodes has sparked debate over whether Pi Network is truly decentralized or just another centralized system in disguise. SuperNodes: A Centralization Problem? Pi Network claims to be a decentralized, community-driven project, but in reality, its core team (PCT) controls the SuperNodes that validate transactions. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where thousands of independent nodes secure the network, Pi’s system remains tightly managed. Initially, only three SuperNodes existed, all controlled by PCT in Canada and Finland. While the number has now grown to 42 as per Piscan.io , there’s little transparency. The team hasn’t shared a list of these SuperNodes or explained how they are selected, leaving many Pioneers confused about the process. Community Frustration Reaches Boiling Point However with the recent price drop, KYC details, controversy over its claims of decentralization. Many Pioneers are growing frustrated with the lack of rewards and participation opportunities. A Reddit post asking, “What is a SuperNode?” received vague responses from the team, only detailing their technical role without clarifying how one could become a SuperNode. On the other side, regular Pioneers who have been running nodes for months report no progress or rewards, further fueling skepticism. Some fear that only a select group with insider knowledge or powerful hardware can qualify, contradicting Pi Network’s vision of making crypto accessible to all. If participation is restricted, then is Pi Network really as decentralized as it claims to be? Whom to Blame? Meanwhile, the Pi Network Core Team reassured users that they are working hard behind the scenes to give Pi the value it deserves. They blamed the price drop on Pioneers who are only selling Pi instead of buying. According to them, once people start buying, the price will surge. Is Pi Network a Scam? Crypto analyst Justin Bons, Founder & CIO of Cyber Capital, has openly called Pi Network a scam. He pointed out flaws in its technology, tokenomics, and centralization, arguing that Pi relies heavily on Stellar’s technology and lacks true decentralized finance (DeFi) potential. Bons also criticized its mining model, likening it to a Ponzi scheme. For Pi Network to regain trust, PCT must address these concerns by making the SuperNode selection process transparent, publishing a list of approved nodes, and ensuring fair rewards for participants. Until then, doubts will continue to overshadow Pi’s vision, and its price may struggle to recover.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,TRADING|TECHNOLOGY|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-24 10:14:58

Investors are always on the lookout for the next big thing, and this time, Arctic Pablo Coin is on the list of Best New Meme Coins to Join Now. With an explosive presale already raising over $1.96 million, those who recognize its potential early stand to gain monumental returns. Unlike random meme coins that come and go, Arctic Pablo Coin has structured tokenomics, a strategic launch plan, and a highly engaged community. But before diving into its presale details, it’s crucial to understand why this token is standing out among the competition. Arctic Pablo Coin Builds a Rock-Solid Foundation Among the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now What sets Arctic Pablo Coin apart is its meticulously crafted ecosystem, steering clear of fleeting hype to prioritize sustainable, long-term growth. With a total supply of 221,200,000,000 APC, its tokenomics are strategically allocated: 50% (110,600,000,000 APC) fuels the public presale, 25% ensures liquidity, 37.5% drives development and marketing efforts, 15% (33,180,000,000 APC) rewards stakers, 20% (44,240,000,000 APC) boosts ecosystem growth, and 10% (22,120,000,000 APC) powers community rewards and referrals. A modest 5% team allocation remains locked for a year, fostering trust. Backed by an aggressive marketing push and enticing community incentives, Arctic Pablo Coin earns its spot among the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now , drawing in seasoned crypto veterans and newcomers alike with its promising, well-rounded vision. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale – A Chance to Get In Before the Surge The Meme coin presale is currently underway at an attractive price of just $0.000079 per APC, making it one of the most promising entry points in the meme coin market. With over $1.96 million already raised, investor interest is surging, driven by the token’s impressive potential for growth. One of the biggest reasons investors are jumping in is the insane return on investment (ROI) potential. Those purchasing at the presale price could see gains of over 10,027.85% when the coin reaches its projected launch price of $0.008. Additionally, with only 50% of the total supply allocated to the presale, demand is expected to rise sharply once the token is listed on major exchanges. Unlike many meme coins that lack utility, Arctic Pablo Coin offers staking opportunities and community-driven incentives, ensuring long-term sustainability and growth. At the current presale price, an investment of just $100 secures 1,265,686 APC, which could be worth $10,125.49 upon launch. This presents a rare opportunity to get in early on a high-potential meme coin at an exceptionally low price. The Popcat ICO That Slipped Away – A Painful Lesson Crypto history is filled with missed opportunities, and Popcat is a prime example. In its early days, Popcat traded for just $0.000001 per token, yet few believed it would amount to anything. Then came the viral explosion. What started as a joke quickly turned into a high-value digital asset, making those who invested in its infancy incredibly wealthy. Those who dismissed it as “just another meme coin” were left watching in regret as its value soared. This is exactly why Arctic Pablo Coin is in the list of Best New Meme Coins to Join Now—those who missed Popcat’s rise finally have a second chance.

AI has rapidly evolved from a futuristic concept to an essential part of modern life, with a projected market value of $1,278 billion by 2028. However, this growth comes with significant challenges, especially in how AI data is stored, managed, and accessed across networks. Decentralized storage systems offer a promising solution, providing enhanced scalability, efficiency, and security to support AI’s expanding needs, but they can still be hindered by scalability, efficiency, and security issues. You might also like: As AI rewrites history, blockchain technology is a line of defense | Opinion The surge in AI’s influence also drives an exponential increase in data and power consumption, with data center energy use expected to rise by 160% by 2030. Decentralized storage systems must evolve to meet these rising demands, ensuring AI’s continued success and sustainability. Challenges with current decentralized storage As AI grows at an annual rate of 28% , it puts significant pressure on decentralized storage networks. The challenge lies not only in managing present data needs but also in anticipating future demands. AI applications require vast, real-time data access, and existing systems often struggle to scale effectively. Current decentralized systems also face difficulties in ensuring data integrity. For AI to function accurately, it must rely on high-quality, unbiased data. Without proper verification mechanisms, the risk of data manipulation or errors becomes a serious concern, potentially undermining the outcomes of AI models. Key requirements for decentralized storage to support AI Traditional centralized storage systems are becoming increasingly inadequate. They are prone to censorship, slower data retrieval, and security vulnerabilities. Decentralized storage alternatives, in contrast, offer greater security and censorship resistance but still need to address three critical factors: scalability, speed, and security. Scalability is essential for supporting AI’s rapid growth. Decentralized storage systems must be flexible enough to handle increasing amounts of data without slowing down or compromising performance. Solutions that prioritize automation and adaptive scaling can help meet the needs of growing AI workloads. Speed is another vital consideration. AI applications, such as machine learning and real-time data processing, demand ultra-fast data access. Many decentralized systems are not optimized for these high-volume, low-latency requirements. Enhancements in storage retrieval times and network throughput will be necessary to keep pace with AI. Security is non-negotiable. With AI’s reliance on accurate data, any compromise in security can lead to faulty or manipulated outputs. Decentralized storage must ensure data integrity, leveraging encryption, data validation, and blockchain technology to ensure tamper-proof storage. Advanced security protocols will be critical in protecting AI’s underlying datasets. The path forward for decentralized storage For decentralized storage to meet AI’s needs, it must provide data that is both verifiable and tamper-proof. Blockchain technology, for instance, can offer immutable records, ensuring that once data is stored, it cannot be altered without detection. This approach would improve the reliability of AI outputs by preventing data manipulation, which can have cascading consequences for AI applications. Further, decentralized storage solutions must prioritize interoperability—the ability to integrate with various AI platforms and technologies. AI systems depend on data from multiple sources, so storage systems must support seamless data exchange without creating barriers. This will enable AI to function at its full potential, drawing from diverse datasets without concerns over compatibility or access issues. Finally, as AI continues to evolve, decentralized storage will need to embrace edge computing capabilities. By distributing data storage closer to the source of AI applications, edge storage minimizes latency and reduces the pressure on centralized data centers. This approach ensures faster access to critical data and supports real-time decision-making, which is vital for AI in fields like autonomous vehicles and smart cities. Setting the stage for AI-ready decentralized storage AI requires trusted, real-time access to vast amounts of data. As decentralized storage systems evolve to meet these needs, they must not only focus on secure, immutable data storage but also enable efficient data retrieval and smooth integration across a variety of platforms. In this rapidly changing landscape, the role of decentralized storage will become more integral than ever. By evolving alongside AI, these systems can become the backbone of innovation, ensuring AI operates with the highest levels of reliability, speed, and security. With the right infrastructure in place, decentralized storage will not just support AI—it will enable its full potential, empowering industries to innovate and thrive in an AI-driven world.

The scam involves counterfeit arrest warrants that claim individuals have failed to appear for jury duty and demand immediate payment in Bitcoin or other difficult-to-trace means. Cryptocurrency Scammers Exploit Court Documents in New Scheme According to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, these fraudulent documents appear authentic and mimic official forms used by the Eastern District of Virginia. Copy of the fake arrest warrant – Source: vawd.uscourts.gov Victims typically receive a phone call from the scammers, who pressure them to make immediate payments or face legal consequences. The scam preys on fear and urgency, coercing individuals into complying with their demands before they have time to verify the legitimacy of the claims. Court officials have clarified that U.S. district courts do not issue arrest warrants for failing to appear for jury duty unless the individual has been officially summoned and subsequently failed to comply. They urge anyone receiving such demands, especially those requesting Bitcoin payments over the phone, to contact their local district court for verification. California and West Virginia Authorities Crack Down on Crypto Scams The West Virginia case resembles recent actions taken by California financial regulators to combat cryptocurrency fraud. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI), in collaboration with the state’s Department of Justice, has shut down 26 fraudulent cryptocurrency websites using a nationally recognized scam-tracking tool. California regulators received 2,668 complaints from residents through its ‘Crypto Scam Tracker’ tool, that led to identify 7 new scam schemes. #CryptoScam #CryptoFraud #CaliforniaDFPI https://t.co/GEhyLAXURy — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 11, 2025 These efforts have led to the identification of $4.6 million in consumer losses connected to cryptocurrency scams. To tackle the growing threat, DFPI has developed the ‘Crypto Scam Tracker,’ a tool that aggregates consumer complaints and provides a database of identified scams. The tool has already identified several new fraudulent schemes, including fake Bitcoin mining operations and deceptive play-to-earn crypto games. Additionally, DFPI has published a ‘Pig Butchering’ scam playbook to educate consumers on one of the most alarming crypto fraud trends. ‘Pig butchering’ scams involve fraudsters building long-term fake relationships with victims, convincing them to invest in bogus crypto schemes before draining their assets. According to a recent Chainalysis report , revenues from these scams have increased by 40% year-over-year, making them one of the most profitable fraud techniques in the crypto industry. Crypto Scams Continue to Evolve with Advanced Technology As cryptocurrency scams become increasingly sophisticated, new reports indicate that fraudsters are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and professional scam networks to defraud victims more effectively. Chainalysis recently revealed that crypto scammers stole at least $9.9 billion in 2024 , with estimates suggesting the final figure could surpass $12 billion as more fraudulent activities are uncovered. A 2024 @chainalysis report reveals that cryptocurrency scams defrauded victims of at least $9.9 billion, with AI-powered fraud and pig butchering scams surging by 40%. #CryptoScams #CryptoFraud #AI https://t.co/Mt5c5XXmOL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 13, 2025 One of the most concerning trends is the rise of pig butchering scams, which accounted for over 33% of total crypto scam revenue. Initially concentrated in Southeast Asia, these operations have now expanded to regions like Nigeria and Namibia. Meanwhile, traditional high-yield investment scams (HYIS) accounted for over 50% of scam-related losses but saw a decline in activity. Some major Ponzi schemes, such as Smart Business Corp, amassed billions in illicit gains before collapsing. Fraudsters have also started exploiting cryptocurrency ATMs to target victims, particularly elderly individuals. Losses from crypto ATM-related scams in the U.S. surpassed $65 million in the first half of 2024 alone, with an average loss of $10,000 per victim. Looking forward, with AI now playing a crucial role in enabling fraudulent operations, scammers have adopted deepfake videos, AI-generated fake identities, and cloned websites to enhance their deception tactics. These tools make scams harder to detect and easier to execute, with fraudsters openly advertising AI-powered scam software on illicit platforms. With billions of dollars at stake, authorities have increased their efforts to combat these deceptive practices and safeguard the industry’s integrity.

While BTC experienced an inflow of $724 million, Ethereum (ETH) experienced an outflow of $86 million. When we look at other altcoins, XRP experienced an inflow of $6.7 million, Solana (SOL) experienced an inflow of $6.4 million, while SUI experienced an outflow of $1.3 million, unlike in previous weeks. “Bitcoin led the recovery, attracting $724 million in inflows and snapping a five-week streak of outflows totaling $5.4 billion. Sentiment in the altcoin space was mixed. Ethereum faced the heaviest outflows, with $86 million exiting the asset. Other altcoins with notable outflows included Sui ($1.3 million), Polkadot ($1.3 million), Tron ($0.95 million), and Algorand ($0.82 million). On the other hand, Solana recorded $6.4 million in inflows, while Polygon and Chainlink saw more modest inflows of $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively. When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, it was seen that the USA ranked first with an inflow of 632 million dollars. Switzerland came in second after the United States with $15.9 million in inflows. In contrast to these outflows, Sweden and Canada saw smaller inflows of $10.3 million and $9.1 million, respectively. *This is not investment advice.

However, the bullish momentum appears weak, suggesting that this rebound could be a temporary correction rather than the start of a sustained uptrend. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin is showing early signs of a recovery after bouncing off the crucial $80K support level. This region aligns with the ascending channel’s lower boundary, the 200-day moving average, and the key 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, making it a formidable support level that sellers have struggled to break. As long as this support is in place, the overall trend will remain intact. However, bullish momentum appears weak, suggesting that the recent rebound could be a temporary correction rather than the start of a strong uptrend. If BTC continues its recovery, the following key resistance lies at $92K, where the 100-day moving average could act as a barrier. The 4-Hour Chart In the lower timeframe, Bitcoin successfully broke out of its descending wedge pattern and formed a pullback, signaling a bullish move. Following this breakout, the price has seen a moderate surge, indicating increased buying interest. Despite this, Bitcoin still faces a significant test at the $92K resistance zone, where notable selling pressure is expected. The price action at this level will likely determine BTC’s mid-term direction. In the short term, buyers seem poised to push the price toward $92K, with potential consolidation before the next decisive move. Sentiment Analysis By Shayan The Binance liquidation heatmap provides key insights into potential price targets, as liquidity levels often act as magnets for market movements. Recent market consolidation has led to the formation of a significant cluster of liquidation levels just above the $92K resistance. These levels correspond to short-position liquidations, making them attractive targets for bulls and institutional buyers. As a result, Bitcoin’s price could be drawn toward this liquidity pocket, increasing the likelihood of a breakout above $92K in the mid-term. Despite the current lack of strong bullish momentum, the $92K level remains a critical battleground. A decisive move above this resistance could lead to a sustained bullish trend. However, given the overall market conditions, Bitcoin could still experience lower price levels before a decisive breakout. This potential downside would offer an excellent accumulation opportunity for smart money investors, positioning them ahead of the next major move.

Within hours, the token reached its ATH of $75.35 before collapsing nearly 90%. This led to investors losing their confidence before this Sunday, as TRUMP memecoin price rally formed, gaining 10% in the last 24 hours. However, the question is how this happened and whether it will continue. TRUMP Memecoin Price Surged 10% After Donald Trump’s Post On March 23, Donald Trump posted on Truth to support his TRUMP memecoin, which turned successful as price surged immediately. The U.S. President endorsed his token with a simple post, calling it cool and greatest among all. I LOVE $TRUMP — SO COOL! The Greatest of them all. This was an awaited moment as Trump had not talked about his crypto in weeks; it was bearing a significant downtrend and hit an all-time low of $6.24. However, a bullish peak formed after the post, resulting in the price jumping from $10.72 to $12.24 within a few hours. Although the token has moved minorly down from the peak, it is currently trading at $11.92 with a market capitalization of $2.38B. Additionally, it has a trading volume of $1.41B, up 360%, showcasing high investor interest, but will sustain it? TRUMP Memecoin Price Prediction: 10x Rally in Formation As the investors were concerned about the Official Trump coin price rally, a few analysts anticipated further uptrend. One such analyst pointed at the Donald Trump-influenced rally and claimed that the token is forming a base and is the only meme coin investors need to invest in. The analyst further added that if the market’s bullish sentiments remain and the token breaks the $12 resistance, the price could witness 10x growth over the upcoming weeks. $TRUMP on the daily chart getting back to 12$ resistance. Price is forming a base. Trump tweeted yesterday to pump my bag, cringe but good for me. $TRUMP is the only meme coin you need to be invested in imo. If markets show strength, I see a 10x possibility over the next few months. However, at the same time, the drop from the peak reveals that the market is no longer excited about the Trump-themed token. More importantly, the seller may bring volatility if they attempt to take all the profits in. Will Bullish Momentum Continue? Despite the bullish performance, the TRUMP memecoin price is 75% down from the prime. This reveals that the token would require far more bullish factors for better performance, which seems missing as it does not carry any significant utility. The global crypto market sentiments are still bearish , but the more significant concern is the president-affiliated companies holding a major stake in the crypto. Reports reveal that out of the 1 billion tokens, CIC Digital LLC (a Trump Organization affiliate) and Fight Fight Fight LLC hold 800 million tokens (80%). Those allocations have affected the Official Trump coin price in the past and may continue to do so. Additionally, the upcoming 40 million TRUMP token unlocks may affect its performance further. The unlocking will start on April 18 and may continue to enter the market until the end of 2027, bringing additional volatility due to building selling pressure. Some even claim that Donald Trump’s recent post was to grab some exit liquidity before unlocks. Trump is shilling TRUMP coin on Truth Social… It seems like they are grabbing some exit liquidity before the unlock. Overall, the volatility may take over soon per Official TRUMP price prediction , and the memecoin may crash again.

On March 24, the Infini team sent an onchain message to the attacker, citing developer Chen Shanxuan and three unidentified persons with access to wallets involved in the exploit as defendants in the lawsuit. Infini said that the 49.5 million USDC ( USDC ) traced from the plaintiff’s funds are subject to an ongoing legal dispute and are contentious in nature. “Any subsequent holders of the said crypto assets (if any) once held in those wallets that they cannot claim the status of bona fide purchases without notice of the dispute,” Infini stated. The Hong Kong court sent an injunction order through an onchain message, a method to send legal notices to anonymous crypto wallets containing stolen funds. It also included a writ of summons that required the defendants to attend the return date hearing. Infini offered a 20% bounty to hacker Following the $50 million hack on Feb. 24, Infini offered a 20% bounty to the hackers responsible for the attack. In an onchain message, Infini said it had gathered IP and device information about the attackers. The platform said it’s constantly monitoring the addresses involved and will take action if necessary. However, the payment firm offered a bounty to the attacker if they returned 80% of the funds. “Upon receipt of the returned assets, we will cease further tracking or analysis, and you will not face accountability,” Infini wrote. Still, despite the warnings, the attacker did not return any of the funds from the address specified by the Infini team.

On Feb. 21, a hacker took control of Bybit's multisignature wallet, stealing $1.4 billion in crypto assets. In a statement, FearsOff chief operating officer Marwan Hachem told Cointelegraph that the Infini hacker carefully chose the timing of the attack. The cybersecurity executive said the attack came only a few days after the Bybit hack, and the timing “was not by chance.” “With everyone busy on the investigation and recovery efforts of the $1.5B, the Infini attackers perceived their chances of success to be higher at that moment,” Hachem told Cointelegraph.

Hedera (HBAR), a blockchain project that has garnered attention for its focus on enterprise solutions, is also benefiting from this growing trend in DeFi. But amid this momentum, a new player is emerging as a leading contender for the title of the best Web3 crypto of 2025: Coldware (COLD) . While Hedera (HBAR) has traditionally focused on supporting enterprise-level applications with its ultra-fast Hashgraph consensus mechanism, Coldware (COLD) has distinguished itself by focusing on a decentralized approach to the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain, effectively filling a gap that has been largely overlooked by other Web3 projects. Coldware (COLD): The Web3 Crypto of the Future In contrast to Hedera (HBAR)’s focus on enterprise and institutional adoption, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself to take over the Web3 space with a focus on IoT integration and decentralized solutions. The blockchain project combines IoT with blockchain technology, providing a platform that is secure, scalable, and incredibly fast. As we move into 2025, Coldware (COLD) is set to dominate the Web3 landscape, leveraging its unique position to fill the growing need for decentralized IoT solutions. The Coldware (COLD) blockchain is designed to process large amounts of data from connected devices in a decentralized manner, making it highly appealing to industries that are looking to integrate IoT with blockchain technology. Where Hedera (HBAR) has a solid foundation in enterprise use cases, Coldware (COLD) is on track to become the go-to solution for decentralized applications that require high-speed transaction processing and the security that comes with blockchain technology. This positions Coldware as the best Web3 crypto for 2025. Hedera’s Growth in DeFi and Its Potential to Lead The integration of Hedera (HBAR) into the DeFi ecosystem has been relatively slow compared to other Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL), but recent developments suggest that Hedera could become a major player in DeFi by 2025. One of Hedera’s main selling points has always been its scalability and high transaction throughput, which are key features for the growing DeFi space. Hedera’s use of the Hashgraph consensus algorithm enables it to process over 10,000 transactions per second, making it an attractive option for decentralized finance protocols that require speed and efficiency. As DeFi momentum continues to grow, many projects are turning to Hedera (HBAR) for its ability to handle large volumes of transactions without compromising security or decentralization. With institutional backing and increasing participation from enterprise clients, Hedera is set to see a surge in demand for its services, particularly as DeFi becomes more mainstream. Coldware (COLD) vs Hedera (HBAR): Which One is Best for DeFi? Both Hedera (HBAR) and Coldware (COLD) are making waves in the DeFi ecosystem, but they are doing so in very different ways. Hedera (HBAR) is drawing attention for its ability to support large-scale enterprise applications, while Coldware (COLD) is attracting DeFi enthusiasts with its innovative approach to IoT and decentralized solutions. When it comes to DeFi, Coldware (COLD) may have an edge in 2025, thanks to its ability to seamlessly integrate with the rapidly expanding IoT space. DeFi applications are increasingly looking for solutions that not only offer scalability but also work in conjunction with the growing number of connected devices.

On the other hand, Hedera (HBAR)'s strengths lie in its scalability and performance for institutional and large enterprise clients, making it a solid option for enterprise-level DeFi projects that need robust support for large transaction volumes. However, Coldware (COLD)'s decentralized, community-driven model gives it a unique advantage in the Web3 space. Why Coldware (COLD) is the Best Web3 Crypto for 2025 Looking ahead to 2025, Coldware (COLD) has all the makings of the best Web3 crypto. The combination of decentralized technology with IoT integration is something that Hedera (HBAR) and other blockchains have yet to fully explore. With the rise of DeFi and the growing need for decentralized solutions, Coldware (COLD) is well-positioned to lead the next generation of Web3 platforms. The Coldware (COLD) presale has already garnered significant attention, with many investors eyeing the project’s innovative approach to blockchain and IoT. As Coldware (COLD) continues to attract new users and investors, it is set to become a dominant force in the blockchain space in 2025.

Pi Set for 25% Surge & DOGE Shows Bullish Signals,https://timestabloid.com/blockdags-ambassador-program-takes-off-globally-pi-set-for-25/,"The crypto market keeps shifting quickly, with some coins forming strong technical patterns and others influenced by news and sentiment. Dogecoin (DOGE) technical analysis indicates a possible price shift, with certain support and resistance points defining upcoming action. At the same time, the market is looking closely at the possibility of a 25% PI price surge, as traders weigh promising indicators against concerns tied to regulations and exchange access. In a different area of the market, BlockDAG (BDAG) is creating a buzz with a presale that has now crossed $205.5 million. Early supporters have already seen returns as high as 2,380%, placing this project among the best long-term crypto options. Its newly introduced Ambassador Program is now offering enthusiasts a way to grow the project while earning rewards. DOGE Price Levels: Watching for a Breakout The Dogecoin (DOGE) technical analysis points to a major setup, with market participants watching certain levels closely. The analysis notes $0.1822 as a key support point. If the price holds here and rebounds, it could lead to a shift in trend. Resistance at $0.2457 is also being tracked. If DOGE can break past this level, it might signal more gains ahead. A higher target sits at $0.4846, but the uptrend needs strong support to get there. Many traders using Dogecoin (DOGE) technical analysis are waiting for confirmation before acting. The price is still correcting, though signs point toward a possible reversal soon. Will the PI Price Surge by 25%? Excitement continues around the PI price surge, though concerns remain about regulatory clarity and exchange listings. The 25% PI price surge theory is largely tied to speculation about a potential Binance listing, which could bring more volume and raise the project’s standing. PI recently moved out of an ascending triangle setup, which some see as a signal for more upside. That said, doubts persist over the Pi Network’s withdrawal limits and KYC practices. Even with these concerns, talk of a PI price surge keeps going, and current technical signs suggest a run toward $2.34 could happen if interest continues. BlockDAG’s Ambassador Program Spurs Rapid Growth Now ranked as one of the fastest-growing presales, BlockDAG has already pulled in $205.5 million, with 18.8 billion coins sold and a 2,380% price rise so far. At batch 27, its current price sits at $0.0248. More than 170,000 unique holders and over 300,000 followers across social platforms signal that its reach is spreading quickly. Through the Ambassador Program , people can now take part in growing BlockDAG’s presence while being rewarded. Participants can earn BDAG coins, receive USDT payments, and build experience in blockchain and Web3. This program also allows creators, developers, and community members to grow their networks, build content, and contribute to the future of decentralized systems. It supports those who see real value in shaping strong blockchain ecosystems. What makes BlockDAG the best long-term crypto choice is its consistent rise and now its community-driven focus. The Ambassador Program offers a real way to earn and get involved, both financially and professionally. Many in the crypto community are watching closely as this project gains more momentum with each new participant. In a Nutshell! Recent activity across the crypto space has shown different directions for these digital assets. Dogecoin (DOGE) technical analysis highlights important chart points that could signal trend changes. The PI price surge continues to draw attention, especially with potential catalysts on the horizon. At the same time, BlockDAG is moving forward quickly, collecting over $205.5 million through presale, while offering meaningful ways for people to engage. The Ambassador Program adds another layer of growth, as users earn BDAG, explore Web3, and help shape the future of this project. BlockDAG keeps showing why it’s seen as the best long-term crypto in the current market.

Why April 2 Is Massive For Crypto In a post shared on X, Krüger describes the looming announcement, which the president has dubbed “Liberation Day,” as “10x more important than any FOMC” meeting: “April 2nd is similar to election night. It is the biggest event of the year by an order of magnitude. 10x more important than any FOMC, which is a lot. And anything can happen.” According to Krüger, Trump might choose one of several paths: “Trump could go soft, in which case markets would rally fast and furiously. Or could go half-way, adding uncertainty on timelines, in which case markets would take out the stops of all longs and shorts. Or go all out, in which case markets could easily crash another 10% to 15%, fast.“ Related Reading: Crypto Sleuth Claims Mysterious $20M ‘Hyperliquid Whale’ Is Tied To Illicit Activity Krüger also suggests that “the US economy is still strong, but will highly likely slow down due to tariffs regardless of the path Trump chooses.” Nevertheless, he notes that many economists have already factored in a sharp year-end slowdown. He stresses that April 2 could mark the peak of market anxiety, aligning with the arrival of US Tax Day just two weeks later. “Either way, you all want to be prepared and ready to act on ‘Liberation Day.’ It will be big.” Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement will reportedly focus on “reciprocal tariffs” targeting specific countries or blocs deemed to maintain unfair trade barriers. Although this strategy appears “more targeted than the barrage he has occasionally threatened,” officials familiar with the matter believe it could still prove far-reaching. President Trump has repeatedly signaled that these tariffs would be significant. Citing trade disparities with nations such as the European Union, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India, and China, he asserts the US has been treated unfairly for too long. In remarks from the Oval Office, he declared: “April 2nd is going to be liberation day for America. We’ve been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe.” Worst Case Scenario Aides and allies suggest that while some countries may be excluded, Trump is looking for immediate impact. Tariff rates could take effect right away, adding to market fears of spiraling retaliation. In this case, Krüger says: “In worst case scenario sh*t would hit the fan then tariffs would start coming off as Trump negotiates hard in the following month, in which case peak negativity would hit around week 2 of April, which would coincide with US Tax Day.” Related Reading: Trump’s Crypto Czar David Sacks Unloads $200M In Digital Asset Holdings Senior officials, including National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have indicated that the administration is focusing on a “dirty 15” group of countries where tariff and non-tariff barriers are allegedly most egregious. Hassett recently remarked, “It’s not everybody that cheats us on trade, it’s just a few countries, and those countries are going to be seeing some tariffs.” For the crypto market, global macroeconomic events have increasingly played a pivotal role in price action in recent weeks. The April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement arrives at a time when digital asset traders already face headwinds from monetary policy shifts and a slowing global economy. Krüger believes that if the tariffs come in softer than expected, “markets would rally fast and furiously.” On the other hand, a maximalist tariff approach could deliver a significant shock, potentially denting cryptocurrencies. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.81 trillion.

The buzz is real, and the numbers are in: Binance Alpha 2.0 has made a monumental entrance into the on-chain trading arena. Just one week after its highly anticipated launch, this groundbreaking platform has absolutely smashed expectations, racking up a staggering $103 million in trading volume . That’s not just impressive; it’s a seismic shift in how we might interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) from the comfort of our familiar centralized exchange (CEX) accounts. Let’s dive deep into what’s fueling this explosive growth and what it means for the future of crypto trading. Unpacking the Phenomenon: Binance Alpha 2.0’s Booming On-Chain Trading Volume Reaching $103 million in trading volume within a mere seven days is no small feat, especially in the dynamic and often volatile world of cryptocurrency. According to Wu Blockchain’s report on X, this impressive figure was achieved through approximately 83,700 individual trades. But what makes Binance Alpha 2.0 so special?

TUT: Coming in second with a solid 13.9% contribution. Brocoli714: Rounding out the top three with 11.2% of the trading volume. These early adopters are likely a mix of seasoned traders eager to explore new opportunities and users curious about on-chain trading but seeking a more accessible entry point. Their activity is a strong indicator of the platform’s appeal and potential for future growth. What’s Next for Binance Alpha 2.0 and the Future of Crypto Trading Platforms? The initial success of Binance Alpha 2.0 raises exciting questions about the future trajectory of crypto trading platforms . Will we see more centralized exchanges embrace this hybrid model, seamlessly integrating on-chain trading capabilities? It certainly seems plausible. The demand for easier access to DeFi is undeniable, and Binance Alpha 2.0 appears to have tapped into a significant unmet need. Here are some potential implications and future developments to watch for: Aspect Potential Future Impact Increased DeFi Adoption Simplified access could onboard a new wave of users to decentralized finance, driving growth and innovation in the DeFi space. Competitive Landscape Other CEXs may feel pressure to develop similar on-chain trading solutions, intensifying competition and potentially leading to even more user-friendly platforms.

For DeFi Beginners: If you’ve been intimidated by the complexities of DeFi, this platform can serve as an excellent starting point, providing a smoother onboarding experience. For Active Traders: If you’re an active trader seeking new opportunities and efficient access to on-chain tokens, Binance Alpha 2.0’s CEX integration could streamline your trading workflow. However, as with any new platform, it’s crucial to conduct your own research, understand the risks involved in crypto trading , and start with amounts you’re comfortable with. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and while Binance Alpha 2.0 simplifies access, it doesn’t eliminate market risks. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Leap in Crypto Accessibility Binance Alpha 2.0’s $103 million trading volume debut is more than just a number; it’s a powerful statement about the demand for simplified access to on-chain trading. By seamlessly integrating with centralized exchanges, Binance has potentially unlocked a new era of decentralized finance accessibility.

In November 2024, Microsoft Incident Response researchers uncovered a remote access Trojan (RAT) called StilachiRAT. This discovery highlights the evolving nature of cyber threats, with the malware combining multiple malicious functions into a single tool for maximum impact. Designed to evade detection and exfiltrate sensitive data, StilachiRAT steals credentials and extracts and decrypts usernames and passwords stored in Google Chrome. It performs extensive system reconnaissance, collecting details such as operating system information, BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) serial numbers, camera presence and active remote desktop protocol (RDP) sessions. With a focus on stealing cryptocurrencies , StilachiRAT scans for up to 20 crypto wallet extensions within Chrome, including those from Coinbase, Fractal, Phantom, Manta and Bitget. It also monitors clipboard activity and running applications, specifically looking for sensitive information like passwords and private keys . Although Microsoft has yet to attribute StilachiRAT to a specific threat actor or region, current observations indicate that it is not yet widely distributed as of March 2025. However, its advanced capabilities make it a significant cybersecurity concern. Did you know? In November 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence found a North Korean hacking group called “Sapphire Sleet” involved in cryptocurrency theft and corporate espionage. How hackers trick users into installing StilachiRAT Hackers employ various deceptive tactics to trick users into installing malware like StilachiRAT using multiple vectors. Such tactics include: Phishing emails: Attackers have been using phishing emails to trick recipients into opening malicious attachments or clicking on harmful links, leading to RAT malware installation. For instance, in November 2024, scamsters sent phishing emails targeting self-hosted help desk software for the delivery of AsyncRat, PureLog Stealer and XWorm RATs. Fake browser extensions: Cybercriminals develop counterfeit browser extensions that mimic popular ones. When users install these malicious extensions, they unknowingly introduce malware like StilachiRAT into their systems. ​ Malicious downloads: Users may inadvertently download StilachiRAT by accessing compromised websites or downloading software from untrustworthy sources. These downloads can be bundled with malicious code that executes upon installation. Exploit kits: Attackers utilize exploit kits to target software vulnerabilities, delivering RATs like StilachiRAT without user interaction. ​Exploit kits enable hackers to automatically manage and deploy exploits against a target computer. Brute-force RDP attacks: Cybercriminals attempt to gain unauthorized access by systematically guessing remote desktop protocol (RDP) credentials, allowing them to install malware remotely. ​ USB droppers: Attackers distribute infected USB drives that automatically install malware when connected to a system. ​ Drive-by downloads: Visiting compromised or malicious websites can result in automatic malware downloads without the user’s knowledge. Fake applications and social media links: Scammers may disguise StilachiRAT as legitimate applications or share them through deceptive links on social media platforms, tricking users into installation. ​ Did you know? In cybersecurity, the term “zero-day vulnerability” is an unknown security flaw in software or hardware. Because the developer is unaware of it, no patch or preventative measures are available to address it. How does StilachiRAT steal crypto wallet data? Designed to bypass traditional security measures, StilachiRAT functions in multiple layers. Understanding its methods, from initial infection to data extraction, is crucial for protecting your digital assets from this potentially devastating threat. Targeting specific digital wallets StilachiRAT focuses on a set of designated cryptocurrency wallet extensions for the Google Chrome browser. It accesses the configurations in the following registry key and checks if any extensions are present. \SOFTWARE\Google\Chrome\PreferenceMACs\Default\extensions.settings StilachiRAT specifically targets the following cryptocurrency wallet extensions: Stealing credentials StilachiRAT obtains Google Chrome’s encryption key from the local state file within the user’s directory. Nevertheless, as this key is initially encrypted when Chrome is installed, the malware uses Windows APIs to decrypt it based on the current user’s context. This enables it to access saved credentials stored in Chrome’s password vault. Extracted credentials originate from the following locations: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Local State, which holds Chrome’s configuration data, inclusive of the encrypted key %LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data, which preserves user credentials input into Chrome. The “Login Data” file constitutes an SQLite database, and the malware extracts credentials using a defined database query. Command-and-control Scammers use “command-and-control” to launch commands like system reboot, credential theft, log clearing, executing applications and manipulating system windows to the malware. They have access to a wide range of commands for espionage, including enumerating open windows, modifying Windows registry values and suspending the system. The command-and-control server has two configured addresses. One is obfuscated, while the other is an IP address in its binary format rather than a regular string. For communications, a channel is established using TCP ports 53, 443 or 16000. StilachiRAT confirms the presence of “tcpview.exe” and halts its execution. It would also postpone the initial connection by two hours to avoid detection. Once the connection is established, the malware transmits a roster of active windows to the server. Observing RDP sessions StilachiRAT observes RDP sessions by recording window details and replicating security tokens to assume user identity. For RDP servers hosting administrative sessions, this is a significant threat. The malware could capture the active session while dynamically initiating foreground windows. Through this process, it could also enumerate all remaining RDP sessions. To acquire permissions for each identified session, it would access the Windows Explorer shell and make a copy of the security tokens or privileges. It uses the acquired permissions to launch applications. Collecting user data and monitoring clipboard StilachiRAT gathers diverse user data, including software installation logs and running applications. It observes active graphical user interface (GUI) windows, their title bar text, and file path and transfers the data to the command-and-control server. Access to this data enables scammers to monitor user actions. The malware also has the ability to observe clipboard data. It can read the clipboard, use search patterns to extract text, and transfer this data to the server. Using this feature, scamsters can launch dedicated searches for passwords, cryptocurrency keys and potentially personal identifiers. Did you know? While Google Chrome is available on macOS, its data storage and system integration are handled differently. MacOS neither uses a Windows registry nor follows the same file system structure or API conventions. How does StilachiRAT evade detection? Scammers can launch StilachiRAT as a Windows service or a standalone component. Regardless of the version in use, there is a system in place to ensure the security mechanism doesn’t remove the malware. Role of observer thread StilachiRAT has an observer thread that monitors the “EXE” and dynamic link library (DLL) files used by the malware. In case the files are missing, they are recreated using an internal copy obtained during initialization. The thread could also recreate the Windows service component by making the necessary modifications in the relevant registry settings and restarting it. Removal of event logs and looping checks To avoid detection, StilachiRAT removes event logs and performs continuous checks for analysis tools and sandbox timers that might block its full activation in virtual environments. It also obfuscates Windows API calls and encodes text strings and values using a custom algorithm, slowing down malware detection software. StilachiRAT employs advanced API-level obfuscation techniques to hinder manual analysis. For example, instead of directly referencing Windows APIs like RegOpenKey(), the malware encodes API names as checksums, which are dynamically resolved at runtime, adding complexity to its concealment strategies. The malware also prevents memory scans from detecting API references. It stores precomputed API checksums in multiple lookup tables, each with a specific XOR value. When executed, StilachiRAT selects the appropriate table based on the hashed API name and applies the correct XOR mask to decode the value. Additionally, cached function pointers are masked with another XOR value, making it difficult for direct memory scans to identify them. How to mitigate malware like StilachiRAT from affecting your device RATs may disguise themselves as legitimate software or updates. To minimize risk, it is important to download software directly from the official developer’s website or trusted sources. Use secure web browsers, which can detect and block phishing sites, scams and malware-hosting pages. Organizations must use software that scans and rewrites email URLs, preventing phishing attacks. Safe attachments are another useful feature that provides an extra layer of protection by scanning email attachments for threats. You need to activate network protection to block access to malicious websites and online threats. Before implementing the feature, audit the network protection feature in a test environment to identify any applications that may be affected. The Microsoft report recommends organizations activate safe links and safe attachments within Office 365 to defend against harmful links and attachments in phishing and related attacks; operate endpoint detection and response systems in block mode; enable protections in Microsoft Defender against potentially unwanted applications (PUAs); and only use web browsers that support functionalities for automatically detecting and preventing malicious websites. Real-time threat intelligence reduces the attack scope and empowers security teams to formulate detection protocols, modify network surveillance, and block malicious domains or actions before a comprehensive attack. Considering StilachiRAT’s evasive nature and capacity to steer clear of forensic analysis, timely detection is important to deter any damage. Did you know? In February 2025, Bybit, a cryptocurrency exchange located in Dubai, experienced a record-breaking $1.5-billion loss due to a significant security breach, marking the largest crypto theft recorded. Signs your device is infected with StilachiRAT Although StilachiRAT is designed to be elusive, there are red flags that can signal its presence. It’s crucial to identify these signs and take action before it’s too late. Unusual system behavior: Your device may run slower than usual, crash unexpectedly, or experience frequent freezes. Unauthorized access: Suspicious logins to online accounts or unexplained password changes could indicate credential theft. Increased network activity: StilachiRAT communicates with remote servers, which might result in abnormal data usage or network slowdowns. Unexpected pop-ups or applications: You may see unfamiliar software, browser extensions or unauthorized changes in settings. Clipboard and browser issues: If you discover copied text or cryptocurrency wallet addresses to be altered, it is a sign that the malware may be manipulating clipboard data. How to remove StilachiRAT malware from your device StilachiRAT’s presence on your device is a threat to your crypto holdings. To remove StilachiRAT from your device, follow these steps: Disconnect from the internet: This prevents the malware from communicating with remote servers, sending data or receiving instructions. Run a full security scan: Use a trusted antivirus or anti-malware tool to remove StilachiRAT. To be doubly sure, you could use more than one. Uninstall suspicious programs: Uninstall any suspicious or unknown applications from your system settings. Remove malicious browser extensions: Check your browser for unfamiliar extensions, especially in Google Chrome, and delete them. Reset system settings: Reset browser settings to remove lingering threats. You can generally find the option in the device’s settings menu. Update software and security patches: Keep your operating system and applications upgraded to prevent reinfection. Enable real-time network protection: Turn on an anti-malware solution that activates network protection for future security.

Young disclosed this on X while responding to the news that Fidelity wants to issue its own tokenized fund on Ethereum. According to Young , stablecoin issuers will decide the platform for tokenized treasury products, and for one, Ethena Labs appears to have chosen BUIDL on Ethereum. He said: “Stablecoin issuers decide where the demand for these treasury products will sit at scale, Ethena holds >60% of BUIDL alone and accounted for 95%+ of the growth in BUIDL in the last three weeks.” Ethena leads BUIDL’s RWA surge BUIDL, a tokenized treasury product issued by Securitize and BlackRock in March, has been on a parabolic ride recently. Its assets under management (AUM) increased by more than 127% in the last 30 days, enabling it to cross the $1 billion mark. Most of these gains are due to Ethena Labs, which recently allocated $200 million to the product. Interestingly, Ethena’s allocation accounts for over 60% of BUIDL’s value. This is due to the tokenized treasury product serving as the reserve asset for Ethena stablecoin USDtb. According to Defillama , the stablecoin that Ethena launched in December 2024 already has a market cap of $1.182 billion. Unlike Ethena’s flagship product, the USDe, the USDtb is like regular stablecoins such as Tether USDT and Circle USDC. However, its reserve asset is mostly tokenized treasury funds rather than physical treasury products. BlackRock BUIDL accounts for over 70% of the reserve assets backing USDtb . The other assets backing the stablecoin are USDC, with $350.18 million, and only $27 worth of USDT. BlackRock BUIDL nearing $2 billion as Ethereum leads RWA issuance Meanwhile, BlackRock BUIDL is now on its way to hitting $2 billion in AUM after recent developments. Presently, the tokenized fund has $1.467 billion in total asset value after more than doubling in the past month. However, it could see a more substantial increase after winning the Sky (formerly MakerDAO) Tokenization Grand Prix, through which DeFi lending platform Spark will allocate $1 billion to tokenized assets. Sky recently announced BUIDL as one of the winners, along with two other tokenized products. According to the announcement , Spark will allocate $500 million to BlackRock BUIDL, $200 million to Centrifuge JTRSY, and $300 million to Superstate USTB. Steakhouse Financial evaluated 39 applicants before selecting these three products, and Sky Governance’s final approval vote is set for April 3. Ethereum dominates the charts for RWA assets value and products. Source: rwa.xyz If the Sky community approves this proposal, it will represent a milestone not just for BUIDL but also for the real-world assets (RWA) sector. Tokenized US treasuries already have a total asset value of $4.77 billion and could reach $6 billion in the next few weeks. Interestingly, Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain network for RWA activity, with 66.49% of the market share and $4.759 in AUM from 140 products. The network could soon see more products after leading asset manager Fidelity applied to the US Securities and Exchange Commission to register tokenized US dollar money market funds that will initially launch on Ethereum. Fidelity’s application has led some analysts to question the need for a new blockchain network for RWA when all major asset issuers continue to use Ethereum. Blockworks research analyst Dan Smith noted that the big names continue to choose Ethereum to launch despite recent announcements from chains claiming they are “optimized for RWA issuance.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH has managed to bounce from the $1,900 support zone and is now pushing toward the $2,200 resistance area. However, the asset remains well below the 200-day moving average, which is around $2,900, which continues to act as a major hurdle. The RSI is gradually climbing but still hasn’t entered overbought territory. Unless ETH decisively breaks above $2,400 and holds, the downtrend structure remains intact, with the $1,900 and $1,600 levels acting as key supports to watch. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows Ethereum forming an ascending channel, recently pushing towards the upper boundary near $2,150. This rally from the $1,900 support zone has been strong, but the asset is approaching a confluence of resistance levels, including the $2,200 zone marked by previous breakdowns. RSI has also entered the overbought region, hinting at possible exhaustion. A breakout above $2,200 could shift the short-term bias bullish, while rejection from the current range could pull ETH back toward the $1,900 zone. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Long Liquidations The long liquidations chart reveals a sharp spike in recent months, particularly during ETH’s drop below $2,000. These mass liquidations wiped out leveraged long positions, contributing to heightened volatility. Although liquidation events have now cooled down, the market remains vulnerable to sharp moves if leverage builds up again. The previous spikes indicate a fragile sentiment among speculators, and any sharp rejection at resistance zones could trigger another cascade of long liquidations, reinforcing bearish pressure. Overall, price stability and a sustainable recovery will require a reduction in excessive leverage and stronger spot-driven demand.

As the crypto market gears up for another bull run, investors are wondering which will be the next altcoin to do so. Many analysts point to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which is rapidly gaining traction. More than 6500 investors have joined the project so far at its current Phase 3 value of $0.02 while the entire platform exceeds $4.7 million in worth. After the forthcoming price surge, the platform will reach a new value of $0.025 with a 25% increase from current market rates. Investors have limited time to secure tokens before the prices spike since over 65% of phase 2 has already been sold out. The price is $0.06 during the launch yet Phase 3 investors will reach 200% profit with their initial purchase of $0.02. Mutuum Finance presale gains momentum The investor sentiment-driven growth of MUTM relies on its basic DeFi lending model which provides its momentum for advancement. Through Phase 3 investors have an opportunity to acquire MUTM tokens at $0.02 yet the value will rise to $0.025 after the following period begins. Strategy-based MUTM investors will achieve a 200% profit estimation while the platform functions at a $0.06 market value supported by its strong tokenomics foundation. The funding campaign for MUTM has attracted many investors who pushed the platform’s capitalization beyond $4.7 million thus proving market interest in platforms connecting lending resources to growth potentials. Through its automated Buy-and-Distribute mechanism the ecosystem of MUTM purchases tokens in the market and distributes them to stakers during specific time intervals. The model maintains regular market purchases which stands out as a rare phenomenon against the general volatile and speculative market character. Mutuum Finance is in the process of having its smart contract audited by CertiK, a key measure to enhance security and trust. The official audit report will be published on their social media once completed. Innovative growth strategy Mutuum Finance defines its identity through its development of mtToken technology which serves as an investment token for both ETH and DAI alongside additional deposit assets. They can earn money from interest-accumulating mtTokens while maintaining complete access to their funds. The platform maintains participant deposits within its pool network while giving different APY yield rates to depositors alongside loan functions for users who have assets as collateral. On the platform users obtain $5,000 USDT by depositing $7,000 ETH with an optimized security measure that controls the loan-to-collateral ratio. A smarter alternative to other coins Mutuum Finance maintains its financial operations in a stable long-term pattern. Investors select initiatives with long-term value because the presale operation completes swiftly. An opportunity to buy MUTM for $0.25 will soon cease to exist as specialists project that its market worth will increase. Crypto investors who once saw life-changing gains from Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are now looking for the next breakout opportunity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be a strong contender, combining an innovative DeFi lending model with a solid tokenomic foundation. More than 6,500 investors have already joined, contributing over $4.7 million, while the presale price of $0.02 offers a rare chance for massive early gains. Analysts predict a rise to $0.06 at launch and a long-term target of $3.40. The opportunity to invest before the next price jump to $0.025 is running out. Act now and secure your MUTM tokens today and position yourself for potential exponential returns.

Do you thrive on discovering promising projects before they hit the mainstream? If you answered yes, then you’re in for a treat! Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, is known for fostering innovation, and their Binance Alpha initiative is a testament to this commitment. It’s designed to shine a light on early-stage crypto projects that show significant potential. And guess what? Two new tokens, AGON and BUBB, have just been added to the Binance Alpha roster! Let’s dive into what this means for the crypto sphere and why these tokens are capturing attention. What is Binance Alpha and Why Should You Care? Binance Alpha is more than just a list; it’s a curated selection of crypto projects handpicked by Binance Exchange. Think of it as a launchpad, but for information and visibility rather than immediate trading. It’s an initiative that aims to highlight projects that are still in their nascent stages but demonstrate strong fundamentals and the potential for future growth. Why should you care? Because getting in early on promising crypto projects can be incredibly rewarding. Binance Alpha offers a valuable window into the crypto ecosystem, helping you discover tokens that might just be the next big movers and shakers. It’s about getting ahead of the curve and understanding the landscape of emerging digital assets. Key Benefits of Binance Alpha: Early Discovery: Binance Alpha helps you identify promising crypto projects before they gain widespread attention. This early insight can be crucial for investors and enthusiasts alike. Curated Selection: Unlike the vast ocean of cryptocurrencies, Binance Alpha presents a curated list, saving you time and effort in sifting through countless projects. Binance Spotlight: Being featured in Binance Alpha provides projects with significant visibility within the crypto community, potentially boosting their growth trajectory. Educational Value: Following Binance Alpha can educate you about the criteria Binance uses to evaluate early-stage projects, enhancing your understanding of market trends and project fundamentals. AGON and BUBB: The New Entrants to Binance Alpha Now, let’s talk about the stars of today’s announcement: AGON and BUBB. These two tokens have been selected to join the ranks of Binance Alpha , signaling Binance’s recognition of their potential. According to the New Listings Feed’s Telegram channel, these tokens were chosen based on several factors, including community engagement and current market trends. But what exactly are AGON and BUBB, and why are they generating buzz? AGON: Powering the Future of Gaming? While specific details about AGON and BUBB require deeper research into their respective whitepapers and project websites (which is highly recommended!), we can infer some potential areas based on the current crypto landscape. AGON might be associated with the burgeoning GameFi sector. Many crypto projects are focused on revolutionizing the gaming industry by integrating blockchain technology. This could involve: Play-to-Earn Mechanics: AGON could be a token within a play-to-earn gaming ecosystem, rewarding players for their participation and achievements. NFT Integration: It might facilitate the trading and ownership of in-game assets as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), giving players true ownership of their digital collectibles. Decentralized Gaming Platforms: AGON could be part of a decentralized gaming platform, offering more transparency and control to players and developers. BUBB: Innovating in the Social or Metaverse Space? On the other hand, BUBB might be venturing into the realms of social crypto or the metaverse. With the metaverse gaining traction, numerous projects are exploring how blockchain can enhance digital interactions and virtual experiences. BUBB could potentially be involved in: Social Tokens: BUBB might function as a social token within a specific community or platform, enabling users to engage, reward content creators, or access exclusive features. Metaverse Applications: It could be integrated into a metaverse project, serving as the native currency for transactions, virtual land purchases, or digital asset ownership within that virtual world. Decentralized Social Networks: BUBB could be part of a decentralized social network, aiming to give users more control over their data and online interactions. Navigating the Binance Alpha Landscape: What to Keep in Mind It’s crucial to understand that while Binance Alpha is a fantastic resource for discovering potential crypto projects, inclusion in the list is not a guarantee of a future listing on Binance Exchange itself. Binance Alpha is primarily for spotlighting and awareness. Think of it as a ‘ones to watch’ list rather than an ‘upcoming listings’ announcement. Here are some key points to remember: Important Considerations Regarding Binance Alpha: No Listing Guarantee: Being in Binance Alpha does not automatically mean AGON or BUBB (or any other token) will be listed on the Binance exchange for trading. Due Diligence is Key: Binance Alpha is a starting point for your research, not the endpoint. Always conduct thorough due diligence on any crypto project before considering investment. Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Early-stage projects, while potentially high-reward, also carry higher risks. Community and Trends: Binance considers community engagement and market trends when selecting tokens for Binance Alpha. Keep an eye on these factors yourself as you explore these projects. Actionable Insights: Your Next Steps with AGON and BUBB So, crypto projects AGON and BUBB are on Binance Alpha – what should you do now? Here’s a step-by-step approach to delve deeper and make informed decisions: Research, Research, Research: Visit the official websites of AGON and BUBB. Read their whitepapers to understand their technology, use cases, tokenomics, and roadmaps. Community Engagement: Join their communities on platforms like Telegram, Discord, and Twitter. Gauge the community’s sentiment, activity level, and the project’s responsiveness to its users. Market Analysis: Explore available market data (if any). Look at their price history (if traded), trading volume, and market capitalization (if available on platforms like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap). Risk Assessment: Understand the risks involved. Early-stage crypto projects are inherently riskier than established ones. Assess your risk tolerance before considering any investment. Stay Updated: Keep following Binance Alpha and the news around AGON and BUBB. Project developments and market conditions can change rapidly. Conclusion: Embracing the Excitement of Early Crypto Discovery The addition of AGON and BUBB to Binance Alpha underscores the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency space. Binance Alpha serves as a valuable compass, pointing towards potentially groundbreaking projects. While it’s crucial to remember that this is not an investment recommendation, it is an exciting opportunity to learn about and potentially get involved with projects at the forefront of crypto innovation. By staying informed, conducting thorough research, and understanding the nuances of early-stage crypto, you can navigate this exciting frontier with greater confidence.

The futures closed at $84,190 at the end of the last week and opened about $1,000 higher at $85,160. That sets the stage for a drop back because bitcoin has developed a tendency to fill these CME futures gaps. As of mid-March, it had filled the most recent gap, which was created during the November rally following President Donald Trump’s election victory. That gap was fully closed when bitcoin dropped to $76,700 in mid-March. The gaps occur because spot bitcoin trades 24/7 while CME futures operate only 23 hours a day, Sunday through Friday. When there’s a significant price movement during the CME’s off-hours, a gap forms between the previous close and the next day’s open. Historically , bitcoin has often retraced to fill such gaps.

According to a tweet by financial data platform ‘Unusual Whales,’ these traders are purchasing $100 puts for June 20, 2025, which signals their belief that Tesla’s stock will continue to drop in the coming months. The post also noted that smaller traders are beginning to follow this move, driven by the momentum from the subreddit’s posts . Tesla Troubles This activity comes at a time when Tesla’s stock has faced a significant downturn. Data reveals that the figure has dropped by almost 50% from its peak in December 2024. While Elon Musk previously warned short-sellers of the consequences they would face when Tesla’s self-driving tech and Optimus robots became mainstream, the market has instead turned against the company. Tesla’s stock, which was once expected to soar, now sits at around $248 per share. This has created a wave of profit for the very short-sellers Musk had warned, with them reportedly making $16.2 billion in profits in the past quarter alone. Tesla’s struggles can be attributed to increased competition from Chinese EV makers like the Shenzhen-based BYD, which has introduced an advanced charging system that eclipses Tesla’s, as well as shifting market sentiments. Gerber Calls for Leadership Change Additionally, Trump, along with Musk’s leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has initiated significant federal workforce reductions aimed at streamlining government operations and reducing spending. This initiative has led to widespread layoffs across various agencies, sparking legal challenges and public protests concerned about impacts on essential public services. Despite Tesla’s technological edge, the ongoing leadership controversies, coupled with Musk’s focus on X, have created significant challenges for the company. Critics, including long-time Tesla investor Ross Gerber, are calling for a change in leadership while citing Musk’s divisive public image and its negative impact on Tesla’s reputation. In a statement to Sky News, Gerber said, “There’s no question (Musk) has been committed to his job at the government, that’s where he’s spending his time. He is not running Tesla. I think Tesla needs a new CEO. The business has been neglected for too long.” Consumer sentiment is also affected, with some opting for competitors like European EV brands, particularly after negative publicity surrounding Musk’s involvement in US policies and his controversial comments.

XRP and Bitcoin dominate the positive sentiment, marking a combined net inflow of $730 million. In the latest XRP news, the Ripple coin secured the second spot, contrasting with Ethereum, which experienced the highest outflows. Let’s analyze the positive momentum of XRP and BTC, and explore its potential impact, especially in light of their ongoing rivalry. XRP News: Bitcoin and Ripple Coin Lead Weekly Inflows According to CoinShares’ weekly report , the digital asset investment products marked a total inflow of $644 million. While Bitcoin dominated the inflows with a staggering $724 million, XRP ranked second with a notable inflow of $6.7 million. Closely following XRP is Solana, with a notable inflow of $6.4 million. Other altcoins like Polygon and Chainlink have also seen modest gains of $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Notably, Ethereum is the largest loser with a weekly outflow of $86 million. Sui and Short Bitcoin have also experienced significant outflows. Altcoins including Polkadot, Tron, and Algorand have also reported outflows of $1.3m, $0.95m, and $0.82m, respectively. Bitcoin Sets Trend Reversal For five consecutive weeks, the digital asset investment products had experienced a negative sentiment, marking significant outflows. Although Bitcoin bore the brunt of the outflows , it has now become the trendsetter, emerging as the biggest gainer of the week. This development occurs amidst the increasing rivalry between XRP enthusiasts and Bitcoin maximalists. As XRP’s potential inclusion in the US reserve has sparked intense debate, Bitcoin manages to maintain its positive sentiment. Recently, XRP lawyer Bill Morgan highlighted the Trump government’s lean towards Bitcoin, asserting that it could undermine the country’s crypto initiatives. XRP Wins Japanese Payment Deal Adding intrigue to the prevailing positive sentiment, a Japanese real-estate firm, Open House, has embraced XRP, DOGE, and SOL for payments. This marks a significant milestone for XRP’s adoption. Amidst the ongoing Bitcoin vs XRP debate, Bill Morgan ridiculed BTC for being snubbed by the company, which instead chose XRP, along with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL). His tweet read, “But not Bitcoin for payments?” However, his tweet was promptly contradicted as Open House previously selected BTC and ETH for payments. In January, the real-estate firm embraced debuted crypto payments Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the latest development, the company expanded its crypto payment options, including XRP, DOGE, and SOL.

Crypto Fear and Greed Index Rises as BTC ETF Inflows Rise, But Tariff Risks Loom While the index is still in fear territory, it is approaching neutrality (49%), indicating a broader easing of risk aversion in the market. The fear and greed index is an index used to measure the effects of investors' fear and greed (greed) on the markets. It can also be considered as a graphic indicator of investors' emotional reactions to market movements. A key factor driving the increased sentiment has been strong inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs, with investors purchasing 8,775 BTC last week. This increase in institutional demand suggests renewed interest in crypto despite recent market volatility. However, tariff hikes scheduled for April 2 could once again weigh on risk assets, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The lawsuit is against developer Chen Shanxuan and three anonymous individuals with access to the compromised wallets. Legal Notices Served Via Onchain Message In a first, the Hong Kong court instructed an injunction by onchain message, effectively serving the legal documents on the anonymous wallets in question. These included a writ of summons for the defendants to appear for a return date hearing. Infini warned that any subsequent holders of the stolen funds would not meet the status of “bona fide purchasers”, alerting the crypto community that the funds remain legally contested. Bounty Offered, No Funds Returned Infini disclosed that it has collected IP and device data related to the hackers and is continuing to monitor the wallet addresses. While it offered a bounty agreement—promising no further action if 80% of the funds were returned—the attacker has been silent and has yet to return any assets. Exploit Coincided with Bybit Hack Cybersecurity specialists think the timing of the hack was deliberate. FearsOff COO Marwan Hachem posited that the exploit came hot on the heels of Bybit’s $1.4 billion hack on Feb. 21. While the world was focused on Bybit’s breach, the hackers of Infini might have spied a chance to attack unnoticed. “The timing was not coincidental,” Hachem said. “The attackers probably saw a window of decreased attention.” As Infini continues with its legal action and investigation, the case sets a precedent for onchain legal enforcement in disputes related to cryptocurrency.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|USDC,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-03-24 12:21:55

Thus, the company is now halfway through the one million bitcoin milestone. $MSTR has acquired 6,911 BTC for ~$584.1 million at ~$84,529 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 7.7% YTD 2025. As of 3/23/2025, @Strategy holds 506,137 BTC acquired for ~$33.7 billion at ~$66,608 per bitcoin. $STRK https://t.co/3vSGnTUVcE — Michael Saylor (@saylor) March 24, 2025 The company, which recently rebranded from MicroStrategy to just Strategy and now includes BTC’s logo, has been on a massive accumulation spree ever since the US elections in November last year. Although it seemed to have slowed down recently, which was evident by last week’s rather modest purchase of 130 BTC (bought for $10.7 million at then-prices), it’s back on the gas pedal now. Saylor, who stepped down as CEO last year but continues to lead all bitcoin-related initiatives, announced on X that the firm had spent $584.1 million to accumulate 6,911 BTC at an average price of $84,529. This puts the company’s total stash above the coveted half-a-million mark at 506,137 BTC, purchased for $33.7 billion (or an average price of $66,608). Given BTC’s price surge in the past several years, Strategy’s holdings are now valued at $44.3 billion, which means that its unrealized profit sits at roughly $10 billion.

42265686,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=698719,1742822123,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42265686.jpeg,The US economy runs on spendings of the 1% – but that clock may be ticking,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-economy-runs-spending-clock-ticking/,"The economy in the United States is getting squeezed by the very people who’ve been keeping it alive. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that rich Americans—who’ve been responsible for almost half of all consumer spending—are starting to tighten their wallets. Their spending has carried the economy through pandemic shocks, rising interest rates, and inflation. But now, with stocks crashing and confidence fading, that lifeline is weakening fast. Over the last month, trillions of dollars have been erased from U.S. stock markets. The S&P 500 dropped more than 10% from its recent peak, putting it in correction territory. It’s still down 8% from its February high. This plunge followed growing concerns about President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war . The market chaos is making high-income earners nervous, and they’re starting to back off from the kind of spending that has kept the economy running. Rich Americans rethink their spending as markets fall David Lowell, a 66-year-old live-events producer from Roswell, Georgia, said on Monday that he spent $40,000 remodeling his kitchen back in October. Back then, markets were climbing, and his retirement savings looked solid. But things have changed. His portfolio has dropped by hundreds of thousands of dollars in the last few weeks. Now, he’s pausing any big purchases. “I feel a little uneasy after the last six weeks of this complete stock market capitulation,” David said . He checks his investment accounts four times a day. Federal Reserve officials last week responded to the financial uncertainty by slashing their growth projection for 2025. In December, they expected the economy to expand 2.1%. Now, they’re saying 1.7%. Their reason: they’re unsure how Trump’s trade policies will affect growth going forward. Troy Ludtka, senior U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities Americas, explained the problem. “We’re now at a point where the stock market—a strong stock market—drives consumption,” Troy said. “But the inverse is also true: A weak stock market can lower consumption.” The behavior Troy described is called the “wealth effect.” It’s a theory from behavioral economics that says when people feel richer—thanks to rising home values and stock gains—they tend to spend more, even if their income doesn’t change. That’s what kept rich Americans spending during the past few years, even while lower-income families struggled with debt and higher prices. The top 10% have fueled the economy but may be pulling back According to economists Thomas Ferguson and Servaas Storm, writing for the Institute for New Economic Thinking, the wealth gains of the richest 10% between 2020 and 2023 were nearly unmatched in history. That top slice of the population kept spending even as their inflation-adjusted incomes shrank. Their spending alone was enough to push total consumer spending above long-term trends. Moody’s Analytics recently found that Americans earning over $250,000 a year now account for 50% of all U.S. consumer spending. In the 1990s, that group only contributed about one-third. The problem now is that this group is starting to cut back. Frances Donald, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, said the current situation is split between income groups. “What we have witnessed in the past two to three years is actually two different economic cycles between higher-income and lower-income Americans,” Frances said. “Anything that impacts your top 10% of Americans now becomes disproportionately important.” That’s exactly what’s happening. The ultra-wealthy kept the economy going while working-class households pulled back. Now, both groups may be cutting at the same time. And when that happens, there’s no backup plan. Even though jobs are still available and wages have gone up, especially for low-income workers, that hasn’t been enough to drive growth alone. The spending power of the rich has been a bigger factor than the Fed or many economists realized. Consumer spending slows across the board New government data from the U.S. Department of Commerce showed that retail sales increased less than expected in February. January saw the biggest drop in sales since July 2021. Spending at restaurants and bars fell last month by the most in a year. Luxury spending is also down. Credit card data from Citigroup showed a 5% drop in spending on high-end brands in February compared to the same time last year. And plans for international travel are slowing. A February survey from the Conference Board said only 17% of Americans plan to take a trip abroad in the next six months. That’s the lowest share in five months. Consumer confidence is taking a hit. A March report from the University of Michigan said overall sentiment is now at the lowest level in more than two years. People’s expectations for their own finances dropped to the lowest level the university has ever recorded. Another report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that the number of people who expect their financial situation to worsen in the next year just hit a 15-month high. Spending behavior is changing because people don’t trust the direction things are going. They’re not confident in the markets. They’re not confident in policy. And that’s bleeding into how they use their money. Delinquencies rise among high earners There’s also been a rise in late payments—especially among high-income earners. Data from credit scoring company VantageScore showed that the number of consumers making more than $150,000 a year who were 60 to 89 days late on debt payments has more than doubled since January 2023. That’s compared to only a 30% increase in delinquencies among low-income earners during that same time. Rikard Bandebo, chief economist for VantageScore, said this trend could signal trouble. “If you start seeing that this group is coming under more pressure, that may well have a concerning picture for how consumer spending is going to evolve,” Rikard said. Thomas Ferguson added that when wealthy people feel pressure, they don’t just reduce spending slowly—they stop all at once. “It’s not like we continue dribbling out some low rate of our wealth. We clam up,” Thomas said. He pointed out that while we haven’t hit that point yet, the signs are moving in that direction. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

42266594,https://blockworks.co/news/projects-to-watch-pantera,1742822351,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Two projects Pantera’s Cosmo Jiang is watching,https://blockworks.co/news/projects-to-watch-pantera,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The AI/crypto narrative seems to have died down, despite some mentions of it during DAS (AI itself was a hot topic). But while the narrative may not be top of mind, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist anymore. Pantera’s Cosmo Jiang believes that both AI and crypto — together and separately — are two of the biggest disruptors today. Jiang’s background is in tech investing, which makes the way he views opportunities unique in comparison to some players in the space. For example, Jiang said that the wildly volatile nature of crypto can simply be boiled down to the fact that it’s a space dominated by startups, which sometimes justifies the craziness. Eventually, though, Jiang believes that we’ll see a more fundamental focus enter the market via institutional capital. Jiang specifically is looking for a return on time as well as the “biggest growth areas” that’ll be rife with disruption — particularly areas where there’s an abundance of debate and disagreement. It’s obvious to Jiang that “AI is uniquely enabled by crypto, and that blockchain … can be helped by AI in a few ways.” The talent pool also possesses a heavy amount of crossover already. “AI naturally creates abundance and blockchain naturally creates scarcity,” he noted. It wouldn’t surprise Jiang if we see a world — 10 or 15 years down the line — where AI is as frequently used as the internet is today. And that’s where he has some alpha for all of you. Jiang is closely watching projects like Grass , which he praised as doing an “incredible job getting multimodal data in a very unique way that could not have been done without a decentralized network. Lo and behold, they’re now selling their data to the largest AI companies that you and I all probably use in our everyday life.” Then there’s Bittensor, which is dominating in token incentives. Pantera previously showed support for Bittensor, and a 2023 update from Bittensor said the venture capital firm bought TAO as well as expressing interest in “supporting the ecosystem.” “Historically, open source developers or researchers have never been able to be compensated for their open source work,” Jiang said. But the idea is that you could compensate them with token incentives that could be monetized. That then becomes a “very sustainable system.” Bittensor “is such an interesting instantiation of the first time on a very global basis and a bit scaled basis, open-source research can be profitable for those who don’t want to go to big tech companies and become close source.” And there you have it folks — some early morning alpha to go with your coffee.

On Friday, the Treasury Department's sanctions watchdog removed Tornado Cash from its global blacklist while also removing over 100 ether (ETH) addresses from the Specially Designated Nationals list. The platform was backlisted in 2022 for its alleged role in laundering $445 million stolen by the North Korea-linked Lazarus cybercrime group. The Treasury then argued that the action of delisting Tornado Cash resolved the issue at hand and that a final court ruling ordering it to remove the crypto mixer from its sanctions list was no longer necessary, according to a court filing dated March 21. Grewal, however, said the Treasury's attempts to have the case declared moot is an attempt to sidestep a ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that will leave the door open for a renewed blacklisting and sanctions. ""After grudgingly delisting TC, they now claim they've mooted any need for a final court judgment. But that's not the law, and they know it,"" Grewal said on X. ""Under the voluntary cessation exception, a defendant's decision to end a challenged practice moots a case only if the defendant can show that the practice cannot 'reasonably be expected to recur.'"" Coinbase funded the court case that made its way to the appeals court, Van Loon vs. Treasury . Grewal cited the example of the FBI v. Fikre case, in which the government removed Yonas Fikre, a U.S. citizen and Sudanese emigree, from the No Fly List, and argued in court that this action rendered Fikre's lawsuit moot. Fikre had brought a lawsuit alleging that the government unlawfully placed him on the No Fly List. But, the Ninth Circuit reversed that decision saying that the party seeking to moot a case based on its own voluntary cessation of challenged conduct must show that the conduct cannot “reasonably be expected to recur.” In Tornado Cash's case, the Treasury hasn't provided any assurance that it won't re-sanction the crypto mixer. ""Here, Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from the SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again. That's not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,"" Grewal noted.",Policy|Coinbase|Tornado Cash,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-24 13:24:50

Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a major turnaround with $744.4 million in net inflows last week, breaking a five-week outflow streak. Additionally, discussions around tokenizing US gold reserves have resurfaced, with experts noticing that these efforts could raise broader awareness about Bitcoin's decentralized advantage. Fear of Mistakes Is the Real Barrier to Bitcoin Wealth Robert Kiyosaki, the bestselling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, once again voiced his support for Bitcoin. This time, he warned that the fear of making mistakes—what he calls FOMM—could prevent many from achieving generational wealth. In a post shared on X , Kiyosaki drew a distinction between two common investor mindsets: FOMO, the fear of missing out, and FOMM, the fear of making mistakes. While those driven by FOMO often rush into assets like Bitcoin and potentially reap rewards, those paralyzed by FOMM tend to hesitate and ultimately miss out. Kiyosaki warned that, if history repeats itself, those fearful of making mistakes will wait until Bitcoin surpasses $200,000 and then claim it’s too expensive to buy. He firmly believes that this mindset, more than any market condition, is what keeps people from building wealth. Reiterating his long-held belief in Bitcoin’s potential, Kiyosaki said he still sees the asset climbing to $250,000 in 2025, driven by increasing institutional adoption, its fixed supply, and growing distrust in fiat currencies. Kiyosaki is known for his deep skepticism of traditional financial systems, and sees Bitcoin as a way to protect oneself from inflation, government overreach, and what he describes as “fake money.” He even called Bitcoin the greatest opportunity in history, and argued that too many people are held back by a deeply ingrained fear of failure that is often instilled in them by the education system. According to Kiyosaki, this fear prevents people from learning through action and taking the kinds of financial risks that lead to success. To those still hesitant, Kiyosaki recommended turning to respected voices in the Bitcoin space like Jeff Booth, Michael Saylor, Samson Mow, and Max Keiser. He pointed out that real financial education isn’t coming from classrooms or Wall Street anymore. Now, it’s accessible to anyone through platforms like YouTube. In his view, the worst mistake someone can make today is not buying Bitcoin, and allowing fear to stop them from acting. Bitcoin ETFs Break Outflow Streak Traders’ FOMM could reduce as spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States broke a five-week streak of net outflows after recording a net inflow of $744.4 million in the week ending March 21. This was the strongest weekly performance for these funds in eight weeks and extended their daily inflow streak to six consecutive trading sessions. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the charge by accounting for $537.5 million of the total, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $136.5 million. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) The renewed inflows come after a difficult period for the crypto market and global economy, which was weighed down by trade tensions and rising concerns over a potential recession. Earlier this year, Bitcoin ETFs saw their highest weekly net inflows in 2025, with $1.96 billion during the week ending Jan. 17 and $1.76 billion the next week. That period also coincided with Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20, the same day Donald Trump was inaugurated as US President. However, after that peak, Bitcoin dropped to the $78,000 range due to a broader market correction. In contrast, Ethereum ETFs continued to face pressure and extended their net outflow streak to four weeks. During the same period ending March 21, Ethereum funds saw $102.9 million in outflows, with $74 million attributed to BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Despite the short-term weakness in Ethereum ETFs, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund offered a sign of institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term utility. The fund focuses on tokenized real-world assets, and now holds a record $1.15 billion worth of Ether. This is up from $990 million a week ago. This increase means that there is still strong confidence in Ethereum as a leading platform for asset tokenization. Crypto fear and greed index ( Alternative ) Overall market sentiment also improved, which was reflected in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . The Index rose to a score of 45 from 32 the past week. Still, Singapore-based QCP Capital urged caution, warning that tariff escalations expected on April 2 could reignite pressure on risk assets and dampen optimism surrounding the current rebound. Tokenizing US Gold Could Boost Bitcoin A proposal to tokenize or track the United States’ gold reserves on a blockchain recently gained some traction, but it wouldn’t operate in a trustless manner like Bitcoin, according to Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG). In a note that was published on March 21, Cipolaro addressed the recent ideas floated by figures in the Trump administration, including Elon Musk, to use blockchain technology for greater transparency around US gold holdings and government spending. Summary of Cipolaro’s note While crypto executives have voiced their support for the concept, Cipolaro pointed out that blockchains themselves are limited in their capabilities and rely on external input for context. For instance, Bitcoin doesn’t know its own price or the current time, he said. Cipolaro argued that tokenizing gold reserves or tracking their movement on a blockchain could indeed help improve transparency and simplify audits. However, he warned that such systems will still depend on centralized institutions to provide and verify the data—unlike Bitcoin, which was designed to eliminate the need for centralized trust. Despite this limitation, Cipolaro said that these efforts are not in competition with cryptocurrencies and could actually help raise awareness of the broader crypto market, potentially benefiting Bitcoin in the long run. The conversation around gold transparency was reignited amid calls for an independent audit of the United States’ gold reserves. Senator Rand Paul recently suggested that Elon Musk’s federal efficiency campaign should look into the nation's gold holdings, particularly those stored at Fort Knox, which houses roughly half of the country's reserves. Although the US Treasury already conducts monthly audits and publishes reports on its gold holdings, people like Trump and Musk echoed some of the longstanding conspiracy theories about whether the gold is actually still there. Trump and Musk both advocated for a more independent verification process. The vaults at Fort Knox were last publicly opened in 2017 for a visit by then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and before that, in 1974 for a congressional delegation and a group of journalists. According to the US Mint, no major movement of gold has occurred at Fort Knox for many years, apart from minimal samples used for purity testing.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-24 13:25:41

The decline points to a sharp reduction in demand for Ethereum’s blockspace. The EIP-1559 upgrade, implemented in 2021, aimed to simplify transaction fees and reduce ETH supply by burning the base fee in each transaction. High Network Activity Can Turn Ethereum Deflationary Under EIP-1559 During periods of high usage, the EIP-1559 mechanism can make Ethereum deflationary . However, current network conditions suggest otherwise. Based on recent data from Ultrasound.money , Ethereum’s supply is now expected to grow by 0.76% annually. The low burn rate aligns with falling on-chain activity. Metrics such as active addresses, new address creation, transaction count, and daily trading volume have all seen significant drops in recent weeks. The seven-day moving average of active addresses recently dipped to its lowest level since October 2024. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s transaction fees have also plummeted to their lowest level since late August, averaging just $0.41 per transfer. The significant decrease marks a stark contrast to the $15.21 high seen in the past two years, indicating potential bullish sentiment for Ethereum’s long-term price outlook. These trends raise concerns about slowing user engagement on Ethereum, especially amid growing competition from Layer 2 networks and alternative blockchains offering lower fees and faster transactions. Ethereum burn rate hits a record low: only 53 ETH (~$106K) removed from circulation on March 22. Network activity is slowing too, with active addresses and transactions dropping to multi-year lows. #Ethereum #Crypto pic.twitter.com/eDvz8JM4Vf — TradeDucky (@tradeducky) March 24, 2025 As reported, Standard Chartered has also significantly revised its 2025 price forecast for Ethereum, cutting it from $10,000 to $4,000 amid the rapid expansion of Layer 2 networks. According to Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s global head of digital assets research, platforms like Base are now generating substantial profits from within the Ethereum ecosystem, contributing to the revised outlook. Instead of supporting ETH’s price, the adoption of L2 networks has shaved off $50 billion from its market capitalization. Standard Chartered expects this trend to continue, further diminishing Ethereum’s influence. Fidelity Taps Ethereum Blockchain for Treasury Fund Filing Despite the drop in demand for the Ethereum network, the blockchain is still the top choice for asset tokenization, with over $3.3 billion in tokenized assets. More recently, Fidelity Investments filed to register a tokenized version of its US dollar money market fund on Ethereum. The move aligns the $5.8 trillion asset manager with industry giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, both of which are exploring real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Furthermore, a significant on-chain metric supporting ETH’s long-term bullish case is its rapidly declining exchange supply . As of now, only 6.38% of Ethereum’s total supply remains on centralized exchanges, marking the lowest level since its inception. This trend suggests that investors are moving ETH into cold storage, a signal that they intend to hold rather than sell.

However, a new performer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is aiming to steal the spotlight with a projected 17,040% surge. The project is in Phase 3 presale. Investors acquired are more than 6500 presale tokens to produce a dynamic level of investor support worth $4.7 million. Mutuum Finance Phase 3 has already sold out over 65% of it. Those entering now can expect 200% returns worth $0.06 during the exchange launch period. Investors have a limited period remaining before the phase closes. Analysts predict parabolic gains to $10.22, positioning MUTM as the next altcoin to outshine Solana. Solana’s ascent: a powerhouse in blockchain innovation The blockchain sector welcomes Solana (SOL) as a leading platform that provides powerful transaction speed combined with minimal costs and scalability capabilities. The Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus system enables Solana to maintain decentralized operations while delivering thousands of transactions per second at maximum speed levels. Major institutions pay increased attention to this technological advancement because it drives fast DeFi adoption and NFT development and Web3 applications. The current trading price of SOL nears $129 while experts predict it will reach $1,000 by the end of 2025 which confirms its essential position in the crypto market environment. Solana keeps climbing up in value but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and similar competitors emerge with innovative solutions and strong financial expectations. Mutuum Finance presale Investors show growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because they continue to support its project development regardless of Cardano’s market performance. During the pre-sale phase, investors achieved an outstanding milestone by providing more than $4.7 million in funding for reaching 6500 participants. The token value of Mutuum Finance tokens showed growth during Phase 3 initial stages and continues increasing toward its launch price expectation of $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi lending with a dual-lending system Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework that combines Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish straight loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P exchanges because this system represents a superior way of managing worldwide assets. Users benefit from automated security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing (staking rewards) mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings of new exchanges will improve inter-user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. $100,000 giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its first users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to gain traction as analysts highlight its potential for massive growth, outperforming Solana. More than 6,500 investors have already contributed $4.7 million, and Phase 3 presale has surpassed 65% completion. A limited opportunity remains for investors to secure MUTM tokens at early-stage prices before its expected surge to $10.22.

SOL’s Renewed Uptrend Smashes Through $137,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-smashes-through-137/,"Solana (SOL) is back in the spotlight as its price rockets past the $137 level, marking a significant milestone in its ongoing rally. This surge comes amid a wave of renewed optimism in the crypto market, with Solana leading the charge as one of the top-performing assets. Furthermore, breaking through the $137 barrier is no small feat. This level had previously served as a key resistance point, and its breach signals a potential shift in market sentiment. Will this breakout pave the way for a sustained upward trajectory, or is a correction on the horizon as traders lock in profits? Solana Breakthrough: A Closer Look At the $137 Milestone From a technical perspective, the $137 level was a critical psychological barrier that had capped SOL’s price multiple times. Breaking through this resistance required strong buying pressure and positive market sentiment, both of which have been evident in recent weeks. Related Reading: Solana Price Faces Slowdown: Support And Resistance Levels To Keep An Eye On So far, SOL’s upward move has been backed by steady volume growth of over 100%, signaling strong market participation and increasing investor confidence. This surge in trading activity indicates that buyers are actively accumulating, reinforcing the bullish momentum and reducing the likelihood of a premature reversal. Additionally, momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remain firmly in bullish territory, climbing up to 69%, which signals that the rally still has fuel. With Solana’s RSI now approaching the 70% level, it suggests that buying pressure remains strong, and bulls are in control of the market. For SOL to extend its gains, buying interest must remain strong, and key resistance levels must be cleared with conviction. If demand persists, the rally could continue, but a loss of momentum might lead to a consolidation or short-term retracement Price Targets: Where Could SOL Be Headed Next? With Solana maintaining its position above $137, traders are now looking ahead to potential price targets. If the uptrend continues, the next key resistance level to watch is around $164, a barrier that may determine whether SOL extends its rally. Furthermore, a successful break above this zone could open the door for a move toward $211, where previous price action suggests strong selling interest. Related Reading: Solana Price On The Verge Of A ‘Big Breakout’ — Here’s The Target Beyond $211, SOL targets the $240-$260 range, a crucial area that would mark a significant recovery to its all-time high levels. However, sustained buying pressure and increasing volume are essential for a bullish scenario. On the downside, if Solana faces rejection at $164, a pullback could occur, with $137 acting as a key support zone. A breakdown below the level might shift momentum in favor of the bears, leading to a deeper correction toward the $118–$99 range.

However, the ALGO coin has been struggling in the past month. Is Algorand a good investment? When will this token rise? Find out in our Algorand price prediction. Table of Contents What is Algorand? Algorand crypto price prediction: general outlook Algorand price prediction 2025 Algorand price prediction 2030 What is Algorand? Technically, it is an attempt to solve the classic “blockchain trilemma,” which states that it is impossible to effectively combine decentralization, scalability, and security within a single platform. One of these components must be compromised to meet the needs of the others. In other words, a large and powerful decentralized platform will almost always face challenges with security and scalability. Algorand was launched to counter this trilemma. Launched in June 2019, the project aims to promote a decentralized digital economy based on the following principles: Open and unrestricted access to information Instant verification capabilities Its own algorithm, Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) A transaction management system that allows users to scale their projects based on blockchain technology The project is based in Boston, and its founder, Silvio Micali, is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a recipient of the Turing Award (often considered the “Nobel Prize” in computer science).

It is used for staking, paying transaction fees, running relay nodes, and governance within the network.What’s on the horizon for the ALGO token? Let’s take a closer look at the Algorand price prediction. Algorand crypto price prediction: general outlook At the beginning of December 2024, the crypto market saw a positive trend, and ALGO reached around $0.51, marking its highest point in quite a while. But just 3 months later, by March 24, 2025, its price had dropped to $0.20, showing a decline. In the past month, ALGO has lost more than 24% of its value. On a more positive note, the token has started to recover slightly in the past 24 hours, rising by almost 6%. The token’s all-time high of $3.28 was reached in June 2019, but it has not surpassed that level since. ALGO 1-day chart, March 2025 | Source: crypto.news Despite the recent downturn, Algorand’s long-term prospects still rely heavily on the broader market sentiment, adoption of blockchain technology, and any updates from the development team. Although facing challenges, Algorand still holds a strong position in the growing blockchain space, leaving room for potential growth — especially if market conditions start to turn around. Now, let’s turn our attention to the Algorand coin price prediction for 2025. Algorand price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s Algorand price prediction, the token’s price is expected to increase by 8.3%, potentially reaching a price of $0.214 by April 12, 2025. The analytical site suggests that ALGO could fluctuate between $0.179 and $0.244 over the course of the year. As of March 14, 2025, the overall sentiment for the Algorand price forecast remains negative, with 22 technical indicators showing bearish signals and only 8 indicating bullish trends. Wallet Investor forecasts that by the end of 2025, the coin could reach a maximum price of around $0.6. DigitalCoinPrice predicts that ALGO’s price could range between $0.38 and $0.44 in 2025. Will Algorand go up or down in five years?

DigitalCoinPrice’s projections indicate a less significant leap in value, estimating the token could trade between $0.95 and $1.09 by the end of the decade. According to CoinCodex’s ALGO price prediction for 2030, token’s price could range from only $0.097 to $0.298. Should you invest in Algorand? The future of the Algorand blockchain depends on the efforts the team puts into setting it apart from its competitors and its ability to solve the current blockchain issues. While the ALGO token price remains uncertain in the short term, its position as a strong player in the blockchain space means it could see growth if market conditions turn favorable.

Listing his short-term expectations, Hayes said he expects the Bitcoin price to rise to $110,000 soon and the FED to switch to quantitative easing. At this point, Hayes argued that if the FED were to switch to quantitative easing (QE) very soon, the Bitcoin price would reach $110,000. Quantitative easing (QE) means the Fed buys bonds and pumps money into the economy to lower interest rates and encourage spending during difficult financial conditions. The famous name also said that Trump's concerns about tariffs were unfounded and that he agreed with FED Chairman Jerome Powell's view that inflationary effects would be short-lived. At this point, Hayes noted that Bitcoin is more likely to rally to a new record high of $110,000 rather than correct to $76,500 amid concerns about easing monetary policy. “I bet BTC will hit $110k before testing $76.5. Fed is switching from QT to QE for treasuries. And tariffs don't matter because of temporary inflation. Powell said so. I mean, it's more likely to hit $110,000 than it is to hit $76.5,000. If we hit $110,000, then it's time to go up and we won't look back until $250,000.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Arthur Hayes Made the Final Point!

Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs continue to struggle, marking their fourth consecutive week of outflows. Bitcoin Breaks 5 Weeks Outflow According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $744.4 million last week, the highest in nearly two months. This inflow of funds comes at a time when investors are cautiously optimistic about the market’s recovery Leading the surge was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which pulled in $537.5 million, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $136.5 million. This came after the volatile February month, when over $5 billion was withdrawn from ETFs. Many big investors sold their holdings because the market was unstable and the economic outlook was unclear. Earlier this year, Bitcoin ETFs recorded record inflows, reaching $1.96 billion in mid-January and $1.76 billion the following week. This influx helped push Bitcoin to an all-time high of $109,000 on January 20. However, a market correction later pulled BTC down to the $78,000 range. Now, with fresh inflows, Bitcoin has bounced back to $87,343 , signaling renewed investor confidence. Ethereum ETFs Continue to Struggle While Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a strong recovery, Ethereum-based funds remain under pressure. Last week, Ether ETFs saw net outflows of $102.89 million , extending their losing streak to four weeks. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) was hit the hardest, recording $74 million in outflows. Despite these struggles, there’s a positive note for Ethereum. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which focuses on tokenized real-world assets, now holds a record $1.15 billion worth of ETH, up from $990 million just a week ago. This suggests that institutional interest in Ethereum’s long-term potential remains strong.

42266753,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=698727,1742823321,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42266753.jpeg,Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E still wants to force Social Security to cut staff and close field offices,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musk-d-o-g-e-to-cut-social-security/,"D.O.G.E, the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, is still pushing to cut staff, shut down field offices, and limit phone services at the Social Security Administration, which sends checks to around 70 million Americans every month. The Wall Street Journal reported that the agency is getting ready to scale down key services, even though more people are retiring as the baby boomer generation gets older. Two big changes are hitting at the same time: staff cuts and fewer phone options. According to an internal memo sent by Doris Diaz, acting deputy commissioner for operations, as many as 85,000 more people could start walking into field offices every week because of these changes. That’s on top of people already complaining about long wait times and a messy 800-number phone system that barely works. These cuts come as the agency is already dealing with increased demand from retirees and beneficiaries. D.O.G.E cuts phone services and triggers longer wait times On March 31, the agency will stop letting people file for retirement, disability, or survivor benefits over the phone. People won’t even be able to change their direct deposit info by phone anymore. They’ll have to go online or visit a local office. Leland Dudek, acting Social Security commissioner, said these changes are meant to prevent fraud and make sure “the right payment is to the right person at the right time.” He also admitted that the move will lead to more in-person visits over the next two months. “We’re going to adjust our policy and our procedures to adapt to that volume,” Dudek said on a call with reporters. Right now, about 250,000 people call the agency’s 800-number every day. Only 47% of them get through to a real person. That number used to be closer to 60% just last year. Callbacks now take over two hours on average. Bill Sweeney, senior vice president at AARP, said “customer service has been going downhill for years. It’s going to get worse.” Dudek also said that field office employees will get new training over the next two weeks to handle the flood of new walk-ins. But walk-ins aren’t really a thing anymore. Maria Freese, senior legislative representative at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said most offices are no longer accepting unscheduled visitors. People need to call the 800-number to make appointments. That change was approved by the Biden administration. In February, just 45% of people who tried to schedule an in-person or phone appointment got one within 28 days. And even that number is expected to drop now. Kathleen Romig, who works as the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, questioned why phone identity verification was being eliminated while still being allowed online or in person. She warned that these new hurdles will especially hurt people without internet or those living far from a field office. D.O.G.E pushes deeper cuts, field office shutdowns, and staff layoffs The agency currently has about 57,000 employees, but D.O.G.E is planning to cut that number down by 12%, which would leave just around 50,000 workers nationwide. For context, the agency had 68,000 employees in 2010. On top of that, nearly 50 field offices are expected to shut down. The watchdog group Social Security Works said some of the locations targeted for closure “don’t seem to exist,” raising questions about how the list was made. There’s more: Elon Musk and President Trump have both made claims that the Social Security system is full of fraud. Howard Lutnick, Commerce Secretary, went as far as saying during a podcast interview that delaying checks might be a good way to catch fraudsters. “They would make the loudest noise screaming, yelling and complaining,” Howard said. Illinois’ Democratic Governor JB Pritzker said “they’re killing these programs from the inside. The result of which is, we don’t know what they are doing to tear down the scaffolding that holds Social Security together.” Even Sue Gentry, a 65-year-old from Florida, reportedly said she’s been worried about her benefits since she experienced disruptions two years ago. “Everybody worries about what they are doing and whether they’re trying to break the system,” she said. D.O.G.E has also been trying to get access to systems that hold Americans’ personal information. But a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order stopping them. After that order, Dudek threatened to shut down the entire agency but later took that back. The situation is even more tense because the program’s money is running out. If Congress doesn’t act, the Social Security trust fund will run dry in 2033, leading to an automatic 21% cut in benefits. Warren and Wyden confront Trump nominee over D.O.G.E actions On Monday, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, both Democrats, sent a letter to Frank Bisignano, the man nominated by President Trump to lead the Social Security Administration. They asked him if he supports privatizing any part of the agency, whether he’ll reverse the layoffs, and if he’ll stop the closures. They also questioned whether he would roll back the new rule forcing people to verify their identity in person. Warren and Wyden pointed out that Fiserv could “theoretically benefit” from a privatized Social Security system. They also said they’re worried about Elon’s private equity connections and warned that these firms may follow the typical plan of “extracting anything of value before selling the remains for parts.” The Senators said in their letter that D.O.G.E’s efforts could “hollow out” the agency and “deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need.” They also wrote that Elon, who called Social Security the “biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” during a February interview with Joe Rogan, is now leading the privatization push. Warren and Wyden said the Trump administration and D.O.G.E are trying to make the agency fail on purpose so they can justify turning it over to the private sector. That’s the exact same idea President George W. Bush tried in 2005, but it didn’t go anywhere. Now it’s back. Currently, the Social Security Administration puts payroll taxes not immediately needed for benefits into Treasury bonds. If those funds were invested in the private market, returns could be higher — but it would also be way riskier. That’s part of what’s driving the privatization debate all over again. On Tuesday, Warren, Wyden, and other senators will question Bisignano during his Senate confirmation hearing. They want clear answers about the future of the Social Security Administration under President Trump, Elon Musk, and D.O.G.E. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

There is no reason to build an L2. L1s can be faster, cheaper, and more secure. They aren’t slowed down by a glacially moving L1 data availability stack, or have to compromise security with complex fraud proofs and upgrade multisigs. https://t.co/Ov3YAfz9U4 — toly (@aeyakovenko) March 23, 2025 He criticized L2 solutions for being constrained by a slow L1 data availability stack and the complexities of fraud proofs and upgrade multisigs. Scalability Through Storage Increase One of the primary concerns raised in response to Yakovenko’s stance was the scalability of a single blockchain when data storage demands increase exponentially. A user asked , “What happens when the amount of data we want to store on blockchains goes exponential? What are the limits of keeping everything in a single blockchain?” Yakovenko downplayed the concern , stating that Solana currently generates only 80TB of data per year, which he claims is too little to sustain a business yet too much for individuals to store conveniently. Solana generates a measly amount of data. Like 80TB per year so far. It’s just not enough data to build a business around, but too much for any individual to easily store. — toly (@aeyakovenko) March 23, 2025 Further discussions delved into Solana’s strategy for handling unused storage , particularly in the absence of an activated state rent mechanism. Yakovenko clarified that while the ledger would be stored on decentralized storage providers like Filecoin, Solana’s primary focus is on efficiently managing its state growth. Of course they can. 8 billion * 3 txs per day is sub 300k tps. That fits in under 1gbps of block throughput for 400 byte txs. — toly (@aeyakovenko) March 23, 2025 Addressing Solana’s State Growth and Scalability In an article written in March last year, Yakovenko elaborated on Solana’s state growth challenges , emphasizing that while the blockchain adds approximately 1 million new accounts daily, its total number has surpassed 500 million. Despite the snapshot size reaching 70GB, he maintains that these numbers remain manageable as hardware continues to improve. However, he highlighted key limitations related to memory and disk bandwidth, which influence Solana’s design choices. State != ledger. Ledger is going on filecoin or whatever decentralized storage provider wants it. State https://t.co/VbgfJj74lA — toly (@aeyakovenko) March 23, 2025 To optimize state growth and ensure long-term scalability, Solana has introduced several innovations, including “Chilly,” “Avocado,” and “LSR.” Chilly serves as a runtime cache that dynamically manages frequently accessed accounts, improving transaction efficiency. Avocado addresses state and index compression by replacing stored account data with hashes and migrating the account index to a binary trie structure. These solutions aim to reduce snapshot sizes and enhance transaction processing without sacrificing performance. One major challenge lies in creating new accounts, which requires validators to prove that an account does not already exist. This process is currently resource-intensive, and Yakovenko proposed a solution involving binary trie mining. Validators could earn additional SOL by compressing inactive accounts into a trie structure, thereby reducing the total active state size. He estimates that compressing Solana’s 500 million accounts could take approximately 80 days at a rate of 30 accounts per transaction. Scalability Concern Grows After SIMD-0228’s Proposal Rejection The latest controversial take from Solana’s co-founder follows a recently rejected proposal from the community. According to a report from March 14, the Solana community has decisively rejected SIMD-0228 , a proposal to introduce a dynamic emission schedule for staking rewards, in what has been called the largest governance vote in crypto history. SIMD-228 was a historic milestone for crypto. Even though our proposal was technically defeated by the vote, this was a major victory for the Solana ecosystem and its governance process. Over 74% of stake turned up to vote on the proposal. Yes votes were 43.6% of stake, no… — Tushar Jain (@TusharJain_) March 14, 2025 Despite an initial lead, the proposal failed to secure the required two-thirds supermajority, largely due to a late surge in opposition from smaller validators concerned about financial sustainability. With over 74% of network stakes participating across 910 validators, the vote proves that smaller validators could successfully counter institutional influence. Adding to the controversy, vote trading emerged as an unexpected twist when the Solayer validator sold 10% of its vote tokens on Meteora, allowing stakeholders to purchase governance rights. As it stands now, it remains to be seen whether Solana’s state management strategies will prove more efficient than traditional L2 rollups. However, Yakovenko’s vision for a streamlined, high-performance L1 challenges conventional thinking and could later be implemented for the blockchain’s scalability.

But that’s not the law, and they know it,” he stated in a March 24 post on X. Treasury’s Reversal On Tornado Cash Ruling The U.S. Treasury removed Tornado Cash and smart contract addresses linked to the mixer from the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list on March 21. This followed a November 2024 appeal court ruling , where the Department was told it had gone above its powers when it sanctioned the crypto mixer. Treasury officials now argue that since Tornado Cash had been removed from the SDN list, the lawsuit challenging such sanctions no longer had a purpose, as the platform could not be classified as property under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a special law that allows the federal government to block and freeze assets in response to foreign threats. Grewal warned that without a conclusive and final judgment, authorities could reimpose such sanctions on another company in the future. He cited past legal precedents where law enforcement agencies attempted to remove sanctions and evade court judgments. Grewal warned that authorities could later reimpose similar sanctions without a conclusive ruling. This dispute stems from the August 2022 sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which had previously targeted Tornado Cash for allegedly enabling illicit transactions, including those linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Tornado Cash Broader Legal Battle and Community Support Tornado Cash users have been contesting the Treasury’s sanctions in court, arguing that the platform’s immutable smart contracts should not be subject to OFAC restrictions. Meanwhile, developers linked to the platform continue to face legal challenges. On February 26, the Ethereum Foundation committed $1.25 million toward the legal defense of Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev, emphasizing the importance of protecting financial privacy and open-source development. Pertsev had been arrested in 2022 by Dutch authorities on money laundering charges and was sentenced to five years in prison in May 2024. He was released earlier this month, citing the financial burden of his legal fight. His co-founders, Roman Semenov and Roman Storm, also face legal scrutiny in the U.S., where they have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. Regulatory Wins and Unresolved Challenges The crypto industry has seen regulatory shifts under Trump’s administration, which have benefited companies that backed his return to office. Coinbase, a major player in the industry, donated $25 million to the Fairshake super political action committee (PAC), including $1.7 million in Bitcoin to the Trump 47 Committee. These efforts appear to be yielding results. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its two-year-long enforcement case against Coinbase, a move seen as a victory for the exchange’s lobbying efforts. Great news!

The redemptions represent nearly 6% of the total $6.77 billion in assets held by spot ether ETFs, according to data from SoSoValue . Just one day this month—March 4—saw positive inflows, with $14.58 million added. In comparison, January and February saw inflows of $101 million and $60 million, respectively. Spot bitcoin ETFs also faced withdrawals, with $893 million in net outflows this month, but the scale relative to assets under management, roughly 0.9% of $94.35 billion, was far less severe. Bitcoin funds remain net positive for the year after strong inflows of $5.25 billion in January. The contrast mirrors recent market performance. Since March 1, ether has dropped roughly 8.5%, while bitcoin has gained more than 3%. Year-to-date, ether has plunged over 37% to around $2,080. Bitcoin, while also down, has fared better with a 7.5% decline to about $87,300. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index fell 21% in the same period. Despite the downturn, ether ETFs still hold a net inflow of $2.42 billion since their launch. But that’s dwarfed by the $36.05 billion pulled in by the bitcoin counterparts, highlighting the gap in investor appetite between the two assets.",Markets|Ether ETFs|Ether,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-24 13:53:49

Fear and Greed Index spikes to 45,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-is-xrp-up-today-fear-and-greed-index-45/,"XRP is up 3.5% from its values 24 hours ago, up from its weekend low of $2.37, after weeks of consolidating between $2 and $2.2. A recent surge has pushed the broader crypto market into a slightly neutral sentiment, with the fear and greed index growing to 45 from Sunday’s 30, according to market data trackers. The token’s community sentiment grew optimistic about its price outlook after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the end of a four-year-long legal clash between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and his company, although the latter has yet to give an official statement on the matter. Crypto Fear and Greed Index. Source: alternative.me The push towards a greed index could have been fueled by the possibility of XRP’s price seeing further positives. Investors are waiting for Ripple to make more announcements on partnerships, the Ripple USD stablecoin (RLUSD), and the confirmation of a rumored collaboration with cross-border payments platform SWIFT. XRP follows historic trend, activity points to bull run Ripple Ledger’s native token has historically performed well in March, averaging a 19.2% gain over the past 11 years, per data from Cryptorank. But as of Monday, XRP’s price growth for the month has plummeted by 4.72% and is currently changing hands at $2.46, with the final trading week of the month yet to conclude. According to Coingecko, the token went up by slightly more than 5% intraweek and recovered by 26% from its 30-day lows. Analysts predict that XRP’s upward momentum could continue throughout this business week if it follows its historical patterns, and it could end March 2025 on a positive. Another reason the token is up today could be the announcement of 21Shares’ listing of three new exchange-traded products (ETPs) on Nasdaq Stockholm. These include the 21Shares Bitcoin Core ETP (CBTC), the 21Shares Solana Staking ETP (ASOL), and the 21Shares XRP ETP (AXRP). An ETF Express statement said that there is growing interest in crypto investments in the Nordic market. The entity plans to offer digital currency services to investors in Europe as soon as the necessary legal approvals are received. “This year represents a breakthrough moment for crypto in Europe, with increasing confidence driven by the MiCA regulatory framework and a significant rise in institutional participation,” 21Shares’ Head of Financial Product Development, Mandy Chiu, remarked in a press briefing.

The aim is to bring Visa card functionality to World Network wallets, delivering a range of fintech and FX applications, fiat on and off-ramps, as well as allowing stablecoin-based payments to thousands of merchants around the world that are part of the Visa network. Tools for Humanity, the company cofounded by Open AI CEO Sam Altman that oversees Worldcoin and World Network, sent out a request for product form to card issuers, which was seen by CoinDesk. World Network has been in talks with crypto card facilitators such as Rain, a company backed by Coinbase and Circle that provides on-chain Visa cards for projects like Optimism and Avalanche. “The plan is to build up a whole connected wallet strategy so that you can trade in all kinds of things, from FX to crypto, load to wallet, send to wallet, spend from card,” according to a source familiar with the plans. “Basically to turn World Wallet into a mini bank account for anyone who wants it.” Given Altman's resources and general clout, ""other wallet providers should be worried,"" the source added. Earlier this month, World Network announced a World Chat application and the ability to send money in the form of crypto-based transactions between users on the network. Worldcoin , the iris scanning orb that collects biometric data for the network, has attracted more than its fair share of controversy since appearing in 2021.

This pressure comes with the goal of getting it to President Donald Trump’s desk within two months, Crypto in America reported . The bill, introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty, passed the Senate Banking Committee on March 13 with an 18-6 vote. It is expected to reach the Senate floor for debate next month, with Majority Leader John Thune overseeing its progress. If the bill secures strong bipartisan support — potentially reaching 70 votes — the White House and key lawmakers may push to bypass a reconciliation process with the House’s competing STABLE Act.

The shift marks a change in investor sentiment, with inflows recorded on each day of the week following 17 consecutive days of outflows, according to a report by CoinShares . As a result, total assets under management have increased by 6.3% from their recent low on March 10. U.S. Leads Crypto Fund Recovery with $632M in Inflows The United States accounted for the bulk of the inflows, contributing $632 million. However, the renewed optimism was not limited to the U.S., with Switzerland, Germany, and Hong Kong also seeing inflows of $15.9 million, $13.9 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. Bitcoin was the clear leader in the recovery, drawing in $724 million after five weeks of outflows totaling $5.4 billion.

Ethereum led outflows with $86 million, while other tokens like Sui, Polkadot, Tron, and Algorand also saw modest losses.

Ethereum ETFs See $103M Outflows as Bitcoin ETFs Attract $744M in Weekly Inflows Ethereum ETFs faced notable pressure last week, recording net outflows of $103 million between March 17 and March 21, according to data from SoSoValue . The losses contrast sharply with the continued momentum of Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $744 million in net inflows during the same period. The most significant Ethereum outflow came from BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA), which saw $74 million in net withdrawals. While Grayscale’s ETHE reported a modest weekly net inflow of $2.87 million, its cumulative outflow remains substantial at $4.17 billion. Overall, Ethereum spot ETFs now hold a combined total asset value of $6.77 billion, representing 2.84% of Ethereum’s total market capitalization. Historical cumulative inflows across all Ethereum ETFs stand at $2.42 billion. On the other hand, Bitcoin ETFs continue to benefit from rising institutional demand.

According on-chain monitoring X account EmberCN , the 1inch team’s investment fund recently sold 37.9 Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) at $86,578 each, totaling about $3.28 million, and 511 Ethereum ( ETH ) at $2,072 each, amounting to around $1.05 million. EmberCN revealed that from Feb. 2 to March 10, the fund spent a total of $44.22 million on WBTC, ETH, and 1INCH. This included purchasing 11,198 ETH for a total of about $28.85 million at an average price of $2,577, 160.8 WBTC totaling around $14.21 million at an average price of $88,395, and 4.7 million 1INCH for roughly $1.15 million at an average price of $0.245. “Currently, everything is uderwater,” wrote EmberCN. Moreover, EmberCN noted that 1inch has previously been trading the three assets with a winning rate, especially Ethereum .

The price consistently moving below the 21-day Exponential Moving Average, with the major price drops accompanied by spikes in volume, particularly in early February, suggesting aggressive liquidation . However, the price has now climbed back above $2,090, testing the 21-day EMA at $2,067 for the first time in weeks. Source: crypto.news Similarly, WBTC has suffered a significant decline since the beginning of February, when the price briefly peaked above $105,000. Like Ethereum, it traded below the 21-day EMA since then, with a few brief breakouts. The decline became more pronounced in late February and early March, with WBTC experiencing sharp sell-offs that brought the price down to around $76,000 at its lowest low on March 11. In mid-March, WBTC started to form support at the $80,000 level. As of now, WBTC has climbed back to $87,544, having crossed above the EMA at $85,515.82, suggesting that bullish momentum may be building. Source: crypto.news While the assets have climbed back toward key resistance levels, their prolonged period below the 21-day EMA and previous sharp sell-offs suggest that the 1inch fund may be taking advantage of the bounce to reduce exposure and minimize potential downside risks.

It’s trading around the $2K level, which happens to be the bottom of a prominent trendline. The last two times $ETH bounced off from this trendline (in May 2022 and November 2022), it surged by 110% and 250%, respectively. If the scenario repeats this time around, we can expect $ETH to reach $3.5K in the next few weeks. In addition to the upward trendline, $ETH currently happens to be between its strongest support and resistance zones – highlighted in the image by the blue rectangle. Read on as we’ll discuss which institutional investors see this as a ripe opportunity to add $ETH to their portfolios and how you can match their ROI by buying the best presales . Blackrock Accumulates Record Amount of Ethereum BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) added $155M in $ETH investments over the last week, taking its total $ETH holdings to more than $1.145B. Although BUIDL has a diversified portfolio across various chains, such as Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Aptos, Ethereum is still one of its major bets in this dicey crypto market. It’s worth noting that Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI) also holds around $41M in $ETH, which comprises 40% of its total portfolio value. This vote of confidence from institutional investors is surely a positive sign for $ETH in the long term. Speaking of the long haul, our detailed $ETH price prediction for 2025 laid out why the token can reach $6K before the end of the year. Although investing directly into $ETH is the simplest way to capitalize on the crypto’s upcoming bull run, it’s not necessarily the very best. The best cryptos on presale could be more profitable due to their current low capitalization. New cryptocurrency typically follows the larger crypto trend but can potentially make you more money than $ETH (or $BTC). If you don’t know which meme coins on presale to consider, here are our top three suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Presale to Benefit from Big Crypto’s Growth After a long-drawn consolidation, $BTC is finally showing signs that it wants to rally higher. If you wish to make the most of $BTC’s growth, consider investing in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . It’s worth noting that even though $BTCBULL follows the coattails of $BTC, it’s based on the Ethereum blockchain thanks to the network’s large liquidity pool. $BTCBULL owners who store their tokens in Best Wallet will get free $BTC every time the OG crypto climbs and reaches a new milestone, such as $150K and $200K. At $250K, HODLers will receive a massive $BTCBULL airdrop. By directly linking its $BTC giveaways to the actual King Crypto’s price, BTC Bull Token has ensured the price of its own token, $BTCBULL, will also keep rising. Another reason why BTC Bull Token can be the next crypto to explode is its token burn mechanism. Essentially, the developers will shave off a part of the total $BTCBULL supply every time $BTC’s price rises by $50K. With one token currently available for just $0.002425, $BTCBULL’s presale is ongoing and has raised over $4M. Here’s how to buy BTC Bull Token . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Top Meme Coin Building Debut L2 for Solana Built to unleash the true potential of Solana, Solaxy ($SOLX) will be the first-ever Layer-2 solution on the memecoin-friendly blockchain. Solana has been battling with network congestion and scalability issues ever since its popularity among investors skyrocketed thanks to $TRUMP and no-code launchpad Pump.fun. Solaxy will reduce the burden on Solana by processing a sizable portion of the network’s total transactions on its sidechain. Additionally, Solaxy will jack up Solana’s affordability, seeing as it will process transactions in bulk and not one by one. Given that Solaxy could be one of the biggest catalysts behind Solana’s rise to new all-time highs, it could easily be among the top trending cryptos once it launches. The token is currently in presale, which is why it’s available for just $0.001672. Speaking of Solaxy’s presale , it’s comfortably one of the hottest new cryptos on the market right now – over $27.6M in funding is nothing to sniff at, after all. For more info on Solaxy’s purchase process, check out our detailed guide on how to buy Solaxy . 3. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) – Revolutionary AI Crypto Project Currently in Presale Lightchain AI is a fantastic crypto project built on Ethereum, which is why it enjoys industry-leading efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, like $BTCBULL and $SOLX, $LCAI, is currently in presale – where it has already amassed a whopping $18M in funding. What’s so special about $LCAI, you ask? Well, it’s a much anticipated AI-crypto partnership. For those unaware, investments in AI+crypto projects (as well as AI agent coins ) have skyrocketed in recent times thanks to this niche’s unprecedented potential. Lightchain AI, for example, plans to combine AI and blockchain technologies to build more user-friendly and secure blockchain networks. Furthermore, its whitepaper suggests that it’ll reward users who make meaningful contributions to AI development while keeping the network’s security intact. If you wish to benefit from $LCAI’s growth, consider becoming an early investor in the project. As mentioned earlier, the token is currently in presale, where it’s available for a low price of $0.007125. Bottom Line $ETH will be right alongside $BTC when the next crypto rally gains steam.

Citing anonymous sources, Reuters reported on March 24 that the SEC’s five commissioners conducted a vote on whether to sue Musk or not before the agency filed its lawsuit against the billionaire. Four commissioners voted in favor, while the lone dissent came from Mark Uyeda, who was appointed acting chair by US President Donald Trump on Jan. 20. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce voted along with three other commissioners to sue Musk. Uyeda and Peirce are known for their dissenting opinions on the SEC’s enforcement actions against the crypto industry during former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s time in office. SEC lawsuit against Elon Musk In 2022, Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion and rebranded the social media platform to X. Since then, the SEC has been investigating whether Musk had violated any securities laws as he acquired the platform. The SEC filed the lawsuit on Jan. 14, alleging that Musk failed to disclose his purchase of Twitter shares within the required 10-day window after surpassing the 5% ownership threshold. The agency said Musk delayed the disclosure by 11 days, allowing him to continue acquiring shares at lower prices, ultimately saving an estimated $150 million. Related: Musk says he found ‘magic money computers’ printing money ‘out of thin air’ Elon Musk claps back at “broken” organization Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, previously told Cointelegraph that the SEC's action is an “admission” that they cannot bring an actual case. Meanwhile, Musk described the SEC as a “totally broken organization” on X, saying that so many “actual crimes” go unpunished. Around a month after the lawsuit was filed, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a US government agency led by Musk, set its sights on the SEC . On Feb. 17, a page affiliated with DOGE called the public to disclose any “waste, fraud and abuse” related to the SEC. Musk also shared the post with his over 200 million followers on X. A court filing indicates Musk has until April 4 to respond to the lawsuit. Meanwhile, President Trump has issued an executive order calling for a review of politically motivated investigations at the SEC and other federal agencies under the previous administration.

Four of the five commissioners voted in favor of suing Musk, but the interim SEC chief, Mark Uyeda, cast the sole vote against the action. Uyeda's decision comes in the context of ongoing scrutiny of the SEC's actions under new Republican leadership. This development follows a history of SEC actions, including a notable case in 2023 where the agency charged Coinbase with violating federal securities laws. Coinbase had previously provided over $76 million to Donald Trump and promoted a meme coin associated with him, an action that has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest and corruption within the SEC.

Dave argues in a note sent to crypto.news that reversing the rule would drive both short-term and long-term changes in how digital assets are managed and stored. The custody rule was introduced in response to high-profile failures like FTX , which made it clear there existed notable weaknesses in how customer assets were managed. Dave noted that the rule aimed to prevent similar mismanagement by requiring firms to use a qualified custodian. However, a more effective approach would involve creating structured guidelines rather than imposing a blanket requirement. “A potentially better approach could be to provide guidelines that would serve as a structural framework enabling companies to securely store and manage digital assets for themselves and their customers,” Dave said. He suggested that these guidelines could cover essential practices like asset segregation or align with the Central Bank of Bahrain’s specific requirements around cold storage. You might also like: FTX’s bankruptcy nears $1B in costs, ranking among the most expensive in history Institutional interest and acquisitions could follow Dave expects that rolling back the rule will initially open up new business opportunities for crypto firms, but the long-term impact could be even more significant. “It will force traditional financial institutions to be aggressive in getting onboard with crypto. We will likely see an era of acquisitions where financial institutions will buy digital asset wallet providers as a way of retaining customer capital,” he explained. Crypto-native custodians, Dave added, are better suited to manage digital assets because of their deeper alignment with the Web3 industry. “Traditional financial institutions are more slow-moving and have a risk-averse approach to new asset classes,” he said, stressing the importance of industry-specific expertise. Need for a structured framework Looking ahead, Dave hopes that Securities and Exchange Commissioner Mark Uyeda will replace the custody rule with a balanced framework rather than leaving a regulatory gap. “Ideally, we would like to see a replacement of the blanket rule with an initial high-level framework that sets expectations and provides clarity, followed by a comprehensive rule book,” Dave said. “A complete elimination without anything to take its place will proliferate fear, doubt and uncertainty in the market.”",News|FTX|SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-24 14:07:24

As a result, the crypto market cap has jumped almost 3% and currently sits at $2.83 trillion. After a relatively quiet weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) started the week on a bullish note, going from $84,338 to $87,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 3% in the past 24 hours and is trading just below $87,000. Ethereum (ETH) also made a strong start to the week as it reclaimed $2,000 after an increase of over 2% to trade at $2.050. Ripple (XRP) is also up over 3%, while Solana (SOL) is up almost 7% and trading just under $140. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 4% and trading at $0.175, while Cardano (ADA) is up over 2% and trading at $0.725. Chainlink (LINK) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Stellar (XLM) , Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) also registered substantial increases. SEC-Crypto Roundtable Sees Passionate Discussions The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hosted its first-ever crypto roundtable on Friday. The roundtable pit crypto proponents and critics against each other, and lead to a fiery discussion to determine whether a crypto asset is a security or not. President Trump promised a crypto-friendly administration, with one of his campaign promises being the firing of the SEC Chair Gary Gensler, considered crypto’s most vocal detractor. However, Gensler resigned on the day of Trump’s inauguration. Gensler’s resignation sparked a shakeup in the SEC, with acting Chair Mark Uyeda announcing a new crypto task force only a day after Gensler’s departure. One of the first items on the agenda for the task force was to establish a series of roundtable discussions exploring some of crypto’s most contentious issues. Uyeda and SEC Commissioners Hester Pierce and Caroline Crenshaw delivered opening statements, and Troy Paredes, Founder of Paredes Strategies, was tasked with moderating a panel of eleven legal experts who discussed and gave their opinion on the intersection of crypto and securities regulation for almost four hours. While Uyeda and Pierce kept the decision light-hearted and positive Crenshaw issued a warning, “Modifying the law to facilitate the success of a chosen product category is fraught with risk. We cannot poke holes in the foundation without expecting the walls may crack.” Meanwhile, John Reed Stark, an 18-year veteran of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, claimed he had been getting death threats because he was talking about crypto regulation. “The people buying crypto are not collectors. We all know that they’re investors, and the mission of the SEC is to protect investors. And how do I know they’re investors? Because whenever I go around and talk about this stuff I get death threats afterwards because I’m talking about crypto and that it should be regulated.” Stark also said he had read all the briefs from law firms involved in legal battles with the SEC and concluded each time the assets were securities. Benjamin Schiffrin, Director of Securities at Better Markets, a nonprofit advocating for the financial industry, stated, “I went yesterday to look at the websites of some large brokers…and on the web pages of a lot of them, there’s always a tab of products that they offer: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, crypto. I struggle with the idea that only four out of five are securities and not all five.” Crypto Stocks In Freefall Crypto stocks have been caught in a staggering freefall as they mirror the slump in Bitcoin and other altcoins. Coinbase saw its stock price crash from $350 per share in November to $190, wiping out billions from its market cap. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy has also shed billions in value, with its market capitalization dropping from a high of $106 billion to $79 billion. Strategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, holding 499,226 BTC on its balance sheet. Meanwhile, Robinhood stocks also shed considerable value, dropping from $66 to $45 per share, erasing about $18 billion in value. US To Return $7M To Scam Victims US authorities are looking to return $7 million to victims of a social engineering scam that tricked gullible investors into sending money to fake crypto investment platforms. Fraudsters contacted the victims, earning their trust and directing them to fraud websites masquerading as legitimate crypto investment platforms. Once victims deposited funds to the platform, they were funneled through over 75 bank accounts, then sent abroad “deceptively characterized” as domestic wires despite being transferred to a bank outside the US. The platforms tricked victims into thinking their investments were making significant gains. “When victims would attempt to make withdrawals, the perpetrators would coerce the victims to send even more money using tactics such as claiming the victims owed taxes on their purported profits.” The United States Secret Service had seized some of the funds from a foreign bank and began civil forfeiture proceedings by filing a claim in a US District Court. However, the bank also made a claim against the cash, and US authorities eventually reached a settlement agreement for $7 million of the seized funds. Victims have been urged to contact the Secret Service to recover their funds. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $85,000 on Sunday, ending the weekend on a bullish note as markets rallied after a relatively quiet week. Data from TradingView showed BTC found strength over the weekend as it rallied from the $84,000 mark. BTC’s jump also lifted several altcoins, with popular trader Daan Crypto Trades stating, “I think this next week will be telling where the market wants to head for the next higher timeframe move.” The analysis echoed the broader market sentiment as traders eyed a fresh push towards and end the month on a positive note. Rekt Capital also reiterated encouraging signs of a breakout on the daily timeframes of BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI). “The Daily RSI is showcasing early signs of retesting the Downtrend dating back to November 2024 as new support.” BTC is now trading above the $85,000 level, continuing its consolidation phase and holding firm above the $81,000 support level. Market sentiment is also leaning towards bullish, with over 60% of Binance Futures trades locked in long positions, indicating expectations of a breakout. “On the network side, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty increased by 1.43 percent to 113.76 trillion at block height 889,056, nearing historical highs. Meanwhile, Ethereum edged down 0.6 percent, while XRP and Solana saw gains of 1.8 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.” Despite the uptick, BTC is trading downwards, well below the descending trendline, sitting just above $90,000. A break above the trendline could confirm a bullish tilt and set the price on a trajectory to $100,000. BTC was bullish as it entered the previous weekend, rising almost 4% to move past the 200-day SMA and reach an intraday high of $85,363 before settling at $84,002. Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $84,398. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC was back in the red on Sunday, dropping over 2%, slipping below the 200-day SMA and settling at $82,611. BTC started the week positively, rising almost 2% and settling at $84,016. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as the price slumped to an intraday low of $81,187 before recovering and settling at $82,725, ultimately registering a drop of 1.54%. Source: TradingView Markets rallied on Wednesday following the FOMC meeting. As a result, BTC rose over 5%, surging past the 20 and 200-day SMAs to reach an intraday high of $87,038 before settling at $86,875. However, the rally lost momentum on Thursday, and BTC dropped over 3%, slipping below the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $84,215. Price action remained muted on Friday, and BTC registered a marginal decline to settle at $84,51. Sellers retained control on Saturday, and the price registered another marginal decline. However, sentiment changed on Sunday as bullish sentiment returned. As a result, BTC rose almost 3% to move past the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settled at $86,111. Buyers have retained control during the ongoing session, with the price up over 1% and trading at $87,197. Buyers will look to maintain the current momentum and push towards $90,000. A break above this level could see BTC chart a course towards $100,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) found support around $1,900, suggesting a recovery could be on the horizon. ETH prices were buoyed by BTC’s rally, which began on Sunday. As a result, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency reclaimed $2,000 after an increase of over 5% in the past two sessions. ETH had struggled during recent sessions as sellers tested the support between $1,850 and $1,900. However, the levels held firm, suggesting bulls are unwilling to cede ground and help the price recover the key $2,000 level. According to some analysts, ETH is eyeing a potential breakout after testing a long-term support level. They believe if ETH bounces from current levels, it could surge past $3,000, an increase of over 50%. Meanwhile, institutional interest and confidence in ETH has also surged, with BlackRock’s crypto funds holding over $1.145 billion worth of ETH, up from around $990 million a week ago, according to data from Token Terminal. BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund focuses on tokenized real-world assets, with Ethereum as the base layer. However, the fund is also diversified across multiple chains, including Avalanche, Polygon, Aptos, Arbitrum, and Optimism. ETH ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping almost 3% and settling at $1,888. However, bullish sentiment returned on Monday as the price registered an increase of over 2% and settled at $1,928. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as ETH registered a marginal increase before rallying over 6% on Wednesday to reclaim $2,000 and settling at $2,058. However, ETH lost momentum after failing to cross the 20-day SMA, dropping almost 4% on Thursday, slipping below $2,000 and settling at $1,983.

Bullish sentiment has intensified during the current session, with ETH up over 4% and trading at $2,093. If ETH continues to push higher, it could move to $2,200. A break above this level could see the price surge to $2,500. However, if sellers retake control, ETH could drop below $2,000 to the $1,850 support level. The MACD and RSI are bullish, indicating buyers have the upper hand. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has hit the crucial $140 level during the ongoing session as price action picks up after a sustained lull. The Ethereum killer has seen an uptick in price and trading volume. A high trading volume suggests significant interest from investors, indicating SOL could see a substantial jump, at least in the short term. SOL started the previous weekend positively, surging over 8% on Friday and settling at $133. Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price registered an increase of almost 2% and settled at $135. However, SOL was back in the red on Sunday, dropping over 7%, slipping below $130 and settling at $126. The price recovered on Monday, registering an increase of 1.58% and settling at $128.

The vital support price of $1 in Pi Network collapsed last week following a recent period of positive market growth. The current market value of Pi Network stands at $0.90 after its price underwent a 30% drop from previous weekly rates. The market value of Pi Network has fallen at the same time as the overall cryptocurrency market slump. The negative impact on Pi Network’s value has caused industry analysts to predict a better future based on the network’s recovery signals. The global crypto market demonstrates significant advancement in its capitalization value. The capital value of the market touched $2.85 trillion, with an upward trend of 2.83% throughout the previous day. Trading volume experienced an enormous 62.39% increase, reaching $72.2 billion the previous day. Bitcoin surged past $87,000 in value to maintain its position, while Ethereum remains steady at $2,000. The rising crypto market may create conditions for Pi Network to make a comeback despite its current difficulties with the BNB listing speculation. Pi Network Price Could Surge as Experts Spot Bullish Pattern A crypto analyst has found evidence from market analysis showing that PI will extend its price growth based on its bullish Three Drive chart pattern. All three peaks increasing in height show the market could advance in price. According to analysts, there are three essential indicators for analysis: the first drive indicates a swift upward movement, and the second drive produces a higher peak. The third indicator confirms the existing trend. A major upswing for PI is possible when resistance barriers succeed to break. PI Breakout Signals Potential Market Shift The trend analysis makes it apparent that a PI breakout indicates transformation in market pattern. Right from last month the price chart shows a never ending falling pattern with many successive peaks and valleys forming a perfect descending pattern. Such a breakout from the descending channel pattern indicates that bearish conditions could end and introduce new market trends. Market operators spend their attention on this potential price movement to discover future market direction changes.

Bitcoin showed resilience, recovering above $87 800 despite growing recession fears. Corporate investors continue to hoard the cryptocurrency, and the stablecoin industry is breaking capitalization records, surpassing the $230 billion mark. Experts' opinions on the market's prospects are divided from forecasts of a prolonged correction to a possible rise to $200 000 in the next two years. Biggest Short of the Year Against the Community: Whale Bet $368 Million on Bitcoin's Fall Shortly before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, a trader opened a short on 4 442 bitcoins with 40x leverage. With an average entry price of $84 043, the trade totaled over $368 million and the liquidation point was set at $85 592. Following news of the large short position, a fundraising campaign was launched on social network X to counter this strategy - users attempted to organize a ”short squeeze” to forcibly close the whale position with a sharp rise in price, similar to the case of GameStop stock. Despite resistance from the community, a major player managed to close his position with a profit. According to data from Hypurrscan, the trader made $9.46 million in eight days, converting a portion of the profit into 3 200 Ethereum worth $6.1 million. Analyst firm QCP Capital in its report noted the correlation of this event with the cryptocurrency market's Fear and Greed Index at 32% (”fear”), reflecting a persistent negative attitude towards risk, especially given the overall negativity in equity markets. On The Brink of Recession: Bitcoin as an Alternative Macro Hedge Bitcoin has begun to show itself as an alternative macro hedge amid growing fears of a US recession. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said a recession cannot be ruled out, reiterating a view previously expressed by Donald Trump. BlackRock's head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick emphasized that bitcoin is likely to thrive in a recession: ”I don't know if there will be a recession or not, but a recession will be a powerful catalyst for bitcoin.” He said bitcoin will be energized by increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, lower interest rates and monetary stimulus - all things that typically happen during a recession. An opposing view was expressed by Coinbase researchers, who stated that the positive outlook for cryptocurrencies for the first quarter was ”clearly misguided” due to recession fears and recently imposed tariffs. Fed Meeting as a Key Driver of Market Movement On March 19, the long-awaited Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting took place. As expected, the Fed kept interest rates unchanged, but confirmed plans for two rate cuts before the end of 2025. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated that inflation has ”declined significantly.” A key driver of the rise was the Fed's decision to scale back its quantitative tightening program starting in April. According to data from QCP Capital, markets interpreted this as an indirect rate cut, reinforcing expectations of monetary easing as early as June. Former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX Arthur Hayes noted that quantitative tightening effectively ends on April 1, and a true bull run would require either a loosening of bank reserve ratios or a restart of quantitative easing. The Trump Administration is Shaping a New US Crypto Policy US President Donald Trump continues to shape a new cryptocurrency policy. On March 20, he became the first sitting U.S. president to speak at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit cryptocurrency conference. In his address, Trump reaffirmed his intention to make the U.S. the ”cryptocurrency capital of the world” and praised the role of stablecoins: ”With dollar-backed stablecoins, you will help expand the dominance of the U.S. dollar for years to come.” Bo Hines, executive director of the President's Council of Advisors on Digital Assets, stated that the federal government is considering budget-neutral ways to acquire bitcoin, such as realizing profits from gold certificates. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, all gold certificates settle at a set price of $42.22 per troy ounce, while the current spot price of gold exceeds $3 000. Minnesota Senator Jeremy Miller introduced the ”Bitcoin Act,” which provides the ability for public employees to include bitcoin in retirement accounts, pay taxes and fees with bitcoin, and exempt investment gains from state income tax. Stablecoin Market Growth Amid Institutional Adoption Stablecoin capitalization continues to skyrocket, exceeding $230 billion thanks to the Trump administration's direction and institutional interest. Compared to the same period last year, the market capitalization of steblecoins is up 56%. Tether's USDT dominates with a 62.6% share, reaching nearly $144 billion, followed by Circle's USDC with a market capitalization of $59 billion. LVRG Research Director Nick Ruck explains this growth by increasing institutional participation in the cryptosphere and easier access for traditional financial firms. Ethereum continues to lead the way as the primary blockchain for stablecoin transactions, holding $35 billion in USDC and $67 billion in USDT. Stablecoin volume on the blockchain has maintained an impressive momentum, totaling roughly $800 billion per month over the past four months. USDC and USDT account for $740 billion of the total $850 billion volume for February. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino stated that conducting a full audit of USDT is a ”top priority” for the company and would go much easier with the support of the Trump administration. Global Cryptocurrency Regulation: From Bans to Adoption The global regulatory space is trending toward a softening stance on cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Treasury Department excluded mixer Tornado Cash from the blacklist following a January ruling by a U.S. appeals court that found the sanctions illegal. The court found that ”immutable smart contracts are not the property of a foreign national or entity.” The Australian government presented a plan to regulate cryptocurrencies that would subject exchanges to existing financial services laws. The new regime imposes the same regulatory requirements on cryptocurrency companies that exist for other companies: protection of customer assets, mandatory Australian financial services license and minimum capital requirements. Pakistan has dramatically changed its stance on cryptocurrencies. The head of Pakistan's Cryptocurrency Board, Bilal Bin Saqib, has proposed using the country's excess energy to mine bitcoin. This is in stark contrast to 2023's statement that cryptocurrencies will never be legalized in the country. In Russia, the approach to regulation remains more conservative. The head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina proposed not only to ban the use of cryptocurrencies for settlements between Russian residents, but also to introduce liability for violation of this ban. At the same time, the Central Bank allows the creation of conditions for investment in cryptocurrencies, but only for ”especially qualified” investors. Corporate Bitcoin Accumulation Continues Despite market fluctuations, corporate hoarders continue to increase their bitcoin holdings. The number of publicly traded companies buying and holding bitcoin has increased to 80 in 2025, up 142% from 33 companies in 2023. Japanese company Metaplanet purchased another 150 bitcoins worth $12.5 million, increasing its cryptocurrency reserves to 3 200 coins. The company also issued 2 billion yen (about $13.3 million) worth of bonds to continue buying up the cryptocurrency. Metaplanet plans to own 10 000 bitcoins by the end of 2025 and 21 000 coins by the end of 2026. US President Donald Trump's son Eric Trump joined Metaplanet's strategic board of directors, further emphasizing the rapprochement between the Trump family and the crypto industry. At the same time, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) made the smallest bitcoin purchase in the history of observation - 130 bitcoins for $10.7 million. With this acquisition, Strategy and its subsidiaries now own 499 226 bitcoins. Expert Forecasts: From Bear Market to $200 000 Experts' opinions on the future of bitcoin are divided. CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju predicts up to 12 months of ”bearish or sideways price movement,” stating that ”bitcoin's bull cycle is over.” According to him, all of bitcoin's onchain metrics point to a bear market, ”As fresh liquidity is depleted, new whales are selling bitcoin at lower prices.” An opposing view was expressed by Bitget CEO Gracy Chen, stating that bitcoin could cross the $200 000 mark within the next 1-2 years. In her opinion, bitcoin will not fall below $70 000, rather $73-78 000, which is a good entry point for hesitant investors. Financial expert Timothy Peterson presented an analysis according to which bitcoin has a good chance of setting a new all-time high by June this year. According to his predictions, BTC/USD has about two and a half months left to surpass the current record of $108 000. Peterson set a median target of $126 000 with a June 1 deadline.",News|Reviews,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-24 15:31:49

Cybercrooks Turn Smart Homes into Botnets A March 24 report, citing an agency of law enforcement, says that hackers have been invading smart home networks in order to commandeer connected devices. The hijacked devices are used as part of botnets—networks of automated systems controlled from a distance—to mine cryptocurrencies and launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on websites. Surveillance Potential Raises Alarm In addition to crypto mining, attackers might also employ smart devices to spy, authorities warn. Toothbrushes, thermostat sensors, and even security cameras might be exploited to tap into user behavior and check if residents are at home. However, no additional information on attack methods or devices compromised was disclosed. A Larger Trend of Crypto-Themed Malware This is not the first that hackers have used unconventional methods to take over crypto. In 2022, malicious software was found hidden in pirated films offered through torrents. When downloaded, it planted malicious code in browsers like Firefox with the aim of stealing Bitcoin and Ethereum by replacing wallet addresses. Malware also hijacked search results and even redirected Wikipedia donations to attacker-controlled wallets. Emerging Threat to IoT Security The hacking of Russian smart homes exposes a bigger vulnerability in Internet of Things (IoT) devices worldwide.

The proposal is currently being discussed amongst TRON developers and traders. Justin Sun, TRON founder, suggests reducing block rewards could further reduce inflation, and higher prices would offset the new costs. The move would drastically change TRON’s economic model, adding extra functionality akin to Bitcoin’s original design. The proposal suggests reducing block rewards and balancing the economy of TRON so that users are encouraged to participate in staking. This would reduce the dilution of token value, which results from overproduction of TRX, a phenomenon that occurred frequently during the early stages of the token. However, this may need to be balanced to allow for better supply-demand dynamics. TRON plans to transition from inflation to deflation to align the structure of its block rewards with the token’s maturity. It needed inflation in the early stages of the project but may need more deflation now that the token is mature and people are seeking an inflation-proof asset like gold or Bitcoin. Justin Sun claims TRON is in a deflationary state of 1% per year, making it one of the only major cryptocurrencies with this feature. He also claims that higher TRX prices offset the reduction in block rewards. Therefore, given the token’s deflationary nature, a further reduction in block rewards wouldn’t hurt and wouldn’t have to be too much. “This proposal suggests,” wrote Jamestepforward, TRON developer, “reducing the TRX block rewards. The adjustment aims to create a more balanced supply-demand dynamic that encourages increased user participation in staking. This will benefit all stakeholders, ensure the TRX block rewards consistent with the maturity of the TRON network, and promote the healthy and sustainable development of the TRON ecosystem”. Justin Sun explained to investors through his X account that the changes would not adversely affect TRON validators. Validators don’t rely solely on block rewards for their income. They also get income from transactions and other network activities, thus mitigating the effects of lower block rewards. The proposal models the effects of block reduction, arguing that a 20% to 50% block reduction would result in a drop in inflation from the current level of -0.81% to a range between -1.20% and -1.78%. The reduction may make TRON more scarce, leading to upward pressure on the market and providing a store of long-term value like gold. On the flip side, stakers may be negatively impacted in the short term, and transaction fees may be disrupted. TRON could, like Bitcoin, benefit from reduced block rewards. The modeling further shows, using a back-of-the-envelope analysis, that blocks reduced by 1 million TRX would create 1.5% deflation per year, a 50% increase in deflation. Blocks reduced by 2 million TRX would create 2% deflation per year, a 100% increase in deflation, essentially doubling the deflation and implementing TRON’s version of the Bitcoin halving. The proposal considers the impact of reduced block rewards on the role of validators in the network. Validators are essential to securing the network, so a reduction in their rewards needs to be considered carefully while also, equally seriously, the inflation rate of the token. Sun mentions that validators have diverse income streams, including transactions, to mitigate the risks of increasing the deflation rate. TRON’S DEX volume dropped from $299 million to $121 million, possibly indicating a short-term drop in price. Lower network activity can sometimes indicate lower prices. Three years ago, when TRX hit $0.38, the DEX volume hit $299 million. Solana, however, failed to reduce block rewards because validators voted down the proposal. The SIMD 0228 proposal could not gain approval because many small validators were worried about its negative effects. Justin Sun, however, believes the benefits of block reduction far outweigh the negative effects because validators have a diversified portfolio of income streams, and deflationary measures put TRON on par with long-term assets such as gold.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|TRX,EN,0,0,TRX|BTC|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-24 15:33:30

Ether ( ETH ) traded at roughly $2,088 at the time of writing amid c ontinued exchange-traded fund (ETF) outflows , down over 57% from its all-time high of nearly $4,900 set in mid-November 2021, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite this decline, Ethereum maintains a market capitalization of nearly $252 billion, surpassing global corporations such as Toyota ($250 billion) and the total market value of the precious metal platinum ($245 billion). Other notable companies currently worth less than the Ethereum network include IBM, McDonald’s, General Electric, Shell and Disney. If Ethereum were a company, it would be the fiftieth largest in the world, just behind Nestlé, with its market capitalization of nearly $256 billion. Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research, told Cointelegraph that speculative interest significantly contributes to Ethereum’s valuation, as well as its “freedom from the financial framework of traditional finance.” He added: “Ethereum is about the future, about new financial technologies and solutions. The project is still very young and attracts many new and young investors who are ready to take risks. I believe that the average Zoomer will choose Ethereum for investment rather than Toyota or IBM shares.” Flavio Bianchi, a Polkadot ambassador and the chief marketing officer of the decentralized fundraising platform Polimec, told Cointelegraph that the comparison is less insightful than it might appear at first. He highlighted that “Ethereum isn’t a business” — it’s infrastructure. He explained: “Its value doesn’t come solely from revenue or profit but from usage and belief in its future role. It enables people to build, transact, issue assets and coordinate without intermediaries.” Obchakevich also suggested Ethereum became more attractive after it transitioned to proof-of-stake (PoS), reinforcing “its value as a deflationary asset with growth potential in the digital economy.” Related: ETH may reclaim $2.2K ‘macro range’ amid growing whale accumulation Is Ethereum a deflationary asset? Recent data from Ultra Sound Money shows that Ethereum is inflationary again, with an annual inflation rate of about 0.73% over the past 30 days. The rate of inflation or deflation is largely dependent on the ETH fees burned by the network and the amount of newly issued Ether. Fees have been burned on the network since the implementation of EIP-1559 in 2021 , which, paired with decreased issuance after the PoS transition, resulted in Ethereum being deflationary during sustained network activity. IntoTheBlock data shows that on March 23, daily fees on Ethereum fell to a little over $337,000, the lowest value reported since June 2020. YCharts also shows that on March 23, there was only 118.67 ETH worth of fees, the lowest value reported this year. Ethereum network transaction fees per day. Source: YCharts Over the past 24 hours, ETH’s value rose nearly 3.5%, increasing its market capitalization by about $9.3 billion, now totaling approximately $252.1 billion. For comparison, this figure exceeds Greece’s gross domestic product (GDP), currently around $243.5 billion. Related: Ethereum eyes 65% gains from ‘cycle bottom’ as BlackRock ETH stash crosses $1B Obchakevich highlighted that other than being worth more than Greece’s GDP, Ethereum’s market cap is also higher than the GDP of countries such as Slovenia and Croatia combined. He said this is more than a curious factoid: “For institutional investors, it is a sign of legitimacy. Ethereum is valued for smart contracts, and DeFi has a TVL [total value locked] of over $124 billion, seeing it not only as speculation but as the infrastructure of the future.” Pradeep Singh, CEO of enterprise privacy and security infrastructure firm Gateway FM, told Cointelegraph that these numbers reflect “a fundamental shift in how we value digital infrastructure”: “What we’re witnessing is a growing recognition that significant portions of the global economy will eventually migrate to this infrastructure. Ethereum’s market capitalization is essentially pricing in its future role as the settlement layer for everything from financial services to supply chain management.” The Ethereum protocol continues to evolve as developers introduce innovations such as native rollups , further expanding the blockchain’s capabilities and potential use cases.

CoinShares, Europe’s leading digital assets investment firm, says Bitcoin ( BTC ) led this flip as the crypto market witnessed renewed optimism. According to a weekly report CoinShares published on March 24, the crypto exchange-traded funds market notched over $644 million in weekly inflows, ending a five-week run of outflows. This report aligns with the outlook across the spot exchange-traded funds market in the United States, which has seen a fresh dose of demand from investors as Bitcoin edges higher. SoSoValue data shows the U.S. spot ETFs market saw Bitcoin spot ETFs record six straight trading days of inflows between March 14 and March 21, 2025. On Friday last week, only Grayscale’s GBTC saw outflows, while BlackRock registered nearly $105 million in net inflows. Commenting on the shift in sentiment, James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said: “Total assets under management have risen by 6.3% from their low point on March 10th. Notably, every day last week recorded inflows, following a 17-day consecutive run of outflows—signalling a decisive shift in sentiment toward the asset class.” You might also like: Michael Saylor’s Strategy acquires 6,911 Bitcoin, now holds over 506,000 BTC CoinShares report, which covers the global performance of ETPs issued by leading providers, notes digital asset investment products bled over $6.4 billion in five weeks.

However, as Bitcoin reclaimed upward momentum to climb from under $80,000 last week, the sector bounced back. Overall, sentiment saw institutional investors pour more than $724 million into Bitcoin-related products. The five weeks of consecutive outflows had seen investors pull more than $5.4 billion from Bitcoin-tied investment products. XRP and Solana investment products saw modest inflows of $6.7 million and $6.4 million respectively. Meanwhile, Ethereum, which has struggled with downside pressure near $2k , recorded outflows of $86 million. Short Bitcoin investment products also saw $7.1 million in outflows, with a third-consecutive week of such movement suggesting a bullish flip.

BITO's high expense ratio of 0.95% and reliance on futures and swaps hinder its ability to meet its investment objectives. The fund's attractive trailing 12-month yield is misleading as it shrinks with the falling share price. Post-election optimism in the crypto space has waned, and the strategic bitcoin reserve's budget-neutral requirement dampens future price growth expectations. The post-election euphoria in the crypto space has faded, as it was bound to do. There is still plenty to be optimistic about in the long term, but in the near term, crypto may drift lower in the absence of drivers. This article outlines why the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) is the wrong fund at the wrong time. The Problems With BITO According to the fund page, ""BITO aims to produce returns that correspond to bitcoin."" It fails: Data by YCharts This significant underperformance relates to BITO's early launch date in 2021, way before the more recent ETFs such as IBIT and FBTC. As the fund page states, BITO invests in futures and swap and does not directly invest in bitcoin. There is no guarantee that the fund will meet its investment objective. Back in 2021, that was the only way BITO could operate. Unfortunately, it introduced unneeded expense and complexity. The costs associated with rolling (buying and selling) futures and the impact of margin requirements, collateral requirements and other limits may have a negative impact on performance and prevent the Fund from achieving its objective. BITO needs active management, which means it has a high expense ratio of 0.95%, adding to the other costs involved. Newer ETFs can passively buy bitcoin and store it with a custodian, which leads to lower expense ratios in the 0.25% region. I explained this in more detail in my January article, BITO: This Fund Has Outlived Its Usefulness . Some Thoughts On The Dividend One reason BITO has remained popular is that it pays massive monthly distributions, currently reported at 77.8% (TTM). That is impressive, but also slightly misleading as BITO's price has fallen nearly 50% in the last year and distributions are getting smaller. Data by YCharts As the fund sponsor states: It is important to remember that the dividend distribution amount for each Fund may change significantly from month to month. In some months, a Fund may not make any dividend distributions at all. For example, a Fund may not make distributions if its subsidiary has had significant recent losses or if the distributions previously paid by the Fund have already covered the Fund’s expected required calendar-year dividend distribution. For the most part, the dividend is a return on profits created by the fund, and the returns are shrinking as the share price shrinks. For example, June 2024 paid a distribution of $1.77, which at today's price of $18.69 would give an annualized yield of 113%. However, the last distribution was only $0.72, which annualized is 46%. Including the higher distributions from last year in the trailing twelve-month calculation distorts the yield. In any case, you would be much better off simply holding a newer ETF and paying yourself periodical dividends from the superior total return. Data by YCharts The Post-Election Drift Two major factors drove the massive crypto rally following the election: Firstly, the new administration is crypto-friendly, and many of Trump's closest allies (Elon Musk, J.D. Vance, Howard Lutnick, and a long list of others) hold significant amounts of cryptocurrencies. Secondly, there was the promise of deregulation and other positive policy shifts, including the creation of a U.S. Crypto Reserve. This idea had been circulating for some time and when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was in the running for president, he promised to create a Bitcoin reserve and buy 550 Bitcoin daily to amass a reserve of 4 million Bitcoin. That's a lot of bitcoin! There was optimism President Trump would do something similar (if on a smaller scale) and on March 6th a big announcement was made : Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, positioning the United States as a leader among nations in government digital asset strategy. The Order creates a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that will treat bitcoin as a reserve asset. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the Department of Treasury that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. Other agencies will evaluate their legal authority to transfer any bitcoin owned by those agencies to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The United States will not sell bitcoin deposited into this Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which will be maintained as a store of reserve assets. The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies impose no incremental costs on American taxpayers. The key takeaway comes from the last paragraph. Additional bitcoin can be acquired, but it would need to be budget-neutral . This is a disappointment, and bitcoin prices fell in the subsequent sessions. One option would be for U.S. gold reserves to be sold in order to buy bitcoin. This was an idea floated just after the election by Trump ally Senator Cynthia Lummis, who said the Fed should sell some of its gold reserves to buy bitcoin . Bo Hines, the executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, talked about this again on Sunday , saying: If we actually realize the gains on the U.S. gold holdings, that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more bitcoin. I'm not sure if this plan will gain traction. If it does, it could drive the next large rally, and selling some gold after the recent huge rally to over $3000/oz makes sense. If it doesn't, the options for acquiring more bitcoin would be very limited. It's perhaps a theme that will continue throughout 2025, but in the meantime, sentiment in the crypto space could be flat and the post-election drift below $100k may continue. Holding an ETF long-term remains a good investment, but there does not seem a compelling reason to buy BITO right here and now. Conclusions Bitcoin has unwound much of the post-election rally and sentiment has shifted. The big news on the bitcoin strategic reserve turned out to be a disappointment, and while there are some options for acquiring more bitcoin, these must be budget-neutral. BITO is an underperforming fund in the crypto space with a variable dividend and high expense ratio. While the high monthly distributions are attractive, the total return is not and holders are forfeiting gains for yield. This is the wrong fund at the wrong time.",BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-24 15:35:38

According to a company note, the new digital identity product will support authentication, verification, and interactions with digital asset services. This is expected to help enterprises and consumers navigate an increasingly digital economy while ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory standards. “There has been talk for a long time about whether the EU’s digital identity scheme would use blockchain,” Rob Viglione, CEO of Horizen Labs told crypto.news. “The fact this has been confirmed is a positive step forward. The fact it’s using self-sovereign identity technology is also a positive step.” World Mobile Chain, the infrastructure supporting the project, is designed to facilitate blockchain adoption among European businesses. As a Layer 3 protocol on Base, it provides scalability and efficiency for decentralized applications. The digital ID solution will allow companies to implement blockchain-powered identity verification without compromising privacy. Viglione emphasizes the importance of privacy in digital identity systems, stating that: “Users need privacy and security guarantees. Any digital ID scheme should be using zero-knowledge proof technology to ensure data remain ‘usable but invisible.’” The product is expected to streamline digital access across various sectors while giving users greater control over their online identities.

According to a new report from Swiss blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger, a slew of on and off-chain data indicates that Grinex is a direct successor to Garantex. Some liquidity from Garantex, including all of Garantex’s holdings of a ruble-backed stablecoin called A7A5, has already been moved to Grinex-controlled wallets. Global Ledger CEO Lex Fisun told CoinDesk that, in addition to on-chain data connecting Garantex to Grinex, there have been numerous off-chain indications that the two exchanges are intimately connected. Fisun pointed to the rapid growth of Grinex, which he said had surpassed $40 million in volume in just two weeks, as well as a host of social media ties between the two exchanges. Though other major blockchain analytics companies, including TRM Labs and Chainalysis, have yet to confirm Global Ledger’s findings, Chainalysis’ Head of National Security Intelligence Andrew Fierman told CoinDesk that he had seen several indicators that Grinex was likely to be the rebrand of Garantex. Fierman pointed to a recent Telegram comment from Sergey Mendeleev, one of the original founders of Garantex, announcing the creation of Grinex and claiming any similarities between the two exchanges were random — followed by two crying laughing emojis. Both Fierman and Fisun told CoinDesk that there were numerous reports of Garantex users going to Garantex’s in-person offices in Europe and the Middle East and transferring their crypto from Garantex to Grinex. Both also pointed out the similarities in the two platforms’ user interfaces. Though the evidence is certainly compelling, Fierman said that until Chainalysis completes its review of Grinex’s infrastructure, it cannot definitively validate the accuracy of Global Ledger’s report. But, if Grinex is, in fact, a rebrand of Garantex, it wouldn’t be the first time that a sanctioned exchange remade itself after a shutdown. In 2017, Russian crypto exchange BTC-E was taken down by American law enforcement, and subsequently rebranded as WEX. WEX didn’t last long though — it shuttered a year later due to internal conflict and in-fighting among its remaining leadership. Similarly, sanctioned Russian exchange Suex rebranded as Chatex, and was subsequently sanctioned again. The trouble with sanctions The fast revival of Garantex demonstrates the challenge of sanctions, especially against criminal operations like non-compliant exchanges, darknet marketplaces and ransomware gangs that can simply morph to avoid detection. “Sanctions evasion is going to happen,” Fierson said. “Because if you're sanctioned, you aren't just going to accept that you can no longer conduct any financial transactions. You are going to look to avoid detection, however that may be, whether it be through creating shell companies, creating new crypto wallets — and the larger the operation, and the more prominent, the more technically advanced you'd have to be to actually make it work.” Feirson said this problem isn’t unique to crypto, but crypto-related sanctions offer law enforcement a unique opportunity to follow the money after sanctions are put in place. “The unique aspect to the blockchain is that it's transparent and immutable, and so what happens when a company gets shut down is a lot more examined,” Fierson said. “There's a lot more to examine on-chain. Garantex gets shut down, their Tether holdings get seized, but that doesn't stop them from moving other assets. There's opportunity to monitor what happens to those funds post-official shutdown.” A hydra-like network of potential successors Whether Grinex is Garantex 2.0 or not, there are a number of other non-compliant Russian crypto exchanges eager and willing to take its place. Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs, told CoinDesk that it was simply “too early” to definitively assess the relationship between Grinex and Garantex. “That said, it is clear that other high-risk non-compliant exchanges will try to fill the illicit finance void left by Garantex,” he added. A recent client report from TRM Labs named several possible successors, including high-risk Russian exchanges ABCEX and Keine-Exchange. Garantex take down Garantex was dismantled by international law enforcement from the U.S., Germany and Finland in a joint operation earlier this month, which seized its domain and servers. The U.S. Treasury’s Department of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) first sanctioned the exchange in 2022, accusing it of knowingly facilitating money laundering for ransomware gangs like Black Basta and Conti, as well as darknet markets like Hydra. According to court documents, Garantex’s clientele also included North Korea’s state-sanctioned hacking squad The Lazarus Group, which was behind the recent $1.4 billion Bybit hack, as well as Russian oligarchs who used the service to evade sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Two of Garantex’s operators, Lithuanian national and Russian resident Aleksej Besciokov and Russian citizen and United Arab Emirates resident Aleksandr Mira Serda have been charged with money laundering conspiracy in connection with their work with Garantex. Besciokov was arrested while vacationing with his family in India earlier this month, and is expected to be extradited to the U.S. to face charges.",Policy|Blockchain Analytics|Chainalysis|Garantex,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|WALLET|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-24 15:46:21

The protocol plans to spend 25% of its net protocol fees on buying back the DYDX token from the open market. In an announcement today, the protocol stated that the move would reinforce confidence in the token. According to dYdX , the acquired tokens would be used for staking to improve network security, which aligns with the token’s significant role in the protocol ecosystem. With the platform facing declining revenue this year, the news of revenue going towards token buyback could be the boost it needs to rebound. dYdX fees (Source: Defillama) It said: “This initiative marks a significant milestone for dYdX tokenomics, further aligning platform growth with the role of the DYDX token in the ecosystem.” Meanwhile, the announcement also detailed the full distribution of the protocol revenue, noting that all the revenue has been allocated to ecosystem participants in the past year. With the Buyback program, 40% of the revenue will now go towards staking rewards, 25% for MegaVault, its USDC liquidity program, and 10% for the Treasury SubDAO. The announcement noted that the distribution structure ensures that all revenue generated by the protocol is reinvested into the ecosystem to improve its security and governance and ensure its long-term sustainability. It added that the percentage allocated to buyback could increase to 100% later. DYDX surges 8% after news of buyback Following news of the buyback, the DYDX token saw an almost 8% increase in value, taking its price to $0.715. This is a welcome development for a token that has struggled for most of this year and is currently down 51% year-to-date. CoinGecko data shows the token is down 84% from its peak price of $4.51, reached back in March 2024. Interestingly, the move to adopt buyback aligns with what appears to be the common trend in the DeFi sector today, with multiple projects modifying their tokenomics to enable token buyback programs. Leading lending protocol Aave is working on implementing Aavenomics, which includes a buyback program that will see the protocol buy $1 million worth of AAVE tokens weekly for six months. Other projects, including Hyperliquid, Jupiter, and Uniswap, also have plans to initiate a similar program. The interest is not totally surprising as token buybacks create constant demand for tokens, usually leading to a price increase and reduction in the circulating supply of the token. While there have also been a few criticisms of the practice, many in the crypto industry consider it a bullish sign for any project. dYdX set to launch new products as part of its evolution Meanwhile, the token buyback is merely one of the many initiatives the decentralized derivatives trading protocol has planned. In its announcement, it noted new innovations under development, including Spot Trading, EVM support, and Multi-asset Margining. All these products are designed to boost the protocol’s adoption, which has seen its total value locked (TVL) drop to $279 million from its peak of $1.12 billion. One of the factors contributing to the decline in TVL was the decision to move away from Ethereum to its own Layer-1 network in 2023. Although 86% of the token supply is now on the dYdX L1 network, 14% has not been bridged from Ethereum. Holders of these remaining tokens may need to act fast with the community proposal for ending support for the Ethereum cross-chain bridge by June 2025.

While the SEC claimed in its lawsuit that XRP was a security, Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York made a dual distinction in her decision. The court said Ripple's institutional sales constituted an unregistered securities offering, but sales to retail investors on cryptocurrency exchanges were not securities. Finally, after the SEC's move to withdraw the Ripple case, experts stated that the doubts about XRP being a security were removed, while the IMF indirectly argued that XRP is a security in a recent report. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) released the first update of its Balance of Payments and International Investment Guidelines since 2009 last week, and cryptocurrencies were added to the framework. The IMF’s new Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7) classifies crypto assets according to whether they impose a financial claim or liability on the issuer, while generally suggesting that altcoins are debt-bearing securities. While the IMF argues that Bitcoin does not pose a liability due to its mining process, it argues that utility tokens, commonly known as altcoins, do pose a liability. After the IMF made this distinction, some users commented, “XRP is about to be permanently listed as a security.” Following these comments, Ripple CTO David Schwartz claimed that XRP does not fit this definition of a utility token, but if it does, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) would also fall into this definition. “If XRP is a utility token that you can use to pay future transaction fees, or a security according to the IMF, then so are BTC and ETH.” *This is not investment advice.

The company, which already holds more Bitcoin than any publicly traded company, has now broken the 500,000 BTC threshold. Strategy Buys A Further 6,911 BTC Strategy continues to buy Bitcoin. The self-described Bitcoin development company said Monday that it bought approximately 6,911 Bitcoin for $584.1 million between March 17 and March 23. The orange coins were purchased at an average price of approximately $84,529, the announcement added. Strategy now holds 506,137 Bitcoin. Today’s price is about $44 billion in the apex cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is now changing hands for $88,267, according to CoinGecko. For perspective, the company now holds at least 2.4% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1904142379646415203 The purchase is the latest in a string of Bitcoin buys dating back to August 2020, when Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) and then-CEO Michael Saylor strategically decided to allocate capital to the top crypto to “maximize long-term value for shareholders.” Since that time, the Tyson, Virginia-based business intelligence firm has reshaped itself into a Bitcoin development company and pioneered the BTC treasury reserve asset model copied by many TradFi companies, such as Elon Musk’s Tesla and Japanese Metaplanet . According to the March 24 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the latest buying spree was funded by proceeds from Strategy’s “Common ATM” and “ STRK ATM ” programs. Between March 17 and March 23, Strategy sold 1,975,000 shares of its Class A common stock, generating net proceeds of around $592 million, and 13,100 shares of its 8.00% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock, resulting in more than $1 million in net proceeds. The new purchase came after the company upsized its recently announced Strife perpetual stock offering to $723 million after having initially priced it at $500 million. The offering aims to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions. Both the STRF and STRK offerings are part of Strategy’s initial “ 21/21 plan ,” which targets a total capital raise of $42 billion in equity offerings and fixed-income securities to buy more BTC. Strategy joined the Nasdaq 100 in December 2024 and currently ranks 47 with an index weighting of 0.49%.",Cryptocurrency|News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|STRK|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-24 16:01:12

Specifically, on Monday, BTC soared 2.46% to its press time price of $88.142. BTC 1-day price chart. Source: Google The rally was the extension of a greater rise that started on Sunday, March 23, and kicked off with the world’s premier cryptocurrency changing hands at about $84,000. For the excitement in the digital assets market, its primary stock market extension, a selection of blockchain companies have been making even grander moves. Of these, MARA Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA ) proved among the best-performing stocks in the initial hours after the morning bell rang. By press time on March 24, MARA shares had rallied 12.28% in the Monday session – almost six times as much as BTC – and are changing hands at $13.90. MARA stock 1-day price chart. Source: Google Why MARA stock is soaring today Examining the recent developments regarding the miner, it appears that the chief – possibly sole – driver of the upswing is the cryptocurrency market rise in the last 24 hours. The strength of the tailwind is also observable in the other stock most linked with Bitcoin, Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) as it is up 6.93% to $325.08 in the March 24 session. Still, MARA shares’ leadership in Monday’s trading is also likely a result of a mix of other long-standing factors. To begin with, concerns over several protracted periods of BTC price stagnation – especially in the aftermath of the April 2024 halving – have pummeled miners’ equity. MARA Holdings stock is itself 33.39% down in the last 12 months and 18.91% in the red since 2025 started. Such a price situation, paired with relatively consistently strong earnings – the miner beat Wall Street forecasts in three out of the last four reports – created a situation in which MARA equity appears decidedly undervalued and ready to take advantage of the Bitcoin rally.

The announcement signaled a favorable turn in the regulatory scenario for XRP and the broader crypto market. However, XRP has lost at least half of its gains in recent days, falling below the key $2.50 zone. Now, investors are wondering why the crypto asset is not skyrocketing despite Ripple emerging victorious in the longstanding SEC enforcement case. XRP Fails To Moon Despite Ripple’s Latest SEC Win In a recent post on X, early crypto investor Armando Pantoja took to X to share his thoughts on XRP’s dull price action. “Why hasn’t XRP skyrocketed to $10 since the news? Pantoja asked. According to him, the lackluster price action was because the Securities and Exchange Commission had not yet officially confirmed its dismissal of the Ripple appeal. On March 19, Ripple boss Bradley Garlinghouse announced that the SEC agreed to drop its appeal of a July 2023 ruling that said the firm did not break federal securities laws in selling XRP to retail investors by making it available through exchanges, and that the case itself is close to a conclusion. However, the agency has not yet issued any statement regarding the matter. Pantoja thinks the lack of the SEC’s formal announcement leaves cautious investors on the sidelines. It’s worth noting that Ripple still faces a legal barrier in the form of an injunction issued by District Judge Analisa Torres, which bars the firm from selling XRP to institutional investors, namely banks and financial institutions. XRP’s 10X Rally In Play Armando Pantoja also discussed XRP’s price action, noting that the token’s movement cannot be as erratic as meme coins. In his belief, derivatives affect XRP’s price stability more than smaller coins. Therefore, explosive 10X XRP rallies overnight are not likely. “10X will come soon, but not in 24 hours,” Pantoja summarized. Now that regulatory headwinds seem to have subsided, the future certainly looks bright for XRP.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|ZRX|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-24 16:07:17

It has crashed by 45% from its highest level in December and is in a price discovery phase. This article explores whether ADA price will rise by 40% and hit $1 as Charles Hoskison celebrated a new ecosystem milestone. ADA Price in Focus as Charles Hoskinson Cheers Key Cardano News A common critique of Cardano is that it is a ghost chain or a blockchain network with no major dApps in its ecosystem. Charles Hoskinson, its founder, addressed these concerns in an X post last week. In a reply to a FastCompany article, he argued that Cardano had real numbers. He then pointed out that the market was largely cheering other chains with fake numbers. Charles Hoskinson Addresses Cardano Ghost Chain Claims In another X post , he celebrated a crucial Cardano news, where a San Francisco startup named as Haus was actively hiring a developer to migrate from Ethereum to Cardano. This is a notable development since Haus is a fast-growing company that has raised $40 million in venture funding. Haus is a tech company that offers online marketing optimization to companies of all sizes. As such, it likely wants to use Cardano because of its lower costs, fast transaction speeds, and the fact that it is one of the most decentralized players in the crypto industry. Still, Cardano’s ecosystem is still smaller than others compared to other chains. Its DeFi ecosystem has a total value locked (TVL) of $365 million , while its stablecoin market cap is just $23 million. In contrast, Solana has $6.8 billion and $12 billion in stablecoins. Cardano Price Technical Analysis Technicals point to more ADA price upside in the coming weeks. On the weekly chart, it has formed a descending channel and is slightly above its lower side. The coin has formed a bullish flag pattern, which is characterized by a vertical line and some consolidation. Cardano is being supported by the 50-week moving average, meaning that the uptrend that started in 2024 is still intact. The coin is also hovering near its key support at $0.806. Also, as this CoinGape article noted , it is in the second phase of the Elliot Wave pattern . This phase is usually followed by the third wave, which is usually the longest. As such, hopes of the coin hitting $1 will remain as long as it is above the 50-week moving average. Cardano Price Chart A drop below the lower side of the bullish flag at $0.52 will invalidate the bullish ADA outlook , and point to a drop to $0.282, the lowest swing on August 5.

The Graph rivals some Web2 data oracles for its efficiency and low costs. GRT, its native token, however, remains a victim of general market dynamics and high volatility. If observed over the larger picture, the current sentiment is bearish, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. What can we expect from GRT price analysis next? The Graph price analysis gives out a highly bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends. GRT/USD value has spiked up to a $0.1029 high in the last 24 hours. From an overall observation, the cryptocurrency received up to 6.89% of recovery today. Technical indicators give out a relatively neutral overview of the market. However, the price charts continue to reflect the bullish supremacy during the day. Why is GRT up? The increase in the Graph’s value could be attributed to the general bullish market sentiment. Moreover, the past few weeks supported the bulls, as the buying pressure remained substantially high. Will GRT reach $0.5? Yes, GRT should rise above $0.5 in 2028. In that year, the price will range between $0.446 and $0.510. WIll GRT reach $1? Per the analysts’ price predictions, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $1 by 2031. WIll GRT reach $10? Considering GRT’s current price and market cap, it remains highly unlikely that it will reach $10 in the next ten years. Does GRT have a good long-term future? According to the market assumptions, GRT is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

This marks the first time a property and casualty (P&C) insurer has held all of its regulatory reserves in BTC while continuing to denominate its insurance policies and premiums in U.S. dollars. The company expressed the benefits of its funding approach, allowing regulators and auditors to verify reserves in real time. According to Tabit, its use of BTC as capital is intended to provide an alternative source of capacity for the insurance industry. The company operates as a segregated cell company, which allows for additional cells to be formed to deploy capital in the insurance sector. This structure also enables BTC holders to earn USD returns through their own segregated cells. William Shihara, co-founder of Tabit, stated, “Our approach to capital allocation underscores our confidence in providing a steady hand to our partners. By combining traditional balance sheet strength with carefully chosen assets like bitcoin, we’re able to stay responsive to market shifts and better serve the insurance community. This solution offers a regulated dollar return which we’re excited to earn on an alternative asset class such as bitcoin.” The company also emphasized that its reserves are verifiable on the blockchain through a proof-of-reserves model, which allows for real-time transparency beyond the typical quarterly disclosures in the insurance industry. “At Tabit, we saw a clear opportunity to enhance transparency within an industry that has been sorely lacking in innovation,” said Stephen Stonberg, co-founder and CEO. “We’re eager to move the insurance sector into the future by demonstrating what is possible by allowing an insurer to access a largely new and untapped source of insurance capital: digital assets.” Tabit is headquartered in Bridgetown, Barbados, a jurisdiction known for its captive insurance market and is a top ten global captive jurisdiction. The company states that Barbados’ regulatory framework provides oversight for its operations. Tabit plans to work with insurance carriers, brokers, and organizations seeking additional capacity or alternative risk financing options. It also aims to collaborate with large holders of digital assets who want to generate USD income while maintaining BTC exposure.

Market analysts foresee a possible correction, with downside targets ranging between $72,800 and $80,000. Beware of a New Pullback The primary cryptocurrency started the business week on the right foot, with its price soaring above $88,000 for the first time since March 7. Despite the solid gains , though , one important indicator suggests that the rally might be short-lived and followed by a new correction. The metric in question is Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and change of price movements. The ratio varies from 0 to 100, and readings above 70 typically signal that the asset might be in overbought territory, with its price potentially preparing to head south. Over the past several hours, the RSI has been hovering slightly above that bearish zone. Some analysts also support the thesis that the BTC bulls might suffer additional pain in the near future . The X user Koroush AK believes the asset’s price pattern continues to follow an HTF downtrend. The market observer projected that the valuation might drop to as low as $72,800 unless BTC reclaims $92,000. Captain Faibik gave their two cents, too. The analyst claimed BTC is still trading within a falling wedge pattern, envisioning a potential decline to $80,000 before a subsequent surge toward $109,000 in the following weeks. How About a New ATH? Another well-known person in the crypto space who touched upon the matter is Arthur Hayes (co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX). Earlier today (March 24), he predicted that BTC’s price is more likely to hit a fresh peak of $110,000 than tank to $76,500. “If we hit $110k, then it’s yachtzee time and we ain’t looking back until $250k,” he added. Hayes based his prediction on the potential quantitative easing (QE) policy the US Federal Reserve might enforce in the coming months. The central bank usually takes this step to stimulate the economy when interest rates are already low and traditional methods aren’t enough. QE involves money printing to buy government bonds and other financial assets. It is typically implemented during recessions or financial crises and encourages borrowing, spending, and investing. Currently, the US inflation rate is higher than the Fed’s target of 2%, which seems to be among the main reasons why interest rates remained unchanged after the previous FOMC meeting. It will be interesting to see whether the central bank will lower the benchmark (as expected) in its next meeting and whether that will benefit the crypto market.

42275235,https://blockworks.co/news/nillion-launch-privacy-focus,1742836266,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Starting from NIL: Privacy focus of Nillion,https://blockworks.co/news/nillion-launch-privacy-focus,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . After months of delay, Nillion has officially launched its mainnet — a milestone for one of crypto’s more technically-ambitious privacy networks. Focused on the market for “blind compute,” Nillion hopes its architecture will unlock a new set of use-cases with long-term impact. Alongside mainnet is the NIL token, which debuted today on exchanges, including Binance. The mainnet was previously slated for February (under the moniker “Nilluary”), but the launch slipped into late March. “Good tech needs time to cook,” a team member quipped on the project’s Discord last month. And this wasn’t the first time. Nillion marketing head Charlie Rogers previously wrote the mainnet delay was due to the fact that “the broader economic markets and the crypto industry have been filled with uncertainty and turmoil,” and urged that “during times of uncertainty, the best path forward is to keep building.” That sounds like it could easily apply to the present day, but it was in August 2024! At the time, Nillion’s community was already eagerly awaiting the release of NIL. The project has raised $50 million across VC and angel rounds since 2022 . But now the day has finally arrived. While only 19.5% of supply is circulating at launch — and a 48-month total unlock schedule — a full 80% is allocated to insiders or entities under their control. Source: Nillion The figures for early backers (21%) and core contributors (20%) are straightforward. Another 10% goes to “protocol development,” and 29% to “ecosystem and R&D” — both typically team-directed. That leaves 20% clearly earmarked for the community. Unlock cliffs hit between months 6 and 12, followed by linear vesting. Most insider allocations will be substantially unlocked within three years. Despite the typical vesting period, the structure skews toward early stakeholders, leaving an important question: Will the team deploy the ecosystem and community buckets in ways that meaningfully decentralize ownership — or will governance and value capture remain top-heavy? ‘Validator’ is a misnomer Nillion isn’t a blockchain — it doesn’t rely on consensus to settle transactions or produce blocks. Instead, it’s a decentralized infrastructure for privacy-preserving computation. Consequently, its validators’ nodes don’t validate transactions or reach consensus on a shared state like in Ethereum or Solana. Instead, their role is to jointly perform secure, distributed computations on encrypted data. Its architecture is built around multi-party computation ( MPC ) — a cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over private inputs, without ever revealing the inputs themselves. Whereas most privacy networks in crypto focus on privacy in transaction layers (e.g., Zcash with zk-SNARKs, Monero with ring signatures, or Tornado Cash with mixers), Nillion targets off-chain compute privacy — enabling smart applications (e.g., AI inference, genomic analysis, financial modeling) to operate on encrypted data without decrypting it. This unlocks a different class of use cases beyond anonymous payments or shielded transfers. So far, the mainnet supports an early wave of ecosystem projects. These include: Ritual , for blind AI inference; Skillful AI, a privacy-first AI assistant network; Salt, a financial application enabling confidential portfolio comparisons among wealth managers; Monadic DNA, for secure genomics analytics; and Soarchain, which lays claim to having processed over 130 million privacy-preserved data points from a global driving competition. That said, access to the network remains tightly gated. Nillion’s node program ended in late 2024, and there are currently no plans to open validator participation. The current set of testnet validators remains closed, and community node operations are on pause. Developers can build on the network, but compute execution depends on approved infrastructure — a scaleability tradeoff for MPC networks. For participants in Nillion’s 2024 CoinList Community Round, the vesting schedule is as follows:​ Capped purchases: 5% of tokens unlock at the TGE (today), with the remaining 95% vesting linearly over six months.​ Uncapped purchases: 25% of tokens unlocked, with the remaining 75% vesting monthly over the subsequent 24 months, completing by mid-March 2027. Looking ahead, Nillion says it will focus on expanding its orchestration layer and building out tooling to make private computation more accessible. The long-term ambition is to become a generalized privacy layer for Web3 applications and beyond. The question now is whether the network can translate its unique architecture into real-world traction — before the token unlocks start to ramp up. As of 12:00 p.m. ET, NIL is changing hands at about $0.74, giving Nillion a $750-million fully-diluted valuation. Get the news in your inbox.

If you’ve been around long enough, you’ve probably witnessed some tokens surge overnight, leaving those who hesitated kicking themselves for not getting in earlier. Celestia (TIA) is one of those cryptos that took off, delivering massive gains while many sat on the sidelines, watching in disbelief. But here’s the good news: there’s always a second chance in crypto—and this time, it comes in the form of Qubetics ($TICS). While Celestia built its success around modular blockchain infrastructure, Qubetics is shaping up to be the next big disruptor in Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy this month , missing out on Qubetics could be a mistake you’ll regret. Celestia (TIA) – The One That Got Away The pain of missing out on Celestia is real. The modular blockchain project made waves with its groundbreaking approach to scalable, customizable blockchain solutions. Its data availability layer allows developers to create lightweight chains that don’t have to worry about consensus or security, making it a game-changer for blockchain adoption. Earlier this year, Celestia’s price skyrocketed, delivering eye-watering returns. Those who bought early are sitting on triple-digit gains, while those who waited for a dip are still waiting. TIA shot past multiple resistance levels, fueled by strong community demand, developer adoption, and a growing belief in modular blockchain technology. For many, the dream of owning Celestia at a bargain price is gone. The price surge wasn’t just hype—it was driven by solid fundamentals. And now? It’s already cemented itself as a major player, making it harder to find that same level of explosive upside. The market has spoken, and those who got in early are the winners. If you missed Celestia, you’re probably wondering: where’s the next big opportunity? This is where Qubetics comes in. Qubetics – The Next Big RWA Tokenization Play? For those still searching for the best cryptos to buy this month, Qubetics might just be the answer. The project is taking on one of the most explosive trends in Web3: Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. RWAs have been touted as the bridge between traditional finance and blockchain, allowing assets like real estate, stocks, commodities, and intellectual property to be digitized and traded on the blockchain. Right now, the sector is booming, with institutions pouring billions into tokenized assets. But there’s a problem: most blockchains aren’t designed for seamless asset tokenization. Liquidity is fragmented, interoperability is limited, and the user experience is still too complex for mainstream adoption. Qubetics is solving these issues with its advanced cross-chain marketplace for RWAs. Imagine a future where you can fractionally invest in a luxury skyscraper, a blue-chip stock, or even a rare art piece—all without dealing with intermediaries or outdated banking systems. That’s what Qubetics is building, and early adopters could be in for serious gains. Why Qubetics Is Positioned for a Massive Breakout Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project—it’s an aggregator for Web3, bringing multiple ecosystems together under one roof. Here’s what makes it stand out: Multi-Chain Asset Tokenization – Unlike single-chain solutions, Qubetics enables real-world assets to be tokenized across multiple blockchains, unlocking deep liquidity and broader accessibility. Interoperability at Its Core – Its framework allows seamless cross-chain trading of RWAs, reducing friction for institutional and retail participants. Advanced Security & Compliance – Regulatory hurdles have slowed down RWA adoption, but Qubetics is integrating compliance-friendly mechanisms to ensure smooth onboarding for both institutional and individual users. These factors position Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to buy this month, with its presale providing a rare chance to buy before its market cap explodes. Qubetics Presale – Your Last Chance Before the Next Price Jump The Qubetics crypto presale is moving fast—and early-stage momentum is at an all-time high. Early whitelist participants in Qubetics got the ultimate head start—snagging $TICS tokens at just $0.01, all without spending a dime upfront. Talk about a first-mover advantage. Since its official launch on September 29, 2024, Qubetics has rapidly progressed through stage after stage, with each new round pushing the token price higher. If you’ve been waiting for a signal to jump in, consider this it. The Best Cryptos to Buy This Month are already emerging—and Qubetics is blazing the trail. Now in Stage 27, $TICS is priced at $0.1300, with over 503 million tokens sold and more than 23,700 holders securing their spot ahead of the much-anticipated mainnet launch in Q2 2025. With a 10% price hike hitting every Sunday at midnight, hesitation could cost you more than you think. Let’s crunch the numbers. A $2,000 investment at the current price of $0.1300 gets you approximately 15,380 $TICS tokens. Now imagine Qubetics hitting its next major price targets. At $1, your investment would grow to $15,380—a 669.13% ROI. At $5, you’re looking at $76,900. And if $TICS climbs to $10, that return doubles to $153,800. The boldest projections push the token to $15, which would turn your $2,000 into a massive $230,700—an incredible 11,436.99% ROI. This isn’t just crypto hype—it’s a strategic presale backed by strong fundamentals and real momentum. That’s exactly why Qubetics is being named one of the most promising tokens to grab in March 2025. With the countdown to the next price hike already underway, this is more than just a hot presale—it’s your chance to secure a rare position before the rest of the world catches up. Miss this stage, and you’ll be paying more next week. Conclusion – Will You Make the Same Mistake Twice? The crypto market rarely gives second chances. Celestia’s price action is proof that early adopters always win, while latecomers scramble to catch up. If you sat on the sidelines and watched TIA skyrocket, you now have the opportunity to get ahead of the next breakout project. Qubetics is making waves in RWA tokenization and cross-chain interoperability, two of the biggest narratives for 2025. With the presale nearing its next price jump, the time to act is now. Opportunities like this don’t come often. If you’re still waiting on the sidelines, you could be watching Qubetics moon from a distance—just like you did with Celestia.

The proposal outlines key regulatory measures designed to address investor protection, market structure, and transaction reporting. CoinRegTech’s recommendations focus on three main regulatory changes that aim to strengthen the framework surrounding digital asset securities. First, the proposal emphasizes the need for clearer investor protection measures and urges the SEC to enforce structural requirements for trading platforms that facilitate digital asset securities transactions. This would help ensure that investors are adequately safeguarded in an evolving market landscape. Second, CoinRegTech advocates for revisions to the Securities Exchange Act to enhance transaction reporting mechanisms. These updates would also aim to clarify market supervision responsibilities, thereby improving the overall structure and reliability of the market. Third, the firm introduces the Digital Asset Electronic Reporting System, which is proposed to be developed in collaboration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission . This new reporting system would play a vital role in enhancing regulatory oversight of digital asset transactions, promoting greater transparency and accountability in the market. According to CoinRegTech, implementing these recommendations would increase transparency in cryptocurrency markets, enhance investor protection, and contribute to a more stable regulatory environment.

The agency has taken an active role in enforcing existing securities laws within the digital asset space, frequently arguing that many crypto tokens qualify as securities and should be regulated accordingly. The SEC appears open to refining its approach rather than solely relying on enforcement actions. If adopted, these measures could have significant implications for the crypto industry, particularly for exchanges and trading platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of digital asset securities. The introduction of investor protection measures and structural requirements could lead to stricter compliance rules for crypto platforms, similar to those imposed on traditional securities exchanges. Additionally, revising the Securities Exchange Act to account for digital assets may provide greater legal clarity for companies operating in the space. CFTC and market supervision One of the most notable aspects of the proposal is the call for cooperation between the SEC and the CFTC through the development of DART . The two agencies have long debated their respective roles in overseeing digital assets, with the SEC asserting authority over crypto assets classified as securities and the CFTC overseeing digital commodities like Bitcoin ( BTC ).

Berachain ( BERA ) price jumped to a high of $7.45, up by 42% from its lowest level this year. This surge has brought its market cap to over $795 million. Berachain’s surge happened as its decentralized finance ecosystem gained momentum. According to DeFi LLama , the network’s total value locked jumped to a record high of $3.2 billion, a big increase from the year-to-date low of $770 million. Most decentralized applications on the Berachain network have added funds in the past few months.

Further, the BERA token price rose after the developers launched the Proof of Liquidity feature, which allows users to earn rewards. They introduced 37 new reward vaults, which will distribute BGT emissions across the ecosystem. A look at the vaults website shows that active incentives rose to $355,000 a few hours after launch, with the largest one offering an annual percentage rate of about 215%. https://twitter.com/berachain/status/1904196335659606294 Berachain price analysis BERA price chart | Source: crypto.news The three-hour chart shows that the BERA price has bounced back from this month’s low of $5.25 to a high of $7.8. It has soared above the crucial resistance point at $7.08, the upper side of the ascending triangle pattern. Such a triangle is one of the most bullish continuation signs in the market. Berachain price has moved to the ultimate resistance of the Murrey Math Lines at $7.8125. The Relative Strength Index and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicators have continued rising. The bullish trend will likely continue as bulls target the extreme overshoot at $8.60. This is a notable level since it was the highest swing on March 3. A drop below the support at $7 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

Image source: CoinStats Ton network launched in 2018 as the Telegram Open Network (TON) but was later renamed “The Open Network” and taken over by the TON Foundation. In June 2020, all Toncoin tokens (98.55% of the total supply) became available for mining. The tokens were placed in special Giver smart contracts, enabling anyone to mine until 28 June 2022. Users mined around 200,000 TON daily. All the tokens were mined in two years, marking the completion of the distribution event. On September 20, 2021, TON registered its all-time low price at $0.3906. Its first significant break came in November 2021. In days, the coin slid from $0.8 to $4.5. It corrected in 2022, reaching a low of $0.9. In 2023, it ranged between $1.1 and $2.5. In 2024, it registered another bull run, rising from $2.11 to its all-time high of $8.24 on Jun 15, 2024. It corrected later and traded at the $5.2 mark in October and $4.98 in November when it started recovering. The recovery saw the coin rise above $6.5 in December. It then crossed into 2025, trading at $5.5. From there, it assumed a bear run as it fell below $3.8 in February and $1.40 in March.",Crypto Price Predictions|Toncoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|TON,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-24 17:20:20

Now, traders are wondering what factors could drive Bitcoin's daily close above $92,000, which last occurred on March 3. Adding to cryptocurrency investors’ frustration, gold is trading just 1% below its record high of $3,057, while Bitcoin price trades 19% away from its all-time high. S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Some analysts attribute Bitcoin's recent price gains to the US-listed company Strategy increasing its BTC reserves , while others highlight macroeconomic factors, such as easing inflation expectations and a softer stance from US President Donald Trump on tariffs. Despite this constructive backdrop, traders question what is preventing Bitcoin from maintaining its bullish momentum. Bitcoin’s upside is limited as investors fear an economic recession Economists expect signs of a slowdown in the ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which is projected to rise by 2.7% in February, according to Yahoo News. This data, the US Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, is set to be released on March 26. Implied expectations for the Sept. 17 FOMC. Source: CME FedWatch tool / Cointelegraph If confirmed, the softer inflationary trend would support Federal Reserve Chair Powell's remarks on transitory inflation and increase the likelihood of two interest rate cuts in 2025, as reflected in the Treasury futures market. As the US central bank shifts to a less restrictive monetary policy, risk markets typically benefit from increased liquidity and reduced fixed-income appeal. However, uncertainty remains regarding economic growth. Investors are increasingly worried about recession risks due to excessive valuations in artificial intelligence stocks and concerns that US federal spending cuts could negatively impact consumers and the commercial real estate market. While these issues have little direct connection to Bitcoin, traders fear that all risk markets could suffer if the threat of stagflation emerges. The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump is considering scaling back some tariffs initially planned for April 2. Although unconfirmed, the news suggests Trump may exclude certain industry-specific duties and grant exemptions to some nations. On March 24, S&P 500 futures rose 1.5% as investors perceived lower economic contraction risks, potentially supporting Bitcoin’s price gains. Strategy buys more Bitcoin, but is their tactic sustainable? On March 24, Strategy announced the acquisition of an additional $584 million in Bitcoin, increasing its holdings to 506,137 BTC. The funds for this latest purchase came from the sale of 1.97 million common stock shares, along with the broader $21 billion STRK perpetual preferred stock issuance program. These expanded fundraising options have improved the company’s chances of reaching its ambitious $42 billion Bitcoin acquisition target. While this news appears positive for Bitcoin’s price in the short term, if the US Federal Reserve implements expansionist measures, corporate earnings will likely accelerate, making stocks relatively cheaper. Likewise, a reduced risk of a full-scale global tariff war benefits the stock market and lowers risks in the artificial intelligence and commercial real estate sectors. Related: Bitcoin ‘more likely’ to hit $110K before $76.5K — Arthur Hayes Source: DexyyDx Critics argue that Strategy has been the primary factor supporting Bitcoin’s $80,000 level, posing a risk of price corrections if the company fails to raise additional funds or pauses its stock issuance program for any reason. However, this view overlooks the fact that Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $786 million in net inflows between March 14 and March 21. In essence, Bitcoin is well-positioned to recapture the $92,000 level, although it remains heavily dependent on overall macroeconomic conditions. Regardless of gold’s performance, investors view Bitcoin as a risk-on asset, favoring a higher correlation with the stock market, at least in the short term.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalisation rose by approximately 2% to $1.74 trillion. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index climbed 15 points to 45. Although still in ‘fear’ territory, the shift reflects a significant improvement in trader sentiment. Several of the altcoins posted modest gains, though overall momentum remained largely concentrated in Bitcoin. Will Bitcoin price go up? Bitcoin’s price has been moving sideways in a wide range between $76,600 and $87,500 since 11 March. One analyst says it’ll need to break above $90,000 soon, or this choppy phase could drag on longer. According to Daan Crypto Trades, right now, the price is hovering in the middle of the range, with no clear direction. He says sentiment and momentum could flip bullish again if Bitcoin manages to reclaim the previous range between $90,800 and $108,500, which might open the door to new highs. If that doesn’t happen, he’s eyeing the $73K–$74K zone as the next major level to watch. In the long term, though, he remains bullish and sees the recent correction as a normal pullback in an ongoing bull cycle. Currently, several bullish catalysts remain in Bitcoin’s favour. For instance, Bitcoin’s funding rates are around 0%, indicating indecisiveness in the market. When funding rates are neutral, there’s little cost to holding positions, which takes pressure off both longs and shorts. That can help stabilise prices in the short term, reducing volatility and keeping Bitcoin in a consolidation phase. At the same time, sentiment is starting to tilt in Bitcoin’s favour as broader macro conditions shift. Trump has softened his stance on the upcoming 2 April reciprocal tariffs, easing fears of an all-out trade war. On top of that, the Federal Reserve has signalled it may pause further rate hikes for now, giving markets more room to breathe. Meanwhile, signs of strong accumulation are starting to show. On-chain analyst Ali Martinez pointed out a large transfer of 10,000 BTC—worth roughly $842.9 million—from exchanges to self-custody wallets. He described the move as “strongly bullish,” noting that large outflows like this often signal that investors are planning to hold for the long term. With fewer coins available on exchanges, selling pressure tends to drop, which could support a move higher if momentum picks up. Another bullish case was presented by analyst Niels, who pointed out that the M2 money supply just hit a new all-time high. Historically, every time this has happened, Bitcoin has followed up with a new high of its own within 8 to 12 weeks. Based on that pattern, Niels believes the chances of Bitcoin reaching a fresh all-time high by April or May are pretty strong. A chart shared by the analyst suggested a high of around $123,000 by mid-July. Over the short term, Bitcoin is now testing a key level around the $88,000–$89,000 range—the 21-week EMA, which is often seen as critical support in bull markets. According to analyst Rekt Capital, if BTC can reclaim this area as support, it could open the door for a breakout toward $93,500. When writing, Bitcoin was changing hands at $87,743, up 3% in the past 24 hours. Altcoin market reacts to Trump Altcoin markets saw a brief spike in activity after U.S. President Donald Trump praised the meme token Official Trump (TRUMP) in a post on Truth Social. The total altcoin market cap briefly jumped to a daily high of $1.28 trillion but quickly gave up those gains, slipping back to $1.24 trillion by late Asian trading hours on Monday. The altcoin season index dropped a point to 17. The leading gainers for the day were: SPX6900 SPX6900 (SPX) rose 25% over the past day to a three-week high of $0.629 at press time while its market cap was seated at $580 million. Its daily trading volume jumped 146% over the period to $42.52 million, a sign of heightened interest among traders. Source: CoinMarketCap Most of the gains came after analyst Murad, who has over 716.1k followers on X, shilled SPX, which he believes could have the same potential as BTC or top meme coins like SHIB or DOGE since their launch. Some of these gains also came from a spike in demand from derivatives traders, with open interest in the futures market jumping 27% from the previous day to $25.09 million. The weighted funding rate also flipped positive, suggesting most of these traders were bullish on its long-term potential. Fartcoin Over the last 24 hours, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) rallied 24% to an intraday high of $0.631 with its market cap rising to $610 million. The memecoin’s daily trading volume stood at over $217 million up 58% over the period. Source: CoinMarketCap FARTCOIN’s gains today were part of a broader meme coin rally, with the market surging 9.4% after President Donald Trump posted about TRUMP on Truth Social, which helped spark the momentum. Meanwhile, on the 1-day chart, FARTCOIN is forming a rounded bottom pattern, a gradual, U-shaped curve that often signals easing selling pressure and a shift in market sentiment. Sometimes, this pattern sets up a cup and handle formation, which can lead to a strong and sustained bullish trend. Render Render (RENDER) jumped 15.7% in the past day, trading at $3.85 at the time of writing. The price surge came with a big spike in daily trading volume, which shot up from $36.5 million to $120 million. Source: CoinMarketCap Today’s gains came following a major update to the Render Network’s generative AI tools, introducing a sleek new interface, streamlined workflows, and more powerful GenAI models. It also added direct image-to-video integration and enhanced image-to-image capabilities, making it easier for creators to generate and evolve content. Additionally, the announcement of RenderCon 2025, scheduled for April 15 at Nya Studios in Hollywood, has boosted investor interest. The inaugural in-person conference will explore the future of media, technology, and art, featuring a full day of talks and panels on emerging trends in GPU rendering across various industries, including film, VFX, virtual production, and more.

While Dogecoin is currently around $0.17, and XRP, trading near $2.47, remain popular among retail investors, their growth potential is limited compared to low-cap gems with strong fundamentals. Now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to grow stronger since its launch. Phase 3 of the presale has already sold out over 60% giving investors once in a lifetime opportunity before it ends. Over $4.5 million has been accumulated and 6400 holders attracted. New investors purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.02 because the value will reach $0.025 as part of Phase 4. Current investors have the opportunity to achieve a 200% return on investment before the project launch occurs at $0.06. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance leads the decentralized lending space through its innovative dual-lending system and it has established itself as a quick-growing collaborative system. The project maintains increasing popularity as 6400 investors put $4.5 million into the presale. During Phase 3 which presents the current trading value of $0.02 investors can expect a 25% price increase in Phase 4 to secure substantial profit potential. Research data indicates that MUTM stands among the most underpriced yet promising DeFi projects set to exceed $1 after its release on the market. Mutuum Finance stands apart for its ability to unite the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in one system. The P2C model combines USDT liquidity pools that produce passive income for users who benefit from automatic smart contracts used for lending operations. Both P2P and P2C models deliver fundamental DeFi functions to users through their different mechanisms for transacting directly between parties without third-party involvement. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. The Development of a Stable Secure Environment To demonstrate its focus on stability Mutuum Finance releases a fully secured Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by USD. The stablecoin token stands distinct from algorithmic stablecoins because Mutuum Finance bases it on over-collateralization to provide both risk reduction and long-term trustworthiness. Open financial architectures paired with audited smart contracts alongside this architecture strengthen investor trust by covering all the vulnerabilities found in past DeFi projects. Compensation to its initial investors and an inclusive investment network. Mutuum Finance implements incentive plans as a method to increase its community reach. By offering a million-dollar giveaway the program will give out 10 thousand dollars worth of MUTM tokens to winners among 10 participants in addition to its innovative referral system that pays users for successful new investor acquisitions. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance obtain both special staking pools and governance rights and VIP access to platform updates which keeps them committed to the platform over the long term. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance implements controlled token supply restrictions and deflationary mechanics throughout presales to build scarcity in its framework thus boosting the token’s potential value growth. The staking program gives crypto users attractive incentives to remain engaged while ensuring token sustainability during long-term development of the platform. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) may dominate in popularity, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers greater upside potential. Phase 3 of its presale is 60% sold out at $0.02, with over $4.5M raised and 6,400 investors onboard. A 25% price jump to $0.025 is coming before launching at $0.06, a 200% potential gain.

Amid the renewed bullish sentiment, 4 crypto tokens have stood out, with technical analysis suggesting that they could easily post 10x gains this week. These altcoins include Kekius Maximus (KEKIUS), Sonic (S), Render (RENDER), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Crypto Tokens to Buy for 10X Gains in the Last Week of March As the crypto market shows signs of a recovery, the following crypto tokens are well poised to make significant price gains. These tokens could easily deliver 10x gains. Kekius Maximus (KEKIUS) KEKIUS is one of the crypto tokens that could record 10x gains in the last week of March. At press time, KEKIUS trades at $0.025 with a staggering 20% gain. The KEKIUS price rally started last week after Elon Musk’s X post that showed his office with a wall picture of the Kekius Maximum frog. A bullish double-bottom pattern has emerged on the KEKIUS daily price chart. If the meme coin confirms this pattern by flipping resistance at the neckline of $0.031, it could spark a 1,800% price rally toward the all-time high of $0.40. The RSI has risen to 60, which shows that bulls are in control. The ADX line is tipping north, a sign that the uptrend will continue. This makes it likely for traders to make 10x gains with KEKIUS this week. KEKIUS/USDT: 4-hour Chart Sonic (S) Crypto traders can also make 10x gains with Sonic, previously known as Fantom. Sonic trades at $0.59 with a 13% gain in 24 hours. This crypto token is not only gaining because of the positive sentiment across the broader market but also because of rising utility. Data from DeFiLlama reveals that Sonic’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is at an all-time high of $1.38 billion, and has even flipped the Polygon layer 2 network. As the TVL gradually rises, it will boost investor confidence in Sonic, and trigger a 10x price gain in the last week of March, making it one of the top altcoins to buy. Sonic DeFi TVL Render (RENDER) Render is among the best-performing crypto tokens today with a 16% gain in the last 24 hours to trade at $3.88. Traders who buy this altcoin this week can easily register 10x price gains after a bullish setup on the four-hour price chart. If these gains continue, the next resistance for Render price is $4.86. If this altcoin flips this level, the target price is the 423.6% Fibonacci level of $8.66. The sudden uptick in buying pressure has seen the RSI surge to 78, which shows a bullish Render price prediction that could lead to a 10x times gain. RENDER/USDT: 4-hour Chart Official Trump (TRUMP) TRUMP is also rallying today after President Donald Trump posted the meme coin’s ticker on Truth Social. In his post, Trump endorsed the meme coin saying it was “the greatest of them all.” The four-hour price chart shows that bulls are gaining more ground, and could soon push TRUMP price up by more than ten times on the last week of March. The RSI has made a series of lower highs and moved above 50, showing a strong uptrend. The bullish MACD also makes TRUMP one of the top crypto tokens to buy. As President Trump drives the rally, the meme coin could likely surge toward $24. TRUMP/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Final Thoughts on Top Crypto Tokens to Buy Cryptocurrencies have registered slight gains today, with Bitcoin trending higher as traders look for the best altcoins to buy. As the market sentiment turns positive, KEKIUS, Sonic, RENDER, and TRUMP will likely make 10x gains in the last week of March.

Chainlink ( LINK ) rose to $15.5 on Monday, its highest level since March 9, and 26% above its lowest point on March 11. The rebound may continue as Chainlink’s fundamentals strengthen. In a statement, the developers noted that Chainlink had surpassed the $20 trillion milestone in terms of transaction value enabled, a key indicator of network activity and adoption. Chainlink has reached this milestone since 2022, and the upward trajectory continues. Some of the largest decentralized exchanges using Chainlink’s technology include Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, 1inch, and Curve Finance. Chainlink also powers major decentralized finance protocols like AAVE, Spark, Compound, and Venus. Chainlink’s ecosystem continues to grow. The platform recently partnered with Abu Dhabi Global Market , a leading international financial center in the United Arab Emirates, to support dialogue on blockchain and artificial intelligence regulation. Over the years, Chainlink has also secured agreements with some of the biggest names in the financial sector. It was selected as the oracle and tokenization blockchain by Emirates NBD, the largest bank in the UAE. Chainlink is also working with SWIFT, UBS, JPMorgan, and Coinbase, among others.

It has already risen from a low of $11.87 on March 11 to the current $15.5. Chainlink has formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal signal. A wedge is made of two descending and converging trendlines, indicating that downward momentum is fading, with a bullish breakout often occurring when the two lines converge. Chainlink price has also moved above the 25-day moving average. Additionally, the Percentage Price Oscillator lines have pointed upwards, forming a bullish crossover. The Relative Strength Index has moved above 50, signaling increased buying pressure. Therefore, Chainlink price could see further gains, with the next target at the psychological level of $25.

42275919,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=698898,1742837715,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png,South Korean auto giant Hyundai will invest $20B in America to bolster EVs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/hyundai-will-invest-20b-in-america/,"Hyundai will pour $20 billion into building up its U.S. manufacturing, including a $5 billion steel plant in Louisiana, where around 1,500 workers will be hired to make advanced steel for electric vehicles. That information is reportedly expected to be announced Monday at the White House by President Donald Trump, Hyundai Chairman Euisun Chung, and Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry. The steel will be used at Hyundai’s two car factories in Alabama and Georgia. That’s where Hyundai is already making electric cars that compete directly with Tesla. On top of this, Hyundai is also expected to reveal a third U.S. car plant, again in Georgia, during the same White House event. Hyundai speeds up U.S. expansion ahead of Trump’s tariff deadline Hyundai’s move comes just days before April 2, when Trump is expected to push out new tariffs against countries with trade surpluses, including South Korea. Companies are now rushing to get ahead of that. Taiwan Semiconductor and SoftBank have already made their trips to the White House in the past two months to announce their own American expansions. José Muñoz, the CEO of Hyundai Motor, explained this move during an interview with Axios, saying, “The best way for Hyundai to navigate tariffs is to increase localization.” That means building more inside the U.S. and importing less. This steel factory is part of that plan. It will build next-gen steel that Hyundai’s American plants will use in electric vehicles, avoiding overseas sourcing and slashing reliance on imports. The White House confirmed the announcement is coming when they responded to a request for comment from CNBC by pointing to a post on X from Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary. She posted, “More investments, more jobs, and more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans – all thanks to President Trump’s economic policies.” This is not just about Hyundai. It’s part of a bigger wave. Trump has made it clear that he wants big foreign companies to build inside the U.S. to avoid getting hit with tariffs. Other international firms are getting the message. Apple said last month it would spend $500 billion over the next four years to expand across the U.S., including manufacturing and facility upgrades. That announcement was widely seen as a way to stay ahead of potential China-related tariffs, even though parts of that investment had already started. Then in January, Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank teamed up to launch a new AI venture called Stargate. They said they’d be investing $500 billion into it over the next several years. That project is aimed at growing artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S., and again, that timing doesn’t seem accidental. Meanwhile, Trump has also taken shots at South Korea over trade. In early March, he said that South Korea applies higher tariffs to U.S. exports—four times higher than what the U.S. imposes on South Korean imports. Seoul disagreed and said that under the free trade pact between both countries, the effective tariff rate on U.S. imports was just 0.79% in 2024. The tension around trade rules is exactly why Hyundai is moving fast. They’re cutting risk by building more directly in the U.S. That includes cars, steel, and everything in between. It also helps that Hyundai is already one of the top EV sellers in the country. That gives them a reason to double down. But history says not every flashy investment deal at the White House turns out the way it’s pitched. Back in 2017, Trump stood with Foxconn and announced a $10 billion factory in Wisconsin. That deal was supposed to create 13,000 jobs and pump out high-tech electronics. But it didn’t. The project fizzled out. In 2021, the company walked it back and said they’d invest just $672 million instead. That smaller deal was only expected to create under 1,500 jobs—a long way from the original promise. This announcement helps Hyundai avoid the kind of tariff mess that’s got other companies scrambling. It checks the boxes: job creation, American factories, and keeping the supply chain close to home. That’s the game now. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The action stems from the SEC’s lawsuit against him for allegedly failing to properly report his acquisition of Twitter stock in 2022 before trying to buy the business. According to reports, four of them voted yes, with only SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda voting against. The unexpected thing is that the Republican, Hester Peirce, voted yes. However, both Uyeda and Peirce did not agree with what the SEC wanted Musk to do: give up $150 million in claimed unjust enrichment plus a fine. ⚖️🐦 SEC Voted 4-1 to Sue Elon Musk Over Twitter Share Disclosure Before Trump Took Office Tickers of interest: $TSLA $USD Full Story → https://t.co/oRprlMrO4B pic.twitter.com/8DWPknuFba — PiQ (@PiQSuite) March 24, 2025 Under U.S. law, investors who accumulate a stake exceeding 5% of a company’s outstanding shares must disclose that holding within 10 days. When Musk told the public about it in April 2022, Twitter’s share price went up 27% over the previous close. The SEC says Musk was able to save $150 million on his purchase of Twitter because he told the public about it 21 days after he had bought it. This allowed him to buy more shares at lower prices. According to reports, days before the vote, Uyeda asked law enforcement officials working on the Musk case to sign papers saying that the case was not political. According to sources who spoke to Reuters, the staff refused to sign the promise because that’s not common for the SEC. Musk has been delaying the case The SEC sued Musk on January 14, a week after the 4-1 vote in favour that week. Twitter shareholders also sued Musk for fraud. Sources say that agency investigators investigated whether they could prove any purpose behind his late filing, which could have led to more serious charges. They also investigated the timing of his disclosure. Musk said he quickly told the SEC about the stake after learning he had misunderstood the rule on disclosure, and the SEC did not bring any charges alleging intent in the end. The investigation took longer because Musk kept putting it off. He said yes to being questioned twice in 2022, but then said no to being questioned a third time. That’s why the SEC asked a judge to make him show more proof. He showed up on October 3, 2024, but the fight that went on for a year meant that the problem could not be fixed before the election. Could this be some sort of strategy? Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer who worked in two administrations, said, “They could have brought it closer to the timing of the conduct But bringing it at the last minute – literally – it loses credibility. That’s problematic for any agency, especially when dealing with such an obviously politicized issue.” Therefore, the SEC tried to reach a deal with Musk in December, a month before they sued. It said that the SEC had given Musk 48 hours to settle the investigation by paying a fine or face civil charges. The two sides could not come to an agreement. Clearly, the delay didn’t work, and the SEC somehow revived the case. Why? According to Robert Frenchman of Dynamis law firm in New York, “It’s certainly not the violation of the century, but if we care about fair markets and fair enforcement, it would be humiliating for the SEC, a fiercely independent agency, to be seen as backing down.” A few days ago, Elon Musk got a court notice. The filing said that the civil summons was given to Musk on March 14 at the offices of SpaceX in Brownsville, Texas. The server wrote that when he got to the SpaceX building, three different security guards wouldn’t take the papers, and one told him he was breaking the law. He dropped the papers and left while the guards took pictures of him and his car. Market leaders are back at advertising with X A new report says that Musk’s social media site X (formerly known as Twitter) has been able to recover from a big drop in value. The company is now worth $44 billion again. This is a big change for the site because its value dropped after Musk paid $44 billion to buy Twitter in 2022. In fact, Fidelity had marked it down by 72% as of December. How did it get back? The study says that the return of top advertisers is one of the main reasons why X’s value has gone up again. For instance, market leaders like Apple and Amazon have started to spend money on the site again, which is helping to bring back revenue after a drop. In addition, according to Bloomberg, investors, including Musk, have given the social media site about $1 billion in extra shares. As per the story, Darsana Capital Partners took part in the equity round and also bought some of X’s debt. Not long ago. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The company recently acquired 6,911 Bitcoin (BTC), adding more to its holdings. Strategy and Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation As per its Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy acquired Bitcoin between March 17 and 23, 2025. The cash purchase was estimated to cost $584.1 million. Each Bitcoin purchased costs an average of $84,529 per BTC, including fees and expenses. The recent purchase resulted in an average unrealized profit of about $3,000 per BTC, given that the price of the coin has risen since the huge buy. This development brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to over half a million Bitcoin. Strategy currently has 506,137 BTC, which is worth more than $44 billion. On average, each of Strategy’s Bitcoins was bought for $66,608. This gives a net cost of about $33.7 billion, including fees and other expenses. Hence, Strategy has unrealized profits above $10 billion. Analysts emphasize that this staggering profit is why Saylor has remained a Bitcoin advocate. Saylor’s Vision: From First Mover to Market Giant With this move, Strategy has approximately 2.4% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million. The Bitcoin treasury company is inching closer to having half of Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated 1.1 million BTC holdings. Interestingly, Strategy has made this staggering accumulation in less than five years. Strategy, then known as MicroStrategy, became the first listed company to buy Bitcoin as part of its capital allocation move. Its first purchase was 21,454 BTC on July 28, 2020. According to Saylor, “This investment reflects our belief that Bitcoin is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset.” This belief might have prompted Saylor to urge the U.S. government to acquire between 5% and 25% of the Bitcoin supply. Market Reaction and Bitcoin’s Ongoing Surge Market observers maintain that the bet on Bitcoin has paid off for Strategy, given the growth of the asset from 2020 till date. When Strategy made its first purchase, BTC traded below $10,000. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $88,550.95, a 4.30% increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data . Meanwhile, investors are actively transacting, with trading volume currently up by 135.81% to $24.48 billion, a development likely triggered by the Strategy’s recent purchase.

Both Houses are barreling toward tying up loose legislative ends to table a final version of President Donald Trump’s Desk. The GENIUS Act Gathers Significant Steam According to reports , a robust stablecoin regulation is coming to the US in the coming months. The US Senate is deliberating over the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation For US Stablecoins (GENIUS Act), inching forward to a full vote. Following the US Senate Banking Committee’s approval , the GENIUS Act is ready for a full vote on the floor of the Upper Chamber. The legislation, presented by Senator Bill Hagerty seeks to provide a a robust regulatory framework for stablecoins in the US. A quick scan into the wording of the bill reveals provisions for stablecoin issuers to receive approvals from federal and state regulators. There is a requirement for issuers to maintain reserves on a 1:1 basis using acceptable assets. House Of Reps Inch Forward With STABLE Act In the Lower Chamber, the Stablecoin Transparency And Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) is scaling legislative hurdles. The STABLE Act is poised for markup by members of the House Financial Services Committee in early April. Akin to GENIUS, the STABLE Act provides for equivalent reserves with full backing while pushing for stringent audits akin to banking institutions. While GENIUS and STABLE Acts share several similarities, there are key differences in their design. For starters, the STABLE Act seeks to impose the same federal banking regulation on stablecoin issuers while GENIUS proceeds with a tiered approach. President Trump has urged Congress to pass stablecoin legislation in the coming weeks to match new policy direction. Which One Will The White House Favor Insiders say the White House is leaning toward the GENIUS Act over the STABLE Act. According to lobbyists, the White House is eyeing the Senate’s version of a stablecoin regulation. For starters, the GENIUS Act makes provision for smaller stablecoin issuers to operate at the state level in line with the new administration’s stance to promote innovation in the space. Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets Bo Hines is eyeing stablecoin legislation on Trump’s desk in two months. To meet the deadline, the GENIUS Act is far ahead of the STABLE Act in the legislative process. However, there remains the possibility of a Conference Committee from both Houses to create a single version of the stablecoin bills. Lobbyists say a Conference Committee will delay the two-month timeline targeted by the White House. There is optimism that if the GENIUS Act receives 70 votes in the Senate, the House of Representatives may adopt the Senate’s version of a stablecoin legislation.

To read full editions, subscribe . Star Atlas, an ambitious sci-fi interplanetary MMORPG, has made strides toward its full launch since its white paper released back in 2021. Right now, there’s a web-based game known as SAGE (Star Atlas Golden Era) that’s available until the full, immersive 3D main game launches. In a broader crypto market where quick hype cycles can dominate narratives, it can be difficult for a game with a longer development timeline to retain interest — and stay financially afloat. Michael Wagner, CEO and co-founder of Star Atlas, tells me they’re doing just fine. “It’s been a wild couple of years, but this year it’s looking strong for us,” Wagner said in an interview with Blockworks at GDC. “Things have recovered quite well post-FTX.” Last month, Star Atlas released a substantial patch adding things like Galia mode, which offers single-player space exploration without any loading screens. “There’s not really anything going on there yet. They are just barren planets. But you can experience the diversity in the biome,” Wagner explained. “[But] what’s really cool about this is we’re starting to showcase the seamlessness of navigation through Star Atlas.” I jumped into this mode. Here are a few screenshots from my exploration: The graphics in general look amazing overall, and flying through space was pretty smooth. You can definitely feel the physics of how gravity changes in this game. I tried out two different ships and encountered some glitches trying to get out of one of them after landing on a planet. Not sure if it was my fault or an issue with the game, but hiccups are normal with in-development games. Aside from Galia mode, there’s also Fleet Command, where you can manage ships from a macro viewpoint. They’re also adding mining within Galia mode, but without the crypto rewards at first. There will also be a team deathmatch arena shooter mode, plus an extraction shooter and zone-based gameplay, all within the main game client. Star Atlas will also have a built-in Solana wallet and in-game NFTs. “We’re kind of a blend between multiple games,” Wagner said, citing Star Citizen, No Man’s Sky, and Eve Online. “What we really like about Eve is [for] one, they have a quite sophisticated economy in-game, and I think that’s really a critical component of what we’re building. It’s part of the value proposition of Web3 is you can engage in this game, you can carve out a niche for yourself, and you can produce real income while you’re playing.” But Wagner also admitted that the financial side of things won’t always be up only. “We’re largely correlated with crypto markets. I mean, if you look at our token charts, they’re not looking great either. But that’s not to say we’re not considering the full utility of the token through the game economy itself,” he explained. Source: Atlas price over time The ATLAS token is down over 99% from its all-time high, and the project’s DAO token POLIS has endured a similar fate thus far. Wagner doesn’t buy into the narrative from some game devs that just making a “fun game” instead of focusing on a game’s economy should be the main strategy in blockchain gaming, though. “I’ve pushed back pretty heavily on that,” he said, arguing that having a real financial model behind a game is one of the main reasons to even use crypto in the first place. Obviously, he wants Star Atlas to look good and have entertaining game loops, but the game economy is a major focus. In-game snaps from others: Still, it’s worth mentioning that Star Atlas’s sky-high ambitions may not be fully achieved. During the interview, Wagner cited Star Citizen as a comparable project. Star Citizen’s long-running sci-fi gaming project (note: not a crypto one) has drawn an array of detractors who’ve criticized the game’s decade-plus development timeline and sales of expensive ship models. It’s hard not to see echoes here, especially given Star Atlas’ ambitious — and lengthy — list of promises to players. In the future, the team plans to expand the game’s existing world, add a companion app, pets, PVE and PVP modes, ship customization, arena maps, careers for players and a tram system. As Star Atlas development pushes forward, the team is focusing on a desktop PC release first — though a port to console isn’t off the table at some point. Star Atlas is currently free to check out through the game’s public Discord server. Get the news in your inbox.

According to a statement released on Monday, the agency will allocate €62.5 billion to bonds and €30 billion to bills while also planning to introduce green bonds at three locations, though their volume remains undisclosed. The plan highlighted the country’s intention to borrow less money this year (by 13%) despite a struggling economy and pressure to assist Ukraine in fighting Russia. Going into the elections, the administrations needed to divest securities with a total value of more than €380 billion, of which approximately €240 billion will be raised on the capital market, more than €120 billion on the money market and over €10 billion in Green Federal securities. Following the announcement, the price of German bonds soared, but the interest rates on debt for the decade fell to around 2.22%. The cost of borrowing rises as spending plans take shape Ever since the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz, announced the deficit spending on the military and infrastructure, and the upper house of parliament approved it, all attention has been diverted to how the government will allocate these hundreds of billions of euros. But, this move could raise interest rates because the Finance Agency is also pushing more bonds into the market. According to economists, these higher interest rates could encourage some members of the European Central Bank to end their low-interest rate policies. What’s more, if sovereign bond yields keep rising, housing loans and corporate credits will be more expensive, and it will take time before these sectors recover. Still, economists expect the spending to boost the country’s GDP by at least 2% in the long run. Sale of debt to expand the military and fund infrastructure while maintaining fiscal discipline The war between Russia and Ukraine created uncertainty all over Europe. It introduced security threats that forced many countries, including Germany, to try and strengthen their military by allocating more funds to it. In addition to a strong defence system, the country also wants to improve its infrastructure, like transportation, energy, and digital networks, and the only way to make more money on a tight and debt-burdened budget is to sell federal debt. So the country can borrow well over its limit, the government proposed to exclude defence spending from limits set by the debt brake. The Finance Agency has also proposed a special €500 billion fund to expand infrastructure over the next decade, creating jobs and helping the country’s economy recover from the effects of high sovereign bonds. For this plan to succeed, the government must propose strict policies on allocating the funds and hold its lawmakers accountable for implementing it.

Additionally, the high hardware requirements for validators suggest a degree of centralization, which contradicts decentralization principles. Regulatory scrutiny further complicates the situation. The U.S. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classified Solana’s SOL as an unregistered security, introducing legal uncertainties and potential restrictions.

In 2025, the market is faster, smarter, and more user-focused than ever. Recently, four names are standing out as the best crypto coins: JetBolt (JBOLT) , Cardano (ADA), Sui (SUI), and Raydium (RAY). With its unique and beginner-friendly innovations, JetBolt is turning heads—propelling its presale to surge past 345 million JBOLT tokens sold. Are you wondering which crypto coins beginners are actually investing in this 2025? If you’re new to crypto and tired of hearing the same old coin names with zero context, let’s discover why JetBolt, Cardano, Sui, and Raydium are the top 4 crypto coins to buy now if you are new to crypto. JetBolt (JBOLT): A Full-On Blockchain and Web3 Disruptor JetBolt (JBOLT) entered the scene like a system update the crypto world didn’t know it needed. With presale numbers climbing past 345 million tokens sold and whales already making moves, JetBolt has swiftly positioned itself as a utility-driven crypto built for the modern user—and it’s already working.

42276759,https://cointelegraph.com/news/paul-atkins-sec-senate-confirmation-hearing,1742839201,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,What to expect at Paul Atkins’ SEC confirmation hearing,https://cointelegraph.com/news/paul-atkins-sec-senate-confirmation-hearing?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) member Paul Atkins is scheduled to appear before lawmakers in the Senate Banking Committee on March 27 as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to get the President’s picks into high-level government positions. Since Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, the SEC, under the leadership of acting chair Mark Uyeda, has dropped several investigations and enforcement actions against major crypto firms, many of which had been in court for months or years. Many analysts see the SEC’s recent actions as the administration acting on its campaign promises to the crypto industry, some of whom donated directly to the then-presidential candidate or his inauguration fund after the Nov. 5 election. The commission’s actions — which include claiming memecoins aren’t securities — also stand in stark contrast to its position under former chair Gary Gensler, leading many to speculate that the SEC under Trump will lead to a booming US crypto industry essentially free of regulatory scrutiny. Atkins, whom Trump picked in December 2024 and officially nominated after taking office, received support from industry players at Coinbase and Ripple, both of which had ongoing enforcement actions brought by the SEC. The cases have since been dropped. Given the SEC’s seeming about-face on crypto enforcement and Trump’s potential conflicts of interest with the industry — with ties to the crypto firm World Liberty Financial and the launch of his own memecoin — some lawmakers are likely to question Atkins’ views on digital assets at the confirmation hearing. If confirmed by the Senate, Atkins could return to a soon-to-be entirely Republican-controlled SEC, with Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw expected to leave by 2026. It’s unclear if Atkins will have the votes to pass a confirmation hearing in the banking committee or a full floor vote in the Senate. Republicans hold a 53-seat majority in the chamber with only 51 votes required to confirm a nominee, and — with the exception of former Representative Matt Gaetz for US Attorney General — have not suggested that they intend to oppose any of Trump’s picks for crucial government positions for any reason. Democratic opposition to Atkins’ nomination Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the banking committee who has often equated crypto with drug trafficking and illicit actions, said in a March 23 letter to Atkins that she had concerns about his potential role at the SEC after his consulting firm, Patomak Global Partners, was an adviser to defunct crypto exchange FTX. He was also an adviser to the advocacy group Chamber of Digital Commerce. “Your deep involvement with FTX and other high-paying crypto clients raises questions about your approach to crypto regulation — and concerns about the extent of your knowledge of FTX’s illegal activities,” said Sen. Warren, adding: “Your financial ties to the industries you will soon regulate raise serious concerns about your ability to avoid conflicts of interest as a regulator.” Sen. Warren suggested that some members of the Senate would likely question Trump’s pick on the SEC recently dropping enforcement cases against crypto firms, reports that the US President’s family had held talks with Binance about a stake in the company as well as a pardon for former CEO Changpeng Zhao, how he intends to apply securities laws to digital assets if confirmed, and the commission’s recent opinion that memecoins were not securities. She hinted that Atkins may have also communicated with Republican SEC Commissioners Uyeda and Hester Peirce after his nomination. Related: SEC is waiting for a chair before setting crypto agenda — Hester Peirce Ahead of his hearing, Atkins has already met with Republican lawmakers on the committee, including Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis. Cointelegraph contacted Sen. Lummis’ office for comment on the SEC commissioner’s nomination but did not receive a response at the time of publication. If his nomination moves through the Banking Committee and the Senate, Atkins would likely be confirmed to a term ending in June 2031, taking over as chair from Uyeda. In addition to the commission dropping investigations and enforcement actions, the SEC acting chair has proposed abandoning rules requiring crypto firms to register with the agency.

Up Only For Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s plunge to $77,000 on March 10 may have marked the bottom for the top cryptocurrency in the current market cycle. Since then, the digital asset has appreciated by more than 10%, trading in the mid $80,000 range at the time of writing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Weekly Close Above This Level To Confirm Market Bottom, Analyst Says The 10X Research report suggests that Trump’s recent pivot toward “flexibility” on the upcoming April 2 reciprocal trade tariffs may have alleviated some concerns about further deterioration in the global macroeconomic outlook. Additionally, the report emphasizes the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) comments following this month’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where the central bank indicated that it would slow the pace of balance sheet drawdown and end the current cycle of quantitative tightening. The Fed’s remarks followed the release of the February 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, which came in line with expectations, easing concerns about inflation. The report’s claim that BTC has formed a bottom aligns with crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes’ recent statement, where he noted that BTC may have “probably” bottomed at $77,000. The following chart illustrates a bullish reversal in BTC’s 21-day moving average, which currently sits at $85,200. The report points out that these weekly reversal signs are back at levels typically seen when past bull markets have resumed. For example, in September 2023, BTC benefited from bullish momentum as the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) narrative gained traction. Similarly, BTC embarked on a historic rally in August 2024 as the US presidential election drew closer. Additionally, a recent post on X by seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights that Bitcoin transaction fees have nearly tripled over the past week, indicating an uptick in network activity as market sentiment improves. BTC Still Not Completely Bullish While Trump’s softening stance on tariffs is good news for risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, BTC still needs to break through and sustain certain price levels to regain strong bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Soon? Dollar Index Breakdown Sparks Optimism Among BTC Bulls Recent analysis by Martinez identified $94,000 as a critical price level for BTC to overcome. If the digital asset decisively breaks through and sustains this level, it could be poised to climb as high as $112,000. That said, concerns remain about BTC’s relatively weak price performance compared to other safe-haven assets like gold. At press time, BTC is trading at $87,650, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours.

According to SoSoValue data, US Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witnessed net inflows of $744.4 million last week after recording five consecutive weeks of outflows. However, Ether ETFs could not replicate a similar performance as they witnessed a fourth successive week of net outflows. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360 Analysts are divided about the near-term price action for Bitcoin. Select analysts believe Bitcoin could run into significant resistance near $90,000 , starting a pullback toward $80,000. In contrast, BitMEX co-founder and chief investment officer of Maelstrom, Arthur Hayes, said in a post on X that Bitcoin will rally to $110,000 before it drops to $76,500. Could Bitcoin bulls maintain the momentum and push the price above $90,000? Will the altcoins follow Bitcoin higher? Let’s analyze the charts to find out. S&P 500 Index price analysis The S&P 500 Index (SPX) has risen to the 20-day exponential moving average (5,742), where the bears are expected to step in. SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will attempt to drag the index below 5,670. If they succeed, the index may retest the critical support zone between 5,600 and 5,500. On the other hand, a close above the 20-day EMA will be the first indication that the correction may be ending. The index will then try to rise toward the 50-day simple moving average (5,913). US Dollar Index price analysis The US Dollar Index (DXY) rebounded off the 103.37 level on March 19, indicating that the bulls are trying to form a floor. DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The index could reach the 20-day EMA (104.59), which is an important level to watch out for. If the index turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the bears will again try to sink the price below 103.37. If they can pull it off, the index may collapse to 102 and eventually to 101. Contrarily, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests the bears are losing their grip. The index could climb to the breakdown level of 105.42, which is likely to act as a formidable barrier. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin broke above the 20-day EMA ($85,572) on March 23, suggesting the start of a strong recovery. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA is flattening out, and the RSI has risen into positive territory, signaling a minor advantage to the bulls. The relief rally is expected to face stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA ($90,290). If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA but finds support at the 20-day EMA, it will indicate a positive sentiment. That increases the possibility of a rally to $95,000 and then to $100,000. Conversely, if the price turns down from the 50-day SMA and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. A drop below $83,000 could sink the BTC/USDT pair to $80,000. Ether price analysis Ether ( ETH ) bulls are again attempting to drive the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,057) and the breakdown level of $2,111. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If they manage to do that, it will signal that the markets have rejected the breakdown below $2,111. The ETH/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($2,356) and subsequently to $2,550. Time is running out of the bears. If they want to retain the advantage, they will have to defend the $2,111 level and swiftly pull the price below $1,750. That may resume the downtrend toward the next support at $1,550. XRP price analysis XRP ( XRP ) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($2.38) on March 23, signaling that the bulls are using the dips to buy. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to push the price above $2.59. If they manage to do that, the XRP/USDT pair could climb to the resistance line, where sellers are expected to mount a strong defense. If the price turns down from the resistance line but rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will indicate a positive sentiment. That improves the prospects of a break above the resistance line. The pair may then rally to $3. Sellers will have to tug the price below $2.20 to seize control. That could clear the path for a retest of the vital support at $2. BNB price analysis BNB ( BNB ) has bounced off the moving averages, indicating a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price rises and breaks above $644, it will indicate the resumption of the recovery. The BNB/USDT pair could ascend to $686 and above it to the crucial resistance at $745. The 20-day EMA ($613) is the strong support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could weaken the bullish momentum. The pair may slide to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $591 and then to the 50% retracement level of $575. Solana price analysis Solana ( SOL ) broke above the 20-day EMA ($135) on March 24, signaling that the bulls are attempting a comeback. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price maintains above the 20-day EMA, the SOL/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($158). Sellers will try to stall the rally at the 50-day SMA, but if the bulls overcome the obstacle, the pair may surge toward $180. That will bring the large $110 to $260 range into play. Contrarily, if the price turns down from the current level or the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bears remain sellers on rallies. The bears will have to yank the price below the $120 to $110 support zone to start the next leg of the downtrend. Related: How long will Bitcoin’s price consolidation last? Dogecoin price analysis Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has risen above the 20-day EMA ($0.18), indicating that the bulls have kept up the pressure. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price closes above the 20-day EMA, the DOGE/USDT pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($0.21) and later to $0.24. Sellers are expected to defend the level, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could soar to $0.29. Contrarily, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below $0.16, it will signal that bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may then slump to the critical support at $0.14. Cardano price analysis Cardano ( ADA ) has been trading between the moving averages and the uptrend line for the past few days. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The failure of the bears to sink the price to the uptrend line suggests a lack of selling at lower levels. Buyers will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the moving averages. If they do that, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to $0.84 and later to $1.02. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down from the moving averages and breaks below the uptrend line. That could sink the pair to $0.58 and eventually to $0.50. Chainlink price analysis Chainlink ( LINK ) has broken out of the 20-day EMA ($14.60) on March 24, indicating that the downtrend could be ending. LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The LINK/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($16.34), which could again act as a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, the pair is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a rally to $19.25 increases. If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to swiftly pull the price below $13.82. That may sink the pair to the channel’s support line near $12.

While tariff threats initially sparked one of the worst stock market drawdowns in recent memory, reports are now suggesting that President Trump’s aggressive trade negotiations may be in the process of a smooth resolution. Citing “US officials familiar with the matter,” Bloomberg reports that Trump’s reciprocal tariffs may be more targeted than initially anticipated, with some countries being exempt, and some sector-specific levies being delayed by the White House. The Wall Street Journal reported similar information. All major stock indices opened the week well into the green, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) is up 3% on the day and is now up 15% from its 2025 low near $76,500. Said Tobin Marcus of Wolfe Research in a note seen by CNBC , “Omitting the sectoral tariffs from the April 2nd package significantly reduces both its aggregate scale and the maximum rate on targeted sectors, given that all of Trump’s tariffs to date have been designed to stack… The ceiling for reciprocal tariffs on April 2 remains dramatic, and we still expect a negative market reaction, but the scale won’t be as severe and the sectoral impacts won’t be as concentrated.” However, in a post on Truth Social, President Trump announced that “secondary tariffs” would be placed on Venezuela and any country that purchases oil and/or gas from the country. Trump cited numerous reasons, including “the fact that Venezuela has purposefully and deceitfully sent to the United States, undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals, many of whom are murderers and people of a very violent nature.” At time of writing, BTC is trading at $88,013.

The action, meant to counter levies on American products, has sparked a flurry of diplomacy by major US trading partners. Governments across Europe, Asia, and North America are scrambling to issue last-minute measures to avoid once-unthinkable economic pain. The European Union has contacted the United States to avert tough trade action. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic is set to meet with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington on Tuesday. However, divisions remain within the EU over how to respond. While France advocates for a firm stance against US pressure, Italy is concerned that escalating tensions could harm its economy. India is also pursuing a diplomatic channel to obtain an exception from Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs.” This week, a senior US delegation, led by the Assistant Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, Brendan Lynch, is scheduled to visit India . Talks will centre on a possible bilateral trade agreement, with India keen to persuade US officials that its policies do not unfairly disadvantage American firms. Governments worldwide make trade concessions amid growing tariff pressure Governments worldwide are scrambling to find ways to placate the US and avert an economic hit from new tariffs, the latest salvo in an escalating trade conflict. The UK is considering reducing or repealing its digital services tax before April 2. The tax has drawn ire from the US, which claims it targets US tech behemoths like Google and Amazon. Meanwhile, Malaysia is adjusting its stance on semiconductor exports after US concerns over potential shipments of Nvidia chips to China. The move is an effort to soothe Washington’s fears about China’s expanding technological might. Under pressure from US tariffs, Canada is enacting emergency economic measures. The Prime Minister, Mark Carney, has announced temporary tax relief for businesses, such as deferring corporate income and consumption tax payments. These actions aim to protect Canadian companies from the cost of a potential trade conflict with the US. Trump’s aggressive trade policies are causing many nations to rethink their international relationships. Spain, while maintaining strong trade ties with the US, is also expanding its economic outreach. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez plans to visit China next month to meet with President Xi Jinping. He will also visit Vietnam, a sign of a broader push for Asian economic relations. Different leaders worldwide take bold steps to confront economic uncertainty Financial leaders around the globe say that a trade war could slow economic growth and raise inflation. Despite this, stock markets in Asia, Europe, and the US gained on Monday, though there was an element of caution attached. China is bracing for economic disruptions as it expects more trade curbs. Premier Li Qiang had cautioned that Trump’s tariffs could cause “shocks that exceed expectations.” In remarks at the China Development Forum in Beijing, Li urged countries to expand their markets and step up cooperation to respond to economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, the US trade talks with China are ongoing. The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, is scheduled on Thursday to hold his first phone call with his Chinese counterpart as both sides scramble to control the tensions.

The agreement, structured through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), will support the development of compliant frameworks for tokenized assets. This partnership will expand blockchain adoption and promote regulatory dialogue within the UAE and globally. Chainlink and ADGM Sign MoU to Build Compliant Tokenization Frameworks As noted in the press release , Chainlink and ADGM have inked an MoU that would thus cover the promotion of tokenization frameworks that meet regulatory standards. Both parties will help each other to deliver an environment that ensures secure and legal tokenization of assets in the financial markets. As part of the collaboration, ADGM will be able to gain Chainlink’s blockchain services, such as the verified data, interfacing solutions, and proof-of-reserve solutions. These tools will improve connectivity between on-chain and off-chain systems and support the growth of scalable digital asset environment. The agreement outlines a plan to host educational workshops and events in the UAE. These sessions will address core topics including cross-chain infrastructure, AI integration, and the application of blockchain in financial services. The focus will be on building knowledge and regulatory clarity within the regional blockchain ecosystem. Advancing Blockchain Innovation Through Chainlink Tools Chainlink has been recognized for its extensive suite of services supporting secure blockchain integration. The platform has enabled over USD19 trillion in transaction value globally and is used by major financial institutions to facilitate secure transactions. With this partnership, ADGM will utilize Chainlink’s technology to promote innovation within its regulated environment. Chainlink’s tools are expected to enhance liquidity, interoperability, and data transparency across digital markets operating under ADGM’s jurisdiction. This initiative also complements ADGM’s efforts to support decentralized technologies through established legal and regulatory structures. The market has already introduced Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) regulations to offer guidance to blockchain-based projects. Meanwhile, amid the growing blockchain adoption, the European Central Bank (ECB) is exploring a blockchain-based payment system to process central bank money transactions. Regulatory Collaboration Under the MoU, Chainlink and ADGM will engage in discussions surrounding regulatory practices for blockchain, AI, and emerging technologies. These discussions will support the establishment of industry-wide standards and best practices for blockchain implementation. In addition, the partnership includes a schedule of educational programs to enhance tokenization, proof-of-reserves, and cross-chain operations. These initiatives will target participants across the UAE’s financial ecosystem. Following the collaboration, LINK price surged, reaching $15 with a 5.74% increase in the past 24 hours. The trading volume also spiked by 79.46%, hitting nearly $399 million, reflecting renewed investor interest.

US President Donald Trump has described April 2 as “Liberation Day” for the US, highlighting his commitment to implement reciprocal tariffs designed to bring US tariffs in line with those imposed by key trading partners. But an administration official confirmed that sector-specific tariffs are unlikely to be announced that day, with the primary focus being on reciprocal tariff measures. The strategy shift was first reported by Bloomberg. The fate of tariffs on Canada and Mexico, initially justified by the administration over fentanyl smuggling concerns, remains unclear. The White House has not commented on whether or when they will be implemented. Related News: BREAKING: Binance Announces New Altcoin to Airdrop to Certain Users The administration is taking a more selective approach than previously envisioned, according to people familiar with the planning. The reciprocal tariffs are expected to target the “dirty 15” countries, which have persistent trade imbalances with the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently noted that these countries account for a significant portion of U.S. foreign trade and are likely to face the largest tariff hikes. While the administration has not formally identified targeted countries, a Federal Register notice last month by the U.S. Trade Representative pointed to countries with significant trade imbalances including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia and Vietnam. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Buy It Just Yet,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/is-trump-the-best-crypto-to-buy-now-heres-why-you-shouldnt-buy-it-just-yet,"US President Donald Trump is back to bull-posting for his official meme coin, Official Trump ($TRUMP). Taking to Truth Social , Trump posted, “I LOVE $TRUMP — SO COOL!!! The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”. The post drew a scatter of applause from the meme coin holders as well as widespread criticism from political opponents and prominent crypto investors. The $TRUMP crypto price rallied by more than 10% on Sunday before a pullback. Despite the optimism from the bulls, the meme coin’s bearish price chart and the overhang of the upcoming $1.5 billion token unlock make it an unappealing investment. Instead, Bitcoin, Solana, Pepe and small-cap meme coins like SPX6900 and Solaxy are among the best cryptos to buy now. Why You Shouldn’t Buy $TRUMP Crypto Just Yet? Earlier this month, Stalkchain reported that $TRUMP was the most sold token by smart money in a 24-hour period, and for good reason. Official Trump is a highly centralized meme coin, with 80% of the supply held by Creators & CIC Digital - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, & 6. Currently, only 20% of the overall $TRUMP supply is unlocked and a major token unlock event , which will release 40 million coins worth $464 million, is scheduled for April 18th. Unsurprisingly, smart money investors have been offloading their $TRUMP crypto holding ahead of the unlock. In light of the upcoming unlock event, Donald Trump’s bull-posting is being viewed as an attempt to grab exit liquidity. Trump is shilling $TRUMP coin on truth social1.5 billion dollars worth of tokens unlock on April 18thSeems like they are grabbing some exit Liqutity before the unlock pic.twitter.com/RxuNW6FQJ5 — HENRI.SOL (@henri_sol) March 23, 2025 Moreover, the Official Trump price chart isn’t exactly instilling much confidence. For starters, the fact that the $TRUMP crypto price rallied by just 10%, and retraced much of the pump, despite Trump’s shilling signals sustainable demand for the meme coin. Moreover, it failed to breach the $12.50 S/R level, a resistance that it rejected from earlier this month as well. To make matters worse, $TRUMP’s RSI has already tagged the “overbought” level in the 4-hour timeframe. In previous such occasions, its RSI swung to the “oversold” territory every time, suggesting that a significant pullback could be imminent. Prominent analyst CRG believes that the meme coin created a “solid bottom” in the daily timeframe. Its daily RSI is also at just 43, signalling significant room for expansion. However, the overhang of the upcoming token unlock event would likely prevent a sustainable bullish reversal. Sidelined investors should, therefore, hold off on adding $TRUMP to their lists of cryptos to buy just yet. Best Cryptos To Buy The cryptocurrency market has had a bullish start to the week, with the Bitcoin price soaring past $88,000. Such broad-market relief rallies are typically excellent opportunities to find the best cryptos investments. The assets with the sharpest bounces typically have the highest latent demand and deliver outsized returns when the market outlook improves. Unsurprisingly, Solana meme coins are leading the charge. SPX6900 and Fartcoin are up by 25% over the past 24 hours. While they, especially Fartcoin, could see some profit-taking, they are consensus pick among experts for the best cryptos to buy now. The Solana price is trading at $143 at press time. Prominent analyst Ansem believes that the top SOL-based coins can 2x in just a few weeks. if solana holds daily above $137 then sol onchain coins likely double in a few weeks btw — Ansem 😳 (@blknoiz06) March 24, 2025 Simply put, all eyes are now on the Solana ecosystem, with whales bidding on high-upside, low-cap assets once again. For instance, the first prominent Solana layer-2 coin, Solaxy (SOLX) , has raised nearly $28 million in its presale, thanks to continued six-figure investments from whales. With the next meme coin mania extremely close, a layer-2 project designed to tackle congestion in the Solana ecosystem during periods of heavy traffic will gain significant traction. Considering that most top Bitcoin and Ethereum Layer-2s have multibillion dollar valuations, experts also believe that SOLX is undervalued during its presale. Solaxy will likely launch during the next bull market, which is expected to start in April. Unsurprisingly, early buyers are expecting a significant post-IEO rally, with many eyeing up 10x returns.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. An Ethereum millionaire who made $10 million from Dogecoin is now betting on XYZVerse as its presale surges past $11 million. Table of Contents XYZVerse sets a new trend: The next 50x memecoin? Why Ethereum remains essential in today’s crypto market Dogecoin’s rise and potential Conclusion An investor famous for making millions from Dogecoin (DOGE) has now turned attention to XYZVerse (XYZ). This seasoned player’s latest move is stirring interest as the presale for XYZVerse surges past $11 million. With the numbers climbing, questions arise about what makes this new project stand out. Could this be the next significant opportunity in the crypto space? XYZVerse sets a new trend: The next 50x memecoin? The excitement surrounding XYZVerse is undeniable. As the first meme token exclusively dedicated to sports, XYZVerse is uniquely positioned at the intersection of sports enthusiasts and crypto investors, creating a dynamic community. With an impressive presale and a rapidly growing following, savvy investors are eyeing major gains. Unlike typical memecoins that rely purely on hype, XYZVerse brings real substance by merging the thrilling energy of sports with the viral appeal of meme culture. This combination is proving successful, as evidenced by its rapidly progressing presale. Early buyers are already locking in tokens at a fraction of the anticipated future price. XYZVerse’s presale prices have surged from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 in Stage 12, with over 70% of its $15 million fundraising goal already achieved. Early adopters who secure their tokens early are positioned advantageously, considering the final presale target price of $0.1. Strong bullish sentiment on XYZ XYZVerse is already listed on CoinMarketCap, where 95% of community voters are bullish, anticipating significant growth for XYZ. Influential crypto figure DanjoCapitalMaster, who commands nearly 800,000 followers, recently labeled XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity,” further amplifying investor enthusiasm. Beyond excitement, XYZVerse is structured with robust tokenomics aimed at long-term sustainability. A substantial 15% allocation is reserved for liquidity, establishing a solid market foundation. Additionally, 10% of tokens are earmarked for community rewards through airdrops and bonuses. Moreover, 17.13% of the supply is set aside for deflationary burns, strategically reducing supply to potentially boost token value over time. A community-driven project with ambitious goals XYZVerse distinguishes itself through meaningful community engagement. Its recently launched Ambassador Program enables community members to earn free tokens through active project promotion. The project is also in discussions with prominent sports celebrities to increase visibility and excitement, effectively bridging the worlds of sports and cryptocurrency in an engaging and entertaining manner. Could XYZVerse become the next big memecoin? With a rapidly advancing presale, an active and dedicated community, and a visionary roadmap, XYZVerse has all the hallmarks of a project poised for significant success. Although the cryptocurrency market always carries uncertainty, many investors view XYZVerse as an opportunity to get in early. You might also like: Crypto’s next 100x star? Why this low-cap coin could exceed Solana’s 2021 rally Why Ethereum remains essential in today’s crypto market Ethereum , introduced by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, is a blockchain utilizing Proof-of-Stake (PoS). It’s widely recognized for smart contracts and its extensive decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem. Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon further enhance Ethereum by significantly improving transaction speed and efficiency. Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens play crucial roles across various platforms, serving as tools for governance, utility, and storing value. Still, ETH itself remains indispensable, functioning as the network’s fundamental currency for transaction fees and smart contract execution. Ethereum continues to display impressive potential. Its upcoming upgrades aim to further enhance scalability while lowering transaction costs. Based on past market cycles, experts anticipate Ethereum’s price might climb to approximately $6,580.53 by next year. Ethereum’s consistent innovation, commitment to decentralization, and robust community support solidify its position as a top cryptocurrency. Dogecoin’s rise and potential Dogecoin , launched in 2013, started as a humorous alternative to Bitcoin, leveraging the viral Shiba Inu meme as its playful logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin’s model releases 10,000 new coins every minute, with no upper limit. Dogecoin has evolved into a significant global cryptocurrency. Its surge in 2021 catapulted it into the top ten cryptos, surpassing a market capitalization of $50 billion, driven by extensive social media engagement and high-profile endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s meteoric rise highlights the substantial impact of community-driven enthusiasm and social media on financial markets. Today, Dogecoin maintains its appeal among investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. Its blockchain facilitates quick, cost-effective transactions. Although Dogecoin lacks certain sophisticated features found in other cryptos, its simplicity remains its strength. In the current market environment, many investors view Dogecoin favorably due to its strong community backing and widespread recognition. Its accessibility and vibrant online presence set it apart from competitors. Nevertheless, investors should remain cautious, conducting thorough research and carefully weighing potential risks. Conclusion While ETH and DOGE are strong, XYZVerse aims to challenge them, uniting sports fans in a memecoin targeting 20,000% growth and community-driven success.

He attributes this forecast to a shift in U.S. Federal Reserve policy from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE) for treasuries, which he believes will support Bitcoin's upward momentum. Hayes has dismissed concerns over tariffs, citing 'transitory inflation' as a less significant factor in Bitcoin's price trajectory. He stated, 'I bet Bitcoin hits $110K before it retests $76.5K,' emphasizing his bullish outlook. Hayes also remarked that Bitcoin is more likely to hit $110,000 than fall to $70,000.

Price Drops Below $1 — What PI Holders Need to Know,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-pi-network-oversold-or-just-getting-started-price-drops-below-1-what-pi-holders-need-to-know/,"Pi Network has fallen by 5% in the past 24 hours, with the alt’s slide to $0.9515 coming as the crypto market as a whole actually recovers by 1% today. PI is now down by 30% in the last seven days, and while it holds on to a 9% increase in a month, it’s also down by 68% since reaching an ATH of $2.99 on February 26. However, PI’s chart and indicators have now entered a strongly oversold position, implying that the coin should rebound sooner or later. But without a listing from Binance or other major exchanges, Pi Network may continue to languish for a while, even if its longer term price prediction looks more encouraging. Is Pi Network Ready to Bounce? As the chart below reveals, Pi Network has been trading within a narrow and descending band for the entire month. Its 30-period average (orange) is falling further below the 200-period average (blue), while its RSI (purple) remains just below 40, having spent several days last week under 30. Source: TradingView But in the particular case of PI, we shouldn’t take it for granted that a rebound is coming, especially when the coin’s trading volume remains so low, at $290 million today. This contrasts very unfavorably with the heights – of more than $3 billion – it reached in late February, not long after the coin’s mainnet launch. But since then, there has been a lack of positive news stories, with PI’s community still continuing to agitate for a Binance listing, as well as listings on other exchanges. Keep your promise @binance $Pi pic.twitter.com/pAf8S8IQuC — Pi Network News Global 𝛑 (@PiNewsGlobal) March 21, 2025 PI community members are especially unhappy that Binance, having held a community vote specifically on listing PI, still won’t honor the positive outcome of this vote. But while community members may be justified in their dissatisfaction with Binance, outside observers may regard the latter’s reluctance to list PI as a warning sign. Indeed, many outside voices have been criticizing Pi Network for its centralization and describing it as a Ponzi, something which may be deterring exchanges. DO NOT INVEST IN #PI PI NETWORK IS THE BIGGEST PONZI pic.twitter.com/vkkYn4ELyI — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) February 20, 2025 And if the likes of Binance, Coinbase and Kraken do not come through with listings, we may see Pi Network continue its decline of the past month. It could fall to $0.80 by the middle of April, while a listing from one of the above exchanges could push it back towards $1.50. New Altcoins with Stronger Long-Term Potential Given the uncertainty surrounding Pi Network, many traders may prefer to turn to alternatives already, with several newer tokens already looking more promising. One of the most interesting right now is MIND of Pepe (MIND) , an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised $7.5 million in its ongoing presale. Real-Time Market Awareness – The RAG Revolution MIND of Pepe is now contextually aware with live market data. ◉ Tracks market conditions & sentiment shifts ◉ Pulls the latest crypto trends, news, and price action ◉ Enhances decision-making for token holders Next-level… — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) March 20, 2025 MIND of Pepe is gearing up to launch an autonomous AI agent, which in the vein of Truth Terminal will generate its own meme coins. On top of this, MIND of Pepe’s platform will scan social and market data to produce market analysis and advice, while also using big data to identify trends it will harness via its self-generated tokens. As its native token, MIND is bullish because it’s the only way of gaining access to its advice and analysis, while holding it will also provide early access to the tokens it creates, before they list. MIND could therefore attract considerable demand, with investors able to buy it now – and at a discount – at the MIND of Pepe website . MIND is currently selling at $0.0035803, with this price will rise once again tomorrow, and will continue to rise every few days until the sale closes. And given that its sale has proven successful so far, it could rise much higher than this price once it lists in the next few weeks. The post Is Pi Network Oversold or Just Getting Started?

Price Stalls as On-Chain Signals Flash Warning,https://cryptonews.com/news/will-xrp-ever-break-10-price-stalls-as-on-chain-signals-flash-warning/,"XRP (XRP) has gone up by 2.2% in the past 24 hours to stand at $2.46 per token as the crypto market continues to recover. However, on-chain metrics indicate that Ripple, the blockchain protocol powered by this cryptocurrency, has not been growing at a pace that justifies this recent price surge. According to data from Glassnode, the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio has spiked to its highest level since January 2020. The aggregated market cap of XRP has been expanding lately as regulatory headwinds in the United States have mostly faded. However, network transaction volumes have not grown at the same pace. The market value of blockchain projects is heavily influenced by network growth. Hence, if growth is stalling, XRP could struggle to keep reaching higher price levels. Also read: Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030 Ripple has recently taken steps to expand its ecosystem including the launch of its stablecoin Ripple USD (RLUSD). In addition, the firm has strengthened its presence in the Middle East and has already secured key licenses to operate as a payments provider in top locations like Dubai. XRP Rallied by 590% the Last Time the NVT Rose to This Level Although this metric could be interpreted as a bearish signal, the performance of XRP back in 2021 seems to indicate the opposite. From January 2021 to May 2021, XRP delivered gains of 590%. The NVT ratio’s expansion at that time occurred in the midst of a bull market. If XRP experiences a similar increase at this point, this means that the price could rise above the $15 level. At that time, this rally unfolded in a period of just 5 months. Will history repeat? In the past few months, Ripple has found strong support between the $1.7 and $1.9 levels. Momentum indicators have been improving although the price action seems to have entered a period of consolidation. To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP would have to rise above $2.65 per token in the next few days. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sent a sell signal on March 13 and has stood above its 14-day simple moving average (SMA) since then. Meanwhile, the MACD’s histogram shows steadily rising positive momentum readings. XRP’s prospects are promising as this NVT ratio could signal an upcoming rally. Meanwhile, the best crypto presales like Solaxy ($SOLX), a layer-two Solana scaling solution, are also offering significant upside to early buyers. Solaxy ($SOLX) Raises $27M to Alleviate Solana’s Congestion Issues Back in January when Official Trump ($TRUMP) and Melania Meme Coin ($MELANIA) were launched, the Solana blockchain experienced delays and delivered transaction errors as transaction volumes spiked. Solaxy ($SOLX) fixes this by introducing a layer-two protocol designed to bundle transactions offline to alleviate the mainnet’s congestion during peak usage times. Since its presale event was launched in December last year, $SOLX has raised $27.7 million to launch its scaling solution and the developing team has already made significant progress to launch the protocol soon. Apart from the attractive upside potential that this utility token offers as the protocol’s adoption increases, investors can stake their $SOLX tokens to earn a 147% APY on their investment. To buy $SOLX simply head to the Solaxy website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). Either swap SOL, USDT, or ETH for this token or use a bank card to make your investment.

Imagine seamlessly using your crypto holdings for everyday purchases, just like traditional money. That’s the vision driving Rain, a company making waves in the digital payment space. They’ve just announced a significant funding round to fuel their expansion of stablecoin payment cards . Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto and how Rain is positioning itself at the forefront of this exciting development. What’s the Buzz About Stablecoin Payment Cards? Stablecoin payment cards are essentially debit cards that allow you to spend stablecoins – cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins offer price stability, making them more practical for everyday transactions. Think of it as bridging the gap between the crypto world and traditional finance. Here’s why crypto payment cards , particularly those backed by stablecoins, are gaining traction: Stability for Spending: Stablecoins mitigate the price volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies, making them suitable for daily transactions. You know that $1 worth of stablecoin today should be roughly $1 tomorrow. Global Accessibility: Crypto transactions can be borderless. Stablecoin payment cards can potentially offer easier access to funds and spending power internationally, especially in regions with limited traditional banking infrastructure. Faster Transactions: Crypto transactions, while sometimes facing network congestion, can often be faster than traditional banking transfers, particularly for international payments. Financial Inclusion: Crypto payment solutions can offer access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked populations globally. Rain’s $24.5M Funding: A Game Changer for Crypto Adoption? Rain’s successful $24.5 million funding round, led by Norwest Venture Partners, signals strong investor confidence in the future of crypto payment cards . This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a substantial investment that underscores the growing belief in the practical applications of cryptocurrencies beyond just trading and investment. With participation from Galaxy Ventures, Goldcrest, Thayer, and Hard Yaka, Rain has garnered support from some of the most prominent names in the venture capital and crypto space. Key Highlights of Rain’s Funding and Expansion Plans: Area Details Funding Amount $24.5 million Lead Investor Norwest Venture Partners Other Investors Galaxy Ventures, Goldcrest, Thayer, Hard Yaka Key Use of Funds Global Expansion, Technology Development, Regulatory Licenses This funding injection is strategically aimed at several crucial areas: Global Expansion: Rain is setting its sights on expanding its Visa stablecoin cards to new markets worldwide. This means bringing the convenience of crypto payments to a broader audience, potentially accelerating global crypto adoption. Technology Development: Innovation is key in the fast-paced crypto world. Rain will invest in developing new technologies to enhance the functionality, security, and user experience of their payment cards. This could include features like enhanced security protocols, faster transaction processing, and more user-friendly interfaces. Regulatory Compliance: Operating in the financial space, especially with cryptocurrencies, requires navigating complex regulatory landscapes. Securing additional regulatory licenses is paramount for Rain to operate legally and build trust with users and partners. This demonstrates a commitment to responsible and compliant growth within the crypto ecosystem. Visa’s Backing: A Stamp of Approval for Stablecoin Cards Rain being a Visa-backed issuer is a significant detail. Visa’s involvement lends credibility and legitimacy to stablecoin payment cards . Visa is a global payments giant with established infrastructure and trust. Their backing suggests that major players in traditional finance are increasingly recognizing the potential of cryptocurrencies and are willing to integrate them into existing payment systems. The Visa Advantage for Rain and Stablecoin Adoption: Global Payment Network: Visa’s vast global network ensures that Rain’s crypto payment cards can be accepted at millions of merchants worldwide that already accept Visa. This instant accessibility is a massive advantage. Established Infrastructure: Leveraging Visa’s existing payment infrastructure significantly reduces the barriers to entry for Rain. They don’t need to build a payment network from scratch, allowing them to focus on their core product and user experience. Increased Trust and Security: Visa is synonymous with secure and reliable payments. This association can help build user trust in Rain’s Visa stablecoin cards and encourage wider adoption of crypto payments in general. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Crypto Payment Solutions While the future looks bright for crypto payment cards and companies like Rain, there are challenges to navigate: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Navigating different regulations in various jurisdictions and ensuring compliance will be an ongoing task for Rain as they expand. User Education: Despite growing interest, many people are still unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Educating users about the benefits and how to use crypto payment cards will be crucial for mass adoption. Competition: The crypto payment space is becoming increasingly competitive. Rain will need to continue innovating and differentiating itself to stay ahead. Volatility (Indirectly): While stablecoins are designed to be stable, the broader crypto market can still experience volatility, which might indirectly affect user sentiment and adoption rates. Revolutionizing Payments with Stablecoins: What’s Next? Rain’s funding round is a strong indicator of the growing momentum behind stablecoins and their practical applications in everyday payments. As they expand globally and develop new technologies, we can expect to see crypto payment cards become increasingly integrated into our financial lives. This could pave the way for a more inclusive, efficient, and globally accessible financial system, powered by the innovative potential of cryptocurrencies. The rise of crypto payment cards represents a significant step towards bridging the gap between the digital asset world and traditional commerce.

US District Judge Deborah Boardman issued the ruling Monday to prevent the Department of Education, the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) from disclosing personal identifying information belonging to roughly two million plaintiffs in an ongoing lawsuit. In a 68-page opinion , Boardman discussed how the Privacy Act of 1974 was designed to prevent unauthorized data disclosure and warned against the risks of centralizing personal information. “ The defendants violated the APA by not acting in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a; that they will suffer irreparable harm if the defendants are not enjoined; and that the balance of the equities and public interest weigh favor of preliminary injunctive relief, ” said the federal judge in her ruling. Preliminary injunction granted against DOGE Judge Boardman mentioned congressional concerns from the 1970s about government overreach, writing, “ No matter how important or urgent the President’s DOGE agenda may be, federal agencies must execute it in accordance with the law. That likely did not happen in this case. ” Six individuals, including veterans, student loan applicants, and federal employees, brought the lawsuit, arguing that DOGE’s actions violated federal privacy protections. They were joined by five labor unions representing government workers, whose members’ sensitive data was stored in agency systems accessed by DOGE. The plaintiffs convinced the court that the agencies had failed in their duty to safeguard the data, accusing them of “abandoning their duties as guardians and gatekeepers” of millions of Americans’ personal information. ‘Need-to-Know’ standard was not met In its ruling , the court found the government was unable to justify why DOGE personnel required access to the data. Federal law mandates that officials must demonstrate a “need-to-know” basis before requesting sensitive records, a standard it determined had not been met. “ Access to those records by unauthorized government officials intrudes into their private lives. This intrusion is not speculative; it is actual. The plaintiffs allege that DOGE affiliates have accessed information in record systems at each of the agencies ,” Boardman’s statement noted. The plaintiffs had initially sought a sweeping injunction blocking DOGE’s access to all individuals’ data held by the agencies, but the judge denied the order. The ruling only applies to the two million plaintiffs in the case. Monday’s decision follows Boardman’s earlier temporary restraining order on February 24, which prevented DOGE from accessing Education Department and OPM records. At the time, she declined to extend the order to Treasury data, citing a separate preliminary injunction from another federal judge that already restricted DOGE’s access to Treasury records. More legal challenges charge at DOGE The lawsuit is one of several legal clashes the government department faces. More than a dozen lawsuits are pending against DOGE, targeting both its structure and its access to various federal systems. In a court battle that took two rulings and concluded on March 13, the Trump administration admitted to terminating nearly 25,000 recently hired federal employees and is now working to reinstate them after a court ruled the dismissals were likely unlawful. According to court filings submitted last Monday in Baltimore’s federal court, officials from 18 federal agencies confirmed that the affected workers would be reinstated and placed on paid administrative leave, at least temporarily. The Oval Office, however, has asked the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision to rehire the workers today. Moreover, the administration is also facing a lawsuit for DOGE’s actions at the US Agency for International Development (USAID). A federal judge in Maryland last week ruled that the agency’s mass terminations were likely unconstitutional but did not call for the government to reverse the layoffs or fully restore USAID operations. Current and former USAID employees had filed lawsuits to challenge the department, but the White House appealed the decision, adding that it will use all legal options to ensure that DOGE’s actions are not undone.

But their inclusion in the group has logic given the unique advantages each offer in the blockchain space. Iuorio, Managing Director at TJM Institutional Services, noted on Bloomberg TV that Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities and Solana’s superior transaction speeds make them attractive assets. “Ethereum has been praised for its smart contract functionality, which powers a wide range of decentralized applications,” Iuorio explained. “Meanwhile, Solana’s ability to process transactions at higher speeds than most other networks is likely a key factor behind its massive 1,500% rally from late 2023 to January 2025.” You might also like: Bitcoin race intensifies as Pompliano, Saylor address urgency for a reserve Meanwhile, Bitcoin gained 300% during the same time period, while Ethereum rose by just 160%. Naturally, Solana’s performance is the envy of the group. This may have contributed to the creation of new Solana-focused trading products as investors seek superior returns in the crypto space. “The CME Group’s introduction of a solana futures contract reflects growing market confidence in the coin’s long-term potential,” he said. “The ability to hedge risk through futures is a significant step in legitimizing both solana and the broader crypto market.” Why it matters The proposal represents a shift toward a broader acceptance of crypto assets beyond the world’s most valuable and popular cryptocurrency. Once implemented, the reserve would increase institutional interest and investment in Ethereum and Solana. As Iuorio highlighted, “Any step forward in the ability to hedge risk is an important step in validating the coin and the technology it brings to the arena.” Trump’s proposal underscores a growing recognition of blockchain’s evolving landscape and the strategic role that diverse digital assets could play in the financial system.

After a recent drop, Ethereum is now expected to recover, and Bitcoin is just beginning its rebound. Analysts remain optimistic about the upcoming weeks, and this article explores the trends and factors that could contribute to a potential rally, highlighting digital assets that may experience notable growth in the near future. Bitcoin Market: Recent Pullbacks Coupled with Strong Six-Month Gains Bitcoin experienced a one-month decline near 10% while recording a six-month gain of approximately 35%. A seven-day boost of about 5 percent added a short-term lift to the mixed performance. Price action over these periods reflected volatility and shifting investor sentiment, highlighting contrasts between short-term corrections and longer-term recovery. Current trading is set between roughly $74,000 and $99,000. Immediate support comes in near $63,700 with resistance at around $113,200, while extended boundaries reach from about $39,000 to nearly $138,000. The neutral RSI at 51 suggests neither bulls or bears hold a clear advantage, prompting traders to watch for breakouts above resistance or tests of support to confirm the next move. Ethereum: Key Levels and Mixed Past Performance Indicate Trading Opportunities The past month saw a 22.45% drop in price, while the half-year decline was around 22.23%. Recently, a 9.42% weekly gain suggests a small recovery amidst mixed price movements. Long-term trends have shown consistent pressure, though short-term actions reflect a glimmer of optimism. Traders should consider these changes for possible reversals and adjustments as they plan their strategies. Currently, the price fluctuates between $1,766 and $3,021, with support around $1,294 and resistance at $3,804. Bears maintain a strong presence, despite the recent uptick from bulls. Trading strategies should focus on movements within these key levels, looking for signs of a decisive trend or reversal that could present new opportunities. Conclusion Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have shown strong potential for growth in the coming months. Market conditions and investor interest suggest a positive outlook. Both coins have demonstrated resilience and significant upward movement. If current trends continue, new all-time highs (ATHs) for BTC and ETH could be achieved in Q2. The market will be closely watching key indicators and broader economic factors. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

On March 24, errors in Nostra’s price feed inflated the reported prices of xSTRK and sSTRK — two liquid staking derivatives of Starknet’s native STRK token — to approximately three times the tokens’ actual value, Nostra said in a post on the X platform. According to Nostra, “[s]uch an inflated price feed could have caused unnecessary liquidations of otherwise safe positions, resulting in users with healthy positions getting liquidated.” In response, the DeFi protocol has disabled any further borrowing against xSTRK and sSTRK collateral deposits, Nostra said. Nostra has also recommended that users with existing xSTRK and sSTRK deposits withdraw the collateral immediately. “Since we don’t have a secondary (fallback) oracle to support these assets, as none are available, we are unable to fully prevent similar events from occurring in the future,” Nostra added. “Our priority has always been and continues to be to keep existing user funds safe and with no fallback oracle, the risks outweigh the benefits,” it said.

It has a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $575 million, according to data from L2Beat. Lending protocol Nostra is among the larger DeFi projects operating on the chain. It has a TVL of approximately $55 million, according to its website. On Nostra, users post collateral in one token to borrow in another token. The DeFi protocol’s most popular collateral tokens are Ether, STRK, and stablecoins USDC ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ). Starknet designed STRK to be staked in exchange for a portion of the network’s fee revenues, according to its documentation. xSTRK and sSTRK are liquid staking tokens issued by independent DeFi protocols Endur and Nimbura, respectively.

He said countries that keep buying oil or gas from Venezuela will face a 25% tariff on everything they trade with the U.S. The so-called leader of the free world made that clear in a Truth Social post , where he also reiterated that the tariffs will kick in on April 2. And yes, it’s aimed right at Maduro and China. The numbers aren’t small. Venezuela pumped out around 660,000 barrels per day in 2024, according to Kpler. About 270,000 bpd of that went to China, making it Venezuela’s biggest oil customer. The U.S. came in second, importing 233,000 bpd. India got 61,000 bpd, and Spain pulled in about 60,000 bpd. Trump targets China and Venezuela with tariffs “This announcement by the Trump administration appears to be one more action targeting China,” said Matt Smith, oil analyst at Kpler, to CNBC . That’s not guesswork. That’s exactly how Trump wants it. He’s trying to choke off China’s grip on Venezuelan oil while handing U.S. producers an edge. That’s what people told The Wall Street Journal, after a closed-door White House meeting between Trump, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth, and other oil execs. During that meeting, Trump said he’s open to extending Chevron’s license to drill in Venezuela—despite saying earlier in February that he’d reverse Biden’s decision that allowed them back in. The Treasury gave Chevron until April 3 to pack it up. Now? Maybe not. Meanwhile, oil prices started to react. Brent crude jumped 61 cents to $72.77 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate rose 59 cents to $68.87. “We expect oil prices to go higher in light of this news and may rise further if Trump follows through with this proclamation,” said Leo Mariani, an analyst at Roth, in a note to clients. But this isn’t just about oil. Trump says Venezuela is sending criminals across the U.S. border. When he announced the tariffs, he also claimed that the Tren de Aragua gang—which his administration labeled a foreign terrorist group—is entering the country under orders from Maduro. Trump invokes 1798 law, targets gang and judge So Trump went even further. On March 15, he pulled out the old 1798 Alien Enemies Act. He’s using it to try and deport members of Tren de Aragua, calling them an invading force engaged in “irregular warfare” against the U.S. He’s basically saying it’s war. Real war. But a federal judge said no. District Judge James Boasberg blocked the plan. That pissed Trump off. He called for Boasberg to be impeached, which pushed the whole thing into what legal experts are calling a constitutional crisis. Even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts had to step in and slap Trump down. Roberts publicly rejected the calls to remove Boasberg. Recession fears rise as Trump pushes tariffs A new Deutsche Bank survey says the odds of a recession in the U.S. over the next year are around 43%. That’s almost a coin toss. Jeffrey Gundlach from DoubleLine Capital put the chances higher—50 to 60%, according to what he told CNBC. The Federal Reserve doesn’t sound too confident either. Last week, Jerome Powell admitted that things are shaky thanks to Trump’s tariff shenanigans. He said the economy is still “strong overall” but added that growth is slowing. The Fed cut its GDP forecast for the year down to just 1.7%. That’s the weakest since 2011, not counting the pandemic crash. Meanwhile, core inflation is still hot—2.8%, well above the Fed’s 2% goal. They say they can bring it down by 2027. Right. Maybe. The problem is, inflation’s sticky, growth is slowing, Trump keeps picking trade fights with US allies, and Americans are whispering the word stagflation again. Last time that happened? Early 1980s. “Markets have been nervous in recent weeks about the prospects ahead,” said Morgan Stanley in a note Monday. “What’s really at the heart of the conundrum, however, is that the U.S. might be at risk for a bout of stagflation, where growth slows and inflation remains sticky.” Barclays analysts said the signs point to only a “modest” slowdown, but they still predict growth of just 0.7% for the year. That’s barely above recession. Even UCLA Anderson, a big name in economic forecasting, has issued its first-ever “recession watch.” Why? Trump’s tariffs. That’s what their economist Clement Bohr said. Bohr wrote, “This Watch also serves as a warning to the current administration: be careful what you wish for because, if all your wishes come true, you could very well be the author of a deep recession. And it may not simply be a standard recession that is being chaperoned into existence, but a stagflation.” So yeah. Trump is trying to crush China and Maduro, control Chevron’s operations, keep Tren de Aragua out, and scare the hell out of the Federal Reserve—all while making sure oil flows back to the U.S. But his new tariffs could set off a chain reaction no one’s ready for. Every single thing he’s doing is shaking the system from oil prices to GDP. And with the 2024 oil exports at 660,000 bpd, and the top buyers being China, the U.S., India, and Spain, this 25% tariff could hit a lot more than just Maduro’s oil tankers. It could touch supply chains, inflation, trade agreements, and maybe even the Constitution. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Chart History Says Yes,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-pepe-about-to-explode-again-chart-history-says-yes/,"Pepe (PEPE) has gone up by 10.3% in the past 24 hours to stand at $0.000007935 as the market keeps recovering from the sell-off that took place earlier this month. The meme coin has been going up in the past two weeks and has started this third week on a strong note. Trading volumes have surged by 71% in the past day as well and currently stand at $605 million. Although other tokens have also experienced price upticks lately, PEPE is currently the best-performing meme coin of the top 5 and its market capitalization has now distanced itself from Official Trump (TRUMP) by nearly $1 billion. This solidifies PEPE’s stance as the third most valuable token in this category. After retreating sharply from at the end of January, open interest in PEPE has been on an uptrend since March 13 as market sentiment hit record lows and panic reigned. This could be an early indication that the market has bottomed. From March 13 to March 23, OI for this meme coin increased by 30%. This may explain why the price of the asset has been rising lately as futures holders are buying the token in the spot market to hedge their exposure to the token as demand for PEPE contracts has kept rising. PEPE Could Rise 35% from Current Levels if Its Breaks This Resistance Moving to the charts, PEPE’s daily price action shows that positive momentum is picking up its pace. The token seems poised to retest its most recent lower high at $0.00000900. A bullish breakout above this level would effectively overturn the downtrend and could mark the beginning of a fresh bullish cycle. Momentum indicators are also favoring a bullish outlook for PEPE as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above the signal line. Today, the oscillator has distanced itself significantly from that line. This typically means that positive momentum is accelerating. At current prices, PEPE offers an upside potential of around 15% if it retests its next key resistance, which seems highly likely at this point. Meanwhile, if a bullish breakout occurs, the coin could experience short-term gains of up to 35% as it could move near the $0.000011 level. An improvement in the performance of PEPE would also help other Pepe-inspired meme coin like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – one of the best AI crypto presales of 2025. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) Leverages AI to Provide Valuable Market Insights to Token Holders MIND of PEPE (MIND) is an AI agent token that leverages both the power of AI and the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme to captivate social media users. The agent is designed to engage with high-profile accounts on platforms like X, gathering insights from these interactions and sharing them exclusively with $MIND holders. This gives investors a strategic edge in navigating current market conditions and identifying high-potential opportunities. As the agent grows its influence and follower base, it may also begin launching its own meme coins. $MIND holders will have first access to these tokens before they’re released to the broader market. To buy $MIND, simply head to the MIND of Pepe website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT, ETH, or BNB for this token or use a bank card to make your investment.

42279691,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142769,1742844021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Update: White House Fast-Tracks Crucial US Stablecoin Regulation Bill – What Crypto Investors Need to Know,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-stablecoin-regulation-genius-act/,"In a move that could drastically reshape the cryptocurrency landscape in the United States, the White House is reportedly applying significant pressure on Congress to expedite the passage of a landmark piece of legislation: the GENIUS Act. This bill, aimed at establishing comprehensive stablecoin regulation , is being fast-tracked with an ambitious goal – to reach President Trump’s desk within the next two months. This development, initially reported by Eleanor Terrett via Crypto in America, signals a heightened urgency from the executive branch to bring clarity and oversight to the burgeoning stablecoin market. Why is the White House Pushing for Swift Stablecoin Regulation? The urgency from the White House underscores the growing importance of stablecoin regulation in the broader financial ecosystem. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset like the US dollar, have become increasingly vital for crypto trading, lending, and payments. However, their rapid growth and potential systemic risks have caught the attention of regulators globally. The push for the GENIUS Act likely stems from several key factors: Investor Protection: Without clear regulatory frameworks, stablecoin users are exposed to risks related to the reserves backing these digital assets. The White House aims to protect consumers and investors from potential fraud or mismanagement. Financial Stability: The sheer volume of stablecoins in circulation, and their interconnectedness with traditional finance, raises concerns about potential contagion risks. Regulation is seen as crucial to maintaining financial stability. Combating Illicit Finance: Like other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins can be used for illicit activities. Regulation aims to enhance transparency and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing through these digital assets. Maintaining US Leadership in Fintech: The US wants to be at the forefront of fintech innovation while ensuring responsible growth. Clear crypto regulation US can provide the necessary legal framework for innovation to flourish within safe boundaries. GENIUS Act vs. STABLE Act: What’s the Difference? The legislative landscape for US stablecoin bill is currently defined by two key proposals: the Senate’s GENIUS Act and the House’s STABLE Act. While both aim to regulate stablecoins, there are nuances in their approach. The GENIUS Act has already cleared the Senate Banking Committee, indicating bipartisan support and momentum in the Senate. It is anticipated to reach the Senate floor imminently. The STABLE Act, on the other hand, is scheduled for markup in the House on April 2nd. Here’s a table highlighting the key differences and current status of both bills: Feature GENIUS Act (Senate) STABLE Act (House) Current Stage Passed Senate Banking Committee, expected on Senate floor Scheduled for House markup on April 2nd Legislative Path Potentially faster track due to Senate momentum Requires House markup and vote Reconciliation Possibility Lawmakers may bypass reconciliation if strong Senate support emerges Likely to proceed through House committee and floor votes House’s Stance Unclear if House will drop STABLE Act in favor of GENIUS Act Currently proceeding with markup process The crucial question is whether the House will ultimately decide to support the Senate’s GENIUS Act or proceed with its own STABLE Act. If the GENIUS Act gains overwhelming support in the Senate, lawmakers might seek to bypass the often lengthy reconciliation process with the House’s version, potentially expediting the bill’s journey to the President’s desk. However, as of now, the House appears set to move forward with the STABLE Act markup. What are the Potential Implications of the GENIUS Act? The swift passage of the GENIUS Act could have profound implications for the cryptocurrency industry and the broader financial system. Let’s explore some potential outcomes: Increased Legitimacy for Stablecoins: Clear stablecoin regulation can bring much-needed legitimacy to the stablecoin market. A well-defined regulatory framework can instill confidence in investors and users, potentially fostering wider adoption. Clarity for Stablecoin Issuers: Currently, stablecoin issuers operate in a regulatory gray area. The GENIUS Act could provide clear guidelines on registration, reserve requirements, and operational standards, offering legal certainty for businesses in this space. Potential for Innovation: While regulation is often perceived as stifling innovation, in the case of stablecoins, it could actually spur responsible innovation. A clear regulatory framework can encourage established financial institutions and new entrants to develop and deploy stablecoin-based solutions. Enhanced Market Stability: By addressing risks associated with stablecoin reserves and operations, the GENIUS Act could contribute to greater stability in the cryptocurrency market as a whole, reducing the potential for market shocks originating from the stablecoin sector. Impact on Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Stablecoins are a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. Crypto regulation US on stablecoins will inevitably impact DeFi protocols that rely heavily on these assets. The nature of this impact will depend on the specifics of the final legislation. What Should Crypto Investors Watch For? For crypto investors, keeping a close eye on the progress of both the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Senate Floor Vote: Track the progress of the GENIUS Act as it moves to the Senate floor. Strong bipartisan support there could signal a faster path to enactment. Follow House Markup of STABLE Act: Pay attention to the House Financial Services Committee markup of the STABLE Act on April 2nd. This will provide insights into the House’s priorities and potential amendments. Analyze Industry Reactions: Observe how cryptocurrency exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and industry associations react to developments surrounding both bills. Their perspectives can offer valuable clues about the likely impact of the legislation. Prepare for Regulatory Changes: Regardless of which bill ultimately prevails, it’s becoming increasingly clear that crypto regulation US , particularly for stablecoins, is on the horizon. Investors should prepare for potential changes in how stablecoins are issued, used, and regulated. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Stablecoin Regulation The White House’s urgent push for the GENIUS Act marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of stablecoin regulation in the United States. As Congress navigates the complexities of these bills, the cryptocurrency industry and investors alike stand at the cusp of a potentially transformative regulatory landscape. The coming weeks will be critical in determining the future of stablecoins and the broader trajectory of crypto regulation US . Staying informed and adaptable will be key for navigating this evolving environment.

In a recent discussion hosted by Allen Helm of Bitcoin For Corporations , new CEO John Riggins outlined the company’s pivot, its regulatory alignment with Hong Kong, and the broader momentum building across Asia. Riggins, a longtime Bitcoin advocate with extensive experience across China and Southeast Asia, explained that the move was driven by both long-term conviction and a favorable shift in regulatory posture in Hong Kong. He said the company had spent months consulting with regulators, public market investors, and local partners before executing the transition. Originally focused on SIM cards and prepaid tech products, HK Asia Holdings now aims to integrate Bitcoin both as a balance sheet asset and into its business model. This includes plans to roll out Bitcoin-related offerings through its retail footprint, such as ATMs and prepaid Bitcoin products. The company’s first steps included the acquisition of 8.88 BTC during a post-acquisition period, followed by another 10 BTC purchase once the leadership transition was finalized—bringing its total holdings to 18.88 BTC, valued at over $1.7 million at the time of announcement. Riggins said further accumulation is planned, though it will proceed in accordance with Hong Kong’s measured but transparent regulatory guidance. JUST IN: @MoonIncHK has acquired 10 BTC, increasing its total #Bitcoin holdings to 18.88 BTC at an average cost of ~$91,110 per BTC. pic.twitter.com/PtjZUl4U6K — Bitcoin For Corporations (@BitcoinForCorps) March 21, 2025 “We see it as a way to protect our balance sheet, and we see it as a way to diversify, our treasury with an eye on how the rest of the world is moving,” said Riggins. The strategic intent goes far beyond speculation. Riggins framed Bitcoin as a hedge against macro uncertainty, a tool for long-term resilience, and a bridge to emerging global financial infrastructure. He also emphasized how corporate boards in the region are beginning to engage more seriously with the idea, pointing to MetaPlanet in Japan and Strategy in the U.S. as compelling precedents. While Asia’s corporate Bitcoin adoption is still in its early stages, interest is growing fast. Riggins highlighted South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia as markets with clear potential to follow suit. Much of the movement, he noted, is happening quietly behind the scenes—especially in China, where institutional stakeholders and state-connected investors are actively monitoring U.S. policy shifts and corporate adoption trends. “I’m flooded with messages more and more from, people in the government, people, you know, institutional investors who are kinda watching this space closely looking for inside information about what’s happening here,” said Riggins. Although no formal public moves have been announced by Chinese state entities, Riggins believes Bitcoin is already being held indirectly through government-affiliated organizations, including state-connected investment arms. He suggested these holdings may be more significant than publicly known. With the U.S. moving toward a strategic Bitcoin reserve , he sees China closely watching—and potentially following—if global policy momentum continues to shift. Looking ahead, Moon Inc. plans to expand its Bitcoin holdings within Hong Kong’s regulatory framework and serve as a model for other Asian companies exploring similar strategies. The company will co-host Bitcoin Asia this August in Hong Kong, positioning itself as a regional trailblazer and helping catalyze broader corporate adoption across Asia.

This arrest underscores the escalating challenges law enforcement faces in combating sophisticated financial crimes within the digital asset space. Are international borders truly a barrier for criminals in the age of crypto? Let’s dive into the details of this alarming case. What Happened in the Thailand Crypto Crime Case? The Royal Thai Police have successfully arrested Wu Di, 27, and Zhou Zongyon, 29, both Chinese citizens, in connection with a large-scale crypto scam and a chilling kidnapping incident. According to reports, Wu Di is accused of orchestrating investment scams via Facebook, luring victims into fraudulent schemes that amassed a staggering $17.7 million. Adding another layer of complexity to the case, Zhou Zongyon was already a wanted man, flagged with an Interpol Red Notice for a prior kidnapping offense. This international dimension emphasizes the need for global cooperation in tackling cryptocurrency fraud that transcends national boundaries. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements of this alarming situation: The Accused: Wu Di and Zhou Zongyon, both Chinese nationals. The Allegations: Wu Di is accused of perpetrating a $17.7 million crypto scam through Facebook investment schemes. Zhou Zongyon was wanted on an Interpol Red Notice for kidnapping. Modus Operandi: The scam involved deceiving victims into investing in fake cryptocurrency opportunities. The ill-gotten gains were then channeled through “mule” accounts and subsequently converted into USDT (Tether), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, a common tactic to obscure the money trail in cryptocurrency fraud cases. Arrests and Ongoing Investigation: In addition to Wu and Zhou, three Thai nationals have also been arrested for their alleged involvement in the scheme, suggesting a network of accomplices. Investigations are ongoing to uncover the full extent of the operation and potentially identify more individuals involved. This case throws a spotlight on several critical aspects of the current cryptocurrency landscape and the associated criminal activities. The Rising Threat of Cryptocurrency Fraud The decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, while offering numerous benefits, unfortunately, also makes them attractive tools for illicit activities. Cryptocurrency fraud is on the rise globally, taking various forms, from Ponzi schemes and phishing attacks to rug pulls and, as seen in this case, elaborate investment scams. The sheer volume of money involved in this Thai case – $17.7 million – is a stark reminder of the financial devastation these scams can inflict on individuals and the broader economy. Examples of Common Crypto Scams: Scam Type Description Red Flags Investment Scams (like in this case) Fake investment opportunities promising high returns with little to no risk. Often promoted on social media platforms. Unrealistic promises, pressure to invest quickly, lack of transparency, unregistered investment schemes. Phishing Scams Deceptive emails, messages, or websites designed to steal your private keys or login credentials. Urgent requests for personal information, suspicious links, poor grammar, impersonation of legitimate entities. Rug Pulls Developers abandon a crypto project after raising funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Anonymous developers, lack of project roadmap, sudden halt in communication, unusual token price manipulation. Ponzi Schemes Fraudulent investment operations that pay returns to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors, rather than from actual profit. Unsustainable high returns, complex and secretive strategies, consistent positive returns regardless of market conditions. Why Thailand Crypto Crime? Location Matters The fact that this Thailand crypto crime occurred in Thailand raises questions about the country’s regulatory environment and its attractiveness to criminal elements. While Thailand has been working to develop its cryptocurrency regulations, the case highlights potential loopholes or challenges in enforcement. The geographical location and international travel dynamics might also play a role in why criminals choose certain locations for their operations. It’s crucial for nations to strengthen their cross-border collaboration to effectively combat transnational cryptocurrency fraud . Interpol Red Notice and Global Law Enforcement The involvement of an individual with an Interpol Red Notice in this case underscores the international nature of organized crime and the importance of global law enforcement cooperation. An Interpol Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action. Zhou Zongyon’s existing Red Notice for kidnapping suggests a pattern of serious criminal behavior and highlights the interconnectedness of global crime networks. The successful arrest in Thailand demonstrates the effectiveness of international law enforcement mechanisms in bringing criminals to justice, even in the complex realm of cryptocurrency fraud . USDT and the Money Trail in Crypto Scams The conversion of stolen funds into USDT (Tether) in this crypto scam is a common tactic used by criminals to obfuscate the money trail. USDT, being a stablecoin, offers relative price stability and is widely traded across cryptocurrency exchanges. While USDT facilitates legitimate transactions, its liquidity and ease of transfer also make it a preferred choice for money laundering and illicit activities. Tracking the flow of funds through stablecoins like USDT is a significant challenge for law enforcement agencies investigating cryptocurrency fraud . Actionable Insights: Protecting Yourself from Crypto Scams This alarming case serves as a potent reminder of the need for vigilance and proactive measures to protect yourself from falling victim to cryptocurrency fraud . Here are some actionable insights: Be Skeptical of Unrealistic Promises: If an investment opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Promises of guaranteed high returns with little risk are major red flags. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing in any cryptocurrency or project, conduct thorough research. Understand the technology, the team, and the risks involved. Don’t rely solely on social media hype or influencer endorsements. Use Reputable Exchanges and Wallets: Choose well-established and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets with robust security measures. Beware of Social Media Scams: Be extremely cautious of investment opportunities promoted on social media platforms like Facebook, Telegram, or WhatsApp. Many scams originate from these channels. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Always enable 2FA on your cryptocurrency exchange accounts and wallets to add an extra layer of security. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a suspected crypto scam , report it to the relevant authorities, including local law enforcement and cryptocurrency exchanges. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The Thai crypto scam and kidnapping case is a stark and shocking illustration of the risks associated with the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. It highlights the sophistication of criminal operations, the transnational nature of cryptocurrency fraud , and the urgent need for enhanced security measures, regulatory frameworks, and international cooperation. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, both investors and law enforcement agencies must remain vigilant and proactive in combating these evolving threats. This case serves as a critical wake-up call, urging everyone in the crypto space to prioritize security, due diligence, and responsible engagement.

A rally to this price target could pave the way for the new highs, especially with the crypto market looking to be in rebound mode. Next Target For Dogecoin As Ascending Triangle Forms In a TradingView post, CobraVanguard set $0.197 as the next target for the Dogecoin price with an ascending triangle forming. He noted that this ascending triangle indicates a potential price increase. The analyst added that it is anticipated that the price could rise, aligning with the projected price movement of AB=CD. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Turns Bullish With 1-Day RSI In Oversold Region, Why DOGE Can Reach $0.9 Meanwhile, CobraVanguard warned that it is crucial to wait for the triangle to break before taking any action. His accompanying chart showed that Dogecoin needs to break above $0.177 to confirm a break above the ascending triangle. A break above that target would then lead to a rally to the $0.197 target. Dogecoin already looks to be in rebound mode at the moment, alongside Bitcoin, which is nearing the $90,000 mark again. The foremost meme coin is nearing the $0.177 target for a break above the ascending triangle. As crypto analyst Kevin Capital suggested, DOGE will likely rally as long as BTC is in bullish territory. Crypto traders are also betting on a Dogecoin rally to the upside. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that 76.26% of traders with open DOGE positions on Binance futures are leaning bullish. This is particularly bullish because Binance traders have a good track record of being right most of the time. In another X post, Martinez revealed that whales bought over 120 million DOGE last week, which is also bullish for the foremost meme coin. DOGE’s Market Structure Has Shifted In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade revealed that Dogecoin’s market structure has shifted. This came as he noted that Dogecoin is recovering from an ascending triangle, forming higher highs and higher lows from lower highs and lower lows. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Stages Bounce From Lower Border Of Second Falling Wedge, New Targets Unlocked? Based on this, the analyst affirmed that Dogecoin had shifted the market structure from a downtrend to an uptrend on the hourly chart since it just formed the second higher high. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE is eyeing a rally to $0.177 as it continues to form higher highs. Martinez raised the possibility of the Dogecoin price rallying to as high as $4 or even $20 in the long term. He stated that if DOGE holds above the $0.16 support at the lower boundary of an ascending channel, history suggests that it could rebound toward the mid-range at $4 or upper range at around $20. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.174, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The Fed's two-day monetary policy meeting ended without any adjustments to interest rates, prompting Trump to voice his displeasure, arguing that the rate cut was necessary because the economic impact of U.S. tariffs was becoming increasingly evident. Meanwhile, Fed officials including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic signaled a more cautious approach, noting that uncertainty about the direction of the economy remained even as concerns among households and businesses grew. Bostic said the Fed’s inflation forecast for this year was largely unchanged and that inflation was not expected to return to its 2% target until 2027. Bostic warned that the path to lower inflation would be variable, describing it as “a very bumpy ride.” Related News: According to Data, Large Whales Have Entered the Accumulation Phase in These Three Altcoins, Selling in Another Altcoin Bostic reiterated that the Fed currently only sees one rate cut this year, despite speculation of multiple rate cuts in 2025. Bostic also addressed concerns about tariffs, noting that historically these tariffs have led to a one-time spike in prices, but this time the situation could be different. While the Fed remains cautious about making abrupt policy changes, Bostic said it is critical to avoid a scenario in which the central bank cuts rates prematurely but is later forced to reverse course. Bostic also said the Fed would respond appropriately if economic conditions weaken significantly. *This is not investment advice.

To read full editions, subscribe . The SEC’s new crypto task force gathered Friday to hear from 11 crypto attorneys and legal experts. It was the group’s inaugural roundtable discussion, lasting two hours and followed by 90 minutes of public Q&A. The meeting was dubbed the “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity” and had a focus on “defining security status.” Spoiler: To the chagrin of much of the crypto industry, roundtable attendees were not able to reach agreement on the very question that has plagued the securities regulator for 5+ years. Of course, answering the question of how to determine whether a crypto asset is a security wasn’t the primary purpose of the meeting. And, given that the SEC is operating with three commissioners and doesn’t currently have a permanent chair, we’d be shocked if the agency even hinted at passing formal rules around crypto. All that aside, though — even if Friday’s meeting seemed on the surface to be a nothingburger, we’d argue that the conversation was still telling when it comes to what we could expect from the agency in the next few years. Here are our top takeaways: Howey is still king All roads, for better or for worse, lead back to Howey . The panel on Friday spent almost the entire time debating how and if cryptocurrencies fit into the four-pronged Howey test. Until a formal crypto-specific rule is passed (which we don’t expect until the commission is full and a new chair is in place), don’t expect the Howey talk to die down. The guestlist was striking I can’t prove this, but I have a feeling that Friday’s meeting was the largest gathering of crypto-native lawyers inside the SEC, ever (well, save for the depositions and settlement meetings that undoubtedly have taken place over the years). Attendees included a16z Crypto Head of Policy & General Counsel Miles Jennings and Delphi Ventures General Counsel Sarah Brennan. Commission “interpretation” is just that Speaking of Howey , let us not forget that the SEC’s cherished securities framework is the result of a landmark Supreme Court ruling. The industry talks a lot about legal wins, like the district court ruling that secondary XRP sales were not unregistered securities ). But until a crypto case makes it further up the appellate ladder, we aren’t going to have meaningful legal precedent. Yes, commissioners can pass rules and staff can issue guidance, but I’m still a believer that we’ll need to see more judicial opinions before crypto fits neatly into the current securities landscape. The guidance we’ve seen from the SEC in the post-Gensler era is even less permanent. Acting Chair Mark Uyeda himself said Friday that these “staff statements” have no legal backing. In other words: As of now, there’s nothing stopping the next chair from coming in and reversing everything that’s happened since Jan. 20. Of course, the next SEC Chair is widely expected to be Paul Atkins , Trump’s pick, who heads to the Senate on Thursday for his nomination hearing. We don’t currently foresee any major hurdles to his confirmation, and we certainly don’t expect him to walk back any of Uyeda’s pro-crypto statements. Still, we’ll be monitoring the situation closely. Get the news in your inbox.

Although crypto is banned in China, the government greenlit the use of blockchain technology. In a recent interview with CNBC, Deng said that Hong Kong is a gateway to the Chinese mainland, often serving as a testing ground for the country’s new financial and technological innovations. “Hong Kong is always used as the lab for experiments, either in economies or new industries or sectors,” Deng said. He noted that discussions with regulators have revealed there’s an effort to utilize the “one country, two systems” framework to explore crypto and Web3 applications. Donald Trump’s election victory changed China’s perspective on crypto China was once the world’s epicentre of crypto trading and mining, with yuan-based transactions accounting for 80% of global Bitcoin volume before a regulatory crackdown began in 2013. However, four years later, authorities completely tightened restrictions, banning domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and events promoting digital assets. After Donald Trump won the November 2024 US presidential elections, Deng said that China shifted its stance from “hostile” to supportive. “With Trump and the new administration’s support, the regulatory framework will be more clear. So now the institutions, endowments, financial institutions, and high net worth individuals feel comfortable getting into the Web3 and crypto space in a more regulated and compliant way,” the CEO reckoned. China’s central bank does not recognize cryptocurrency as a legal tender, regulators have not passed formal legislation outlawing it entirely. The 2013 government circular on Bitcoin had classified it as a “virtual commodity” rather than a currency, allowing citizens to trade at their own risk. “Regulation takes a longer time than the industry expects. It’s always the case in all new nascent industries. This also is already a very important message to the industry. The US regulator will be followed by other regulators, same as in Europe, in Asia, here in Singapore and Hong Kong,” Deng added. Chinese financial regulators’ mind is changing According to Yifan He, CEO of Red Date Technology, some conversations with financial regulators insinuate that a change of heart might be coming soon. “I see some signal from financial regulators,” He said. “They’re beginning to talk about Bitcoin, saying we need to pay more attention and do more research on digital assets.” Two years ago, He believed China had “zero chance” of lifting its crypto restrictions . Now, he estimates there is “more than a 50% chance in three years.” Decentralized betting marketplace Polymarket placed the odds of China unbanning Bitcoin by the end of March at a 0% chance, a fall from 21% in December 2024, when the crypto was trading for over $97,000. China unbanning Bitcoin by March 31 wager. Source: Polymarket Deng told CNBC that a successful implementation of digital asset regulations in Hong Kong could influence the mainland’s stance. “If it’s successful, I think there is the possibility the mainland China government will reconsider their stance towards the crypto and Web3 industry,” he said. HashKey Capital expands regulated offerings In other news, on March 19, HashKey Capital secured a Type 1 license from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to provide crypto-backed brokerage services for retail and professional investors. The firm already holds a Type 9 license for asset management and a Type 4 license for securities and virtual asset investment advisory services. Recently, it also received approval to provide discretionary account management for virtual assets under its existing license. “The Type 1 license enhances our capabilities and provides significant value to investors,” said Vivien Wong, Partner at Liquid Funds. “It enables us to offer a broader range of investment opportunities, catering to different risk preferences with a strong focus on risk management and long-term growth.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Deposits for WAL are already live, paving the way for trading to commence on March 27th at 10:00 UTC. Mark your calendars and prepare for the WAL/USDT trading pair to hit the spot market on Bitget! What Makes the Bitget Listing of Walrus (WAL) So Noteworthy? Listings on major exchanges like Bitget are significant events in the crypto world. They typically bring increased visibility, liquidity, and accessibility to a token, potentially opening it up to a wider audience of investors and traders. Bitget’s decision to list Walrus (WAL) in its Innovation and Web3 Zones specifically signals that the exchange sees potential in the project’s innovative approach and its relevance to the evolving Web3 ecosystem. This move could be a game-changer for Walrus, providing a platform to showcase its technology and expand its community. Delving into Bitget’s Innovation and Web3 Zones: What Does it Mean for WAL? Bitget strategically categorizes new listings into different zones to guide users and highlight the nature of each project. The Innovation Zone is typically reserved for tokens that are newer to the market and represent novel concepts or technologies. Listing WAL in this zone suggests Bitget recognizes its fresh approach and potential for disruption. Simultaneously, the Web3 Zone placement emphasizes Walrus’s alignment with the decentralized web movement. Web3 is all about building a more user-centric and open internet, often leveraging blockchain technology. For Walrus, being listed in the Web3 Zone alongside the Innovation Zone implies that it’s not just a new token, but one with a vision that resonates with the future of the internet. This dual categorization provides a strong endorsement from Bitget regarding WAL’s innovative and forward-thinking nature within the crypto space.

Benefits of Trading Walrus (WAL) on Bitget: Why Should You Pay Attention? Trading newly listed tokens like WAL can present both opportunities and risks. Here are some potential benefits to consider: Early Access: Listing on Bitget provides early access to WAL for a large trading community.

This could be an opportunity to support and potentially benefit from the growth of a promising cryptocurrency. Potential for Volatility: New listings can experience significant price volatility, which can be attractive to traders looking for short-term gains. However, it’s crucial to remember that volatility also brings increased risk. Navigating the Potential Challenges and Risks of Trading New Listings like WAL While the potential benefits are enticing, it’s equally important to be aware of the challenges and risks associated with trading newly listed cryptocurrencies: Volatility and Price Swings: As mentioned, new listings can be highly volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, leading to both potential profits and significant losses. Limited Historical Data: Being a new token, WAL will have limited historical price data. This can make technical analysis more challenging and increase uncertainty. Project Risks: Investing in any cryptocurrency carries inherent risks related to the project itself. It’s crucial to conduct thorough research on Walrus (WAL) to understand its fundamentals, team, technology, and roadmap before trading. Market Sentiment: The success of WAL trading will also depend on overall market sentiment and broader crypto trends. External factors can influence price movements significantly. Liquidity Risks (Initially): While Bitget provides liquidity, it’s possible that in the very initial hours of trading, liquidity might be slightly lower than established tokens. Traders should be mindful of this, especially when placing large orders. Actionable Insights for Traders: Getting Ready for WAL Trading on Bitget Here are some actionable steps to consider if you are planning to trade WAL on Bitget: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before trading any cryptocurrency, especially a newly listed one, conduct thorough research on the Walrus (WAL) project. Understand its purpose, technology, team, and community. Understand the Risks: Be fully aware of the risks associated with trading volatile assets and new listings. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set Trading Strategy: Determine your trading strategy in advance. Are you looking for short-term gains, or are you interested in holding WAL for the longer term? Have clear entry and exit points in mind. Manage Risk: Utilize risk management tools available on Bitget, such as stop-loss orders, to protect your capital. Start Small: If you are new to trading or uncertain about WAL, consider starting with a small trading amount to test the waters. Monitor the Market: Keep a close eye on the WAL/USDT trading pair after listing. Monitor price action, trading volume, and market sentiment. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Walrus and Bitget’s Commitment to Innovation The listing of Walrus (WAL) on Bitget’s Innovation and Web3 Zones marks an exciting development for both the token and the exchange.

The company is collaborating with financial giants Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to assess this strategic move, according to Bloomberg reporting . The proposed debt raise, which could be as low as $200 million, is intended to fuel Kraken’s growth initiatives rather than cover operational expenses.​ In addition to the debt financing, Kraken is contemplating an equity raise, though no final decisions have been made, and the terms may evolve. Founded in 2011, Kraken has experienced significant growth, reporting a 128% increase in revenue to $1.5 billion in 2024, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $380 million. The platform serves over 10 million users across more than 190 countries, processing quarterly trading volumes exceeding $207 billion.​ You might also like: Pro: Ethereum, Solana key to crypto reserve Kraken’s IPO Kraken’s IPO ambitions have been bolstered by a more favorable regulatory environment under President Donald Trump. The company aims to go public as early as the first quarter of 2026. This optimism follows the recent dismissal of a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against Kraken, which had accused the exchange of operating as an unregistered securities broker. The SEC’s decision to drop the case has cleared a significant hurdle for Kraken’s public listing plans.​ In a strategic move to diversify its offerings, Kraken agreed last week to acquire NinjaTrader, a U.S.-based retail futures trading platform, for $1.5 billion. This acquisition is set to enhance Kraken’s capabilities in offering crypto futures and derivatives in the U.S. market, aligning with its broader goals of entering equities trading and payment sectors.

This partnership, formed through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), focuses on blockchain regulations, tokenization, and new financial technology. The UAE-based financial center is making this move to ensure digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi) operate within a clear legal framework. This collaboration will support blockchain projects registered with ADGM by providing them with Chainlink’s tools and expertise. ADGM Taps Chainlink To Set Clear Rules for Digital Assets ADGM wants to be a global leader in blockchain technology. It is working with Chainlink to set clear rules on how blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) can be used safely and legally. The goal is to ensure digital assets follow financial laws while allowing new ideas to grow. This partnership will also look at how blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) can work together. It will help create guidelines for creating, transferring, and managing digital assets.

Bitcoin Depot (BTM), a firm that specializes in selling bitcoin ATMs, has seen a revenue loss from $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. The lower transaction volume was primarily due to regulatory changes in the state of California, the firm told CoinDesk. Furthermore, Bitcoin Depot's cash flow has historically been uncorrelated to bitcoin’s price action, contended Brandon Mintz, the firm’s president and CEO. “Even when we saw that crash in 2022, transaction volumes were still growing,” he said. Bitcoin Depot's stock is down roughly 85% since it began trading on the Nasdaq after its merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2023. The company's market capitalization stands at $30 million. The firm dismissed the idea that spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which launched in the U.S. in January 2024, may have siphoned some of the firm's flows. ""Historically, our business is not directly tied to bitcoin price or investment vehicles like ETFs,"" said a spokesperson in an emailed statement. ""We haven’t seen evidence that ETFs have impacted our transaction volumes."" Bitcoin Depot, Mintz said, tends to serve unbanked Americans, as well as people who simply prefer to transact in cash, elderly folks who aren’t used to using online payment options, and crypto folks who find giving cash for bitcoin more convenient. “It’s a niche customer segment that we're focused on,” Mintz said. Bitcoin Depot buys the ATM kiosk from another company, but supplies the machine’s Bitcoin software. Prices for brand new machines typically range from $5,000 to $7,000, and it takes about a year for the company to break even on the cost of a machine once it has been installed. The ATMs only sell bitcoin. “We used to offer other cryptocurrencies, but when we went public the SEC was suing a lot of companies for selling other types of cryptos that the SEC claimed were potentially securities, so we decided to go Bitcoin only and avoid that risk,” Mintz said. “We believe it was a smart choice, because we're attracting people that aren’t very sophisticated traders — this is a very beginner-friendly product.” Bitcoin Depot has seen almost $3 billion in transaction volume since inception in 2016, the company’s recent investor presentation shows . While the company has been mostly focused on North America, Mintz floated the idea of expanding internationally, citing market saturation.",Markets|Bitcoin ATMs|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-24 19:45:02

The platform, licensed by Singapore’s Monetary Authority, is partnering with investment firm Hash Global to debut two index funds: one tracking top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks and another tracking leading crypto assets, according to a statement . The move, it says, replaces the traditional infrastructure behind portfolio management—brokers, banks, custodians—with smart contracts and stablecoins. Investors will subscribe to and redeem from the funds using USDT or USDC and view fund holdings in real time on the blockchain. “By bringing real-world equities fully on-chain, we remove inefficiencies, enhance accessibility, and set a new standard for how portfolios are structured, traded, and managed in a blockchain-native environment,” Henry Zhang, CEO of DigiFT, said. The artificial intelligence-focused DigiFT Hash Global AI Index Fund will offer exposure to companies like Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft, tokenized to reflect their real-world stock values. A second fund will track major cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether and Solana. The structure gives investors round-the-clock access to the funds, greater transparency, and increased liquidity.

As the crypto world watches closely, these digital currencies promise exciting returns. This article reveals which coins are poised to surge and why they are catching the eyes of savvy investors. Get ready to discover the next big opportunities in the crypto market. Ethena Price Outlook: Mixed Recovery and Key Level Targets Ethena saw a 14.67% decline over the past month yet posted a 22.02% gain over six months, with a notable 9.88% increase in the last week. Volatile swings have marked its journey, with periods of steep pullbacks followed by recovery pushes over these time frames. Current prices lie between $0.25 and $0.68, with firm support at $0.10 and immediate resistance at $0.95, extending to a second resistance at $1.37. Indicators are neutral with a near-even RSI and weak oscillator, while bulls hold slight momentum and bears remain cautious. Trading ideas include watching for a bounce near support before making moves toward resistance. Hyperliquid Steady Amid Volatility and Emerging Rally The past month saw a drop of 33.26%, while the coin gained 66.98% over the last six months. Weekly figures of 28.85% highlight rapid price movements amid clear ups and downs. Price shifts have been dramatic as market sentiment changed quickly, drawing attention to both sudden declines and robust recoveries. Current trading activity places Hyperliquid between $15.17 and $26.59, with key resistance around $33.24 and strong support at $10.41. Bulls appear to be active in recent short-term gains, even though monthly losses hint at seller pressure. Trading ideas include buying near support and watching for moves toward resistance to capture breakout opportunities. Toncoin: Short-Term Recovery Amid Long-Term Pressure Toncoin shows a 3.69% boost over the past month paired with a notable 34.48% drop over the last six months. The recent recovery contrasts sharply with the sustained decline experienced earlier, signaling a coin that has had a bumpy ride. The action over the month reflects brief optimism while the half-year trend underscores extended selling pressure. Current trading sees prices ranging between $2.53 and $4.52. Immediate support sits at $1.72 with resistance marked at $5.72 and a second barrier near $7.71. Weekly gains of nearly 7% and a slightly above-neutral RSI point to short-term buyer interest. With bulls edging in, traders could look to buy near support and sell as prices test the $5.72 barrier. Conclusion ENA , HYPE , and TON all show strong potential for significant growth soon. As the crypto market evolves, these coins could offer substantial returns. Smart investors are already eyeing them for their next big move.

That made it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the day. The last time it did anything close to this was November 6, 2024, one day after Donald Trump won the presidential election. Even after today’s jump, the stock is still down over 44% from its peak in December. The rally comes after months of sell-offs caused by rising anger over Elon Musk’s political activity. His loud support for far-right policies triggered consumer boycotts across the U.S. and Europe. TSLA one-hour price chart. Source: TradingView That wasn’t just people canceling orders. There were multiple incidents of vandalism and arson at Tesla showrooms and charging stations, both in the U.S. and overseas, all of which fueled the stock’s collapse. Morgan Stanley cuts deliveries as Musk defends stock to workers On Friday, Morgan Stanley cut its first-quarter delivery forecast, warning that Tesla would post a 9% year-over-year decline. The bank blamed declining demand, negative brand sentiment, and rising competition, according to CNBC. The note from the firm directly tied the lower forecast to Elon’s political shift, saying it had turned off a large chunk of consumers worldwide. At an all-hands meeting on the evening of Thursday, Elon told employees to hold on to their shares, saying, “Hang onto your stock.” He also said the Model Y would still be “the best-selling car on Earth again this year.” That claim came despite the recent demand collapse and production concerns highlighted by analysts. The rally on Monday wasn’t just about Tesla’s internal situation. Investors got some relief from Washington D.C., too. According to The Wall Street Journal, the reciprocal tariffs planned by President Trump for April 2 might be less aggressive than expected. The Journal said that industrial sectors may be left out of the initial round, while a separate report from Bloomberg stated that some countries could be exempt entirely. Both outlets warned that the situation is still fluid, and nothing is locked in yet. That news sparked broader optimism across Wall Street. Investors had been bracing for a full-blown trade war. But the idea of a narrower rollout gave traders something to cling to. That helped lift major indexes and tech names, with Tesla leading the pack. Trump confirms delay for key sectors while stocks post sharp gains During a press briefing on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters that tariffs on industries like autos and pharma would still happen, but they won’t be part of the initial April 2 rollout. That lined up with earlier reports and confirmed that sector-specific tariffs are being held back for now. Trump also said that new tariffs will be announced soon, adding that they will hit autos, lumber, and chips next. Markets responded quickly. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 429 points, or about 1%. The S&P 500 rose 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.9%. Alongside Tesla’s more than 10% climb, other major tech names like Meta and Nvidia also moved up roughly 3%. But the biggest spotlight stayed on Tesla, which has now added to its small Friday gains and finally broke its losing streak. Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management, said on Monday, “Market conditions are improving dramatically as the angst around reciprocal tariffs is somewhat diminishing.” He also said, “Should the administration come through with a more targeted and tactical strategy around tariff implementation, risks of a full-blown trade war are reduced.” Traders are still on edge. Inflation is rising, and recession fears haven’t gone anywhere. But Trump’s comments and the tariff reports gave just enough clarity to calm markets for the day. The hope is that the U.S. can avoid a deeper economic slowdown tied to international retaliation. For weeks now, recession warnings have been everywhere. A weak consumer sentiment report earlier this month added fuel to the fire. Starting in late February, the S&P 500 dropped fast and entered correction territory. That sent alarm bells through every trading desk in the country. On Friday, March 21, Trump already started signaling a shift. Speaking to reporters, he said there could be “flexibility” in the tariff plans. That alone helped lift the S&P 500, which was heading for its fourth straight weekly loss, according to CNBC. By the end of that session, the index had managed to post a small gain. It now sits 7.8% below its record high. The Nasdaq Composite, after four straight down weeks, also bounced back slightly and now stands 12% below its all-time high. Despite the bounce, nothing is stable yet. Trump’s tariff threats are still hanging over everything. He confirmed on Monday that new tariffs will hit the auto, lumber, and chip sectors “in the coming days.” That means Tesla and other automakers might have just a short window before the next wave of policy risk slams the sector again. Still, for one day, the rally was real. Tesla jumped. Tech moved higher. And traders who’d been living off anxiety finally exhaled. But with Trump’s tariffs still loading, and Elon’s political baggage still burning through brand trust, nobody’s calling this a comeback. It’s just Monday.

That’s the eyebrow-raising claim from financial heavyweight Standard Chartered. Forget the narrative of Bitcoin as a safe haven, a hedge against market storms – according to their latest analysis, BTC is behaving more like its cousins in the volatile world of technology stocks. Let’s dive into this fascinating, and potentially game-changing, perspective. Bitcoin’s Tech Stock Twin: A Shocking Revelation Geoff Kendrick, a leading analyst at Standard Chartered, has stirred the pot by suggesting a significant shift in how we should perceive Bitcoin. His analysis, highlighted by Decrypt , proposes that Bitcoin’s price action mirrors that of tech stocks more closely than traditional safe-haven assets. This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s backed by data and a compelling thought experiment. Kendrick argues that if you swapped out Tesla (TSLA), a prominent name in the “Magnificent 7” tech stock index, with Bitcoin, creating a hypothetical “Mag 7B,” the results are startling. Consider these key points from Standard Chartered’s analysis: Boosted Returns: Since 2017, a “Mag 7B” index, replacing Tesla with Bitcoin , would have actually increased overall returns by a significant 5%. This is a substantial outperformance, challenging the notion that adding a volatile asset like Bitcoin would dampen portfolio gains. Reduced Volatility? Surprisingly, this hypothetical index not only boosted returns but also potentially reduced volatility. This counterintuitive finding suggests that Bitcoin , when viewed within a tech-centric portfolio, might not be as destabilizing as commonly perceived. Nvidia Parallels: Kendrick points out that Bitcoin ’s recent market behavior is particularly aligned with high-flying tech names like Nvidia (NVDA). This correlation strengthens the argument that Bitcoin is increasingly intertwined with the tech sector’s performance. Futures Market Surge: The surge in open interest in Bitcoin futures further supports this tech stock analogy. Futures markets are often indicative of institutional and sophisticated investor activity, and their growing interest in Bitcoin suggests a view of BTC as a tradable asset within broader market dynamics, rather than just a niche hedge. Easing Market Jitters: Following periods of uncertainty, such as those related to tariffs, the easing of market jitters seems to have benefited both tech stocks and Bitcoin alike, further highlighting their correlated movements. Is Bitcoin a Hedge or a High-Growth Gamble? Rethinking Crypto Market Strategies For years, the narrative around Bitcoin has often revolved around its potential as a “digital gold” – a safe-haven asset, uncorrelated to traditional markets, and a hedge against inflation and economic instability. However, Standard Chartered’s analysis challenges this deeply ingrained perception. If Bitcoin is indeed trading more like a tech stock , what are the implications for investors? Let’s consider the contrasting roles: Asset Class Hedge (Traditional View) Tech Stock (Emerging View) Bitcoin Safe haven during market downturns Growth asset, correlated with tech sector Gold Store of value, inflation hedge Less correlated with tech sector Tech Stocks High growth potential, higher volatility Sensitive to interest rates and innovation cycles If Bitcoin behaves like a tech stock , it means: Higher Risk, Higher Reward: Like tech stocks, Bitcoin might offer significant growth potential but also comes with increased volatility and risk. It’s no longer just a shield against market chaos; it’s part of the risk-on asset class. Sensitivity to Macroeconomic Factors: Tech stocks are often sensitive to interest rate changes, economic growth forecasts, and investor sentiment. If Bitcoin is mirroring this behavior, it will likely be similarly influenced by these macroeconomic factors, diminishing its role as an uncorrelated hedge. Correlation with Innovation and Tech Trends: The value of tech stocks is intrinsically linked to innovation, technological advancements, and the adoption of new technologies. A tech-like Bitcoin suggests its price might be increasingly tied to developments in the broader blockchain and crypto space, as well as general technological progress. Decoding the Crypto Market Signals: Open Interest and Market Jitters Why is Bitcoin acting more like a tech stock now? Several factors could be at play. The surge in open interest in Bitcoin futures is a significant indicator. Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, and a rise often signals increased institutional participation and speculative activity. This influx of institutional money might be treating Bitcoin less as a fringe asset and more as a mainstream investment vehicle, aligning it with broader market trends, including those of the tech sector. Furthermore, the easing of “market jitters” after events like tariff-related uncertainties suggests a risk-on environment. In such environments, both tech stocks and Bitcoin tend to benefit as investors become more willing to take on risk in pursuit of higher returns. This shared response to market sentiment further strengthens the observed correlation. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation doesn’t equal causation. While Bitcoin ‘s price movements might currently resemble those of tech stocks, this relationship could evolve. The crypto market is still relatively young and subject to rapid shifts in sentiment and regulatory landscapes. Bitcoin ‘s fundamental characteristics as a decentralized, scarce digital asset remain unchanged, even if its short-term trading behavior aligns with tech equities. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Adapting to the Tech Stock Narrative So, what should crypto investors do with this intriguing information? If Standard Chartered’s analysis holds true, and Bitcoin is indeed trading more like a tech stock , it necessitates a recalibration of investment strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Portfolio Diversification: If Bitcoin is no longer a reliable hedge, diversification becomes even more critical. Investors should consider diversifying across different asset classes, including traditional hedges like gold, and potentially other cryptocurrencies with different use cases and market correlations. Risk Management: Treating Bitcoin as a tech stock means acknowledging its inherent volatility and managing risk accordingly. Position sizing, stop-loss orders, and a clear understanding of your risk tolerance are essential. Macroeconomic Awareness: Pay closer attention to macroeconomic factors that influence tech stocks, such as interest rate policies, inflation expectations, and economic growth forecasts. These factors could increasingly impact Bitcoin ‘s price as well. Tech Sector Analysis: Keep an eye on the performance of the tech sector as a whole. Trends and sentiment within the tech industry could provide valuable insights into potential Bitcoin price movements. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term correlations are interesting, maintain a long-term perspective on Bitcoin . Its fundamental value proposition, driven by scarcity, decentralization, and potential for future adoption, may still play out regardless of short-term market behavior. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin? Standard Chartered’s assertion that Bitcoin is trading more like a tech stock than a hedge is a provocative and thought-provoking analysis. It challenges conventional wisdom and forces us to reconsider the role of Bitcoin in investment portfolios. Whether this tech-like behavior is a temporary phase or a more permanent shift remains to be seen. However, it’s undeniable that the crypto market is constantly evolving, and understanding these evolving dynamics is crucial for navigating the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of digital assets. The idea of Bitcoin as a pure hedge might need to be nuanced, acknowledging its growing entanglement with the broader tech and financial markets. This new perspective, though potentially shocking to some, opens up exciting avenues for strategic crypto investing in the years to come.

In a new interview with Fox Business, Garlinghouse says that since the United States is no longer stifling the crypto industry with unnecessary lawsuits and regulation by enforcement, the growth of the digital assets sector is poised to skyrocket. “Once the United States government filed suit, we really were kind of frozen in the US market, and so about 95% of our customers today, Ripple’s customers, are non-US financial institutions, and those are some of the largest financial institutions, ranging from HSBC and BBVA to payment providers you wouldn’t necessarily have heard of. Markets like Japan, I think are still unlocking. The market opportunity here is massive. You have trillions of dollars flowing cross-border globally. It’s still largely dominated by the Swift network, if you will. That’s a technology architecture that was developed 50 years ago. There’s an opportunity to modernize. That takes time, particularly when you have a government in the US kind of combating that innovation. But that’s changing now. The Trump effect, if you will, is profound. You’re seeing that in asset prices, but you’re also going to see that in the adoption of these technologies.” The Ripple CEO also says that blockchain technology may be adopted for a number of uses, including the trading of stocks and the selling and buying of real estate. “We’re definitely already seeing a change in the domestic interest. These six weeks after President Trump was elected, we signed more deals in the United States than we had in the previous six months. So these are very innovative technologies. I think they’re going to play out over 10, even 20 years, in terms of how they integrate and rewire the financial infrastructure of the United States. That’s across payments, that’s across even the settlement of maybe real estate transactions, securities transactions. So I think we’re going to see this play out over a long arc, but the United States is finally unlocked, and I think people are underestimating how big that change is, and you’ll see that continue to play out this year.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Is This Trending Altcoin Set To Steal Its Market Share?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-cardano-ada-price-hit-10-in-2025-is-this-trending-altcoin-set-to-steal-its-market-share/,"Cardano (ADA) investors are wondering whether the token can reach $10 in 2025, but a rising altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is already gaining momentum and could steal ADA’s market share. Currently trading around $0.73, Cardano would need an extraordinary 15x surge to hit $10, a feat that seems challenging given its slow ecosystem growth and stiff competition. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are available in Phase 3 presale for $0.02 per token during the present phase. Phase 4 price will increase to $0.025 after the opportunity ends when current phase 3 which is 60% sold out, exists at $0.02. Since its launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) collected $4.5 million through the investments of more than 6400 holders. Analysts project that Mutuum Finance assets will experience an astonishing growth to $3 after launch. Investors have less time before phase 3 completes. Mutuum Finance: Transforming DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance has succeeded in attracting many investors through its attractive opportunity structure. Mutuum Finance introduces innovative financial services through its next-generation dual-lending approach which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) smart contracts operate lending pools through the process of receiving USDT stablecoins to issue ETH asset-backed loans. Users maintain exclusive ownership of their confidential loan arrangements through the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system because it operates without requiring any intermediaries. Users can access maximum security and adaptive operations together with profit generation through current APY rates that reach up to 10% during liquidity provision. The platform prioritizes both security and transparency by having third-party examine all procedures and implementing open-source smart contracts to build user trust. The platform will stabilize its operations through introducing a stablecoin which backs USD value together with fee-supported token buyback procedures to maintain price stability over the duration. Stakeholders who can obtain staking rewards gain financial incentives for keeping their liquidity on the platform thus building stronger confidence throughout the system. The platform registers growing popularity because it has gained over 5700 investors. Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity Throughout the Phase 3 presale event people may purchase MUTM tokens at their initial value of $0.02. Throughout its 11-staged sale period the MUTM token price growth will expand from $0.02 to $0.06 to create up to 200% investor gains before trading commencement. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens will achieve a price of $3 after the launch becoming a leading DeFi token in 2025. Investors who participated in the first phase and purchase MUTM tokens at the $0.025 price point will receive 75% instant profit and the current MUTM capital now exceeds $4.5 million. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives Mutuum Finance is set to achieve wider adoption through its prize giveaway of $100,000 for donating ten $10,000 MUTM tokens to users. The site adds more value to users who are capable of attracting new investors as it drives user engagement and community growth rates higher. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly positioning itself as a game-changer in the DeFi space, attracting thousands of investors and raising over $4.5 million in capital. While Cardano (ADA) would require an immense 15x surge to reach $10, MUTM’s presale price of $0.02 offers an early entry point with projections soaring to $3 post-launch. The platform’s dual-lending model, high APY incentives, and security-focused ecosystem make it a formidable competitor in the crypto landscape. Investors have limited time to capitalize on this opportunity with Phase 3 presale already 60% sold out and a $100,000 giveaway fueling adoption.

XRPTurbo is filling this gap by building a suite of intuitive DeFi products, dramatically lowering entry barriers for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors alike.

The sui coin price has tumbled, dropping 50% over two months, while stiff resistance near $4 keeps many traders on edge. At the same time, speculation swirls around the Cardano price prediction for 2025. ADA could range from $0.6855 to $1.3058, though challenges in development and tough competition are raising questions about its future. As SUI and ADA work through these issues, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gathering momentum. It has already raised more than $205.5 million, and its game-changing partnership with Inter Milan is turning heads. By bringing blockchain closer to millions of soccer supporters, BlockDAG is ramping up its presence and making a solid case as the next big crypto. Demand is skyrocketing as its presale hits new milestones, drawing fresh waves of interest daily. SUI Coin Price Slashes 50%, Eyes on $4 Resistance The sui coin price has been under heavy pressure, slipping by 50% in just two months. Adding to the tension, SUI dropped another 20% in the past week. Some traders are jumping in, hoping to “buy the dip,” while others remain cautious as the coin continues to post lower highs. Short sellers are keeping up the pressure, selling into every rally as SUI nears previous support zones. Analysts say a major move hinges on the sui coin price clearing the $4 resistance, which has so far been impossible to break. Until that level falls, many traders are watching closely, waiting to see if SUI can regain momentum—or if more downside lies ahead. Cardano Price Prediction 2025: Can ADA Hit $1.3058? The Cardano price prediction for 2025 is fueling debate, as traders weigh whether ADA can revisit old highs—or go even further. Coin Codex estimates ADA will trade between $0.6855 and $1.3058 by 2025, with an average price of $0.8901. If these predictions hold up, investors could be looking at gains of up to 79.34%. However, ADA’s path forward is uncertain. Development delays, stiff competition, and shifting conditions across crypto markets all add to the uncertainty. While Cardano’s loyal community and ongoing blockchain upgrades help keep interest alive, maintaining long-term price strength may be an uphill battle. BlockDAG & Inter Milan Partnership: Fueling Demand & Mainstream Buzz BlockDAG’s deal with Inter Milan is shaking things up, exposing millions of soccer fans to cryptocurrency—many for the first time. This collaboration is opening doors to a vast audience, placing BlockDAG directly in the spotlight and drawing attention from potential buyers worldwide. High-visibility alliances like this boost trust and recognition. BlockDAG is quickly becoming a well-known name, not just among crypto insiders but also across mainstream channels. This expanding visibility is stoking demand as more people discover the advantages BlockDAG offers. It’s the kind of exposure that can push a project to the next level and spark serious growth in both user base and market traction. This surge in interest is already making waves in BlockDAG’s presale, which has crossed the $205.5 million mark with over 18.8 billion coins sold so far. The first batch of coins was priced at $0.001, but batch 27 now costs $0.0248, delivering an impressive 2380% increase. As each batch sells out, prices climb higher, rewarding early supporters and reinforcing confidence in BlockDAG’s long-term value. The combination of major partnerships and growing market excitement is driving the presale higher every day. Those waiting to jump in may soon find themselves paying a premium as prices keep climbing. Moving early could be the smartest play before the next batch takes off. Final Thoughts Crypto markets are in motion, with SUI struggling as the sui coin price battles heavy resistance near $4. Cardano, meanwhile, faces a mixed outlook, as the Cardano price prediction for 2025 highlights potential gains but also significant hurdles due to slow progress and fierce competition. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is shaping up to be the next big crypto . Its high-profile Inter Milan partnership is giving it a huge boost, turning heads in mainstream circles and driving demand higher by the day. With more than $205.5 million raised so far and presale prices rising fast, excitement around BlockDAG is building. Early buyers are already seeing the benefits, and as more buyers pile in, the window to get in early is closing quickly. Those waiting might miss out as BlockDAG’s price looks set to climb even higher.

In a new CNBC interview, the CEO of investment management firm DoubleLine Capital points out that the S&P 500 has given up most of its gains since the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle in Q3 2024. According to Gundlach, risk assets like equities tend to witness upside bursts when the Fed slashes interest rates. With the S&P500 plummeting to a level last seen in September of last year, Gundlach says the bearish price action indicates a deeper issue is troubling the stock market. “Since the Fed starting cutting rates back in September, bond yields are still up and the stock market is doing very, very little since then. So this is an unusual time period where the Fed cutting rates by 100 basis points and talking about two more, we have not seen a rally in the 10-year Treasury bond… We have also not really had a rally in stocks since the Fed started cutting interest rates. There’s that old phrase ‘Don’t fight the Fed,’ which is supposed to mean that if the Fed is cutting, you’re supposed to stay long risk but it sort of isn’t working this time. I think that’s going to continue to be a theme as we move forward in time. I think that we really have a big problem… with this interest expense. It’s over $3 billion a day in interest expense on the Treasury debt.” Interest expense is the interest paid by the US government to holders of its $36.22 trillion national debt. The nonpartisan, nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) says data from the Treasury Department showed that the government paid $882 billion in interest costs during the 2024 fiscal year, which ran from October 1st, 2023 to September 30th, 2024.

42281283,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142801,1742846451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Tokenized Real Estate Investment Unlocked in Canada by Ocree,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tokenized-real-estate-investment-canada/,"Imagine owning a piece of prime Canadian real estate without the hefty price tag and complex paperwork. Sounds too good to be true? Not anymore! Ocree Capital, a registered securities dealer, is changing the game with the launch of its groundbreaking platform for tokenized real estate investment in Canada. This innovative approach opens doors for investors to participate in the real estate market in a way never before possible. What is Tokenized Real Estate and Why is it Revolutionary? Tokenized real estate is essentially the digital representation of ownership rights to a property, broken down into smaller, tradable digital tokens. Think of it like slicing a pizza into many pieces – instead of buying the whole pizza (the entire property), you can buy just a few slices (tokens representing fractions of the property). This fractional ownership model dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for real estate investment, making it accessible to a wider range of investors. Here’s why tokenization is a game-changer: Lower Investment Threshold: Forget needing hundreds of thousands of dollars for a down payment. Tokenization allows you to invest with significantly smaller amounts, democratizing access to potentially lucrative real estate opportunities. Increased Liquidity: Traditionally, real estate is illiquid – selling a property can take time and effort. Tokenized shares can be traded more easily on secondary markets (where regulations allow), offering investors greater flexibility. Portfolio Diversification: Tokenization enables investors to diversify their portfolios by investing in multiple properties with smaller capital outlays, reducing risk. Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology, like Polymesh used by Ocree, provides a transparent and secure record of ownership and transactions, streamlining processes and reducing administrative burdens. Ocree Capital: Pioneering Fractional Ownership in Canada Ocree Capital is stepping into the spotlight as a pioneer in Canada’s real estate investment landscape. By launching a regulated platform built on the Polymesh blockchain, they are providing accredited Canadian investors (excluding Quebec) with a secure and compliant way to invest in tokenized real estate. Their first offering is particularly exciting: fractional shares of a 156-unit Class A property in Winnipeg, valued at a substantial $51.9 million. Key Highlights of Ocree’s Tokenized Real Estate Offering: Property: A 156-unit Class A multi-family property in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Valuation: $51.9 million. Investment Structure: Equity investment via a limited partnership, not debt financing. Platform: Built on the Polymesh (POLYX) blockchain, known for its security token focus. Regulation: Ocree Capital is a registered securities dealer, ensuring compliance with Canadian regulations. Investor Eligibility: Currently available to accredited investors across Canada (excluding Quebec). Why Polymesh Blockchain for Tokenized Assets? Ocree’s choice of the Polymesh (POLYX) blockchain is strategic and significant. Polymesh is specifically designed for security tokens and regulated assets. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, Polymesh prioritizes compliance, security, and governance, making it an ideal foundation for fractional ownership of real estate and other regulated assets. Its features are tailored to meet the stringent requirements of the financial industry, ensuring a robust and trustworthy platform for investors. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature General-Purpose Blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) Polymesh (POLYX) Designed for Broad applications, including cryptocurrencies, DeFi, NFTs Security tokens and regulated assets Compliance Focus Less emphasis on built-in compliance features Core focus on regulatory compliance and identity management Governance Often decentralized and community-driven Designed for enterprise-grade governance and control Identity Management Limited built-in identity solutions Native identity layer for KYC/AML compliance Investing in Canadian Real Estate: A Smart Move? Canada has long been considered a stable and attractive market for real estate investment . With a growing population, strong economy in many regions, and a history of property value appreciation, Canadian real estate offers compelling opportunities. However, traditional barriers to entry, such as high capital requirements and complex transaction processes, have kept many investors on the sidelines. Ocree’s platform, by tokenizing a Class A property in Winnipeg, makes accessing this market significantly easier. Winnipeg, in particular, presents a potentially lucrative entry point within the Canadian market, known for its affordability compared to major metropolitan centers like Toronto or Vancouver, while still offering solid growth potential. What are the Potential Benefits for Investors? Investing in tokenized real estate through Ocree’s platform offers a range of potential benefits: Diversification into Real Estate: Easily add real estate exposure to your investment portfolio without large capital outlays. Potential for Passive Income: Tokenized ownership could potentially generate income through rental yields from the property (depending on the specific structure and terms). Simplified Investment Process: A regulated and user-friendly platform streamlines the investment process compared to traditional real estate transactions. Access to Institutional-Grade Assets: Invest in a professionally managed Class A property, typically only accessible to institutional investors. Are There Any Challenges to Consider? While tokenized real estate investment is exciting, it’s essential to be aware of potential challenges: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for tokenized assets is still evolving globally and in Canada. Investors should be aware of and comfortable with the regulatory framework. Liquidity Risk: While tokenization aims to improve liquidity, the secondary market for these tokens is still developing. Liquidity might be lower compared to publicly traded stocks, especially in the early stages. Technological Risks: As with any technology-based investment, there are inherent technological risks associated with blockchain and digital assets. Accredited Investor Requirement: Currently, this opportunity is limited to accredited investors, restricting access for retail investors (excluding Quebec). Actionable Insights: Is Tokenized Real Estate Right for You? If you are an accredited investor in Canada (excluding Quebec) looking to diversify your portfolio and gain exposure to the real estate investment market, Ocree’s tokenized real estate offering presents a compelling opportunity. The fractional ownership model lowers the barrier to entry, while the use of the Polymesh blockchain provides a secure and compliant platform. Before investing, consider the following: Your Investment Goals: Does real estate align with your overall investment strategy? Risk Tolerance: Are you comfortable with the risks associated with new technologies and evolving regulatory environments? Due Diligence: Thoroughly research Ocree Capital, the specific property offering, and the terms of the investment. Accredited Investor Status: Ensure you meet the criteria to be considered an accredited investor in Canada (excluding Quebec). Conclusion: The Future of Real Estate Investment is Here Ocree Capital’s launch of tokenized real estate investment in Canada marks a significant step forward in democratizing access to this asset class. By leveraging blockchain technology and focusing on regulatory compliance, they are paving the way for a more inclusive and efficient future for real estate investment. This initiative has the potential to reshape how Canadians invest in property, opening up exciting new possibilities for portfolio diversification and wealth creation.

As of today, March 25, 2025, with a 6% upward move, the meme coin is reversing its extended market downturn. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, SHIB appears bullish as it has broken out of a consolidation zone and a descending trendline that has acted as a resistance level since the beginning of January 2025. With this breakout and an impressive price surge, the meme coin seems to be forming a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern and is on the verge of another breakout. Experts view this pattern as a bullish signal, indicating a potential recovery of SHIB’s recent losses. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if the meme coin breaks out of the pattern and closes a daily candle above the $0.0000138 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar 50% to reach $0.0000205 in the coming days. Source: Trading View Despite an impressive price surge, SHIB has failed to reclaim the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, keeping it in a downtrend. Current Price Momentum At press time, SHIB is trading near $0.00001362, having surged over 7% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, the meme coin has also seen a 55% increase in trading volume, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors following the bullish price action. Traders Over-Leveraged Levels Following the bullish price action, intraday traders appear to be adopting the same outlook, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at $0.0000132 on the lower side and $0.00001377 on the upper side, having built $300K and $135K worth of long and short positions, respectively, in the past 24 hours.

Metaplanet now has a total of 3 350 BTC that were purchased for about $278.8 million, as reported by CEO Simon Gerovich. At current market prices, the firm's cryptocurrency assets are valued at $291.3 million. The purchase comes after Eric Trump, the second son of Donald Trump, joined the company's Strategic Board of Directors on March 21. According to Gerowitz, Herowitz's ”business expertise and passion for BTC” Eric Trump will help realize the company's mission to create ”one of the world's leading bitcoin treasury companies.” Ambitious Plans Metaplanet has been consistently increasing their investment in the largest cryptocurrency since April 2024, when the company unveiled their bitcoin acquisition strategy. Their goal is to accumulate 10 000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21 000 BTC by the end of 2026. According to Bitcointreasuries.net, the Japanese firm is currently ranked 10th among publicly traded corporate bitcoin holders globally and first in Asia. The leader of the ranking remains Strategy's Michael Saylor with nearly 500 000 BTC. Metaplanet shares were up 4.8% on the Japanese exchange during the afternoon trading session at the time of writing. Google Finance data shows that the company's share price is up 38.7% since the beginning of the year. Metaplanet's decision to engage Eric Trump and increase its investment in bitcoin demonstrates the growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency as a reliable asset.

To read full editions, subscribe . I’ve been getting Ledn CIO John Glover’s bitcoin price technical analyses by email for a while now. But I was finally able to catch up with him in person at the Digital Asset Summit. Glover, ex-managing director at TD Securities and Barclays, uses Elliott Wave Theory — examining price patterns related to changes in investor sentiment and psychology — to predict BTC price. Essentially, the theory goes: A deeply liquid market will move in the main trend direction in five waves (three “motive” phases pushing price up, with two downward “corrective” phases in between). There are then three waves that go opposite that trend. Traders sometimes use this theory alongside other technical analyses to identify possible entry and exit points. Last week, we perhaps neared the end of Wave 4 (the way down) within this broader BTC price uptrend that began in 2023 at around $16,000, according to Glover. The market, he noted, was not moved by the pro-crypto remarks that Donald Trump recorded for last week’s Blockworks conference. BTC performance since January 2023. Source: TradingView. But BTC saw a boost over the weekend. Its price of $88,370, as of 2:10 pm ET Monday, was 2.6% higher than 24 hours prior. Regardless of whether Wave 4 has officially ended or not, Glover expects Wave 5 to lead to a BTC price rally to between $130,000 and $135,000 by Q1 2026. Taking the convo beyond specific price levels, I asked Glover about how bitcoin is perceived — as a safe-haven to some, and as a risk asset to others. “Even though we have deep liquidity, there’re not enough participants in [bitcoin] that have a complete understanding of what it is yet and have formed that view,” he said. Those believing BTC is “digital gold” (and an inflation hedge) might be bulking up their bitcoin ETF positions, for example, as the price has come down. Those fearing that BTC’s rise to roughly $109,000 was just the result of a “Trump pump” might be exiting in panic. “To me, [bitcoin] is digital gold, and once more and more traditional finance players get in, it will start tracking gold much more closely,” Glover added. Nearly one-fifth of surveyed financial advisers with no crypto allocation for clients planned to add that exposure in 2025 (more than double the previous year’s 8%). But those who haven’t committed yet will likely want to see BTC start moving up again before they do, Glover said. Those tend to be stickier positions. “If people have it in their portfolios, I don’t think they’re going to freak out if it’s correcting,” Glover said. “I think they’re going to say, ‘OK, it’s only 1% of my portfolio, I’m happy to hold that for the long term.’” Get the news in your inbox.

42281698,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142802,1742847047,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling the Future: Crypto Platforms Transform into Powerful Multi-Asset Investment Hubs,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-platforms-multi-asset-investment/,"The cryptocurrency landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, and if you’re invested in digital assets, you need to pay attention. Imagine a world where your crypto exchange isn’t just for trading Bitcoin or Ethereum, but a comprehensive platform mirroring traditional brokerage services, offering stocks, bonds, and a whole lot more. This isn’t a distant dream; it’s the rapidly evolving reality of crypto platforms . Why the Shift Towards Multi-Asset Investment? According to recent analysis from Bernstein, a prominent research firm, the crypto industry is experiencing a significant transformation. The buzzword? Integration. We’re moving away from siloed crypto exchanges and towards investment hubs that cater to a broader spectrum of financial needs. This evolution is driven by several factors: Easing Regulatory Pressure: As regulatory frameworks surrounding cryptocurrencies become clearer (though still evolving!), established crypto exchanges are finding more room to maneuver and expand their service offerings. Market Demand: Investors are increasingly seeking streamlined solutions. The desire to manage both traditional and digital assets within a single, user-friendly platform is a powerful driver. Growth Opportunities: The U.S. crypto derivatives market, in particular, is identified as a massive growth area. Platforms are vying to capture a piece of this lucrative pie. This isn’t just about adding more cryptocurrencies to trade; it’s a fundamental reimagining of what a crypto platform can be. Think of it as the convergence of Wall Street and the decentralized world of crypto. The Rise of Unified Brokerage: A New Era for Digital Assets The concept of unified brokerage is central to this transformation. Imagine managing your stock portfolio, trading crypto, and exploring other investment avenues all within the same platform. This is the vision analysts are painting, and exchanges are actively pursuing it. Companies like Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood are not just sitting idle; they are making strategic moves to become these all-encompassing financial powerhouses. Aggressive Acquisitions: The Growth Strategy One of the key strategies these platforms are employing is aggressive acquisitions. Instead of building every new service from scratch, they are acquiring companies that already have expertise and infrastructure in traditional finance areas. This allows them to rapidly expand their offerings and compete in the evolving landscape. This acquisition spree signals a clear intent: to become more than just crypto exchanges; they aim to become complete investment hubs . Examples of Platforms Leading the Charge Let’s look at some prominent examples of platforms actively evolving: Coinbase: Known for its user-friendly interface and strong regulatory compliance, Coinbase is strategically expanding its services beyond spot crypto trading. They are exploring derivatives, staking, and potentially traditional financial products to solidify their position as a leading multi-asset investment platform. Kraken: Another major player, Kraken, is also diversifying its offerings. With a reputation for security and a wide range of crypto assets, Kraken is likely to expand into traditional finance services to cater to the growing demand for unified platforms. Robinhood: While initially popular for stock trading, Robinhood has embraced crypto wholeheartedly. Their platform already offers both stocks and cryptocurrencies, positioning them as a frontrunner in the unified brokerage model. These are just a few examples, and the competition is heating up. Other exchanges and fintech companies are also vying for a piece of this expanding market. Benefits of Multi-Asset Investment Platforms What’s in it for you, the investor? The shift towards multi-asset investment platforms offers several compelling advantages: Convenience: Managing all your investments in one place simplifies your financial life. No more juggling multiple platforms and logins. Diversification: Access to a wider range of assets, including stocks, bonds, and crypto, makes portfolio diversification easier and more effective. Potentially Lower Fees: As platforms compete to become your primary investment hub, we may see more competitive fee structures and bundled services. Seamless Experience: Integrated platforms aim to provide a smoother, more intuitive user experience across different asset classes. Access to New Markets: For crypto-native investors, these platforms open doors to traditional financial markets, and vice versa. In essence, these platforms are designed to make investing more accessible, efficient, and comprehensive for everyone. Challenges and Considerations While the evolution towards unified brokerage models is exciting, there are challenges and considerations to keep in mind: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto and integrated platforms is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the services offered and how these platforms operate. Security Risks: Combining traditional and digital assets on a single platform could potentially create new security vulnerabilities. Robust security measures are paramount. Complexity: Navigating a platform offering a wide array of assets can be complex, especially for new investors. User-friendly interfaces and educational resources are crucial. Platform Reliability: As these platforms become central to investors’ financial lives, reliability and uptime are critical. Outages or technical issues could have significant consequences. These challenges are not insurmountable, but they require careful attention from both platforms and regulators to ensure the sustainable and secure growth of these digital assets hubs. Actionable Insights for Investors So, how can you, as an investor, navigate this evolving landscape and capitalize on the rise of multi-asset investment platforms? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in the crypto and traditional finance sectors. Follow industry news and analysis to understand the trends shaping these platforms. Research Platforms: Explore different platforms that are moving towards unified brokerage models. Compare their offerings, fees, security measures, and user experience. Diversify Wisely: Utilize the expanded asset offerings to build a well-diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Start Small: If you’re new to a particular asset class or platform, start with smaller investments and gradually increase your exposure as you gain confidence and experience. Prioritize Security: Always prioritize security. Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and be cautious of phishing attempts. By taking a proactive and informed approach, you can position yourself to benefit from the exciting opportunities presented by the convergence of crypto and traditional finance. The Future is Integrated: Embrace the Change The evolution of crypto platforms into multi-asset investment hubs is not just a trend; it’s a fundamental shift in the financial landscape. As regulatory clarity increases and technology advances, we can expect to see even more seamless integration between traditional and digital assets . The future of finance is likely to be characterized by these unified platforms, offering investors unprecedented convenience, diversification, and access to a wider range of investment opportunities. Embrace this change, stay informed, and position yourself to thrive in this exciting new era of finance.

The answer lies in a significant update from Ripple Labs, the company deeply intertwined with XRP. Ripple CEO’s Optimistic Announcement: Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, recently hinted at a major development – the SEC may be planning to drop its ongoing lawsuit against Ripple. This lawsuit has been a dark cloud hanging over XRP for years, impacting its price and market sentiment. The Lawsuit’s Shadow: The SEC lawsuit, alleging that Ripple’s XRP sales constituted unregistered securities offerings, has been a major hurdle for XRP adoption and institutional interest. Any indication of this lawsuit being resolved positively is a massive win for XRP. ETF Hopes Ignite: Garlinghouse’s announcement has acted as a shot of adrenaline, injecting fresh hope into the possibility of an XRP ETF . For many, the lawsuit was seen as a primary obstacle to ETF approval. With potential resolution on the horizon, the path for an ETF seems clearer. Think of an ETF as a wrapper that makes it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to an asset without directly holding it. An XRP ETF would allow investors to invest in XRP through traditional stock exchanges, potentially opening the floodgates to institutional money and broader market participation. Ripple vs. SEC: How Does the Lawsuit Update Fuel XRP ETF Optimism? The long-standing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC has been a central narrative in the crypto world. Let’s understand why developments in the Ripple SEC lawsuit are so crucial for the XRP ETF approval narrative. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple has been a major point of contention, arguing that XRP should be classified as a security. This classification has significant regulatory implications and has created uncertainty around XRP’s legal status in the US. A positive resolution or dismissal of this lawsuit would: Remove Regulatory Uncertainty: Clearing up the regulatory ambiguity surrounding XRP would be a major boon. It would provide clarity to exchanges, institutions, and investors, making them more comfortable with XRP. Boost Institutional Confidence: Institutions are often wary of investing in assets with unclear regulatory standing. A resolution in Ripple’s favor could significantly increase institutional interest in XRP, paving the way for ETF adoption. Set a Precedent: A favorable outcome for Ripple could set a precedent for other crypto projects facing similar regulatory scrutiny, potentially fostering a more innovation-friendly environment within the US. While Garlinghouse’s announcement is encouraging, it’s important to note that the situation is still developing. However, the market’s reaction, as seen on Polymarket, suggests a strong belief that the tide is turning in Ripple’s favor, directly impacting the prospects of an XRP ETF . What’s the Timeline for a Decision on XRP ETF Applications? Excitement is building, but when can we realistically expect a decision on these much-anticipated crypto ETF products? The SEC is currently reviewing five applications for spot XRP ETFs. Here’s what we know about the timeline: The SEC has a structured process for reviewing ETF applications, and the current timeline points towards a decision by mid-October. While the exact dates can fluctuate, this timeframe provides a clear window for potential approval. Here’s a breakdown: Key Factor Details Number of Applications Five XRP ETF applications are currently under SEC review. Decision Deadline Expected by mid-October 2024. SEC Review Process A thorough process involving legal and market analysis to ensure investor protection and market integrity. The companies vying to launch these groundbreaking crypto ETF products include major players in the financial industry. While specific applicant names weren’t mentioned in the original content, it’s safe to assume reputable financial firms are involved, further adding credibility to the ETF prospects. Could XRP ETF Approval Unleash Billions in Inflows? If the XRP ETF approval indeed comes to fruition, what kind of impact could it have on the market? Analysts at JPMorgan are projecting potentially massive inflows. Their estimates are quite eye-opening: JPMorgan analysts foresee up to $8 billion flowing into crypto ETF products during the first year of trading, assuming approval is granted. This is a significant influx of capital that could have a transformative effect on the XRP market. Let’s consider the potential implications: Price Surge Potential: Increased demand driven by ETF inflows could lead to a substantial surge in XRP’s price. Basic economics dictates that higher demand with limited supply typically pushes prices upwards. Market Capitalization Growth: Billions of dollars entering the XRP market would significantly boost its market capitalization, potentially elevating XRP’s position in the cryptocurrency rankings. Mainstream Adoption: An ETF makes XRP more accessible to mainstream investors, including institutional investors who may have been hesitant to invest directly in cryptocurrencies. This broader accessibility could drive further adoption and growth. While $8 billion is a projection, it highlights the immense potential impact of an XRP ETF . The actual inflows will depend on various market factors and investor appetite, but the anticipation alone is already generating significant excitement. What are the Potential Hurdles for XRP Despite ETF Excitement? Despite the soaring optimism surrounding XRP ETF approval odds , it’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective. While the outlook is undeniably positive, some factors could still temper XRP’s price performance. Broader economic factors and market conditions can significantly influence cryptocurrency prices, including XRP. It’s important to remember that the crypto market doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Here are some potential headwinds: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical events can all impact investor sentiment and risk appetite, potentially affecting crypto markets. Regulatory Landscape: While the Ripple lawsuit shows signs of potential resolution, the overall regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains evolving and can introduce unexpected challenges. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. Even with ETF approval, XRP’s price can still experience significant fluctuations due to market sentiment and unforeseen events. Therefore, while the XRP ETF approval is a major positive catalyst, a holistic view that considers broader market dynamics is essential. Optimism should be tempered with a realistic understanding of the inherent risks and uncertainties in the crypto space. Conclusion: Is the XRP ETF Dream About to Become Reality? The surge in XRP ETF approval odds to 87% on Polymarket is a clear indicator of growing market confidence. Fueled by positive developments in the Ripple-SEC lawsuit and the anticipation of potential ETF approvals by mid-October, the XRP community has reason to be excited. The prospect of billions of dollars flowing into XRP through ETFs is tantalizing, and could potentially reshape XRP’s market trajectory. However, it’s vital to remember that the crypto market is dynamic and influenced by numerous factors. While the current signs are overwhelmingly positive, a balanced approach that considers both the opportunities and potential challenges is always prudent. Keep a close watch on the SEC’s decisions in the coming months – they could mark a pivotal moment for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.

This article dives into the price trends and potential of standout tokens like BONK , SHIB , and PEPE . Discover which coins are primed for a surge and could capture the market's attention once more. Bonk (BONK) Faces Volatility with Mixed Performance Across Periods Bonk dropped 13.14% over the past month and slipped 27.93% in the last six months, despite a 28.61% rally over the past week. Past price movements reveal sharp volatility and a struggle to sustain upward momentum over the longer term. This coin experienced a rapid burst of optimism before falling back into bearish pressures, marking its inconsistent performance during recent trading sessions. Current price stands near a resistance level of $0.00003 and a firm support at $0.00000348. A quick surge in the week sparks hope for a recovery, yet the overall trend remains downwards. Traders may target a move above $0.00003 to challenge $0.000044, while a fallback to support suggests a potential bounce, urging caution within these boundaries. Shiba Inu Market Snapshot: Past Declines and Key Levels Ahead Shiba Inu registered a 13.01% drop over the last month and an 11.60% decline over the past six months. Price movements ranged between $0.0000106 and $0.0000182, reflecting a period of steady downward pressure. The data hints at ongoing seller influence and a lack of robust upward momentum over these timeframes, indicating a market in a corrective phase. Current trading sees the coin operating within the $0.0000106 to $0.0000182 band. Support appears near $0.0000073, while resistance lies at $0.0000226 and further out at $0.0000302. Although indicators suggest a neutral tone, cautious range-bound trading around these levels may prove worthwhile as the market waits for a definitive directional breakout. Pepe Altcoin Eyes Key Price Levels Amid Recent Volatility Pepe experienced a month-long decline of about 16% amid a half-year drop nearing 11%. A sharp weekly surge of around 15% marked a brief period of recovery. Price activity over these periods shows a coin that has been trading on a rollercoaster path, oscillating between downward pressure and short-lived rallies. Historical movements hint at a market that has faced bearish challenges with intermittent buyer interest. Current trading sees Pepe bouncing between approximately $0.00000535 and $0.00001239. A key resistance level at $0.00001686 and support near $0.00000278 frame the price action. The balanced RSI and mixed oscillator signals point to a neutral trend, suggesting cautious trading entries near support and targets toward resistance. Conclusion BONK , SHIB , and PEPE show strong potential as the market rebounds. Each of these coins has unique appeal and patterns that attract enthusiasts. BONK’s prices reflect solid investor confidence. SHIB continues to benefit from a robust community. PEPE's recent performance indicates growing interest. Together, these trends suggest a positive outlook for memecoins in general. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This rally mirrored the gains seen across the broader cryptocurrency market as traders began to expect reduced risks of an economic downturn. The growing risk appetite can also be seen among memecoins, several of which rallied by 12% or more since March 23. Outside of the broad market rally, SOL has its own merits, including a rise in network activity and the direct involvement of US President Donald Trump with the memecoin market . Additionally, growing interest from top traders on exchanges and the increasing likelihood of a spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval suggest further potential for SOL’s price growth. SOL/USD (green) vs. crypto market cap (orange). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Despite the recent rally, SOL has underperformed the broader crypto market by 23.7% over the past two months. This weakness is linked to a 93% decline in Solana network fees during that period. The decline likely began with traders’ disappointment in the memecoin sector but gradually affected the entire decentralized application (DApps) market. SOL still trades 52% below its all-time high Traders now question whether the selling was an overreaction, as SOL is currently trading 52% below its all-time high of $295. This comes despite Solana remaining the second-largest blockchain in terms of total value locked (TVL) and ranking third in onchain volumes. For comparison, BNB is trading 20% below its all-time high, and XRP is 28% below its peak. Blockchains ranked by total value locked (TVL), USD. Source: DefiLlama While Tron and BNB Chain provide competition in terms of onchain volumes, deposits in Solana network’s smart contracts are valued at $6.8 billion. In third place, BNB Chain holds 21% less TVL, with $5.4 billion. Key highlights on Solana include the Jito liquid staking solution, Kamino lending and liquidity platform, and the Jupiter decentralized exchange. The fees on the Solana network are now higher than those on the Ethereum base layer, surpassing $1 million per day. More importantly, Solana's revenue has recently reached its highest levels in two weeks. While still far from the levels seen two months ago, the increase in Solana network activity suggests that the bottom may have been reached as the numbers continue to improve steadily. Solana network daily fees, USD. Source: DefilLlama As a comparison, Ethereum accrued less than $350,000 in fees on March 23, leading to an increase in ETH supply as the built-in burn mechanism failed to offset weak blockchain activity. Solana, on the other hand, offers a 7.7% native staking reward rate, surpassing the equivalent 5.1% inflation rate, according to StakingRewards data. Solana ETF decision nears while Trump tweet boosts memecoin momentum Despite SOL’s price weakness, top traders on Binance have increased their leveraged long (bull) positions on SOL, according to CoinGlass data. Binance top traders' long-to-short SOL ratio. Source: CoinGlass The long-to-short ratio among top traders on Binance surged to 2.40 on March 23, its highest level in over two months. Part of the excitement can be attributed to the anticipation of the spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the US. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to issue its final verdict before the end of the year, according to Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital asset research. Although success is not guaranteed, the eventual spot Solana ETF approval would set SOL apart from its competitors, adding legitimacy to the asset, especially among institutional investors. Another source of momentum came from a weekend social post by President Trump , which explicitly mentioned the TRUMP memecoin and helped to create a buzz in the sector. In the Solana ecosystem, Fartcoin gained 15% on March 24, Dogwifhat (WIF) rallied 12%, and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) traded up by 12%. Ultimately, SOL has significant potential for higher gains, given the network’s TVL and fees, especially in comparison to competitors, along with bullish positioning from whales using leverage.

Qubetics , Sonic, and Bitcoin Cash are three coins that are turning heads as they bring something fresh to the table. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to hold, these coins should definitely be on your radar. Now, when people talk about Bitcoin Cash, they often mention its efficiency and the focus on peer-to-peer transactions. But let’s be honest, it’s not the only contender in town. The rise of newer players like Sonic and Qubetics is forcing the old guard to innovate faster, making the competition in the crypto world hotter than ever. In this article, let’s take an in-depth look at these three digital assets, diving into the latest news, price predictions, and what makes each one special. Spoiler: Qubetics ($TICS) might just be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. What sets Qubetics apart from its predecessors is its ability to solve real-world problems that many older blockchain technologies have struggled with. From enabling seamless interoperability for businesses and professionals to delivering a streamlined user experience, Qubetics is geared to address gaps in the market. But let’s get into that soon—first, let’s break down each coin individually and see what makes them tick. Qubetics: The Future of Interoperability and Blockchain Solutions Qubetics ($TICS) has been generating a lot of buzz, especially with its presale in full swing. Currently in its 27th stage, Qubetics has already sold over 503 million tokens to more than 23,700 holders and raised over $15.4 million. The crypto presale price stands at $0.1300 per token, making this the perfect opportunity to jump in before it goes mainstream. What really stands out about Qubetics is its focus on interoperability. Unlike many other blockchain networks, which are siloed and limit cross-chain communication, Qubetics aims to create a more connected and unified digital finance ecosystem. Whether you’re a business, a professional, or an individual, Qubetics makes it easier than ever to leverage blockchain technology. By supporting multiple chains and providing a seamless user experience, it opens up new possibilities for everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to supply chain management. Qubetics: Solving Crypto’s Biggest Issues with Scalability, Speed, and Security Tackling Crypto Challenges: Qubetics is addressing longstanding issues in the crypto world, including scalability, transaction speed, and security. Upcoming Mainnet Launch: The imminent mainnet launch promises exciting prospects for $TICS token holders. Massive Potential Returns: A $TICS token at $1 represents a 669% ROI. A price of $5 post-presale would mean an astounding 3745% ROI. Some analysts predict a $TICS price of $15 after the mainnet launch, offering a staggering 11,436% ROI. With all these factors combined, it’s no wonder Qubetics is being hailed as one of the best cryptos to hold for the future. Its focus on interoperability and real-world use cases makes it a strong contender in the rapidly evolving blockchain space. Sonic Blockchain Sees Growth with New Token and Stablecoin Surge Sonic, an advanced blockchain platform developed by Sonic Labs, continues to make significant strides in the cryptocurrency space. In January 2025, Sonic introduced its native token, Sonic S (S), replacing Fantom’s FTM token at a 1:1 conversion rate. This transition aimed to enhance the platform’s performance and interoperability with major blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum. The Sonic S token was successfully listed on 13 major exchanges, including Binance and Bybit, facilitating seamless integration and trading for users. ​ By March 6, 2025, the total value of stablecoins on the Sonic platform surpassed $250 million, reflecting a 25% increase from the previous month. This growth underscores the rising early buyers confidence in the Sonic ecosystem. Additionally, the platform’s trading volume and active user engagement have seen substantial growth, indicating a bullish sentiment towards Sonic’s future prospects. Bitcoin Cash Sees Surge Ahead of 2024 Halving Event Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continues to garner attention within the cryptocurrency community. On March 5, 2025, analysts observed a significant surge in BCH’s value, with a notable 18.54% increase within a 24-hour period. This surge has led experts to predict that BCH could reach up to $4,100 within the next 30 to 90 days, drawing parallels to its remarkable performance in late 2017. ​ In the lead-up to its halving event on April 4, 2024, Bitcoin Cash experienced substantial growth. Between February 4 and March 31, 2024, BCH’s price surged by 172%, reaching a three-year peak above $600. This surge was accompanied by the addition of over 230,000 new BCH wallets, indicating a significant influx of participants ahead of the halving event. Interoperability: The Key to Unlocking Blockchain’s Potential When it comes to the future of blockchain technology, interoperability is everything. The ability for different blockchain networks to communicate with one another opens up a world of possibilities. It allows for cross-chain transactions, seamless integration of decentralized applications (dApps), and the creation of a truly interconnected blockchain ecosystem. Qubetics is leading the charge when it comes to interoperability. By building a platform that connects multiple blockchain networks, Qubetics makes it easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals to move assets and data between different ecosystems. This ability to bridge the gap between otherwise isolated chains is crucial for the growth of decentralized finance and the broader blockchain industry. In the coming years, interoperability will become a key factor in determining which blockchain projects succeed and which ones fade into obscurity. With its focus on creating a more connected digital economy, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in this space. Conclusion The world of cryptocurrency is full of opportunities, but it’s also packed with competition. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to hold in 2025, it’s hard to ignore the rising stars like Qubetics and Sonic, alongside established players like Bitcoin Cash. Qubetics, with its focus on interoperability and real-world use cases, stands out as a forward-thinking solution that addresses the limitations of existing blockchain technologies. Sonic, on the other hand, brings speed and scalability to the forefront, while Bitcoin Cash continues to serve as a reliable choice for peer-to-peer transactions. As the market evolves, the future of crypto will depend on innovation, scalability, and the ability to meet the demands of real-world use cases. Qubetics seems to have cracked the code on all three, making it one of the best cryptos to hold for those looking to get ahead of the curve.

The ever-unpredictable world of international trade has just been thrown another curveball. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, known for his assertive trade policies, is back in the headlines, and this time, it’s with a potentially seismic threat aimed at Venezuela’s vital energy sector. According to a post on financial news platform X by Walter Bloomberg, Trump has declared his intention to slap a hefty 25% tariff on any nation daring to purchase oil or gas from Venezuela. Let’s dive deep into what this could mean for global energy markets and the intricate web of international relations. Trump’s Tariff Threat: A Shockwave for Venezuela Oil and Gas The announcement, delivered via social media, is characteristically blunt and impactful. A 25% tariff is not a mere slap on the wrist; it’s a significant economic barrier designed to deter international trade. But why Venezuela , and why now? To understand this, we need to unpack the geopolitical context and the history of U.S.-Venezuela relations. Targeting Venezuela’s Lifeline: Venezuela’s economy is heavily reliant on its oil and gas reserves. These exports are a crucial source of revenue for the nation, which has been grappling with economic hardship and political instability for years. Escalating Pressure: This tariff threat appears to be a continuation of the U.S.’s policy of applying pressure on the Venezuelan government. Previous administrations have also used sanctions and economic measures to influence political outcomes in Venezuela . Global Repercussions: The implications of this tariff extend far beyond just Venezuela . Countries that currently import oil and gas from Venezuela will need to reassess their energy strategies, potentially leading to shifts in global energy flows and pricing. This move is reminiscent of Trump’s previous trade tactics, which often involved imposing tariffs to achieve specific political and economic objectives. But what are the potential benefits and challenges of this particular tariff threat? Navigating the Complex Web: Benefits and Challenges of the Venezuela Tariff While the stated aim might be to exert pressure on the Venezuelan government, the reality of implementing such a tariff is far more complex. Let’s break down the potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits: Increased Pressure on Venezuela: The most direct intended benefit is to further squeeze the Venezuelan economy, potentially weakening the current regime and pushing for political change. Shifting Global Energy Demand: By making Venezuelan oil and gas less attractive, the U.S. could be aiming to redirect global demand towards other energy producers, potentially benefiting U.S. allies or domestic energy production. Asserting U.S. Influence: Such a bold move reinforces the U.S.’s role as a major player in global trade and its willingness to use economic tools to achieve foreign policy goals. Significant Challenges: Economic Impact on Importing Nations: Countries that rely on Venezuelan oil and gas could face higher energy costs and supply disruptions. This could strain international relations and potentially lead to retaliatory measures. Risk of a Global Trade War: Imposing tariffs can be a slippery slope. If other nations perceive this as aggressive protectionism, it could escalate into a broader trade war , harming global economic stability. Circumventing Tariffs: History has shown that tariffs can be circumvented through various means, such as rerouting shipments or finding loopholes in regulations. The effectiveness of the tariff in truly isolating Venezuelan energy exports remains to be seen. Humanitarian Concerns: Further economic hardship in Venezuela could exacerbate the existing humanitarian crisis, potentially leading to increased migration and regional instability. Examples and Precedents: Learning from Past Trade Disputes Trump’s presidency was marked by several high-profile trade disputes, most notably the trade war with China. We can draw some parallels and lessons from these past experiences: Trade Dispute Key Features Outcomes Relevance to Venezuela Tariff U.S.-China Trade War Imposition of tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods; retaliatory tariffs from China. Significant economic disruption for both countries; limited long-term changes in trade imbalances; some sectors benefited while others suffered. Demonstrates the potential for economic damage and escalation in a trade war scenario. Highlights the difficulty in achieving clear-cut victories through tariffs. Steel and Aluminum Tariffs Global tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum imports, citing national security concerns. Increased costs for industries relying on steel and aluminum; retaliatory tariffs from allies; challenged by international trade bodies. Illustrates how tariffs can impact industries beyond the targeted sector and strain relationships with allies. Shows the potential for legal challenges and international opposition. These examples underscore that while tariffs can be a powerful tool, they are also blunt instruments with wide-ranging and often unintended consequences. The proposed tariff on Venezuelan oil and gas needs to be considered within this historical context. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Global Market? For businesses, investors, and policymakers, Trump’s tariff threat on Venezuela presents several key considerations: Energy Market Volatility: Expect increased volatility in oil and gas prices. Traders should closely monitor market reactions and adjust strategies accordingly. Supply Chain Adjustments: Companies reliant on Venezuelan energy supplies need to explore alternative sources and diversify their supply chains to mitigate potential disruptions. Geopolitical Risk Assessment: This move elevates geopolitical risk. Businesses operating in regions affected by U.S.-Venezuela relations or broader trade war dynamics should reassess their risk exposure and contingency plans. Policy Monitoring: Stay informed about developments in U.S. trade policy and international responses. The situation is fluid and subject to rapid change. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Global Trade Tensions? Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 25% tariff on countries buying oil and gas from Venezuela is a bold move that has sent ripples through global energy markets and international political circles. While the intended impact might be to pressure Venezuela and reshape global energy flows, the reality is likely to be far more nuanced and complex. The risk of escalating trade tensions, the potential for economic disruption, and the humanitarian implications are all significant factors that need careful consideration. As the world watches to see if this threat materializes into policy, one thing is clear: the saga of global trade and geopolitics is far from over, and further volatility is almost certainly on the horizon.

42284714,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=699060,1742851228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42284714.jpeg,Victim loses $330K to phishing scammers 408 days after signing approval,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/victim-loses-330k-after-phishing-approval/,"According to a report from Scam Sniffer, a Web3 anti-scam platform, one person just got drained of $330K because of a phishing approval, one that they interacted with more than a year ago. According to Etherscan, the victim lost a total of $329,743 in AAVE tokens to the exploit. One of the most peculiar facts about this case is that the phishing approval was signed 408 days prior, on February 10, 2024, at 12:51 AM UTC, giving the scammer access to the victim’s wallet. The theft did not occur until March 24, 2025, at 12:35 AM UTC, when the attacker transferred 1,999.23 AAVE tokens, valued at $329,743, in a single transaction. Prior to the theft, the targeted wallet held $527,498 in AAVE. By the time the hacker was done, the victim had only $197,755 left. The victim signed the phishing approval signed 408 days ago. Source: Etherscan The wallet contained other assets, including LPT. However, the hacker only moved the victim’s AAVE tokens, as it was the only token targeted in the transfer. The hacker is yet to be identified, and the victim has limited options to recover the stolen funds as of now. Approval phishing scams are a serious threat to crypto holders According to a report from Chainalysis, the crypto space has lost about $1 billion to approval phishing scams since May 2021, with $374 million lost in 2023 alone. While approval phishing as a scamming tactic has been around for many years, scammers historically targeted crypto users via the spread of fake crypto apps. Their techniques have become even more effective as the space evolves. Usually, scammers trick victims into sending them cryptocurrency via a phony investment opportunity or by impersonating somebody else. However, where approval phishing scam is concerned, the scammer tricks the user into signing a malicious blockchain transaction that gives the scammer’s address approval to spend specific tokens from the victim’s wallet. This gives the scammer access to drain the victim’s address of those tokens at will. Generally, approval phishers send the victim’s funds to a separate wallet from the one granted approval to make transactions on the victim’s behalf. The on-chain pattern typically sees the victim address sign a transaction approving the second address to spend its funds, after which the second address, an approved spender address, executes the transaction to move the funds to a new destination address. Principal security researcher for Metamask, Taylor Monahan (aka @tayvano_ ) is one of those tracking romance scam-style approval phishing with the custom Dune Analytics dashboar d . Taylor Monahan shared an example of a phishing email. Source: @tayvano_ (X/Twitter) Victims of these romance scammers have reportedly lost approximately $1 billion to approval phishing scams since May 2021. It’s crucial to note that the $1 billion total is an estimate based on on-chain patterns. Some of it could represent the laundering of funds already controlled by the scammers. This is because romance scams go notoriously underreported, and the analysis that yielded those results began from a limited set of reported instances. It is believed that the vast majority of approval phishing scams are carried out by a few very successful actors, and addressing the problem can be done in various ways, from user education to employing pattern recognition tactics.

Key Takeaways: Uyeda and four other SEC commissioners held a private vote on whether Musk should face legal action over his late Twitter stock disclosure. The SEC officially sued Musk on January 14 for failing to disclose his acquisition of over 5% of Twitter stock back in 2022. The SEC has eased its enforcement approach to crypto, dropping lawsuits against companies like Ripple, OpenSea, and Coinbase. According to the article , Uyeda and four other commissioners from the federal regulator held a “closed-door” vote over whether Musk should face legal repercussions for violating U.S. securities law. SEC Commissioners Held Vote On Suing Elon Musk Uyeda’s fellow commissioners, including Hester Pierce, all voted for litigation against the Tesla CEO, whereas Uyeda strayed from the pack. The SEC, which had been investigating Musk since 2022, formally filed a lawsuit against him on January 14. “Musk failed to timely file with the SEC a beneficial ownership report disclosing his acquisition of more than five percent of the outstanding shares of Twitter’s common stock in March 2022, in violation of the federal securities laws,” the SEC complaint states . “As a result, Musk was able to continue purchasing shares at artificially low prices, allowing him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his beneficial ownership report was due,” the lawsuit continues. The SEC Changes Course Under Trump Administration Musk’s relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked a slew of public speculation, with the controversial politician tapping the SpaceX founder to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). DOGE, which was designed to cut U.S. regulatory practices and government, has also garnered criticism for its role in the recent upheaval surrounding massive federal worker layoffs. The SEC is facing its own exodus of employees, with reports indicating that hundreds of the commission’s workers are set to depart the agency. Under the Trump administration, the SEC has significantly scaled back its regulation-by-enforcement approach to the crypto sector as a whole. Highly-publicized lawsuits against key players in the crypto industry , including Ripple, OpenSea, and Coinbase, have since been dropped by the federal regulator. It remains to be seen if Musk’s will be one of them. FAQs Why did the SEC sue Elon Musk? The SEC allegedly sued Musk for failing to disclose his acquisition of over 5% of Twitter (now X) stock in a timely manner. What was Mark Uyeda’s stance on the lawsuit? Uyeda was reportedly the only SEC commissioner to vote against suing Musk, breaking from his colleagues in the federal regulator’s closed-door vote. How does this lawsuit relate to Musk’s role in the Trump administration? Musk was appointed by President Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a move that has sparked speculation about his influence on regulatory decisions.

According to data from Etherscan and BscScan, the project launched the World Liberty Financial USD (USD1) token in early March. Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao noted the project’s smart contract was deployed on the BNB Chain and Ethereum, while World Liberty said the stablecoin was “not currently tradeable.” The USD1 stablecoin launch comes as US lawmakers consider passing the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS, Act. The bill moved out of the Senate Banking Committee on March 13 and is expected to be taken up for a full floor vote soon. Bo Hines, the executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, said he expected the GENIUS bill on Trump’s desk by June. Former Binance CEO acknowledging the USD1 launch. Source: Changpeng Zhao Since the launch of the platform in September 2024, many aspects of World Liberty’s intentions have been shrouded in secrecy. The project’s website notes that the US President and some of his family members control 60% of the company’s equity interests. As of March 14, World Liberty has completed two public token sales , netting the company a combined $550 million. The launch of the stablecoin on the BNB Chain came amid reports that the Trump family held talks with Binance about acquiring a stake in the crypto exchange and separately granting a presidential pardon to Zhao. CZ has denied reports of a deal between Binance.US and Trump and a pardon. Conflicts of interest in Trump’s crypto ventures? Before the project’s first public token sale in October 2024, World Liberty faced scrutiny from US policymakers, accusing Trump of conflicts of interest while running for office. Days after Trump won the US presidential election, Tron Founder Justin Sun announced he would invest $30 million in World Liberty, likely leading to his position as an adviser to the firm. After Trump took office on Jan. 20 and Commissioner Mark Uyeda began leading the US Securities and Exchange Commission as acting chair, the regulator asked a federal court to pause its case against Sun “to explore a potential resolution.” Sun and three of his companies faced allegations from the SEC of selling unregistered securities. Other executives at crypto companies who backed Trump and Republicans in the 2024 elections — some with financial contributions — including from Coinbase and Ripple, have since seen their SEC enforcement actions dropped under Uyeda. Related: Trump becomes first US sitting president to speak at a crypto conference World Liberty’s launch comes as the stablecoin market continues to grow. Online analytics platforms Artemis and Dune showed that the number of active stablecoin wallets increased by more than 50% from February 2024 to February 2025. The total market capitalization of stablecoins also surpassed $200 billion in January, with Tether ( USDT ) and USDC remaining two of the most popular ones on the market.

The organization is calling the reserve a proof of concept for a payment ecosystem. House of Doge purchased the 10 million DOGE, which is priced at around $1.83 million at the time of writing. The reserve will guarantee liquidity, rather than acting as a hedge, as most strategic reserves do. The Doge reserve will provide liquidity “By maintaining a reserve, we can bridge the gap between transaction processing times and real-world usability, making Dogecoin extremely practical for everyday purchases,” House of Doge board member-elect Michael Galloro said in a statement. “Dogecoin’s inflationary model ensures ongoing liquidity and supports everyday use as a true medium of exchange,” the statement continued. House of Doge plans to offer merchant incentives and cashback offers to users, and in the coming months, strategic partners will demonstrate the scalability of the DOGE ecosystem, while maintaining the fast settlement time. The organization’s website added that it will provide consultation, education, and funding for research and development. Corporate interest in DOGE is lively Dogecoin Foundation director Timothy Stebbing said in a lengthy X post in February that the foundation had rejected offers of millions of dollars from corporations looking for partnerships because their interest in DOGE was not sincere enough. In November, the foundation was introduced to “people with decades of experience at the very top of the American private investment and enterprise world” who wanted to advance the adoption of DOGE. The people are household names in the United States, Stebbing said. Stebbing did not name the individuals but said owners and executives of major league sports teams, government officials, and CEOs of global food and hospitality companies were present at the November meeting. Stebbing mentioned baseball, football, and hockey teams that were prepared to accept DOGE at their events, government agencies willing to accept DOGE for various payments, and restaurant chains and university cafeterias eager to use the token. The result of those introductions was the creation of House of Doge as a commercialization partner under a five-year contract. With that contract in place, the foundation can more than double its development team with new senior engineers and hold hackathons and other promotional activities. Since then, it has become known that vice chairman of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team Roger Rai has joined the House of Doge board. Sarosh Mistry, president and CEO of food services giant Sodexo North America is also a board member . The DOGE community already has things to do House of Doge and the Dogecoin Foundation made a deal for IndyCar driver DeFrancesco and the Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing company to wrap a car and DeFrancesco’s helmet in a DOGE design. It is possible to buy a car with DOGE, Stebbing pointed out. As a matter of fact, DOGE already offers numerous possibilities. Japanese real estate firm Open House Group accepts DOGE for property purchases, for example. By the time of Stebbin’s announcement in February, House of Doge has already raised millions of dollars with the goal of assembling 10,000 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining machines this year to create the largest DOGE mining operation in North America. The DOGE mined in that operation will go into the Official Reserve. There will be a mining pool that community members will be able to contribute hash power to.

The Litecoin Foundation just dropped some exciting news that’s set to simplify how millions of non-U.S. users interact with Litecoin. Imagine managing your crypto right where you chat with friends – well, that’s becoming a reality. Let’s dive into how Litecoin Telegram Wallet integration is making waves. Revolutionizing Crypto Access: Litecoin Telegram Wallet Integration In a recent announcement that sent ripples through the crypto community, the Litecoin Foundation declared on X (formerly Twitter) that Litecoin (LTC) is now officially part of the Telegram Wallet ecosystem. This isn’t just a minor update; it’s a significant step towards mainstream crypto adoption. As of March 24th, non-U.S. Telegram users can now directly access Litecoin within their favorite messaging app. This integration is powered by the Toncoin team, known for maintaining Telegram’s internal crypto wallet. But what does this really mean for you? Let’s break it down: Seamless Access: Forget juggling multiple apps. Now, your Litecoin transactions are just a few taps away within Telegram. Non-U.S. Focus: This feature is specifically designed for Telegram’s vast user base outside the United States, opening up crypto opportunities in numerous regions. Simplified Transactions: The wallet allows you to effortlessly buy Litecoin , sell, and trade LTC directly within the Telegram app. Backed by Toncoin Team: The reliability of the Toncoin team, who are maintaining the wallet, adds a layer of trust and efficiency to this integration. Why Telegram Crypto Wallet Matters? Telegram’s foray into the crypto wallet space is not new, but adding Litecoin to the mix is a strategic move. The Telegram Crypto Wallet already supports major players like Bitcoin, Toncoin, and USDT. With over 100 million users, Telegram’s existing wallet infrastructure is robust and ready for widespread adoption. This integration leverages Telegram’s massive user base to bring crypto functionalities to a mainstream audience. Think about it – millions of people who are already comfortable using Telegram can now explore the world of cryptocurrency without needing to navigate complex exchanges or unfamiliar platforms. Consider these points about the impact of Telegram’s existing crypto wallet: Feature Details User Base Over 100 million users already have access to Telegram’s wallet. Supported Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC), Toncoin, USDT, and now Litecoin (LTC). Accessibility Integrated directly within the Telegram app, making it incredibly accessible. Ease of Use Designed for simplicity, catering to both crypto novices and experienced users. The Benefits of LTC Integration: What’s in it for You? The integration of LTC Integration into the Telegram Wallet unlocks a plethora of benefits for users, especially those outside the U.S. Let’s explore some key advantages: Enhanced Accessibility for Litecoin: Making Litecoin available within Telegram significantly increases its accessibility. Users who might have been hesitant to engage with crypto due to complexity can now easily get started with LTC within a familiar environment. Convenience at Your Fingertips: Imagine buying, selling, or trading Litecoin without ever leaving your chat app. This level of convenience is unparalleled and can significantly boost crypto adoption. Lower Barriers to Entry: For newcomers to crypto, the Telegram Wallet provides a user-friendly on-ramp. The familiar interface of Telegram reduces the intimidation factor often associated with crypto exchanges. Potential for Increased LTC Adoption: By making Litecoin more accessible to millions of Telegram users, this integration has the potential to drive up demand and adoption of LTC. Non-US Crypto Access: A Global Opportunity This move is particularly impactful for Non-US Users . While the crypto landscape in the U.S. faces regulatory complexities, Telegram’s focus on non-U.S. users opens up significant opportunities in other global markets. Many regions are showing increasing interest in cryptocurrency, and this integration provides a seamless way for users in these areas to participate in the crypto economy. This strategic focus on non-U.S. markets can be seen as a calculated step to tap into the growing global demand for crypto assets, particularly in regions where mobile-first solutions are highly favored. Consider the global impact: Tapping into Emerging Markets: Many emerging economies are seeing rapid crypto adoption. Telegram’s reach in these markets can be a catalyst for further growth. Bypassing Regulatory Hurdles: Focusing on non-U.S. users allows Telegram to navigate some of the regulatory challenges present in the United States. Catering to a Mobile-First Audience: In many parts of the world, mobile phones are the primary means of internet access. Telegram’s mobile-centric approach aligns perfectly with these markets. Global Crypto Inclusion: This integration promotes greater financial inclusion by making crypto more accessible to a global audience, regardless of their location. What’s Next for Telegram Litecoin Wallet? While the current integration is a significant leap forward, there’s more to come. Currently, external transfers are not supported, meaning you can transact within the Telegram Wallet ecosystem, but you can’t yet send Litecoin to external wallets or receive LTC from them. However, the Litecoin Foundation and the Toncoin team have confirmed that external transfers are planned for the future. This upcoming feature will further enhance the utility of the Telegram Litecoin Wallet , making it a more versatile and complete crypto solution. The promise of external transfers hints at a future where Telegram Wallet could become a fully functional and widely used crypto wallet, rivaling dedicated crypto exchange apps in terms of user convenience. Looking ahead, we can anticipate: External Transfers: The most anticipated feature – enabling users to send and receive LTC to and from external wallets. Expanded Functionality: Future updates might include more advanced trading features, staking options, or integration with other DeFi services. Wider Cryptocurrency Support: While Litecoin is a significant addition, Telegram Wallet may continue to add support for other popular cryptocurrencies in the future. Enhanced Security Features: As the wallet evolves, expect continuous improvements in security to protect user funds and data. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Crypto Mainstream The integration of Litecoin into the Telegram Wallet is more than just an update – it’s a revolutionary step towards making cryptocurrency more accessible and user-friendly for millions worldwide. By leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and the reliability of the Toncoin team, this move significantly lowers the barrier to entry for buying Litecoin and engaging with the crypto market. For non-U.S. users, this integration opens up a world of opportunities within a familiar and convenient platform. As we look forward to future updates like external transfers, it’s clear that Telegram is positioning itself as a major player in the crypto space, potentially reshaping how people interact with digital currencies on a global scale. Keep an eye on this space – the future of crypto accessibility is unfolding right within your chat app!

According to analysts, Ethereum price may be exiting the “manipulation phase” — the final phase before an upward expansion, based on classic Wyckoff accumulation patterns. This perspective aligns with recent movements, where Ethereum has retested the $2,100 level, nearing the crucial $2,200 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Set to Rally With Upcoming Expansion Phase Crypto market analyst Ted Pillows has outlined a three-phase model in Ethereum’s recent price behavior: accumulation, manipulation, and expansion. Ethereum has spent nearly a year in the accumulation phase. During this time, the price remained in a narrow range, indicating limited retail activity and potential institutional accumulation. The current phase, described as manipulation, has been marked by volatility and sudden dips. These moves push out weaker positions before a possible price expansion. Ted’s analysis suggests this phase may now be ending. Ethereum price is consolidating just under $2,200, signaling that an altcoin rally could be near. Source: X According to Pillows, a confirmed breakout above the $2,200 resistance would indicate the start of the expansion phase. This phase often follows Wyckoff-style patterns and can lead to rapid price appreciation. The projected target during this phase could push altcoin price beyond the $4,000 mark, with momentum likely to increase if volume supports the breakout. Technical Indicators Show Short-Term Sentiment Recent data shows Ethereum price retested the $2,100 level after a low of $1,930. This marks the first move above $2,100 in two weeks. However, technical indicators remain divided on the short-term trend. A flag pattern has formed on the hourly chart, often viewed as a bullish continuation signal in technical analysis. On the other hand, the 14-day EMA has converged bearishly near the overbought RSI range. This suggests caution, as short-term volatility may continue. If the resistance at $2,100 holds, top altcoin price may decline to test $2,000 again before any breakout. More so, analyst Michaël van de Poppe supports the bullish outlook, noting that Ethereum is approaching a key resistance zone between $2,100 and $2,150. He suggests that a breakout above this range could trigger a rapid move toward $2,800, especially with the U.S. dollar index (DXY) showing a notable decline. Source: X ETH Price Prediction Adding to the bullish sentiments, a recent CoinGape report points to Ethereum’s reclaiming of the $2,000 level and strong on-chain accumulation as signs of an incoming multi-week rally. With whales acquiring 470,000 ETH in the past week and over 6 million ETH bought between $1,886 and $1,944, analysts suggest ETH could test the $3,000 mark. At press time, altcoin price is $2,083, reflecting a 4% increase over the past 24 hours. Trading volume has surged by over 102%, reaching $14.77 billion, signaling renewed market interest and heightened activity.

MicroStrategy bought 6,911 Bitcoin, pushing its holdings past 500,000. Meanwhile, BTC eyes $90K as Trump hints at easing tariffs. DeFi lender Nostra pauses borrowing after price feed error Nostra, a lending protocol on Starknet, has paused borrowing for two liquid staking tokens after identifying a “critical issue” with its price feeds, the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol said. On March 24, errors in Nostra’s price feed inflated the reported prices of xSTRK and sSTRK — two liquid staking derivatives of Starknet’s native STRK token — to approximately three times the tokens’ actual value, Nostra said in a post on the X platform. According to Nostra, “[s]uch an inflated price feed could have caused unnecessary liquidations of otherwise safe positions, resulting in users with healthy positions getting liquidated.” In response, the DeFi protocol has disabled any further borrowing against xSTRK and sSTRK collateral deposits, Nostra said. Nostra has also recommended that users with existing xSTRK and sSTRK deposits withdraw the collateral immediately. “Since we don’t have a secondary (fallback) oracle to support these assets, as none are available, we are unable to fully prevent similar events from occurring in the future,” Nostra added. “Our priority has always been and continues to be to keep existing user funds safe and with no fallback oracle, the risks outweigh the benefits,” it said.

42285678,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142823,1742853038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlocking Stablecoins: 3 Major Hurdles to Mass Adoption and the Regulatory Hope,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoins-mass-adoption-hurdles/,"Stablecoins – they promised to be the bridge between the volatile world of cryptocurrencies and the stability of traditional finance. But despite their potential, mass adoption remains elusive. Why aren’t stablecoins in everyone’s digital wallet yet? Foresight Ventures recently shed light on this question, pinpointing three critical issues hindering widespread stablecoin usage. Let’s dive into these hurdles and explore if there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, especially with potential regulatory shifts on the horizon. Decoding Regulatory Uncertainty: The Biggest Roadblock for Stablecoins? Imagine trying to build a house without knowing the building codes. That’s essentially the situation with stablecoins and regulatory uncertainty. This lack of clear guidelines is arguably the biggest headache for the industry. Foresight Ventures highlights this as a primary barrier, and it’s easy to see why. Confusion for Issuers: Without consistent rules across jurisdictions, stablecoin issuers are in a bind. Do they comply with US regulations? EU? Both? The patchwork of global regulations makes it incredibly complex and costly to operate. Investor Hesitation: Retail users and institutional investors alike are wary of investing in or using assets with uncertain legal standing. Nobody wants to be caught on the wrong side of the law, and regulatory ambiguity breeds fear and inaction. Innovation Stifled: Uncertainty discourages innovation. Why invest heavily in developing new stablecoin applications if the regulatory landscape could shift and make your efforts obsolete overnight? The report from Foresight Ventures rightly emphasizes the crippling effect of this uncertainty. For mass adoption to truly take off, we need clarity. Think of it like this: clear regulations are the green light that signals to the world that stablecoins are a legitimate and trustworthy part of the financial ecosystem. User Experience Nightmares: Are Stablecoins Too Complicated for the Average Person? Let’s face it, the crypto world can be intimidating. Wallets, private keys, gas fees – it’s a lot to grasp for someone just looking for a simple way to send money or store value. Foresight Ventures points to user experience (UX) issues as another major barrier to stablecoin adoption. Are stablecoins user-friendly enough for your grandma to use? Consider these UX challenges: Complexity of Onboarding: Setting up a crypto wallet, acquiring stablecoins, and understanding how to use them can be a steep learning curve. Many potential users are turned off by the initial complexity. Transaction Friction: While stablecoins aim for stability, the process of transacting with them can still be clunky. Gas fees on some blockchains, confirmation times, and the need for specialized wallets can create friction. Lack of Intuitive Interfaces: Many crypto platforms and wallets aren’t designed with the average user in mind. Technical jargon, confusing interfaces, and a lack of clear instructions can lead to frustration and abandonment. For stablecoins to reach the masses, the UX needs a serious overhaul. We need interfaces that are as simple and intuitive as using a mobile banking app. Imagine a world where using stablecoins is as easy as sending a text message – that’s the level of simplicity required for widespread adoption. Crypto Compliance Conundrums: Navigating the Labyrinth of Regulations Crypto compliance is the third pillar highlighted by Foresight Ventures as hindering stablecoin adoption. It’s not just about regulatory uncertainty; it’s also about the practical challenges of adhering to existing and emerging regulations, particularly concerning Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Here’s why compliance is a major hurdle: KYC/AML Burdens: While necessary to prevent illicit activities, stringent KYC/AML procedures can create friction for users. Lengthy verification processes and privacy concerns can deter potential adopters. Cross-Border Compliance Challenges: Stablecoins are global assets, but compliance regulations vary significantly across countries. Navigating these different requirements adds complexity and cost for stablecoin platforms and users. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: The rules of the game are constantly changing. Keeping up with evolving regulations and adapting compliance frameworks is a continuous and resource-intensive task. Effective crypto compliance is crucial for building trust and legitimacy in the stablecoin space. However, striking the right balance between robust compliance and a seamless user experience is a delicate act. The industry needs solutions that streamline compliance without sacrificing user convenience or privacy. Hope on the Horizon: The US Stablecoin Bill and a Potential Breakthrough Despite these challenges, there’s a glimmer of hope. Foresight Ventures points to the potential passage of a US stablecoin bill within the next month and a half. This could be a game-changer, particularly in addressing the issue of regulatory uncertainty . What could a US stablecoin bill mean for the industry? Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: A clear legal framework in the US, a major financial market, would provide much-needed clarity and legitimacy to stablecoins. Boost to Investor Confidence: Clear regulations can attract more institutional investment and mainstream adoption as investors gain confidence in the legal standing of stablecoins. Catalyst for Global Adoption: US regulations often set a precedent globally. A comprehensive US bill could encourage other countries to develop their own clear stablecoin frameworks, fostering wider international adoption. While a US bill won’t magically solve all three issues, it would be a significant step forward. Addressing regulatory uncertainty is arguably the most critical piece of the puzzle. Once that foundation is laid, the industry can focus more effectively on improving user experience and streamlining crypto compliance . The Future of Stablecoins: Overcoming Hurdles to Unleash Potential Stablecoins hold immense promise. They can revolutionize payments, improve financial inclusion, and provide a stable on-ramp to the broader crypto ecosystem. However, to unlock this potential for mass adoption , the industry must collaboratively tackle the challenges of regulatory uncertainty, user experience, and compliance. Foresight Ventures’ report serves as a valuable reminder of the key areas that need attention. By focusing on creating clear regulatory frameworks, designing user-friendly interfaces, and developing efficient compliance solutions, we can pave the way for stablecoins to finally realize their potential and become a truly mainstream financial tool. The potential US stablecoin bill offers a beacon of hope, suggesting that the industry may be on the cusp of overcoming one of its most significant hurdles. The journey to mass adoption is still ongoing, but with focused effort and regulatory tailwinds, the future for stablecoins looks bright.

The country saw a 41% increase in crypto app downloads in 2024 from 2023, and it ranked third out of 28 countries in the Henley Crypto Adoption Index 2024. Abu Dhabi in particular has been a hot spot for crypto firms. In December 2024, the ADGM Financial Services Regulatory Authority officially recognized Tether’s USDT ( USDT ) stablecoin as an accepted virtual asset , paving the way for the cryptocurrency’s integration into the local financial ecosystem. On March 12, Binance announced that MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm, had invested $2 billion into the exchange , one of the largest funding deals in the industry’s history. Dubai, another Emirate in the UAE, has also shown itself open to cryptocurrency businesses. In February, Dubai approved USDC ( USDC ) and EURC as the first two stablecoins under its regime .

Blockchain sleuths earlier today noted a flurry of activity with a token labeled as World Liberty Financial USD (USD1) on blockchain monitoring websites Etherscan and BscScan . Blockchain data shows that USD1 was deployed earlier this month on the Ethereum and BNB Chain networks and series of transactions with the token occurring over the past couple weeks. Some transfers included addresses linked to Wintermute, a large digital asset trading firm and market maker, and crypto custodian BitGo, according to Arkham Intelligence data. The token's supply currently stood at around 3.5 million-3.5 million on Ethereum and BNB Chain, per Etherscan and BscScan. Changpeng CZ Zhao, founder of crypto exchange giant Binance, brought widespread attention to the token by ""welcoming"" the project on BNB Chain in a post with a screenshot of the USD1 BscScan profile shared with his 10 million followers. The post, he later said , triggered a wave of copy-cats aiming to capitalize on the new-found attention. WLFI, reacting in a X post , said USD1 is not currently available for trading and crypto users should beware of scams. Stablecoin buzz WLFI, a project spearheaded by Zachary Folkman and Chase Herro, made a splash last year as one of the first crypto projects enjoying the backing of Trump. The protocol aims to provide a blockchain-based marketplace where users can borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, create liquidity pools and transact with stablecoins. It's been widely known that the project is working on crafting its own stablecoin, but there hasn't been any official communication about exact plans and timing of launching the token publicly. CoinDesk has reached out to the team, but hasn't received any replies. Stablecoins are one of the fastest-growing corners of the crypto industry and widely regarded as the killer use case for blockchains. With their prices pegged to an external asset, predominantly to the U.S. dollar, they are widely used as a crypto trading pair and transactions on blockchain rails. They are also increasingly used for everyday payments, remittances and savings, attracting the attention of many venture capital investors. Buzz around the asset class rejuvenated over the past months as the Trump administration elevated stablecoin regulation to the top of its crypto agenda. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that stablecoins have a key role in preserving the U.S. dollar's global role as a reserve currency.",Tech|World Liberty Financial|Donald Trump|DeFi|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BNB|REGULATION|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-24 21:54:43

Was he the elusive founder of Bitcoin ( BTC )? What was his contribution to the crypto industry? Read on to discover the story. Table of Contents Who is Hal Finney? Hal Finney: Bitcoin first tweet Is Hal Finney Satoshi Nakamoto? Hal Finney: Cause of death Who is Hal Finney? Hal Finney was a Bitcoin supporter, a revered cryptographer and cypherpunk, and a gifted computer scientist. Hal was the first person to run the Bitcoin software in 2009, setting a firm base for the network and helping it “stand up”. It is known that he communicated with the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, but it was not this that made him famous. By that time, the computer scientist had already made a name for himself as a respected cryptographer and one of the brightest minds in computer programming. He was behind the creation of the PGP encryption system, effectively laying the foundation for the proof-of-work consensus algorithm that underpins the Bitcoin network. Although Hal Finney’s net worth remains speculative, it is widely believed that he accumulated a significant amount of BTC given his involvement in the early mining and development of the cryptocurrency. Hal Finney: Bitcoin first tweet Hal is famously known for being the first recipient of 10 BTC from Satoshi Nakamoto. Although the exact amount of BTC owned by Hal is unknown, estimated to be worth millions of dollars since he was one of the first to mine Bitcoin, the only public transaction known the amount from Satoshi. What makes this moment even more memorable is that Finney himself made history with the very first tweet about Bitcoin. In 2009, Hal Finney tweeted : “Running bitcoin.” For many, this tweet remains symbolic of the very beginning of Bitcoin’s journey from a niche experiment into a global phenomenon. Is Hal Finney Satoshi Nakamoto? There is speculation that Hal Finney could be the elusive founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. He is not the only name that comes up in such speculation because no one has definitively identified the Bitcoin founder to date. So, did Hal Finney invent Bitcoin? Like Satoshi, Finney was a gifted cryptographer and coder behind several innovations that anchored the Bitcoin network. Furthermore, he was the first person to be in direct contact with the founder, even receiving 10 BTC. Websites like NewsBitcoin.com have published theories on Finney being Bitcoin’s architect. The article pointed to his early work at Caltech and a focus on privacy-themed innovation. He was also part of the pioneer cypherpunks, a group that pioneered research on cryptography and financial autonomy. His libertarian leanings and retirement coinciding with Nakamoto’s disappearance from Bitcoin management further added to the case. However, Hal denied all these claims, further providing email proof that he was a supporter of the Bitcoin idea and not the founder as alluded to. Additionally, Nakamoto sent Bitcoin to Finney, and it would be odd for them to be the same person. Bitcoin payments pioneer Laslo Hecnyz also claims that Nakamoto asked him to develop a MacOs version of the Bitcoin client. This request would have been odd from Finney, who was already proficient in these systems. Finally, the fact that Finney did not cover his trails was the polar opposite of how Nakamoto operated. Finney left a tweet about running Bitcoin online for years, which was not exactly trying to remain lowkey. Regardless, Finney’s impact on the Bitcoin landscape will endure forever. He was crucial in assisting Nakamoto in actualizing the idea into the global financial system it is today. For that, many in the Bitcoin community will remember him for posterity. Hal Finney: Cause of death Unfortunately, Finney died at the age of 58 due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) on August 28, 2014. ALS is a degenerative neurological condition that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to loss of muscle control. Despite being diagnosed with ALS in 2009, Finney continued to contribute to the crypto community and push forward the ideas of decentralized systems. His passing was a major loss not only to his family but also to the global community of cryptographers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, who had benefitted greatly from his visionary work.",Learn|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|RESEARCH|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-24 21:55:14

According to a press release shared with CryptoPotato, the fund will provide investments ranging from $10 million to $50 million per project, with a focus on accelerating Web3 adoption. “DWF Labs, the new generation crypto market maker and investor, is excited to announce the launch of their Liquid Fund aimed at accelerating the adoption and expansion of mid and large-cap crypto projects,” read the announcement. The Liquid Fund Known for its active role in the crypto investment space, the market maker has already allocated over $11 million to blockchain initiatives in the last two weeks alone. As part of this action, it is preparing to finalize two investment agreements, one for $25 million and another for $10 million, with further announcements expected soon. The initiative is designed to provide both financial support and ecosystem development for blockchain projects that drive broader adoption. Each investment will include a tailored strategy, covering stablecoin TVL and ecosystem expansion to enhance liquidity and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity for Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. It will also support lending market development to strengthen financial infrastructure, PR, and brand amplification to increase visibility, as well as a go-to-market strategy to attract traders and grow tokenholder participation. “Through this fund, we are doubling down on our mission to accelerate Web3 innovation and adoption,” said Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner at DWF Labs. “We believe that strategic capital, coupled with hands-on ecosystem development, is the key to unlocking the next wave of growth for the industry,” he added.

Despite its strong community, Shiba Inu, currently around $0.000013, faces slower adoption and whale-driven volatility, making massive gains unlikely. Meanwhile, MUTM, is drawing serious attention following the presale launch. Mutuum Finance tokens available during their Phase 3 presale which has sold out over 60%. A strong investor backing emerged through the acquisition of more than 6400 buyers who have raised $4.5 million during the presale process. Investors participating in Mutuum Finance Phase 3 token purchase earn 200% profit at $0.06 at exchange launch. MUTM could hit $4.62 after launch, 77x return. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates in Phase 3 The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale is in progress while the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 3 of the presale has surpassed $4.5 million total shares and attracted more than 6400 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.02 during Phase 3 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Investors who bought in Phase 3 obtained 200% growth from their investment once MUTM launches. Furthermore analysts predict MUTM will reach $4.62 upon listing resulting in almost 77x the original amount. The current cost of MUTM attracts investors to buy during Phase 4 since it will undergo another pricing increase to 0.025. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Security takes precedence in this ecosystem through combination with open-source smart contracts along with third-party audits to establish complete transparency. The MUTM token holders benefit from both price growth potential and earn passive income while receiving investments through a strategic buyback system that strengthens long-term token value. Mutuum Finance aims to increase accessibility and liquidity by implementing multi-chain expansion which will include EVM and non-EVM blockchain support. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives The $100,000 giveaway conducted by Mutuum Finance aims to give away $10,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 participants as part of its adoption drive. The referral system within Mutuum Finance provides users with rewards for bringing new members into the platform which helps the community to expand while accelerating its growth naturally. As Shiba Inu (SHIB) price predictions continue to underwhelm, investors are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its impressive 77x growth potential. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $4.5 million from more than 6,400 investors, with its Phase 3 presale now 60% sold out. The token price will increase in Phase 4, and early buyers stand to gain substantial returns before the exchange launch at $0.06. Analysts forecast a surge to $4.62, positioning MUTM as a top DeFi contender. Secure your MUTM tokens today and capitalize on this high-growth opportunity.

42286076,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142825,1742853634,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Positive SEC Response: A Promising Step Towards Cryptocurrency Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-positive-crypto-regulation-step/,"Exciting news for the crypto community! The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has signaled a potentially game-changing shift in its approach to digital assets. In a move that could bring more clarity and stability to the often-turbulent cryptocurrency market, the SEC has responded favorably to a comprehensive proposal put forth by CoinRegTech. This development is being hailed by many as a significant step forward for responsible cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. Let’s dive into what this proposal entails and why it’s generating so much buzz. Why is SEC Cryptocurrency Regulation Crucial for Market Growth? For years, the lack of clear regulatory frameworks has been a major hurdle for the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Uncertainty around compliance has kept institutional investors hesitant and created a breeding ground for scams and market manipulation. A robust SEC cryptocurrency regulation framework is seen as essential to: Boost Investor Confidence: Clear rules of the game attract both retail and institutional investors who are currently wary of the risks associated with unregulated markets. Foster Innovation: Well-defined regulations provide a level playing field, encouraging legitimate crypto businesses to innovate and grow within a compliant environment. Prevent Illicit Activities: Strong regulatory oversight helps curb money laundering, fraud, and other illegal activities that can damage the reputation of the crypto industry. CoinRegTech’s proposal appears to address these critical needs head-on, offering a pathway for the SEC to establish effective and practical regulations. What Does the CoinRegTech Proposal for Digital Asset Securities Entail? CoinRegTech, a leading service provider specializing in cryptocurrency market regulation solutions, has presented a meticulously crafted proposal to the SEC. The core of the CoinRegTech proposal revolves around three key recommendations designed to enhance investor protection and market integrity within the digital asset space. Let’s break down each of these recommendations: Establish Investor Protection and Market Structure Requirements for Digital Asset Securities Trading Platforms: This is arguably the most crucial aspect of the proposal. CoinRegTech emphasizes the need for the SEC to define clear guidelines for platforms that facilitate the trading of digital asset securities . These requirements would likely encompass: Registration and Licensing: Platforms would need to register with the SEC and obtain licenses to operate legally. Capital Adequacy: Ensuring platforms maintain sufficient capital reserves to protect customer funds. Custody Solutions: Implementing secure and compliant methods for safeguarding digital assets held by platforms. Fair Trading Practices: Establishing rules to prevent market manipulation, insider trading, and front-running. Revise the Securities Exchange Act to Improve Transaction Reporting Mechanisms and Market Supervision Responsibilities: The current Securities Exchange Act may not be fully equipped to handle the unique characteristics of the cryptocurrency market. CoinRegTech proposes revisions to: Enhance Transaction Reporting: Implement more robust and transparent reporting mechanisms to track crypto transactions effectively. Strengthen Market Supervision: Empower the SEC to actively monitor and supervise crypto market transparency and detect illicit activities. Adapt to Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Consider how regulations can be adapted to address the growing landscape of decentralized finance and its unique challenges. Establish the Digital Asset Electronic Reporting System (DART) in Cooperation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): Recognizing the overlapping jurisdictions of the SEC and CFTC in the digital asset space, CoinRegTech suggests a collaborative approach. The DART system would serve as a unified platform for: Streamlined Reporting: Creating a single system for reporting digital asset transactions to both the SEC and CFTC. Data Sharing and Analysis: Facilitating efficient data sharing between regulatory agencies for better market oversight. Reduced Regulatory Burden: Simplifying the reporting process for crypto businesses by providing a centralized system. Benefits of Implementing the CoinRegTech Proposal for Crypto Market Transparency CoinRegTech argues that if the SEC adopts these recommendations, the benefits for the cryptocurrency market and its participants would be substantial. Improved crypto market transparency is at the heart of these advantages: Enhanced Investor Protection: Stronger regulations and reporting mechanisms directly translate to better protection for investors from fraud and market manipulation. Increased Market Integrity: Greater transparency and supervision foster a more trustworthy and stable market environment. Attracting Institutional Investment: Regulatory clarity can unlock significant institutional capital currently sitting on the sidelines due to regulatory uncertainties. Level Playing Field for Businesses: Clear rules allow legitimate crypto businesses to thrive and compete fairly, fostering innovation and growth. Global Competitiveness: A well-regulated crypto market can position the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space, attracting talent and investment. Addressing Potential Challenges in Implementing Investor Protection Crypto Measures While the CoinRegTech proposal is undoubtedly promising, implementing robust investor protection crypto measures will not be without its challenges. Some potential hurdles include: Technological Complexity: Regulating rapidly evolving technologies like blockchain and DeFi requires specialized expertise and adaptable regulatory frameworks. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Striking the right balance between protecting investors and fostering innovation is crucial to avoid stifling the growth of the crypto industry. Global Coordination: Cryptocurrencies operate globally, necessitating international cooperation and harmonization of regulations to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Enforcement Challenges: Ensuring effective enforcement of regulations in a decentralized and often anonymous environment can be complex. However, these challenges are not insurmountable. By taking a proactive and collaborative approach, the SEC, CFTC, and industry stakeholders can work together to overcome these obstacles and build a robust and responsible regulatory framework. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors and Businesses? The SEC’s positive response to the CoinRegTech proposal is a significant development that warrants attention from both crypto investors and businesses. Here are some actionable insights: For Investors: This news signals a potential move towards a more regulated and safer crypto market. While regulations may bring some short-term adjustments, in the long run, they are likely to enhance investor confidence and market stability. Stay informed about regulatory developments and consider how they might impact your investment strategies. For Businesses: Prepare for increased regulatory scrutiny and compliance requirements. Proactively engage with regulatory bodies and industry associations to stay ahead of the curve. Embracing compliance early can provide a competitive advantage and build trust with customers and investors. Conclusion: A Promising Horizon for Cryptocurrency Regulation The SEC’s favorable response to the CoinRegTech proposal represents a potentially positive turning point for cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. By embracing these recommendations, the SEC has the opportunity to establish a comprehensive framework that promotes crypto market transparency , strengthens investor protection crypto , and fosters responsible innovation in the digital asset space. While the journey towards full regulatory clarity is still ongoing, this development is undoubtedly a promising step in the right direction, paving the way for a more mature and sustainable cryptocurrency ecosystem.

In the analysis, it was stated that Solana received a strong reaction from the 0.618 Fibonacci support at the $ 118 level, and that critical resistance levels must be overcome in order for the upward movement to continue. According to analysts, the current situation is as follows: The reaction from the “Gold Pocket” region ($117–118) gave Solana short-term bullish momentum. However, it would take about 10% to reach the first major resistance at $159.

MakroVision lists the critical areas ahead for Solana as follows: $159 level: Breaking this point could open up space for the price to rally towards the $188 level. $188 level: It is seen as the last major hurdle before a possible structure change. As long as the $117 level is maintained, the technical structure may remain positive in the short term. Breaking this level may open the door to a new wave of decline towards the $104 level. Solana is showing signs of a strong recovery, but a definitive trend reversal requires a breakout above $159.

This comes just days after the US SEC agreed to drop the long-running Ripple lawsuit. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Reveals What As SEC Drops Lawsuit In a FOX Business interview , Brad Garlinghouse discussed what next for his firm following the SEC’s decision to drop the Ripple lawsuit. He noted that about 95% of the company’s customers are overseas, as the lawsuit hindered their US operations. However, he suggested that will likely change moving forward as they grow their operations in the country. Garlinghouse remarked that they have already been witnessing domestic interest since US President Donald Trump took office. The Ripple CEO revealed they have signed more deals since then than in the six months preceding Trump’s inauguration. The company is expected to grow further in the US after the SEC agreed to drop the Ripple lawsuit . Brad Garlinghouse predicts that his firm’s innovative technology will play out over the next ten to twenty years in terms of how it integrates and rewires the US financial structure in terms of payments, real estate, and securities transactions. The Ripple CEO again took time to highlight how Trump’s crypto-related executive orders, especially the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, have created a more friendly environment for crypto firms in the US. He noted that financial institutions are now more open to crypto technology. As CoinGape reported, the OCC has cleared Federal Banks to engage in crypto activities. On Stablecoin Legislation & Its Impact Brad Garlinghouse commended the efforts of legislators like Senator Cynthia Lummis and Rep French Hill to provide regulatory clarity. These lawmakers are championing the market structure and stablecoin bills to create a regulatory framework that will guide crypto firms. Senator Lummis also recently reintroduced the Bitcoin Act to codify Trump’s vision of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Ripple CEO welcomed the idea of regulatory clarity, stating that it would reassure customers that they can engage with them in good faith. He remarked that these customers would feel more comfortable using their technologies without fear of regulators attacking them. Garlinghouse added that this would also enable more job creation, innovation, and capital formation in the US.
