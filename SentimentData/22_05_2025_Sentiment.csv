Trump will host his dinner for more than 200 of his leading memecoin investors, whose money will fill the coffers of the president's own business entities. They've reportedly been invited to his capital-area golf course, the Trump National Golf Club Washington, D.C., outside of which the memecoin buyers may encounter protesters. Some of the counter-programming for his dinner will start earlier in the day in front of the Capitol Building. At 12:45 p.m., Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, will round up other lawmakers in front of the House steps to rail against Trump, accusing him of abusing his White House powers to ""shamelessly promote and profit from a series of crypto ventures tied to himself and his family,"" according to a notice about the event. Waters will also introduce a new messaging bill ""to block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all."" The legislation, which is unlikely to make headway in a Republican-majority Congress, would ban presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress and their families from ""engaging in similar crypto crime."" It's the same type of ban that Democrats had been seeking to insert into crypto legislation, but Republicans have declined to let Trump-targeting language into the current digital assets bills, including the Senate stablecoin effort getting close to the finish line. Later on Wednesday at 2:30 p.m., another press conference of Democratic lawmakers will feature Senators Chris Murphy and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom have been prominent in congressional criticism against Trump's crypto actions. Murphy had introduced his own bill with a similar aim to Waters', the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act to stop federal officials from using their positions to profit from digital assets. That event — also outside the Capitol — will additionally feature Senator Jeff Merkley, who also intends to join an evening protest right outside Trump's golf course, hosted by progressive groups under the banner of Our Revolution . The message of the ""America Is Not For Sale"" rally is to push back on ""a blatant example of political access being sold to the highest bidder,"" according to the group. The guest list for the memecoin dinner hasn't been made public, but analysis of the buying of those coins suggest that the biggest spenders devoted millions for the privilege of joining the president at the event. The attendees' anonymity is part of the problem, according to critics, who say that foreign buyers are gaining access to the president without the knowledge of the public. Debate over the president's crypto ties temporarily delayed progress on the U.S. stablecoin legislation meant to set up rules for domestic issuers, but the bill got back on track this week to clear an important procedural hurdle in the Senate on Monday. Trump's team has downplayed accusations of corruption. White House official Bo Hines said last week at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto that the Trump family's crypto ventures do not pose conflicts of interest, and they have ""the right to engage in capital markets.""

The bill aims to provide clarity and legal protection for blockchain developers and service providers, ensuring they are not misclassified as money transmitters if they don’t handle user funds. Emmer said that the longer Congress delays the clarification, the greater the risk that the digital asset technology is pushed overseas, which will harm American investors and innovators. He believes that the bill provides clarification that will help the U.S. remain a leader in the crypto space. Emmer reintroduces bill to bring regulatory clarity to digital assets Today, @RepRitchie and I introduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act to protect blockchain developers and service providers that never custody consumer funds from unjust government prosecution. pic.twitter.com/nCbpHcpf1Y — Tom Emmer (@GOPMajorityWhip) May 21, 2025 Tom Emmer acknowledged that the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act reflects a thoughtful, bipartisan effort to get crypto policy right. He also revealed that they took feedback seriously from the last Congress , after a similar language was voted down, and returned with a smarter, sharper framework that protects innovation without compromising oversight. The American politician argued that the U.S. should be the global home for responsible innovation, not a place where developers are punished for building open-source software or experimenting with new technologies. “If we want to keep the next generation of builders in the United States, this kind of legal clarity is essential. We cannot afford to let outdated or misapplied regulations drive American talent and technology overseas. With this bill, we protect innovation, uphold civil liberties, and strengthen our global competitiveness in the 21st-century economy.” – Tom Emmer , Majority Whip in the U.S. House of Representatives. Peter Van Valkenburgh, executive director of Coin Center, believes that the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act is the best way to protect American crypto developers and innovators from undue regulation by prosecution. He also noted that recent misapplication of licensing laws has chilled the development of privacy and freedom-enhancing tech in the U.S. Valkenburgh acknowledged that avoiding surprise prosecutions, creating legal clarity, and encouraging free speech and software development are not partisan issues but are core American values, which BRCA codifies. BRCA bill aims to protect digital asset developers Amanda Tuminelli, executive director and chief legal officer of the DeFi Education Fund, said that the bill would protect developers of non-custodial, peer-to-peer software protocols from being unreasonably defined as operators of an unlicensed money service business under the Bank Secrecy Act. She also believes BRCA is an important step in the right direction for the development of digital assets in the U.S. and would deliver much-needed clarity to the builders of the financial future. Blockchain Association Interim CEO and head of policy, Sarah Milby, said the company is proud to support the reintroduction of the bipartisan Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. She mentioned that the bill affirms that innovators building and maintaining decentralized, non-custodial blockchain protocols should not be unfairly treated as financial intermediaries. Cody Carbone, CEO of The Digital Chamber, argued that blockchain developers, miners, and validators aren’t financial institutions but they’re builders. He believes that the bill will finally give them the freedom to build in the U.S. by clarifying that those who never hold customer assets don’t need bank-style licenses. He also urged swift passage and commended Majority Whip Emmer and Representative Ritchie Torres for championing the BRCA bill. Kristin Smith and Miller Whitehouse-Levine of the Solana Policy Institute said they’re proud to support the reintroduction of the bill since it provides the legal certainty blockchain developers and entrepreneurs need to build decentralized networks and the next generation of financial infrastructure in the U.S. Ji Hun Kim, president, and CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, said that the reintroduction of the bill will help ensure that non-custodial blockchain participants are not subject to unnecessary and technologically infeasible compliance burdens that would impede American innovation. Kim believes that the development of digital assets in the U.S. is critical to the U.S.’s national and economic security.

At $22.70, Avalanche is making progress in real world use cases. Meanwhile, another rising project Ruvi AI is getting attention for combining AI with blockchain, and we’re along for the ride. What is Ruvi AI Ruvi AI stands out by combining the power of AI with the security and transparency of blockchain. It’s focused on delivering tools to optimize workflows and decision making across industries like healthcare, logistics and finance. By using blockchain, Ruvi AI ensures its solutions are decentralized, secure and effective for complex tasks. The project has already hit some milestones. Ruvi AI launched its Beta platform, giving users early access to test its features. And it has got its first exchange listing, with more listings coming soon to bring the token to mainstream. Presale Success Story Ruvi AI’s presale was a sign of its strong market demand and potential. In Phase 1, tokens were priced at $0.01 and sold out in 2 weeks. Early investors have already seen a 50% gain in their tokens as the price increased to $0.015 in Phase 2. Experts think Ruvi AI tokens could reach $1 shortly after listing on major exchanges, so this is a great opportunity to get tokens at a discount. Investor Rewards Ruvi AI has a unique VIP rewards system to incentivize long term commitment to the project. Depending on the amount of tokens purchased, investors get bonuses that significantly boost their returns. Here are 3 investment cases: VIP Tier 2 Investing $750 at Phase 2 price of $0.015 per token gets you 50,000 tokens. As a VIP Tier 2 you get an additional 40% bonus and get 20,000 more tokens, so you’ll have 70,000 tokens. At listing price of $0.07, your tokens would be worth $4,900, 553% ROI.* If tokens reach $1, your investment would be $70,000, 9,233% ROI. VIP Tier 3 $1,500 gets you 100,000 tokens and makes you VIP Tier 3 with a 60% bonus. That’s 60,000 more tokens, so you’ll have 160,000 tokens. At $0.07, that’s $11,200, 1,020% ROI. If Ruvi AI reaches $1, that’s $160,000, 10,567% ROI. VIP Tier 5 For higher tier investors, $7,500 gets you 500,000 tokens. With VIP Tier 5 you get a 100% bonus, so your holdings double to 1,000,000 tokens. At $0.07, that’s $70,000, 833% ROI. If the token reaches $1, that’s $1,000,000, 12,233% ROI. These are the juicy opportunities Ruvi AI is offering to committed investors and the project itself. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Contributors To encourage early participation, Ruvi AI has a leaderboard rewards system for its top contributors. Investors who stand out get extra token bonuses: Top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens, worth $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens, worth $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens, worth $7,000 at 0.07 or $100,000 at 1. This is a great way to reward active participants and create a sense of community. This is more than an investment, it’s a solution to real world problems through technology. The Beta launch and exchange listing is just the beginning of what looks to be a big journey.

Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this trend, with on-chain data and analyst commentary confirming high-conviction buying. HBAR and Ethereum remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is now concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. Institutional confidence is rising as retail investors take profits, and forecasts for May call for an average BTC price of $119,798, with potential highs of $136,239 by month’s end. As Bitcoin’s momentum steadies above $100,000, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors looking for the next major wave of upside. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen a surge in whale accumulation as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% allocated to presale, and Hashex-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside if current momentum continues. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading around $2.07, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next resistance levels. As institutional adoption grows and futures products launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. HBAR: Technical Uptrend and Accumulation Hedera (HBAR) is trading between $0.19 and $0.21, showing a bullish structure after completing a five-wave impulse from April lows. Analysts highlight a support zone between $0.139 and $0.170, with targets set at $0.213 to $0.229 in the short term. As HBAR maintains its uptrend, some holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking faster upside before listings. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Whale accumulation is setting the tone for May, with Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge. With a clear listing roadmap, robust demand, and Stage 8 nearly complete, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the month. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

Many new projects release tokens without structure, leaving traders guessing on price. BlockDAG is breaking that pattern with a clear and limited presale model that combines transparency with massive upside. With demand rising and access capped by design, it’s no wonder BlockDAG is being called the top presale crypto by early adopters. So far, the project has raised more than $260 million and sold 20.9 billion coins. With the presale price frozen at $0.0020 until June 13, early backers have a rare chance to secure BDAG at a fraction of its actual value of %0.0262. Batches That Create Urgency & Build Trust BlockDAG isn’t running a typical open-ended coin sale. Its batch-based strategy puts structure into the process and rewards those who act fast. Each presale round is set at a fixed price and increases gradually, unlike dynamic pricing models that create confusion and volatility. This system helps build buyer confidence while also encouraging quick decisions. Currently in batch 28, with that tier priced at $0.0262, BlockDAG still offers a special $0.0020 entry until June 13. This mix of price clarity and urgency is one reason BlockDAG continues gaining ground as the top presale crypto for smart buyers looking for strong upside ahead of exchange listings. Keeping It Fair: Access Without Flooding the Market Many presale cryptos open the gates too wide, causing token oversupply before anything launches. BlockDAG flips that idea. Its model is open to both small and large buyers, but the limited supply in each batch keeps prices under control and demand high. That’s why the sale of 20.9 billion coins hasn’t caused price fatigue. This method of balancing availability and scarcity makes sure everyone has a shot without allowing whales to dominate the supply. That structure is a major reason why BlockDAG has become one of 2025’s most talked-about top presale crypto picks. With real momentum and triple-digit gains before launch, buyers are taking notice of the system behind the growth. 2,520% ROI and a Temporary Price You Can Still Catch In crypto, talk is cheap. What matters most are returns. And BlockDAG is already delivering those, fast. Its batch 1 price has grown over 25x, and thanks to the special $0.0020 offer, new buyers can still lock in that same early advantage until June 13. This isn’t speculation, it’s a live ROI figure backed by real presale traction. The project has already brought in $260 million during its presale alone. Buyers are tracking gains, not guessing. And with the “Go Live reveal” scheduled for June 13, BlockDAG will be announcing listings on 20 major exchanges, including MEXC, LBank, and BitMart. For anyone still waiting, this setup defines what a top presale crypto looks like: real performance, clear targets, and a small window before prices surge again. Key Highlights BlockDAG isn’t just running a presale, it’s rewriting how crypto launches should be done. By sticking to fixed pricing, controlled releases, and time-limited access, the team is creating stability in a space known for chaos. And with the special $0.0020 offer available only until June 13, late-stage buyers still have a rare chance to catch up. So far, the numbers are staggering: $260 million raised, 20.9 billion coins distributed, and a 2,520% ROI already realized by batch 1 holders. But more than the numbers, it’s the method that’s winning buyers over. For those building a high-return portfolio in 2025, BlockDAG is proving to be far more than hype.

SFM price dropped over 5 percent today despite the wider altcoin market following Bitcoin in bullish sentiment. A New York jury convicted Braden John Karony, a former CEO of the SafeMoon (SFM) crypto project, on all crucial charges earlier on Wednesday, May 21. Karony was charged by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. The verdict was a result of a two-week trial that concluded that the ex-Safemoon executives defrauded SFM investors by draining purportedly locked liquidity for their personal gains. The case prosecutor alleged that Karony alongside Thomas Smith, a former Safemoon CTO, and Kyle Nagy, the project’s creator, misappropriated millions of investors’ funds between 2021 and 2022. While Smith has already pleaded guilty to all charges and testified against Karony, Nagy remains a fugitive, allegedly in Russia. Meanwhile, Karony will remain in police custody ahead of his sentencing, with his properties worth over $1.8 million seized. Market Impact on the Safemoon Project The Safemoon project has struggled to regain market share in the recent past following the indictment of the ex-officials. The project dropped in net valuation from nearly $1 billion to about $7.5 million at the time of this writing, according to our latest crypto oracle. Following the announcement on Wednesday, SFM price dropped over 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $0.00002 during the late North American trading session. The Safemoon project has recorded sustained bearish sentiment in the recent past despite the wider altcoin market attempting to follow Bitcoin price in bullish sentiment.

Critics argue the event commodifies political access, allowing wealthy donors, some based overseas, to buy proximity to a U.S. president. The rally, branded “America Is Not for Sale,” will feature speeches from key Democratic figures and visual protests targeting crypto-related political fundraising. A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and activists is set to rally on May 22 in protest of President Donald Trump’s controversial meme coin dinner, raising concerns over political influence and crypto-fueled favoritism. The event, organized under the banner “America Is Not for Sale,” is a direct response to what critics say is the monetization of political access through Trump’s latest crypto initiative. Trump Slammed for ‘Selling Access’ via meme coin The event, held at Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, follows Trump’s announcement that the top 220 holders of his meme coin, $TRUMP, could apply for an exclusive dinner with him. The top 25 are said to qualify for a “VIP White House tour.” Blockchain data shows the token has raised nearly $150 million, with some attendees reportedly spending millions for the chance to meet Trump. Source: Public Citizen Opponents of the event, including members of Congress, say it crosses ethical lines. They claim the president is turning influence into a transaction. “Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” said Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee. Public Citizen is organizing the rally with progressive group Our Revolution. Protesters are expected to display banners reading “STOP CRYPTO CORRUPTION” and enlarged graphics of the $TRUMP coin. Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is scheduled to speak at the rally, alongside several other Democratic figures. According to Our Revolution, some of the coin’s largest holders are based overseas, sparking additional concerns about foreign influence. Crypto industry figures, including Tron founder Justin Sun , Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, are among the known tokenholders expected to attend the dinner. According to the project , all attendees must pass background checks and cannot be from countries flagged by Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance lists. Public Citizen Co-President Robert Weissman echoed those concerns. “Trump’s solicitation schemes for money, gifts, and power are out of control,” he said. “Between his outrageous meme coin grift, his Tesla car show on the White House lawn, and his consideration to accept a gifted jumbo jet from Qatar, Trump’s priority goes to the highest bidder.” Trump Family’s Crypto Links Raise Ethics Concerns, Stall Stablecoin Legislation The dinner has also had political consequences in Washington. For example, some Democratic lawmakers have withdrawn support for crypto-related bills in protest , including the GENIUS Act, a measure focused on regulating payment stablecoins. Though the act passed a key Senate vote on May 19 , several senators voiced concern over Trump’s ties to World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform that launched its own stablecoin, USD1, in March. Critics worry the Trump family’s involvement with the company could present serious conflicts of interest. “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the vote. Senator Chris Murphy, who opposed advancing the GENIUS Act , called for bipartisan efforts to add provisions that would bar a U.S. president from issuing stablecoins. The Senate has a chance – right now – to shut down Trump's biggest crypto coin corruption. The pending bill in the Senate regulates a kind of crypto called ""stablecoin"", but exempts the President from the ethics rules. We shouldn't pass that bill unless that loophole is closed. pic.twitter.com/eHLeCdBV9m — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) May 21, 2025 He also urged the White House to release a full list of dinner attendees, warning that many may be expecting favors in return for their token purchases. Murphy will join Senator Elizabeth Warren and representatives of Public Citizen at a press event on the evening of the dinner. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, is planning a separate press conference on May 22. She is expected to introduce legislation to block Trump’s meme coin and curb what she calls “crypto corruption.” Meanwhile, additional protests are being organized by local Democratic groups, including the Arlington and Loudoun County Democratic Committees. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be,” said Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democrats.

The Brazilian media outlet Livecoins reported that the company will raise funds to buy more Bitcoin as part of its newly established treasury strategy. Earlier this month, Méliuz became Brazil’s first stock market-listed BTC treasury company, s pending almost $28.5 million to buy BTC 274.52 . Méliuz (CASH3) share prices on the Brazilian B3 exchange over the past six months. (Source: Google Finance) Méliuz: Bitcoin Plans in Pipeline The company will continue to buy BTC in the weeks ahead. In a statement, the company declared its intention to raise no less than 150 million real ($26.5 million) on “new BTC acquisitions.” The firm said it had told its shareholders about its intentions and was now “evaluating” its fundraising options. Méliuz CEO Israel Salmen said the company would look to an “issuance of shares or convertible debt” in its search for funding. The firm added that it was working with the São Paulo-based investment banking firm BTG Pactual on its plan. BTG Pactual will act as a coordinator when Méliuz has the funds in place to complete its next BTC purchase. Marcio Loures Penna, Méliuz’s Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Governance, confirmed that the company may issue financial assets “representing debt securities.” These may either be convertible into shares or offered in a non-convertible form, he added. The company may alternatively choose to carry out a primary public offering for common shares, with possible subscription bonuses. Méliuz said that while its goal remains raising 150 million real, it may spend even more “if opportunities arise.” However, the firm warned that its plans remain provisional. It said that it would need to complete an evaluation process before it finalized its next BTC buy. @MeliuzBitcoin #CASH3 announced yesterday that it is evaluating a potential capital raise to expand its Bitcoin strategy, through the issuance of shares or convertible debt. BTG has been engaged to coordinate a potential public offering. — Israel Salmen (@IsraelSalmen) May 20, 2025 When Could Méliuz Make Its Next BTC Purchase? Méliuz also refused to put a timeline on its fundraising efforts or its eventual Bitcoin buy. Earlier this month, the fintech player uveiled details of its first Bitcoin buy, as well as news that its shareholders have “approved, by a wide majority, the transformation of Méliuz into the first listed Bitcoin treasury company in Brazil.” The company currently holds BTC 320.2. Penna added that Méliuz “will keep its shareholders and the market informed of any news” on its next BTC buy. He vowed that the firm would act “in line with best corporate governance practices and in accordance with applicable legislation and regulations.” Méliuz was founded in 2011. Its services include cashback and voucher offerings for online and brick-and-mortar retailers, in addition to the Méliuz credit card. The firm launched a successful $103 million initial public offering on the Brazilian B3 exchange in November 2020.

Coins like XRP and Cardano have dazzled investors with massive rallies and impressive utility stories. It’s easy to get caught up chasing the echoes of these established titans. But history shows us that the truly life-changing gains, the elusive 1000x returns, rarely come from the well-known giants already in the spotlight. Instead, they hide in the shadows, in projects so new that only a few insiders have their eyes on them. If you want to build real wealth in crypto, the smart move is to look beyond yesterday’s winners. The real fortune often lies in pre-exchange tokens, those hidden gems in their infancy. This is where the savvy “smart money” is parking bets, scooping up tokens before the market catches on. And today, we’re pulling back the curtain on one such opportunity. XRP (XRP): Riding High on Waves of Adoption and Anticipation XRP remains one of the crypto market’s heavy hitters . As of May 17, 2025, XRP trades at $2.41 and holds a solid position as the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market cap . Its continued strength is backed by adoption in cross-border payments and a community eager for regulatory clarity. Market forecasts suggest XRP could nearly double, potentially reaching $5.00 within the next four weeks. This optimism stems from ongoing developments and a resurgence of interest in digital payment rails. While XRP’s rise is impressive, its story is well-known and widely priced in by now. Cardano (ADA): The Deliberate Ascent of a Research-Driven Powerhouse Cardano has carved a niche as a research-first blockchain platform focused on security, scalability, and sustainability. At $0.7719 and ranking 9th in market cap , Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem methodically. Analysts project a climb toward $0.9950 over the coming month, fueled by upcoming protocol upgrades and growing DeFi activity on its network. Cardano’s steady, science-backed approach makes it a dependable player, but this slow and steady pace means explosive gains are rarer. The “Off-Radar” Multiplier: Why Pre-Exchange Gems Hold Explosive Potential Here’s the crucial insight: once tokens hit major exchanges, the early explosive growth phases are usually behind them. The crowd has caught on, valuations rise, and the easy gains diminish. The real 1000x plays live in the shadows : projects still in presale or the earliest community stages, where risk is high but rewards are unmatched. These are the tokens still flying under the radar, awaiting discovery by sharp-eyed investors who know where to look. Unveiling the Enigma: Introducing OpenFundNet (OFNT)—The Community’s Best-Kept Secret Meet OpenFundNet (OFNT) , a pre-exchange token quietly building momentum as the next big player in decentralized crowdfunding. While few are talking about it yet, OFNT’s mission is clear: fix the trust, fee, and accessibility problems plaguing traditional crowdfunding by leveraging Web3 technology. Currently in presale or early stages, OFNT offers an unprecedented opportunity to get in before the public stampede. This stealth positioning means early supporters could reap outsized rewards as the platform and token gain visibility. The Anatomy of a Giant Slayer: What Gives OFNT its 1000x DNA? OFNT’s blueprint for massive growth rests on innovative features that solve real-world issues: Validator-Driven Trust: Unlike traditional platforms riddled with opaque vetting, OFNT uses a validator system to score and approve projects. This transparency builds genuine trust and quality control, attracting serious backers. Zero Platform Fees: OFNT’s zero-fe e model means creators receive more funding and backers’ contributions go further. This no-extraction approach is a game-changer in an industry notorious for high fees. Dual Rewards & Emission Engine: The tokenomics reward both backers and validators daily with token emissions. This creates an engaged, sustainable ecosystem fueling continuous growth and participation. The Ground-Floor Window: OFNT’s Presale—Your Entry Before the Public Stampede Here’s where it gets exciting. OFNT has allocated 10% of its total token supply specifically for the presale phase. This limited window is a rare ground-floor chance to secure tokens at favorable terms before they hit major exchanges. Participation is streamlined; early buyers can join using widely accepted cryptocurrencies like USDT. This accessibility ensures that the early community can grow quickly, setting the stage for explosive network effects. Beyond Price Pumps: OFNT’s Vision for a Self-Sustaining Crowdfunding Universe OFNT is more than just a speculative token. Its vision is to build a decentralized, community-governed crowdfunding platform that is self-sustaining and scalable. Governance tokens empower holders to vote on critical platform decisions, ensuring the project evolves with its community’s needs. Combined with deflationary mechanisms like scheduled emission halvings , OFNT’ s design supports long-term token scarcity and value appreciation. This isn’t a flash in the pan; it’s a foundation for lasting impact. The Final Whisper: Position Yourself in OFNT Before the Market Shouts Its Name XRP and Cardano have proven their value, but the real game-changers for exponential gains are hidden pre-exchange tokens like OFNT. This opportunity offers early adopters a shot at massive returns by backing a project built on trust, innovation, and community power. If you’re ready to move beyond the obvious and claim your spot in the future of decentralized crowdfunding , now is the time to research OpenFundNet . Join their growing community channels and get in before the market wakes up to this sleeping giant. The whispers are growing louder; don’t miss your chance before the crowd rushes in.

However, the latest on-chain data reveals that despite elevated unrealized profits, there are still no signs of increased selling pressure for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Unrealized Profits Remain High But No Panic Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by Bitcoin analyst Crazzyblockk, the cohort of new investors – those who have held BTC for less than one month – is currently sitting on unrealized profits of 6.9%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? In the same vein, short-term investors – holders who have held Bitcoin for less than six months – are sitting on unrealized profits of 10.7%. These figures highlight that the unrealized profit/loss ratio remains elevated, with unrealized profits far outweighing unrealized losses. Crazzyblockk noted that while historically, a high percentage of unrealized profits across the network tends to precede sharp price corrections, the current setup appears different. They added: Past cycles have shown that extreme profit concentration tends to precede volatility; however, current market structure shows no outsized concentration of risk in one participant group. The relatively narrow spread in unrealized profits between new and short-term holders indicates that profit distribution is balanced. Furthermore, although profit levels are high, loss levels remain compressed, suggesting limited pressure from distressed sellers. The contributor remarked: While macro conditions and volatility risk remain elevated, and a price correction cannot be ruled out, there is no strong behavioral signal suggesting a high willingness to trigger major distribution or selling. Further Upside For BTC? Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently predicted further upside for Bitcoin. In a post on X, Martinez noted that BTC has undergone another bullish breakout, with the potential to reach a new all-time high (ATH) around $111,500. The current momentum has also drawn in retail investors. According to CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Aleman, wallets holding less than $10,000 worth of BTC are steadily returning to the market – a sign of growing retail participation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cycle Indicator Hints At Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says That said, some warning signs may still dampen BTC’s current bullish trajectory. For instance, despite the recent encouraging price action, Bitcoin’s Demand Momentum remains subdued. Similarly, Bitcoin’s “supply scarcity” narrative still lacks meaningful strength, as Aleman recently stressed that despite depleting exchange reserves, BTC is not likely to face genuine supply scarcity in the near term. At press time, BTC trades at $106,528, up 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges that Ian Patrick Jackson, 37, conspired with another Atlanta man to recruit at least nine business owners to submit fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications using fake tax documents. Jackson allegedly told the business owners to falsely claim they each employed 16 individuals and paid monthly wages of $120,000. The DOJ says the owners then wrote falsified payroll checks to people who didn’t work for them and then either kept the money for themselves or paid Jackson via his co-conspirator. Jackson is allegedly connected to 15 fraudulent COVID-19 relief loan applications that inked $3.39 million in proceeds. He’s the 12th person to be charged in connection with an Atlanta-based PPP fraud ring, with the 11 previous defendants having already pled guilty or been convicted at trial. The DOJ says authorities have recovered nearly $1.2 million of the defrauded funds. Jackson also allegedly applied for a separate $237,500 PPP loan using fabricated tax forms and used a forged driver’s license and false revenue statements to fraudulently apply for approximately $100,000 in PPP and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program loans. The DOJ also says he fraudulently secured another $240,035 PPP loan and $125,000 in EIDL program loans and grants on behalf of another company. Jackson has been charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, two counts of bank fraud, two counts of wire fraud and two counts of money laundering. The charges could result in decades in prison.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano Are Still Considered Major Summer Setups",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/500-into-500k-magacoin-finance-xrp-and-cardano-are-still-considered-major-summer-setups/,"As Bitcoin’s latest rally fuels confidence across the market, investors are scanning for the next wave of altcoins with exponential upside. While BTC dominates the headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects with room to outperform as capital rotates outward. This summer, MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano are emerging as top setups for outsized gains as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity. Still trading under $0.07, the project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. MAGA’s $0.007 listing target and scarcity-driven tokenomics have analysts calling for 34x–40x returns—and some models point to even more extreme upside if current momentum continues. What sets MAGA apart is not just its viral political narrative, but its transparent tokenomics, Hashex audit, and a presale structure attracting both retail and whale capital. As Stage 8 nears completion, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure early exposure before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges. In a market searching for the next SHIBA or DOGE, MAGA’s combination of community energy, clear roadmap, and realistic price targets puts it at the top of many watchlists. XRP: Futures Launch and ETF Buzz XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as the CME Futures launch and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Legal clarity in the U.S. and growing payment adoption have analysts forecasting a move beyond $5 in the short term, with $15–$30 possible if key catalysts align. While a $100 price remains a stretch, the infrastructure being built by Ethereum, Cardano, and new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the real drivers of the next major run. Cardano (ADA): Quiet Accumulation and Summer Breakout Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.85 as of May 2025, with forecasts calling for a steady climb to $1.05 by July and $1.50 by October. Developers have returned, and on-chain metrics are starting to improve. If ADA delivers on upcoming milestones, it could surprise investors with a strong recovery this summer. Many Cardano stakers are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher near-term upside, as ADA’s slow pace gives way to more aggressive early-stage plays. Litecoin and Bitcoin: Steady Anchors, But Seeking Momentum Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $103.77, showing steady accumulation but facing resistance near $105. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $103,000, with May price predictions between $110,000–$115,000 as institutional interest remains strong. While both remain core holdings, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward more nimble early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion As summer kicks off, the 2025 cycle is creating new lanes for growth. XRP and Cardano bring proven value, but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s introducing the kind of high-reward opportunity this market thrives on. With narrative strength, market traction, and investor interest all converging, MAGACOIN FINANCE could still be the next great crypto success story. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

The rising optimism of an altseason amid the re-emergence of FOMO traders will help $B sustain bullish sentiment. A recently launched memecoin on the BSC chain dubbed BUILDon (B) rallied over 150 percent in the last 24 hours to trade above $0.1 on Wednesday, during the late North American trading session. The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $102 million and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $60 million, recorded staggering gains after an endorsement from Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI). According to an X post, the WLFI project purchased an undisclosed amount of $B tokens following its recent move to use the USD1 stablecoin as its base pair. “We just bought some $B to support the BUILDon team. Love seeing projects choose $USD1 as their base pair — faster settlement, deeper liquidity, and growth every day. We hope to see more tokens make the switch,” the announcement noted . What Next for BUILDon Following the WLFI Support The BUILDon memecoin has attracted more than 13k on-chain holders after a net pooled USD1 of over 842k to provide liquidity. The BSC mascot is well positioned to rally further in the coming days amid the rising demand for memecoins following the Bitcoin price pump towards a new all-time high. https://twitter.com/buildonbsc_ai/status/1925314302292238396?s=46 Furthermore, the memecoin culture on the BNB chain has gained significant traction in the recent past following the deliberate decision by Binance to support project developers.

Prosecutors argued that Karony’s actions resulted in the misappropriation of millions of dollars from investors. Following a 12-day trial before US District Judge Eric R. Komitee, Korony was convicted of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. He faces up to 45 years in prison when sentenced. The jury took only a few hours to reach their decision after a trial that lasted about two weeks, during which Karony insisted he was innocent. A jury also ordered the forfeiture of one residential property and the proceeds from the sale of another, amounting to roughly $2 million. According to prosecutors, the scheme undermined investor confidence in digital assets and contributed to broader concerns about fraud in the crypto market. “The SafeMoon digital asset was anything but safe and turned out to be pie in the sky for investors who were deliberately misled by Karony, a man who sought to get rich quick by stealing and diverting millions of dollars,” US Attorney Joseph Nocella, Jr. said in a statement . Jury finds Karony guilty of conspiracy, money laundering, and wire fraud In the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the jury determined that Karony was involved in a conspiracy to defraud the United States, as well as money laundering and wire fraud. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys presented their arguments during the trial that began with jury selection on May 5. The criminal trials against the executive of a cryptocurrency company were widely viewed as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the acting US Attorney for the district, would approach cases of digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump nominee, began serving duty this month. The case began in 2023 with the arrests of Karony, former Chief Technology Officer Thomas Smith, and SafeMoon founder Kyle Nagy. Prosecutors alleged Karony and his “co-conspirators” misled investors about the structure and safety of SafeMoon, a token issued in 2021 that applied a 10% transaction tax on transfers. Half of that fee was purportedly redistributed to token holders, while the remainder was said to be locked in a liquidity pool to support trading. The Justice Department said Karony and others retained access to the liquidity pool and diverted substantial funds for personal use. During the trial, Smith testified against Karony, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and remained at large as of May 21. It was, however, unclear when Karony will be back in court for a sentencing hearing. He could spend over 40 years in prison for his role in defrauding and money laundering activities. On the other hand, Smith, who is said to have agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors, stands to get a lighter sentence. Karony’s trial came after a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York; a judge sentenced him to a 12-year prison term following a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison after going to trial, having previously maintained his innocence. Karony takes to social media to proclaim innocence as trial unfolds Karony turned to social media to defend himself, claiming he was innocent as his trial for fraud and money laundering charges started in New York. This came after he shared an X post on May 6, likely after the court proceedings had concluded for the day. He declared that he was innocent and did not commit fraud in response to news coverage about his trial. The trial, which is expected to last until May 26, has received less media coverage than other crypto cases, like the sentencing of former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Following Karony’s pleading not guilty to charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering, he had been out on a $3 million bond since February 2024. As the public eagerly waits for Karony’s sentencing hearing in court, fear has struck them as this is yet another crypto executive’s involvement in a fraud case. Investors may, therefore, decide to hold back, their investment dragging crypto space development behind.

CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch Before Stage 9 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing serious attention as Stage 8 approaches its final phase, with over $8 million raised and a hard listing target of $0.007. Unlike legacy coins where much of the upside is already priced in, MAGA offers structured scarcity, surging demand, and transparent price discovery. Analysts are projecting a 35x–40x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum continues. Whale allocations, rapid presale sellouts, and a capped 100 billion token supply audited by HashEx are positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity for Q2 and Q3 2025. Bitcoin: Macro Momentum and Whale Accumulation Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, having gained over 14% in the past 30 days and holding well above $100,000 7 . On-chain data shows major wallets accumulating, with ETF inflows stabilizing and analysts forecasting a plausible rally toward $150,000 if current trends hold. As Bitcoin’s macro narrative strengthens, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefitting from increased capital rotation. XRP: Derivatives, ETFs, and Global Settlement XRP is trading at $2.35, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. The launch of CME futures and growing ETF speculation are fueling institutional interest, while legal clarity and Ripple’s expanding partnerships are setting the stage for XRP to serve as a global settlement infrastructure asset. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end, with $15 as a stretch target if ETF adoption accelerates. As institutional flows grow, many investors are also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside. Solana: Whale Accumulation and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $169.25, up 1.84% in the last 24 hours, and has rebounded over 50% from recent lows. Whale accumulation is accelerating, with large wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges and analysts now eyeing the $200 level as a short-term target. While $1,000 remains a bold call, Solana’s bullish momentum is undeniable, but the most aggressive capital is also moving into MAGACOIN FINANCE for earlier, higher-multiple potential. NEAR Protocol: Quiet Growth and Breakout Potential NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is trading at $2.76, up 1% in the past 24 hours. Its developer ecosystem and integrations are expanding, but NEAR still lags the market leaders in momentum. As capital seeks undervalued networks, many NEAR holders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Smart capital is converging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin as the top altcoin picks for the 2025 bull run. With Stage 8 nearly full, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

The Australian Securities and Investment Commission said on May 21 that it wants to ask the High Court of Australia to clarify what the definition of a financial product is and clarify the circumstances when an interest-earning product and the conversion of assets from one form to another are regulated. “The definition of financial product was drafted in a broad and technology-neutral way, and ASIC believes it is in the public interest to clarify this,” the watchdog said. “This clarification is important as it applies to all financial products and services whether they involve crypto-assets or not.” On April 22, Federal Court Justices David O’Callaghan, Wendy Abraham and Catherine Button found that Block Earner’s crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product is not a financial product , a managed investment scheme or a derivative under the Corporations Act. ASIC said the court will consider its application. Special leave is required in an appeal to the High Court, and it’s only granted in cases where it would answer significant legal questions or matters of public interest. A Block Earner spokesperson told Cointelegraph the matter has now escalated to a “broader legal question” around the definition of a financial product, which extends “well beyond Block Earner, and the crypto sector.” “We believe the Full Federal Court’s April ruling was a strong and well-reasoned decision that upheld the integrity of our operations,” the spokesperson said. “We remain confident in the soundness of that judgment and will respond to ASIC’s application through the appropriate legal channels.” Legal saga ongoing since 2022 ASIC first launched legal proceedings against Block Earner in November 2022, arguing the company needed a financial services license to offer its yield product, which was available from March 17, 2022, until the company shut it down on Nov. 16, 2022. Related: Australia outlines crypto regulation plan, promises action on debanking ASIC was arguing Block Earner needed a financial services license to offer its crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product. Source: ASIC In February 2024, an Australian court initially ruled the fintech firm would need a financial services license to operate its crypto yield-bearing products . Another June 2024 ruling in Australia’s Federal Court released Block Earner from any financial penalties because it had “acted honestly” and pursued its legal opinions before launching the products, which ASIC appealed. Block Earner appealed the Federal Court’s decision that it needed a financial services license on July 9, 2024.

As one of the top cryptocurrencies in the market, SOL’s momentum is hard to ignore, but its already-high price point has some investors searching elsewhere for more explosive upside. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a cheap crypto with analysts projecting a possible surge to $5, and potentially even faster than Solana can get to $500. Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale offers tokens at a price of $0.03 per unit. Acquisition by more than 11,000 presale buyers has produced a robust investor backing that has raised $9 million. Buyers of Mutuum Finance Phase tokens during this phase get 100% profit at the projected $0.06 launch price. For those asking what crypto to buy now with high ROI potential, this low-price altcoin might just be the unexpected frontrunner of 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: Path to $500 Still Intact Solana (SOL) is also cementing its position as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, as analysts forecast a push higher to $500 during this bull run. SOL is currently trading at approximately $170 and is riding a high of new developers’ activity, DeFi integration, and meme coin resurgence, all of which are restoring investors’ confidence. The anticipation of a Solana ETF also fuels the speculation that SOL will hit this ambitious price level sooner or later. As institutional interest grows and on-chain metrics persist in strengthening, Solana remains a core holding for those seeking exposure to blue-chip altcoins. Some traders are turning to lower-priced alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for even greater upside, though. Mutuum Finance Presale The project has surpassed a significant milestone as its presale accumulates more than $9 million from participants who have exceeded 11,000 in number. Since Phase 5 initiation the MUTM token value has increased to $0.03 and will steadily grow up to launch at $0.06. Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish direct loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P model because this system represents a superior way of managing assets. Users benefit from automated security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. Strategic Growth & Community Rewards The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing (staking rewards) mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings of new exchanges will improve inter-user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its first users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the most aggressively backed presale tokens of 2025, with over $9 million raised and more than 11,000 investors already onboard. Currently priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, MUTM is on track to hit $0.06 at launch, offering early buyers a projected 100% return before public trading even begins. Secure your position before the next price jump, or risk watching one of 2025’s biggest gainers take off without you.

In contrast, Pi Network (PI) is struggling with a sharp 35% price drop, raising concerns over liquidity and market confidence. While these events unfold, Web3 ai ($WAI) remains focused on growth, positioning itself for future success. Web3 ai is progressing through Stage 5 of its presale for $0.000365. The confirmed listing price of $0.005242 suggests a potential 1747% return. The project features an AI-powered DeFi Yield Farming Advisor, which offers real-time risk assessment and return optimisation. This tool aims to simplify complex farming decisions, making it a reliable choice for those seeking to secure value in the volatile crypto space. XRP’s Whale-Fueled Rally Raises Market Expectations XRP has reached a two-month high, driven by large-scale wallet transactions involving millions of coins. Analysts believe these movements suggest whales may be positioning themselves for a larger market shift. XRP’s price surged beyond previous resistance levels, signalling strong upward momentum. Despite ongoing regulatory concerns, the recent price spike has attracted short-term traders, as whale transactions often signal upcoming market shifts. As large holders consolidate their positions, the rising interest in XRP might indicate a potential buying opportunity, particularly if this momentum persists, making it an asset to monitor closely. Pi Network Faces Volatility After 35% Drop Pi Network’s coin recently saw a sharp 35% drop, adding to the price volatility. The coin had previously experienced a rally, but the quick sell-off following that increase has raised doubts about its long-term stability. Speculation suggests that early holders might be cashing out, contributing to the price decline. This has led to concerns about the network’s liquidity and overall stability. Despite these issues, Pi Network’s large user base and active development efforts still keep it in the spotlight. While the risk remains high, there may still be opportunities for a price rebound if it stabilises. Web3 ai’s DeFi Yield Farming Advisor Sets It Apart from Market Volatility DeFi farming can deliver high rewards, but it also carries significant risks. Without effective risk management, buyers may face quick losses. Web3 ai addresses this issue with its AI-powered DeFi Yield Farming Advisor, designed to help buyers navigate the complexities of yield farming. The tool that would be functional at launch monitors farming pools, smart contracts, and market shifts in real time, reducing the likelihood of costly mistakes. Unlike platforms that only show annual percentage yields (APYs), Web3 ai provides a detailed overview of farming opportunities. It analyses risks and rewards, enabling more informed and strategic decisions. The tool would work seamlessly in the background, so buyers can benefit without needing to constantly track their assets. Currently, the WAI coin is available in Stage 5 of the presale at $0.000365. The expected listing price of $0.005242 offers a potential return of 1747%. With over $4.5 million raised, Web3 ai is gaining traction and positioning itself as an essential tool for those looking to navigate DeFi farming with confidence. This AI-driven platform is designed to help buyers take advantage of the opportunities within DeFi farming while avoiding the risks that often come with it. The combination of real-time monitoring and comprehensive insights makes Web3 ai a valuable addition to any DeFi strategy. Conclusion XRP whale activity and Pi Network’s volatility may generate short-term excitement, but they fail to offer lasting user value. XRP’s price rise, fueled by whale transactions and Pi Network’s erratic behaviour, highlights how sentiment can shift quickly in the crypto market. In contrast, Web3 ai brings real long-term value through its AI-powered DeFi Yield Farming Advisor. This tool, set to launch with the platform, will help users manage risk and maximise returns, offering practical, ongoing utility. Currently priced at just $0.000365 in Stage 5 and aiming for a $0.005242 listing, Web3 ai presents a strong 1,747% ROI opportunity. With over $4.5 million already raised, market confidence is clearly growing, positioning Web3 ai as a reliable asset with long-term potential.

44930324,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=755951,1747875610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/44930324.jpeg,Solana’s BONK Targets 77% Corrective Move After Retrace To 200 EMA,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bonk/bonk-target-77-corrective-move/,"BONK’s price action has been back and forth in May, and the cryptocurrency is now essentially back where it started the month. Recent price action reveals that the token is attempting to stabilize at around the 200 EMA after being rejected by the local high near the 0.00002581 level. This rejection led to a measured pullback towards $0.00001820. However, according to a technical analysis on the TradingView platform, the retrace appears to be forming a bullish continuation setup with a 77% corrective move in view rather than indicating a bearish reversal. Bullish Market Structure Holds Firm For BONK BONK’s price retracement has brought it directly into a zone of heavy technical interest. At the heart of this confluence lies the 200 EMA on the 4-hour timeframe, which could technically serve as the next support zone for the meme coin moving forward. In addition, the retracement aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is commonly associated with bullish corrections. It also aligns with a daily support zone around $0.00001832 to $0.00001841 and a resistance zone around $0.00002034. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin, Analyst Says Solana Meme Coin “BONK” Is About To Explode Interestingly, this movement has led to a consolidation between these levels since May 15, and according to the TradingView analyst, the price structure suggests buyers are stepping in to defend the trend. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a higher low. From a volume standpoint, each upward impulse has shown rising volume since the first week of April. However, the recent decline occurred on diminishing volume, hinting at exhaustion from sellers. 77% Upside Move If BONK Breaks Above Resistance Even with the current range, BONK is still within a bullish setup that could send it towards a new 2025 high and possibly towards its current all-time high levels. The important level to watch now is the point of control (POC) resistance at approximately $0.00001955. This level previously acted as the pivot point before the pullback and now serves as the threshold for bullish continuation. Related Reading: This Dogecoin Rival Is Set For An Over 100% Pump – It’s Not Shiba Inu A confirmed close above this region would likely trigger a rapid expansion move toward the next resistance cluster around $0.00002581, before eventually reaching the predicted price target of $0.00003243, which would bring it close to its January 2025 open of $0.000035. As such, the projected target if this plays out will translate to a 77% rally. The price target also aligns with a previous swing high on January 15 and January 18. At the time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.00001995, up by 1,6% in the past 24 hours. Its reaction here, just above the POC resistance, will be an important deciding factor. If buyers manage to maintain pressure and secure a decisive breakout, the stage could be set for a strong rally into the upper resistance band and a retest of BONK’s 2025 swing high.

Ethereum Trading Outlook Softens & Pepe Meme Trend Grows",https://thecoinrise.com/unstaked-presale-to-bring-2700-roi-for-buyers-ethereum-trading-outlook-softens-pepe-meme-trend-grows/,"In today’s changing crypto environment, Ethereum (ETH), Pepe (PEPE), and Unstaked are each drawing attention for different reasons. While the Ethereum trading outlook hints at a short-term drop, despite a 60% rally in the past month, the Pepe (PEPE) meme trend is gaining momentum, almost doubling in value in 30 days, thanks to its viral appeal. But beyond price spikes and volatility, Unstaked is positioning itself differently. Backed by a real utility model and AI-powered tools, Unstaked has already raised over $6.5 million and is advancing quickly through its Stage 13 AI presale, currently priced at just $0.009267. This may be the beginning of something built to last. Pepe’s Price Push Continues Pepe Coin has soared nearly 98% in 30 days, pushing its market cap above $5.7 billion and making it one of the biggest meme coins right now. Trading at $0.0000136, it enjoys strong liquidity and a loyal community. While some technical indicators suggest it might be overbought, analysts still see potential for PEPE to reach $0.000033 by June. Ethereum Trading Outlook Hints at Pullback Ethereum is currently trading at $2,564, showing a 3% gain over the past day and a 60% jump in the last month. Despite that strength, analysts believe a pullback could be on the horizon. Some are forecasting a dip to $2,258 by May 17, a potential 11.6% decline. Still, the Ethereum trading outlook remains mostly positive overall. ETH’s RSI is at 78.92, which indicates it might be overbought in the short term, but many indicators show strength. ETH continues to trade above its 200-day average, and the Fear & Greed Index is reading “Greed,” a sign that optimism is still widespread. For long-term holders, a price correction could be an ideal entry point before Ethereum’s next potential leg up. Unstaked’s AI Ecosystem Offers Real Value and 2,700% ROI Potential Unstaked is not riding trends, it’s building tech. At the heart of its platform is an AI-powered system that allows users to launch autonomous agents across social platforms like X, Telegram, and Discord. These agents engage, post, manage communities, and help execute tasks in real time. What makes Unstaked different is its Proof of Intelligence system. Every action by an agent is tracked on-chain, turning real engagement into real earnings. Instead of just holding tokens, users power AI agents that deliver measurable results. With a current price of $0.009267 in Stage 13 and an estimated launch price of $0.1819, this AI presale offers a possible 2,700% return. Unstaked has already raised over $6.5 million across 13 presale batches. Its $1 million giveaway adds to the momentum, with 20 winners set to receive $50,000 each.

While Solana, Bitcoin, and XRP continue to dominate the top tier, one new contender is rapidly capturing trader attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 now live, over $8 million raised, and whale inflows accelerating, traders from across the ecosystem—including major Solana and Bitcoin holders—are pivoting toward what’s now ranked as one of the most explosive breakout candidates of Q2 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Driver Fueling Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin is holding strong at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC since mid-April. Institutional inflows and ETF demand remain robust, with May price forecasts calling for an average of $121,351 and potential highs of $137,264. As BTC consolidates above $100K, capital is flowing into high-upside altcoins—MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the top of that list for traders seeking the next 10,000% run. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The #1 Breakout Entry of the Moment MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen a surge in whale accumulation as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% in presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025. Analysts forecast 35x–185x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside if current momentum continues. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3. With Stage 8 nearly full and listings approaching, this is the entry window to watch. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading at $2.07, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next resistance levels. As institutional adoption grows and futures products launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. Solana: Whale Buying and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $166.71, consolidating after a sharp rally and drawing attention from large investors. Whale accumulation is on the rise, with major wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges in recent days. Analysts are targeting $200 as the next major resistance, but many are also rotating into presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater potential returns. Ethereum and Aptos: Quiet Accumulation, Early-Stage Rotation Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, rebounding from recent lows and showing renewed technical strength. With DeFi growth and ETF speculation, ETH is poised for a potential breakout toward $2,750–$2,900 in the coming months. Aptos (APT) is also seeing quiet accumulation, but as capital seeks sharper upside, more traders are rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts Bitcoin and Solana whales are moving first, but XRP traders are quickly following as MAGACOIN FINANCE cements itself as 2025’s most-watched presale. With robust demand, a clear listing roadmap, and analysts projecting 35x–185x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

The VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund is expected to launch in June 2025. It will direct strategic capital to companies with real-world use cases issuing tokens on the Avalanche network. Unlike many crypto funds that pursue hype or short-term momentum, this is a fund that looks over the horizon. It aims to support mission-driven entrepreneurs building lasting value through blockchain-enabled technology. It goes after companies launching tokens with actual utility — not just speculation. The fund will make liquid token investments and early-stage venture-backed blockchain projects, focusing on areas like gaming, financial services, payments , and AI. Most investments will be made at or soon after the project’s Token Generation Event (TGE), when their tokens are first offered to the public. It’s VanEck’s play to back founders who are building for the future, not a quick pump. VanEck’s experienced team drives focused investment The team that runs the VanEck Digital Assets Alpha Fund (DAAF) will co-manage the fund . Since 2022, DAAF has garnered a reputation for investing in scalable liquid tokens associated with real-world products. And with more than $100 million in AUM, DAAF is one of the most steady performers in digital assets. This new fund builds on that success but focuses exclusively on the Avalanche network. Avalanche is now one of the most active and valuable blockchain ecosystems , with a market worth nearly $50 billion. It is recognized for its high speed, low costs, and a growing list of enterprise and decentralized applications. VanEck sees Avalanche as a hub for serious developers creating projects beyond crypto speculation. These builders are focusing on real-world sectors like fintech, real-world assets (RWAs), and artificial intelligence (AI). Capital in the bank will get put to work on-chain via Avalanche-native RWA products such as tokenized money market funds. This maintains the fund’s liquidity and supports economic activity on the Avalanche blockchain. Fund backs builders adding tangible value The PurposeBuilt Fund is about more than just capital — it’s about conviction. “The next wave of value in crypto will come from real businesses, not more infrastructure,” says Pranav Kanade, portfolio manager at VanEck Digital Assets. He thinks Avalanche has already become a beacon for intelligent founders, and the PurposeBuilt Fund hopes to offer them the financial underpinning and subsequent ongoing refuge they require. The crypto market frequently rewards short-term trends and meme coins. Yet, the founders of valuable blockchain applications often draw less attention. These earnest builders run uphill, contending for attention and capital in a noisy market. The PurposeBuilt Fund aims to change that. It provides an alternative source of patient capital that matches long-term aims. It gives developers & startup teams a framework to build for utility, adoption & longevity rather than pump-n-dump token price action. According to John Nahas, Chief Business Officer at Ava Labs, the launch of the VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund marks a turning point for the blockchain industry. He said the industry is shifting from “reality distortion to reality,” emphasizing that the focus is moving away from theoretical discussions about the technology’s potential and toward what is being built and used—and by whom. Nahas noted that the sector is evolving from one dominated by day traders to one that recognizes the true value of distributed trust. He added that the VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund provides the long-term capital and strategic support builders need to lead this transformation. Avalanche already hosts projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, AI, tokenized securities, and institutional finance. These apps are not only being adopted by the crypto native but also by traditional businesses and web2 platforms.

ProCap had boosted its IPO from $200 million to $220 million on May 20, a day before its public launch, pricing its 22 million shares on offer at $10 each. ProCap shares closed the May 21 trading day up 7% at $10.70, which continued with a 1.6% bump after-hours to $10.87, Yahoo Finance data shows. PCAPU’s share price closed up 7% on its debut trading day. Source: Yahoo Finance The company has offered underwriters a 45-day option to buy up to 3.3 million additional shares at the IPO price to cover extra demand. ProCap said in an April 30 regulatory filing that the firm will be a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) that will look to invest in, and potentially take public, companies in the financial services, digital asset, asset management or healthcare sectors. Pompliano is one of the crypto industry’s biggest cheerleaders , hosting a Bitcoin and finance-focused podcast and leading investment firm Professional Capital Management. Pompliano told CNBC on May 21 that he had been itching to take a company public over the last five years but hadn’t seen enough demand in the private market until six months ago, citing recent changes to the US regulatory landscape affecting financial markets. Related: Texas House passes strategic Bitcoin reserve bill He hinted that his blank-check firm would invest in crypto-native and traditional finance businesses as he expects the sectors to converge in the coming years. “The reason why I use the term financial services is basically the new digital world and the old incumbent world are all merging.” SPACs haven’t been done right in the past, Pomp says On CNBC, Pompliano was pressed on why he chose to make ProCap a SPAC, which have historically seen high failure rates due to sponsor conflicts, dilution, speculative valuations and regulatory scrutiny. Pompliano said SPACs have gotten a bad reputation because companies often treat them like public venture capital, targeting high-growth companies that are losing a lot of money at high valuations. Pompliano noted he has put “millions of dollars” of his own money on the line. “We’ve got real skin in the game,” Pompliano said, adding: “I’m taking a huge reputation risk.” Brent Saunders, CEO of health products firm Bausch + Lomb, also joined as a strategic adviser . Saunders completed over $300 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions over the last 17 years.

Thirty-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields catapulted to 3.15% this week, eclipsing every prior high since the tenor’s 1999 debut. That print triggered an instant warning from the markets newsletter The Kobeissi Letter: “Japan’s bond market is imploding… Japan’s 30Y Government Bond Yield has officially surged to its highest level in history, at 3.15%. For decades, Japan was known for low long-term interest rates. Now they are dealing with high inflation, shifting policy outlook, and a whopping 260% Debt-to-GDP ratio.” Liquidity, always fragile at the long end of Tokyo’s curve, vanished just hours later. From New York, Zerohedge relayed traders’ disbelief: “This is unbelievable: for the second day in a row, Japan’s bond market is bidless, with both 30Y and 40Y JGB yields at record highs. Meanwhile, as the world’s 2nd biggest bond market is imploding, the BOJ is pretending nothing is happening.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top Inside the Diet, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba delivered a stark political gloss: Japan’s fiscal plight, he conceded, is now “worse than Greece,” a phrase that would have been unthinkable during the deflationary 2010s. That assessment lands just as gross public debt pushes toward 260% of GDP and as Japanese investors—who still hold roughly $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries—contemplate selling overseas paper to shore up domestic books. Why This Is Ultra-Bullish For Bitcoin For Bitcoin analysts, the chain of causality is brutally clear. Pseudonymous macro voice Stack Hodler wrote to his followers: “Everyone expects Yield Curve Control. But Japan already tried YCC and look at what it got them—a spectacular bond-market implosion happening right in front of us. Now every Japanese bank, pension fund, and insurance company that trusted the Bank of Japan is holding a massive bag of flaming excrement… If this is the end result of YCC, why would any rational investor hold sovereign debt from severely indebted nations? Central-bank credibility is shattering in real time. Scarce neutral reserve assets—Bitcoin and gold—need to be repriced dramatically higher.” Dan Tapiero, founder of the $3.9 billion digital-asset vehicle 10T Holdings, reached much the same conclusion in fewer words: “Quietly…and off the radar…the Japanese long-bond yields are going parabolic. Time to watch Japan…Unsustainable deficits have been the norm for 30 yrs…Now a problem. Very bullish gold and Bitcoin.” The systemic-risk argument tightens further when one zooms out to the global balance sheet. Author Bruce Florian frames the macro math as musical chairs with a finite number of safe havens: “There are three times more debts than GDP, and interest rates are twice as high as economic growth… It’s like a game of musical chairs. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Fate May Be Sealed On June 9, Analyst Warns Everyone knows there are fewer chairs than players.” Florian highlights the feedback loop linking Tokyo and Washington: “The biggest buyer of US debt has been Japan… But this customer is now in financial trouble… There’s a high chance Japan will sell some of these bonds to stabilize its own situation… In a year when the USA needs to refinance $8 trillion, what happens if no buyers show up? The Fed will monetize the debt.” The punch line, he insists, is Bitcoin: “Bitcoin is shifting from a ‘nice-to-have’ asset to a must-have asset… In a world of unlimited debt, scarcity is the most radical form of reason.” Wall Street heavyweights are edging toward the same territory. JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon told investors on Monday, “I’m not a buyer of bonds. The risks are too high.” Ray Dalio wrote that the greater default risk now lies in “currency debasement,” not in missed coupons. And Larry Fink, whose firm’s spot-Bitcoin ETF has absorbed more than $31 billion since January, said on Fox Business that Bitcoin is “an international asset” fit for times when “countries devalue their currencies.” BTC Price Responds Bitcoin’s price action is responding in real time. BTC rose to $107,322 at press time, less than 4% shy of its halving-cycle high. None of this proves that Bitcoin is destined to replace sovereign debt, but the directional shift in marginal flows is no longer hypothetical. When the second-largest bond market on earth shows two consecutive bidless sessions and its prime minister compares the country to Greece, capital chases the assets whose supply cannot be printed. Bitcoin, engineered for hard-cap scarcity, slots neatly into that vacuum. Whether this is the moment sovereign debt loses the mantle of “risk-free” remains to be seen. What is indisputable is that the implosion of Japan’s ultra-long JGBs has handed Bitcoin its clearest macro tail-wind since 2020’s pandemic-era liquidity flood—except this time the narrative is not emergency stimulus but the dawning realization that even advanced nations are running out of balance-sheet room. For a growing cohort of investors, the word bond is beginning to rhyme less with safety and more with risk, while Bitcoin is rhyming—loudly—with insurance.

From institutional buyers to early-stage speculators, the spotlight is now on four tokens: Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA), and TRON (TRX). Each brings a distinct edge—macro leadership, payment utility, early-stage asymmetric potential, and high-throughput infrastructure. But for those seeking the biggest ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the most aggressively positioned altcoin in the space. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Backed for Major Returns MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly emerged as one of the top early-stage altcoins of 2025, with analysts calling it a rare opportunity for 20x–35x returns before listings begin. With Stage 8 live, over $8 million raised, and a fixed listing target of $0.007, MAGA’s blend of political branding, scarcity-driven 100 billion token supply, and Hashex-audited contracts is fueling massive momentum. As Stage 8 accelerates, those entering now are acting on a clear risk-reward model, not just hype. With listings approaching, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly ranked as the #1 altcoin presale for 2025, and analysts say 35x–50x returns are possible as demand surges. XRP: Utility, Legal Clarity, and Institutional Momentum XRP is staging one of the strongest comebacks in crypto history, trading at $2.38 as of May 21, 2025. With full legal clarity in the U.S. and a CME futures launch on the horizon, XRP is being positioned as the primary settlement and liquidity token for global financial institutions. Technical indicators suggest a bullish continuation, with analysts forecasting a move to $3 and beyond as volume and institutional interest grow. Ethereum: Technical Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,593.53, up 1.66% in the past 24 hours and showing strong performance after a 50% rally in the past month. As the cornerstone of DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 innovation, Ethereum’s rising institutional interest and rapid Layer-2 adoption continue to bolster its outlook. Analysts expect ETH to push toward $3,000–$4,000 if support holds, with long-term targets even higher. Bitcoin: Macro Anchor as Capital Rotates Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $107,438, up 1.33% in the last 24 hours and maintaining its position above $106,000 after a strong May rally. While BTC remains the macro anchor and foundation for the market, capital is rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ethereum as traders seek sharper returns. TRON: High-Throughput Utility and Steady Growth TRON (TRX) is trading at $0.27, with analysts forecasting a stable range for May and June 2025. TRON’s consistent throughput and low fees make it a favorite for payment corridors and DeFi applications. As speculative capital rotates, many TRX holders are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper early-stage upside. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion The smart money in May 2025 is moving with conviction—rotating into tokens with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the foundation, XRP and TRON offer scale and utility, but MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the strategic early entry for those seeking life-changing returns. With Stage 8 heating up and listings on the horizon, this could be the defining moment to secure a position before the next wave begins.

The previous peak for Bitcoin ( BTC ), reached during President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, was surpassed in late morning trading, according to crypto.news data. The buying momentum sustained after U.S. equity markets closed with the largest cryptocurrency by market cap pushing above $110,000. Bitcoin has gained more than 4.5% in the past 24 hours and over 23% in the last month, reflecting a sharp reversal from April’s downturn.

Since late April, the S&P 500 has climbed 15%, while the Nasdaq is up more than 21%. Analysts attribute the bounce to growing optimism that President Trump’s trade policies may be less aggressive than initially feared. After introducing steep tariffs in early April—including a blanket 10% import tax and additional penalties for Chinese goods—the White House signaled a partial retreat . A 90-day pause on the most severe measures was announced last week by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent following negotiations with Chinese officials. Bitcoin initially fell to a two-month low of $76,000 shortly after Trump unveiled the tariffs, reflecting market fears over a broader global slowdown. Despite Bitcoin’s reputation as a hedge against traditional financial assets, it often trades in tandem with risk-on equities, especially tech stocks.

Enclave Markets CEO Phil Wirtjes said the rally was “likely aided by policy advancements,” particularly bipartisan progress on stablecoin legislation . A draft bill that would establish clearer rules for USD-backed digital tokens has gained traction in the Senate. Institutional demand has also picked up. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $329 million in inflows over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s latest rally raises questions about how much of its performance is driven by macro versus crypto-native factors. While regulatory clarity and ETF inflows are key tailwinds, the correlation with stocks suggests that investor appetite for risk remains a dominant force in both arenas.

During an interview on Wednesday , David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s top crypto and artificial intelligence advisor, made the bold prediction. “If we provide the legal clarity and legal framework for this, I think we could create trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight, very quickly.” Sacks said in an interview . The targeted legislation is the GENIUS Act, which is short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins. It would seek to establish federal standards for how stablecoins are originated and governed. This week, the bill passed a key test in the US Senate on a 66-32 cloture vote. This means it has cleared the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster. Fifteen Democrats sided with Republicans in endorsing the measure — a testament to unusual bipartisan support. Under the bill, stablecoin issuers must hold reserves to cover every token they put into circulation. Those reserves must be easily accessible and safe assets, such as cash or US Treasury bonds. The idea is to make sure stablecoins remain exactly that: stable. David Sacks described the bill as “a national economic strategy” that would strengthen the US dollar in the internet industry. He said stablecoins provide a new, more efficient, cheaper, and real-time settlement payment system. Trump family’s crypto involvement raises financial and ethical concerns The bill has gained support but has also courted controversy , mostly because of the deep ties between the Trump family and the crypto industry. World Liberty Financial launched its stablecoin, USD1, backed by President Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. US Treasuries and dollar deposits collateralize this coin — the precise type of asset that the GENIUS Act would sanction and regulate. Earlier this month, Abu Dhabi-based investment fund MGX pledged a significant investment in USD1, routing the funds through Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. This marks the largest investment in the Trump-linked stablecoin to date. The development has alarmed many Democrats, who warn that the bill could funnel money directly into the President’s and his family’s financial pockets, creating an unprecedented conflict of interest. Senator Elizabeth Warren and other critics demand that stronger ethical safeguards be incorporated into the legislation to prevent elected officials from profiting personally. Despite those fears, Sacks expressed confidence that the bill would pass. However, he declined to address questions regarding Trump’s financial ties to crypto. Investors flock to stablecoins as Bitcoin surges past $110,000 Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the United States dollar. Unlike Bitcoin or many other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are intended to remain steady and easy to use as payment. Their popularity is skyrocketing. A recent report by Deutsche Bank revealed that transactions of $28 trillion worth of stablecoins were conducted last year — more than even Visa and Mastercard combined. The stablecoin space is currently led by Tether, representing over 60% of the market, and is banked in the US by Cantor Fitzgerald. For now, bitcoin keeps soaring. It reached a fresh high on Wednesday at nearly $110,000 a coin. Sacks believes that stablecoins can be a tool to help the US keep the dollar strong in a world that’s going online and fast. “It also gives the dollar continued dominance online,” he said.

As major digital assets fluctuate, attention has turned toward altcoins promising substantial growth amid shifting market dynamics. Qubetics has emerged as a strong contender in this space, offering a compelling mix of real-world utility, advanced scalability, and AI-driven innovation. Identifying the top altcoin for massive return potential has become a critical focus for market participants—and Qubetics is increasingly being recognized as a project poised to deliver outsized gains in a volatile environment. One such project rising above the noise is Qubetics ($TICS), positioned to solve real-world challenges that older cryptocurrencies have struggled to address. With its unique ecosystem and ongoing crypto presale, Qubetics is attracting considerable attention as the next top altcoin for massive return potential. This article explores why Bitcoin, despite its dominance, may have been a missed opportunity for many, while Qubetics provides a fresh avenue with promising upside. Bitcoin: The Missed Giant in the Race for Massive Returns Bitcoin undeniably revolutionized finance by introducing decentralized digital currency to the masses. It sparked a global movement and built the foundation for the entire crypto industry. However, many who overlooked Bitcoin in its early days now reflect on missed chances to secure extraordinary returns. The cryptocurrency’s historical price surges from mere cents to tens of thousands of dollars per token remain legendary. Despite Bitcoin’s pioneering status, its scalability issues, transaction fees, and environmental concerns have led to growing interest in alternative projects that can deliver faster, more versatile solutions. Bitcoin’s relatively high price per token today presents barriers to new entrants seeking exposure to crypto growth without risking excessive capital. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s established presence often overshadows innovative projects that might offer higher growth trajectories. In a market where timing is critical, missing Bitcoin’s early rise serves as a cautionary tale. Meanwhile, altcoins with advanced technology stacks, targeted use cases, and accessible entry points are becoming increasingly attractive. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential Qubetics is redefining the possibilities of blockchain utility with its multi-application ecosystem designed to serve businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Unlike many projects that focus solely on speculation, Qubetics delivers practical tools and decentralized services that address real-life problems — from secure cross-border transactions to developer-friendly integrated development environments. Currently in its 35th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 513 million tokens to more than 26,800 holders, raising upwards of $17.2 million. The token is priced at an accessible $0.2785 during this phase, making it an enticing entry point for those aiming to capitalize on future growth. Analysts project that $TICS could reach $1 post-presale, representing a 258% return on investment, with even more optimistic forecasts placing it at $5 or higher after the mainnet launch. Application and Ecosystem Impact Qubetics introduces several core applications including QubeQode and Qubetics IDE, which empower users with decentralized tools for privacy, coding, and asset tokenization. QubeQode facilitates secure, private communication and transactions across borders. Businesses dealing with international clients benefit from lower fees and increased security, making it an attractive alternative to traditional financial networks. Qubetics IDE targets developers by providing an intuitive, decentralized development environment that supports multi-chain projects and seamless integration with blockchain protocols. Scenarios illustrate the ecosystem’s potential: A freelance developer in Central Asia leverages Qubetics IDE to build and deploy smart contracts without intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing transparency. An export-import firm uses QubeQode to conduct cross-border payments securely and quickly, bypassing slow legacy banking systems and avoiding hefty transaction fees. Individual users concerned with data privacy rely on Qubetics’ decentralized VPN features to safeguard their online activities without sacrificing speed or reliability. These real-world applications position Qubetics as a versatile platform beyond mere speculation, increasing its appeal and utility within the growing digital economy. Presale Details and Price Projections The ongoing presale offers a rare opportunity to acquire $TICS tokens at an early stage price of $0.2785. This presale phase, now at stage 35, reflects strong community support and growing confidence in the project’s roadmap. With over 513 million tokens sold and a holder base exceeding 26,800, momentum is accelerating. Price predictions from market analysts suggest: At $1 post-presale: approximately 258% ROI At $5 post-mainnet launch: approximately 1694% ROI At $10 to $15 post-mainnet launch: estimated returns soaring above 5000%, reflecting the disruptive potential of Qubetics technology and adoption trends. Such projections underscore why Qubetics is rapidly becoming the top altcoin for massive return potential within the crypto space. Conclusion: Seizing the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential The cryptocurrency market’s dynamic market rewards timely decisions and strategic insights. Bitcoin’s rise was a historic opportunity, yet many missed the chance to capitalize on its early gains. Presently, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as the top altcoin for massive return potential , backed by innovative applications, a strong presale performance, and bullish analyst forecasts. Securing $TICS tokens at the current crypto presale price represents a compelling proposition for those seeking exposure to next-generation blockchain technology. Acting swiftly to acquire Qubetics during its crypto presale phase could unlock remarkable gains. The top altcoin for massive return potential today offers a unique blend of practicality and growth, making it a worthy contender for portfolio inclusion. Awareness and informed choices will remain crucial in navigating this growing crypto market.

Bullish momentum is reinforced by weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index and limited upside in the S&P 500, favoring capital rotation into cryptocurrencies. Potential risks include a bearish Deep Crab pattern and political uncertainty around the U.S. strategic cryptocurrency reserve, but these are not my base case. I will reconsider my outlook if Bitcoin falls below $106,140, but current sentiment and technicals support further upside in the near term. When I last covered Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) on March 2nd, 2025, with my article “Bitcoin: I Was Wrong”, cryptocurrency prices were beginning to lose some of the luster that was present following President Donald Trump’s public comments suggesting that he intended to become the world’s first cryptocurrency President . Of course, these were not just words, there were real actions supporting the bullish long-term cryptocurrency outlook in the United States . Of course, these are deeply positive scenarios for anyone holding large-cap cryptocurrencies, and BTC-USD prices have responded in kind. Since my last analysis was developed, BTC-USD has actually gained by more than +13% even while the S&P 500 has encountered losses of -1.81%. But the story is a bit more complicated than that because bitcoin prices have actually been on a bit more of a roller coaster ride than those somewhat subtle gains might imply. Given bitcoin’s ability to recover losses and form a base at elevated levels, I am raising my rating outlook to a “strong buy” while this newest rally is still in its earliest stages. Bitcoin: Substantial Two-Way Reversals (Income Generator via TradingView ) First, let’s quickly define the most recent “rally” because there are definitely elements of the bitcoin trend that seem to contradict this outwardly bullish assertion. As we can see in the chart above, BTC-USD actually continued to drop (by about -22%) after my prior pessimistic article was published. As a result, I suppose that you could say I was “right” about being “wrong” but market prices quickly reversed into the positive direction after falling below $75,000. This reversal is essentially the main reason I will have to eat some crow with my analysis update today because the bullish trend wave was forceful enough to generate gains of nearly 48% and break above an all-time high resistance level in the process. Bitcoin: Significance of Recent Breakout (Income Generator via TradingView ) When discussing these events with my own trading group, I described the price action of the last few days as being a textbook example of a consolidation zone. Whenever you are dealing with the test of an all-time high (especially when dealing with a high-volume and highly volatile trading asset), the general expectation is that selling pressure is likely to start building as prices continue moving upward. Unfortunately, this can occur either as short-sellers begin to emerge near a critical resistance zone or as bullish cryptocurrency investors start to take profits on prior successful trades. Bitcoin prices, however, really did not experience very much of this type of price action. Almost like a snake hiding in the grass and waiting to strike its prey, BTC-USD prices hovered just below the triple-top resistance region near $107,355 (as well as the +2 standard deviation on the shorter-term time frames). When we did not see any significant pullback from the $107,355 level, I immediately flipped bullish because there were two different negative technical signals (bearish triple-top resistance pattern and the movement of prices into the +2 standard deviation) and neither of them were having much of an effect. Bullish volumes were also rising quite sharply right into this resistance level, and all of this essentially provided a perfect storm of bullish elements that allowed buyers to overcome sellers and print a new record high. Bitcoin: Comparative Trends in U.S. Dollar Index (Income Generator via TradingView ) In order to get a better sense of where cryptocurrency trends are actually headed next, I think it might be important to assess relative performances in peripheral asset classes. As the world’s reserve currency , trends in the U.S. Dollar are often best assessed using the U.S. Dollar Index, and we can see some interesting developments for the greenback when looking at the daily timeframe. Specifically, we can see that the U.S. Dollar Index recently invalidated prior trend momentum readings in the Relative Strength Index ((RSI)) near the beginning of this month. However, upside follow-through has been lacking, with the RSI breaking back below the daily exponential moving average (EMA). In the chart above, this activity is shown with the purple line in the indicator panel falling under the yellow exponential moving average. Importantly, share prices themselves are also trading back below all four major exponential moving averages (20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day periods) and this gives us a bearish confluence of events that seems to contradict the negative momentum break that was experienced earlier this month. As a result, our next downside price target for the U.S. Dollar Index is not seen until 97.921 (April 21st, 2025 lows). Overall, I expect this to have a positive BTC-USD impact in terms of price action - at least until major support in the U.S. Dollar Index is retested (and confirmed to hold). Bitcoin: Comparative Trends in S&P 500 (Income Generator via TradingView ) Another major peripheral asset that cryptocurrency trades should be watching would be the S&P 500 itself. At this stage, it is probably becoming irritating for many investors to listen to stock pundits talk about the potential for cryptocurrencies to become safe-haven assets . But if this characterization is actually an accurate characterization of the market majority, it might be reasonable to suggest that declining momentum in the S&P 500 could actually become beneficial for bitcoin investors. Based on the chart above, bullish BTC-USD arguments can be made right now, due to the fact that the S&P 500 has already failed at resistance following the sizable rallies that emerged after the crash into $4,835.04 in early April. Of course, the May 19th price highs at $5,968.61 rests less than 3% below the S&P 500’s all-time high of $6,147.43. For all of these reasons, I think it is very difficult to make the argument that the S&P 500 has a great deal of upside potential when the benchmark has already recovered most of the losses that have been experienced since January 31st, 2025. Bitcoin: Potential Bearish Signals (Income Generator via TradingView ) If we do believe that the potential for upside is limited in both the U.S. Dollar Index and S&P 500, where would we then expect investors to start flocking next? Small-cap stocks might be one possibility, perhaps treasuries might be another (especially given the long-term complexities of the current market environment). However, if broader selling pressure in DXY and the major U.S. stock benchmarks is not far away, bullish cryptocurrency investors really needed to see a break of important resistance levels in BTC-USD. This week, this did occur as the time-tested flagship cryptocurrency broke through prior all-time highs, but I will also mention potential risks to the positive outlook. In the chart above, we can see that even though historical resistance zones have been invalidated, cryptocurrency prices are still trading outside the +2 standard deviation and a bearish harmonic pattern has developed after the rally from just above $102,105 on May 19th. Specifically, this is a bearish Deep Crab pattern, and it is large enough to suggest that BTC-USD prices could fall back below $100,500 if the pattern reaches a full point of completion (which does not occur in a large majority of instances). We must also be aware of the fact that there has been a great deal of criticism with respect to the viability of President Donald Trump’s strategic cryptocurrency reserve, so much so that a BBC News article actually used the term “ pig in lipstick ” to describe Trump’s plans for a cryptocurrency future. Of course, if these criticisms turn out to be accurate, I think we might see the U.S. government reconsider efforts to operate the strategic cryptocurrency reserve under the next administration. Unfortunately, any financial news headlines centered in this direction would likely be accepted unfavorably by the cryptocurrency market, and I think that this is the type of event that could lead to the next crypto winter (if these types of events actually materialize). Of course, there are a lot of unknowns here and that negative scenario is not my base case right now. Ultimately, I think that the recent breaks of important resistance levels suggests that market sentiment is actually quite healthy and that the influence of short-sellers is diminishing in size. For all of these reasons, I am upgrading my BTC-USD outlook to a “strong buy” rating and I will reconsider my outlook if we see bitcoin fall below $106,140 (near-term pivot lows recorded during the May 21st trading session).",BTC-USD|SP500|DXY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-22 02:30:00

Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a new all-time high of $110,788.98 on Coinbase late on May 21, just before 11:30 pm UTC, according to TradingView. Bitcoin has gained around 3% over the last 24 hours, surpassing its all-time high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its previously long-held Jan. 20 peak. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now gained 17.5% so far this year and is up 47% since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets. Bitcoin’s new peak comes as US stock markets were rattled by a weak 20-year bond auction, which sent treasury yields soaring on May 21. The S&P 500 fell 80 points in half an hour while the Nasdaq and Dow Jones mirrored the move, with all US indexes trading down on the day. Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows it has climbed out of a slump earlier this year. Source: TradingView Caroline Bowler, CEO of the Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said in a note to Cointelegraph that Bitcoin’s new high “reflects a mature interest in digital assets worldwide, not the speculative surge seen in past cycles.” “Today’s demand is driven by institutional-grade infrastructure and stronger regulatory clarity. Investor sentiment has shifted decisively, reflecting institutional-style allocations,” she added. According to Google Trends, searches for Bitcoin have been trending down since November and are at lows typical of crypto bear markets, indicating a low retail interest in the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks market sentiment, was at a score of 72 out of 100 on May 22, indicating “greed.” The index is down from its 2025 high of 84 on Jan. 22, which came two days after Trump’s inauguration. Related: How high can Bitcoin price go? Edward Carroll, head of global markets and corporate finance at MHC Digital Group, told Cointelegraph in a note that growing demand driving the price higher in the medium-term could push Bitcoin to at least $160,000 by the fourth quarter of this year and $1 million by 2030. Trader’s leveraged Bitcoin bet tops $1.1B Meanwhile, leverage trader James Wynn’s Bitcoin long position on the crypto platform Hyperliquidity has become the largest onchain margin trade when it exceeded $1.1 billion amid Bitcoin’s price peak. The entry point for the 40x leveraged position was $108,065 and it has an unrealized profit of $20 million. It will be liquidated if Bitcoin’s price falls to $103,800.

The fund has a large allocation to Bitcoin, which could hurt returns if a true 'altseason' were to manifest. At 2.5%, the fund has a high expense ratio and doesn't stake any of the PoS assets under management, producing an opportunity cost relative to holding the assets directly. The top 4 assets make up over 97% of the fund's capital; none of those 4 assets are 'cheap' in my view. At a 14% discount to NAV, BITW could serve as a potential arbitrage trade if/when more spot ETFs cover the crypto market in the US. I've covered the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF (BITW) for Seeking Alpha four times going back to 2023. My general thinking on the fund can be summed up in this way; I like it slightly better than its closest peer, the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ETF (GDLC) because of a broader offering of assets, but I don't think it's the best way to play a rally in the altcoin market at this juncture. While the fund can occasionally serve as an interesting arbitrage opportunity when it trades a steep discount to net asset value, there are disadvantages with both the fund and its construction. In this update, we'll briefly review some of the pros and cons to holding BITW shares, as well as assess how I view the current valuation setup for the fund's top 4 holdings. Pros and Cons of BITW For speculators who want simple exposure to the digital assets in a single ticker, BITW works fine. As I see it, these are the top advantages of BITW over something like GDLC: BITW GDLC AUM $1.44b $775m NAV Per Share $70.90 $48.81 Market Price $60.83 $42.40 Discount to NAV 14.2% 13.1% BTC Weighting 78.0% 79.5% Fund Holdings 10 5 Sources: Grayscale and Bitwise as of May 20th Closing Prices Not only does BITW have a slightly bigger discount to NAV at 14.2% currently, but the fund also offers exposure to more assets than GDLC and has slightly less reliance on BTC for fund performance. With roughly double the AUM than that of GDLC, BITW has strong liquidity and gets a 'B+' liquidity grade from Seeking Alpha. As I see it, there are three important disadvantages to holding a fund like BITW over alternatives; expense ratio, asset weighting, and opportunity cost. At a 2.5% expense ratio, BITW is way too expensive for what is essentially a passively managed fund that is nearly 80% Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Bitcoin Dominance 5/21/25 (CoinGlass) Bitcoin's dominance of the $2.06 trillion digital asset market is 61.5% per CoinGlass data. While this is obviously a large share of the crypto market, BITW and GDLC are both closer to 80% BTC. To be sure, the overwhelming majority of the assets in the cryptocurrency market are entirely uninvestable. Thus, over-weight BTC makes sense. But there are assets held within BITW that I do think could be long-term successes and even potentially outperform BTC over the next 10 to 20 years. In that regard, choosing BITW over something like a self-directed crypto-IRA might not make sense for long-term investors who have a willingness to open such an account - and there are several providers. Another potential issue with BITW is the opportunity cost of holding stake-able assets dormant in a fund that isn't generating yield. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ) collectively make up nearly 15% of BITW positioning. Each of those assets are stake-able for yield and provide investors a positive real yield after token emissions inflation. It is anticipated that staking could soon be permitted in US-based crypto ETFs under the current administration. If such products enter the market, BITW could theoretically trade at a deeper discount to NAV. Top Holdings Valuation Assessment The fund always has 10 assets under management, though those assets with smaller allocations do often change. As of May 20th, BITW asset weightings are as follows: BITW Holdings 5/20/25 (Bitwise) I've already mentioned the large weighting to BTC. From there, ETH commands 11%, XRP ( XRP-USD ) claims 5%, and SOL comes in at 3.2%. With less than 2% combined allocation to the bottom five assets in the fund, I'm not going to spend much time on those networks. However, the top 4 coins in the fund do have a meaningful allocation and represent more than 97% of BITW. We'll take a look at network valuation metrics for those funds and examine what, if any, alternatives there may be for investors who want larger exposure to those assets than what is currently provided by Bitwise. We already know BITW trades at a discount to the fund's liquidation value. But what about the assets themselves? Can we justify such coin prices based on fundamental usage? I've covered Bitcoin's valuation in prior SA pieces. My personal view is that the NVT ratio is a decent way to assess BTC valuation because it utilizes the coin's market cap as well as the dollar-denominated value transferred over the network. BTC Price vs 30 Day Average NVT ( Coin Metrics ) The multi-year trend in BTC's 30-Day average NVT ratio is admittedly not a great one. What this shows is that over the longer term, as BTC's price moves higher, the NVT ratio generally does as well. That said, at 186 currently, the NVT ratio is well-off highs from last summer. I would personally like to see this ratio come down even further. But what I find to be a positive sign currently is the price rise in BTC near the end of last year was accompanied by a deep drop in NVT ratio. This would indicate that the coin price wasn't outgrowing the transferred value. In my view, NVT is good for networks that intend to be 'payment chains.' Because of this, we could choose to view XRP through this lens as well: BTC vs XRP NVT Ratio ( Coin Metrics ) Believe it or not, XRP was actually cheaper than BTC based purely on NVT ratio for most of the last two and half years. While the 220 ratio reading for XRP currently is back ahead of BTC, the long-term trend for XRP's NVT valuation has been quite opposite that of BTC. I'm not arguing either of these coins are 'cheap' based on this metric - quite the opposite, actually. But I think these can be helpful in showing long-term price vs usage trends. For the smart contract chains, fees are a meaningful part of the underlying economics of the networks. There, I like to look at price to fees ratios of the chains: Weekly Circulating P/F Ratios (Token Terminal) Token Terminal's data shows Ethereum is trading at over 760x fees. Based on this metric, Ethereum is now valued more richly than NEAR Protocol ( NEAR-USD ). Solana, which has been cheaper than Ethereum on a circulating P/F multiple since October, is also seeing the ratio generally moving in the wrong direction. At 136x fees currently, Solana has seen significant multiple expansion since February. What Alternatives to BITW Are There? I've already mentioned that investors who have a willingness to open self-direct crypto IRAs can certainly do that. In those types of accounts, there are typically no storage fees, but transaction fees can be high for those who are active traders. There are usually dozens of trade-able digital assets, and it would be quite easy to overweight most of the top 'altcoins' in the market if one were so inclined. However, not everyone wants to open an additional account due to either the inconvenience or the potential personal data security concern - each of which are justifiable in my view. Can BITW's current digital asset exposure be mimicked by purchases of single-asset products that are already available in the market? Possibly. Asset Spot ETF? Closed-End Fund? Leveraged Fund? Bitcoin Yes Yes Yes Ethereum Yes No Yes XRP No No Yes Solana No Yes No Cardano ( ADA-USD ) No No No Sui ( SUI-USD ) No No No ChainLink ( LINK-USD ) No Yes No Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) No No No Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) No Yes No Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) No Yes No Source: Author's compiled data, funds must be secondary market trade-able not only available through private placement As far as I can tell, only three of the assets in BITW are lacking direct exposure through some combination of spot ETFs, closed-end funds, or leveraged funds. Collectively, those three assets make up less than 2% of BITW. So it is theoretically possible to self-direct exposure to the majority of the assets in BITU through a standard brokerage account utilizing the single-asset products that are already available in the market. Closing Thoughts For those who want a simple way to get exposure to some of the top assets in the cryptocurrency market, BITW will work perfectly fine. Potential investors should keep in mind that there are downsides to getting exposure in this way. In my view, the expense ratio is too high, 78% exposure to BTC defeats the purpose of a 'diversified' fund, and there is an opportunity cost to holding stake-able assets in a fund that doesn't stake them for yield. That said, at a 14% discount to NAV, BITW is somewhat interesting as a potential arbitrage trade should be more of these assets get spot ETFs in the US. While I don't personally hold this fund at this time, it's one of which I've held in the past and would consider holding again if the discount gets to parity with the non-BTC asset allocation of the fund. That said, the discount arbitrage can close simultaneously to a drop in share price. That's a major risk to consider. I would argue that none of the assets in BITW could realistically be considered 'cheap' based on network usage levels.",BTC-USD|ETH-USD|SOL-USD|XRP-USD|BITW,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-22 02:45:00

According to experts, if this momentum continues, Bitcoin could soon target $115,000 to $116,000. However, like always, some ups and downs are expected along the way. Market data confirms that the trend is still bullish. Many who predicted a market crash have gone silent, as current charts and on-chain data show a different picture. While Bitcoin leads the way, several altcoins have also posted gains. Dogecoin rose by 7%, while other major altcoins gained between 2-4%. Pi Coin Eyes $1 One standout is Pi Network’s coin, which jumped 10%, reaching a high of $0.86 before settling around $0.84. The next target for Pi is to cross the $1 mark, a level many supporters are eagerly watching. However, for Pi Coin to hit $1, it should first cross the important resistance level at $0.94. Even though more Pi coins are being unlocked, the price is still rising. This could be because of various factors: First, a $100 million fund was launched to support Pi projects. Second, many people are choosing to hold their Pi instead of selling. What’s Next For Crypto Market? Experts believe that once Pi Network secures listings on major exchanges, it could see a big rise in price and popularity. On the other hand, Bitcoin is still looking strong on the charts, with indicators like RSI and MACD showing positive momentum. Although Bitcoin has entered the overbought zone, it hasn’t reached extreme levels yet, meaning there’s still room for growth. If Bitcoin slows down after a while, altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP might see stronger price movements next.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Accelerates While Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Slow Down",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/2025s-breakout-coin-magacoin-finance-accelerates-while-ethereum-solana-and-xrp-slow-down/,"As summer 2025 approaches, the crypto market is entering a new phase of rotation and accumulation. While established names like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are consolidating after recent gains, attention is shifting toward one early-stage contender: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With current prices and momentum diverging across the board, MAGA is rapidly emerging as the breakout coin of the season—offering a rare combination of structured ROI and presale scarcity before its major exchange listings. 1. Solana (SOL) — Layer-1 Leader, but Momentum Slows Recent Performance: Solana is consolidating after a strong rally, trading between $167 and $172. The network continues to attract developers and DeFi activity, but recent sessions have seen diminished volatility and selling pressure, signaling a pause in upward momentum. Outlook: Analysts remain bullish long-term, with price targets of $250–$400 by Q3 2025, but short-term consolidation is likely as the market awaits a new catalyst. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — The Pre-Listing Breakout MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate early-stage watchlists, with its fixed listing price of $0.007 and imminent entry into Stage 9 . MAGA has become one of the only remaining presale tokens offering structured ROI and political narrative appeal . Why MAGA Stands Out: Structured Tokenomics: Capped 100 billion supply, 45% allocated to presale, audited by HashEx. Analyst Forecasts: 25x–35x returns are considered conservative, with some models projecting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues Pre-Listing Momentum: Stage 8 is nearly full, and listings are imminent, making this a rare ground-floor opportunity before public price discovery. Summary: MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only major altcoin still in accumulation mode before listings, offering the highest risk-adjusted upside window heading into Q3 2025. 3. XRP — Regulatory Clarity, but Price Action Cools Recent Performance: XRP trades between $2.36–$2.65 and has surged over 300% since late 2024, driven by regulatory clarity and institutional partnerships. However, the price has cooled since its recent peak, and short-term momentum is slowing as the market consolidates. Outlook: Analysts project a breakout above $3.40 could push XRP toward $5–$7.50, but for now, the asset is in a holding pattern. 4. Ethereum (ETH) — Technical Breakout Pauses Recent Performance: Ethereum has rebounded from $1,800 to over $2,500 in May, but the rally is now cooling off. Technical indicators suggest a potential retest of $2,700–$2,900 if support holds, but short-term momentum is slowing. Outlook: ETH remains a core holding for DeFi and institutional investors, but the most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. 5. TRUMP (MAGA) — Narrative-Driven, but Not the Focus TRUMP trades at $0.195–$0.20, but it is distinct from MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale token, which is still under $0.001 and targeting a $0.007 listing price.For clarity, this article focuses on presale MAGACOIN FINANCE as the breakout play, offering structured ROI and political narrative appeal EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion As summer 2025 unfolds, MAGACOIN FINANCE is accelerating while Ethereum, Solana, and XRP slow down. With Stage 8 nearly full and listings approaching, MAGA is being positioned as the breakout coin of the season—offering a rare combination of structured ROI, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and early-stage momentum. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns as conservative, with some models projecting even greater upside if current trends continue. For investors seeking the next crypto supercycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only major altcoin still in accumulation mode before listings—making it the highest-conviction play heading into Q3.

While Solana (SOL) and Stellar (XLM) continue to build their networks through technical upgrades and institutional support, BlockDAG (BDAG) is focusing on something different: accessibility. Instead of relying on a small group of experts, it offers a system that invites more people to build. BlockDAG has introduced tools that lower the barrier to entry, like a no-code dApp builder and a developer grant program. These changes are meant to bring in a broader community. With over $260 million raised and more than 20.9 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is creating a space where building on Web3 is more about creativity and less about coding skills. Compared to Solana and Stellar’s price-driven attention, BlockDAG is centered on use cases, ease of entry, and a long-term goal to reshape how crypto apps are made. Solana (SOL) Eyes $180 Breakout Solana’s (SOL) price has stayed strong above $160, and it’s now testing the $180 resistance level, a spot that has previously sparked sharp moves. This higher low pattern suggests growing market support. Along with stronger trading volume, it shows buyers are preparing for a breakout. If SOL closes above $180 with solid volume, it could trigger a larger upward move. However, traders remain cautious and are watching the price closely. A clear push past this level may confirm renewed strength and attract more market attention. SOL continues to be on watchlists due to this critical range. Stellar (XLM): Smart Money Builds Confidence Stellar (XLM) is seeing more activity from large holders. Recent data shows institutional accumulation is rising, often seen as a signal of confidence in its future use. This matches XLM’s focus on real-world payment networks and integrations. Currently, Stellar is moving through a consolidation phase. Some analysts believe this isn’t a pause, but a buildup toward the next move. The platform’s steady transaction volume and wallet growth add weight to that view. Resistance levels are still in play, but the uptick in smart money activity is worth noting. While price swings continue, long-term watchers are tracking these buying signals. BlockDAG Presale Hits $260M With Simple dApp Creation Tools BlockDAG is making Web3 easier for everyone to access. Its upcoming no-code dApp builder is designed so anyone, whether a solo creator or a small business, can build and launch applications without coding knowledge. This shift removes a key hurdle that has kept many from entering the space. What makes this more powerful is BlockDAG’s structure. The platform encourages fast app building, niche use cases, and fresh ideas, thanks to tools that simplify the process. Unlike other platforms that expect builders to know blockchain code, BlockDAG gives them an entry point without that requirement. This change matters right now. BlockDAG has already raised over $260 million in its presale and sold more than 20.9 billion coins. It is now in Batch 28, priced at $0.0262. From Batch 1 to 28, early buyers have seen a 2,520% ROI. On top of that, over $7 million worth of X Series miners have been sold till now. One more highlight is the limited-time price freeze, BlockDAG is offering BDAG at $0.0020 until June 13. That makes this a key window for anyone looking at utility-backed projects. With its CertiK audit completed and builder tools rolling out, BlockDAG isn’t just riding hype, it’s creating real access to building in crypto. BlockDAG’s Utility Sets It Apart in 2025 Solana’s price is near a breakout, and Stellar is gaining institutional attention. But BlockDAG is standing out for its builder-first approach. With no-code tools, developer grants, and real funding already raised, it brings a different kind of value. The numbers are solid: $260 million raised, 20.9 billion coins sold, and BDAG priced at $0.0020 until June 13. This model isn’t just about supply, it’s about function. For those watching top crypto coins with real-world use, BlockDAG offers something unique. It’s focused on making development simple, even for those without technical backgrounds. This could help expand the reach of Web3 and push crypto toward more practical, daily use.

It combines CeFi security with DeFi accessibility, and it is one of only three chains selected for the debut. The major move comes when Bitcoin is hovering just short of 3% from its all-time high (ATH) of $109K. BTC’s price has surged by more than 21% over the last 30 days, reflecting that more investors are jumping in. However, the Fear and Greed Index flashes “Greed” sentiment among traders. OKX unveils xBTC on Sui Bitcoin holders now have more ways than ever to go onchain, and Sui is quickly becoming a BTCfi powerhouse. With the total Bitcoin Total Value Locked (TVL) climbing, xBTC is expected to lead the adoption and liquidity. Data provided by DefiLlama shows that TVL in DeFi has stood at $2.11 billion. Sui was chosen for its fast, scalable, and already building serious BTCfi infrastructure. With this move, OKX is signaling that it isn’t just another Layer 1 and is a rising hub for Bitcoin-backed DeFi. Two major protocols, Cetus and Navi, are exclusive launch partners for xBTC on day one. xBTC is minted directly on OKX and is withdrawable as a native asset. This makes it easier for users to bridge Bitcoin into DeFi without clunky wrappers or third-party trust models. It opens up new liquidity rails and reward strategies for BTC holders. Jason Lau, Chief Innovation Officer at OKX, stated that “Our unique advantage as one of the most trustworthy and transparent institutions imbues xBTC with a powerful security model.” Over 10% of Sui TVL is now BTC-backed Since February, nearly 600 Bitcoin have flowed into Sui, suggesting that Bitcoin holders are flocking to this fast-growing Layer 1 to tap into DeFi opportunities securely and efficiently. BTC-backed assets now make up over 10% of Sui’s total value locked (TVL), and that number keeps climbing. xBTC joins a strong lineup of BTC-based tokens, such as WBTC , LBTC, and sBTC. Each asset comes with unique custody models and DeFi integrations. Christian Thompson, Managing Director at the Sui Foundation, says, “Bitcoin DeFi on Sui has gone from an intriguing concept to proving complete product-market fit in a matter of months.” He added, “OKX is choosing to bring xBTC to Sui, which speaks to the robustness” of the BTCfi ecosystem. Sui’s BTCfi ecosystem has also attracted projects like Stacks, Lombard, Babylon, Cubist, SatLayer, and RedStone. It has created a vibrant hub where Bitcoin holders can put their BTC to work in multiple ways. xBTC can turn out to be a big use up for traders as it charges no minting or redemption fees. The only cost involved would be minimal gas fees on the network.

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,650 resistance zone. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,500 and $2,520 levels. The price is trading above $2,540 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,620 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Could Gain Strength Ethereum price remained in a range above $2,350 while Bitcoin traded to a new all-time high. ETH bulls were active near the $2,440 zone. A low was formed at $2,442 and the price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $2,500 and $2,520 levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,615 swing high to the $2,442 low. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,615 swing high to the $2,442 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,620 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,720 level. A clear move above the $2,720 resistance might send the price toward the $2,840 resistance. An upside break above the $2,840 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,920 resistance zone or even $3,000 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,620 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350.

With over $300,000 raised in its first week of presale, the crypto community is beginning to wonder: Is this the next 100x opportunity since the explosive rise of PEPE? Why Wall Street Ponke is Gaining Traction Fast Unlike many memecoins that launch with little more than a logo and some community memes, Wall Street Ponke entered the scene with a mission, real-world utility, and a strong roadmap. Its first week has been nothing short of impressive—rapid fundraising, growing community buzz, and increasing mentions across crypto forums. This isn’t a random frog-themed pump-and-dump. Wall Street Ponke is blending the entertainment of meme culture with serious crypto innovation. A Secure Ecosystem, Not Just a Token What’s driving the buzz? For starters, WPONKE offers a platform that addresses one of crypto’s most pressing issues: security. At its core, Wall Street Ponke features an AI-powered detection system that continuously scans new tokens across the market. This system flags red flags like fake liquidity, suspicious smart contract behavior, and developer manipulation, helping traders avoid scams before they commit their funds. In a landscape filled with rug pulls, this alone is a major selling point. The Future of Meme Coins: Education and Empowerment Wall Street Ponke goes beyond protection—it educates. The platform includes a full e-learning ecosystem, featuring easy-to-follow courses on DeFi, staking, tokenomics, and smart contract analysis. Whether you’re just starting in crypto or looking to level up your skills, WPONKE has positioned itself as a hub for smarter trading. It’s this blend of fun and functionality that’s earning it comparisons to early-stage PEPE—but with more tools and a clearer vision. High Staking Rewards and Real Community Utility One of the project’s standout features is its staking model. Early investors are being rewarded with a staggering 1232% APY. This system doesn’t just create FOMO—it builds long-term commitment. Instead of encouraging a quick flip, Wall Street Ponke incentivizes holders to become part of a sustainable ecosystem. https://twitter.com/Wallstreetponke/status/1922793562091008367 With staking, AI security tools, and educational resources all rolled into one, it’s no surprise that WPONKE is being called one of the most complete meme coin launches in recent memory. How to Join the Presale and Buy $WPONKE It’s easy and beginner-friendly to join the Wall Street Ponke presale. Create a crypto wallet to deposit funds. Then use a popular wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. You first need to buy some crypto from a central exchange. Use a central exchange like Binance or Coinbase to buy some ETH, USDT, or BNB. Next, go to wallstreetponke.com and connect your wallet to the presale interface. After that, simply select your payment of choice, enter the amount you’d like to invest and hit confirm. At the end of the presale, you will be able to claim your $WPONKE tokens in your wallet. Those who join the presale early will be able to stake their tokens and begin earning up to 1232% APY immediately. Wall Street Ponke isn’t just riding the meme coin wave—it’s reshaping it. If PEPE were a flash, $WPONKE could be the real fire.

The market is currently at a critical point, and how XRP behaves around these key support and resistance levels could shape it’s next move. Approaching a Key Support Level On the daily time frame, XRP is getting very close to breaking below an important support zone between $2.30 and $2.34. If the price closes a daily candle under $2.30, it could open the door for a further drop, falling back toward the $2.10–$2.15 range. Despite this risk, the overall daily price structure for XRP remains bullish. The market has continued forming higher lows and higher highs, which is typically a healthy sign during an uptrend. However, temporary pullbacks and sideways moves are common even in bullish trends. On the upside, a clear break above the $2.48–$2.61 resistance range is needed to confirm a meaningful bullish breakout and signal the start of a larger move higher. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.40 and is up by more than 1% in the last 24 hours. Short-Term Struggles Continue XRP is still under the influence of a bearish divergence. As a result, XRP is struggling to move higher and remains stuck within a range. The market has yet to see a clear breakout in either direction.. Right now, XRP’s price is caught between support and resistance. Both bullish and bearish possibilities remain on the table. A small bounce into the resistance zone is possible in the short term, but unless the price breaks through those upper levels, the overall market picture won’t change much. It’s also important to keep an eye on Bitcoin’s price action since it continues to influence the broader altcoin market, including XRP. However, Bitcoin has crossed above $110k level and it remains to be seen if altcoins will also rally. Short-Term Outlook At the moment, both potential scenarios for XRP remain valid: In the bullish case, XRP might see a short-term rally into resistance, followed by a brief correction, and then continue higher. In the alternative, XRP could start a direct rally from current support levels if buyers step in.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 03:22:07

Recent policy shifts between the United States and China, two of the world’s largest economies, have helped fuel investor sentiment. Both countries have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs: the US cut rates from 145% to 30%, while China lowered its own from 125% to 10%, each over 90 days. These decisions have been interpreted by some as a step toward easing global trade tensions, supporting risk-on assets such as Bitcoin. In response to the broader bullish environment, Bitcoin has seen a steady rise, currently trading at $106,574, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours. The price earlier reached a 24-hour high of $107,844 before retreating slightly. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin remains just 2% below its all-time high of $109,000, recorded in January 2025. The consistent climb has led analysts and traders to monitor on-chain metrics more closely to gauge market behavior and possible future movements. Related Reading: Binance Bitcoin Outflows and MVRV Ratio Point to Sustained Bullish Setup, Analyst Reveals Realized Capitalization Surges as Accumulation Phase Strengthens A recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alemán has brought attention to Bitcoin’s realized capitalization, a metric that measures the total value of Bitcoin based on the price at which each coin last moved on-chain. According to Alemán, the realized cap jumped by more than $3 billion in a single day, marking a 0.33% increase in the total capital invested in Bitcoin. This significant uptick signals renewed capital inflows, and more importantly, it points to a recurring pattern of accumulation and consolidation. Alemán identified a repeating cycle beginning in April, where Bitcoin has shown sharp price increases followed by sideways movements lasting 8 to 10 days. These lateral phases, supported by rising realized cap, form a staircase-like chart structure with each step building upon the previous one. From an on-chain perspective, the steady climb in realized cap suggests buyers are entering the market at higher levels, lifting the network’s aggregate cost basis and demonstrating long-term confidence in the asset. On-Chain Trends Suggest Investors Are Positioning for Continuation Alemán also highlighted that the behavior of realized capitalization in the current market mirrors patterns seen in previous bull cycles. Historically, spikes in this metric during consolidation phases have preceded large-scale price movements. The current rise indicates that capital entering the market is doing so with a long-term view, rather than speculative short-term intent. This positions the market for a potential continuation, especially as accumulation appears to intensify around the psychological $106,000–$109,000 range. Related Reading: $3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows The analyst concluded that tracking realized cap in the days ahead will be essential to confirm whether the current phase evolves into another upward price impulse. If the trend persists, it could support another leg higher, reinforcing the view that Bitcoin remains in a broader accumulation structure.

The case centers on Block Earner’s “Earner” product, a fixed-yield crypto investment offering that ASIC contends operates as an unlicensed financial product . ASIC says it is asking the High Court of Australia to clarify what falls within the definition of a financial product to shed light on digital assets and interest-earning options. In its statement, the regulator emphasized that the definition of a financial product was designed to be broad and technology-neutral. ASIC believes that interpreting this definition should be guided by the public interest. The ruling may change how crypto and other digital financial services are subject to Australian law . ASIC insists there is a problem with crypto and regulatory predictability for the broader financial sector. Block Earner defends its product and integrity Block Earner has welcomed the Federal Court’s decision. On April 22, Federal Court Justices David O’Callaghan, Wendy Abraham, and Catherine Button found that Block Earner’s crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product is not a financial product, a managed investment scheme, or a derivative under the Corporations Act. A spokesperson for the Block Earner said it still had confidence that the clear and robust judgment delivered by the Full Federal Court in April had been based on the facts and law of the matter and had shown that its operations were sound. They also said they remain convinced that the ruling was correct. “We believe the Full Federal Court’s April ruling was a strong and well-reasoned decision that upheld the integrity of our operations,” the spokesperson said. “We remain confident in the soundness of that judgment and will respond to ASIC’s application through the appropriate legal channels.” The spokesman said the current dispute revolves around a broader legal question: what defines a financial product in the digital age? They emphasized that this issue goes far beyond Block Earner or the crypto sector alone. They noted that one key implication concerns not just this case but the future of fintech innovation and regulatory compliance across Australia. The company said that despite the legal win, Block Earner has no plans to revive the “Earner” product. Block Earner has pivoted to other similar crypto-backed loan offerings while complying with regulatory requirements. ASIC and Block Earner battle in years-long legal duel ASIC has been battling with Block Earner for over two years . The matter commenced in November 2022 in response to ASIC’s proceedings claiming that Block Earner was issuing financial products without holding an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL). The product, Earner, allowed users to deposit crypto-assets like Bitcoin and earn a fixed rate of return. ASIC argued that this constituted a financial product under the law. In February 2024, the Federal Court agreed with the ASIC argument that Block Earner did require a license. But the court cut it a break in June 2024, opting not to levy any punishment, after determining that Block Earner had acted in good faith, sought legal counsel, and believed it was following the law. Block Earner challenged the license denial in July 2024, resulting in the April 2025 decision in its favor. Now, ASIC is seeking to overturn that outcome in the High Court. Proceeding requires leave of the High Court, which is granted only where a case raises substantial legal or constitutional issues.

Kristin Johnson Bids Farewell To The CFTC According to Johnson’s statement , the former Emory University professor has notified U.S. President Donald Trump of her decision to leave the CFTC at the end of the year. Statement of @CFTCjohnson on Her Departure from the CFTC https://t.co/YL6q62bXo3 — CFTC (@CFTC) May 21, 2025 “Although this is a difficult decision, I am proud of the work that I have accomplished and am deeply grateful for the chance to develop meaningful relationships with staff and current and former Commissioners during my tenure at the CFTC,” Johnson said. “I am confident that the Commission will continue to do important work protecting investors and customers, combatting fraud and market manipulation, and ensuring market integrity and stability,” she added. Fourth Departure of a CFTC Commissioner Johnson was originally appointed to the derivatives markets regulating agency under former U.S. President Joe Biden in 2022, with her term completed in April of this year. Her decision to step down marks the fourth departure of a CFTC commissioner in recent weeks, with Republican official Christy Goldsmith announcing her May 31 exit just last Friday. Fellow Commissioner Caroline Pham will also leave her position when Trump’s pick to lead the CFTC, Brian Quintenz, is appointed to his role – though a set date has yet to be confirmed. Meanwhile, Republican Commissioner Summer Mersinger will leave the agency on May 30 before beginning her tenure as CEO of the Blockchain Association . “It has been a privilege to work and serve at the CFTC in both the first and the current Trump Administrations, doing my part to assist in pursuing the President’s important policies,” Mersinger said in a May 14 farewell statement posted to the CFTC’s website. No future CFTC commissioners have been announced by Trump, though given the aforementioned officials’ upcoming exits, it appears highly likely that he will do so in the near future.

After a mild correction, however, the altcoin is trading below $0.28. Despite this, new data suggest that TRX has emerged as one of the most “resilient” crypto assets in a turbulent market, as it maintained proximity to its all-time high (ATH) alongside Bitcoin. This strength is supported by CryptoQuant’s Drawdown Heatmap, which revealed TRX’s significant recovery since its 2024 peak. TRX Market Recovery The report highlights TRX’s Sharpe Ratio – annualized over 180 days – hovering between 0.1 and 0.15, a range that suggests a moderate risk-return balance. This is sharp contrast to many altcoins suffering negative or near-zero Sharpe Ratios after recent corrections, TRX’s performance positions it as a more stable option. Complementing this is the Normalized Risk Metric (NRM), which remains close to 0.5. This moderate risk profile, significantly removed from high-alert or undervaluation levels, indicates healthy market behavior. Notably, TRX’s late-2024 rally was followed by only a mild correction, and its current positioning near ATH suggests underlying investor confidence and potential institutional interest. Unlike many assets still lagging behind their historic highs, TRX joins a select group showing strong macro resilience. As such, CryptoQuant stated that TRX offers a measured opportunity for risk-aware investors. The latest price action has pushed all almost all holders of the token to green. This has impacted almost all investor cohorts – from one-week traders to one-year investors – which has seen gains. Meanwhile, Tron founder Justin Sun has made headlines for reasons extending far beyond TRX’s market activity. Justin Sun Earns Trump Dinner Invite Sun has revealed himself as the top holder of Donald Trump’s TRUMP meme coin, which helped him unlock access to a private dinner and VIP reception with the US President. In a May 19 X post , Sun said he controlled the wallet under the username “Sun,” qualifying for the May 22 event hosted at Trump’s golf club. The timing of the announcement, just hours after the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, a key stablecoin regulation bill, has raised concerns from lawmakers. Sun, who happens to be a major backer and adviser to Trump-linked crypto firm World Liberty Financial (WLFI), had previously been entangled in an SEC lawsuit that was paused after Trump’s inauguration. His proximity to the Trump family has prompted criticism from Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren.

44936271,https://cryptonews.com/?p=363689,1747886240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44936271.jpeg,SafeMoon Ex-CEO Found Guilty on Every Charge,https://cryptonews.com/news/safemoon-ex-ceo-braden-karony-found-guilty-on-every-charge/,"A federal jury in the Eastern District of New York convicted former SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony on May 21 of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering after a 12-day trial that began on May 5. He now faces up to 45 years in prison and the forfeiture of illicit gains. Prosecutors detailed how Karony and his co-conspirators misled investors about the SafeMoon token design, falsely claiming that its liquidity pools were “locked” by a 10% transaction tax, that insiders could not perform a “rug pull,” and that tokens would serve only business purposes rather than personal enrichment. They also assured buyers that developers did not hold or trade SFM tokens, and that the team would manually add token pairs to the pool when trades occurred on major exchanges. (1/3) “As proven at trial, the SafeMoon digital asset was anything but safe and turned out to be pie in the sky for investors who were deliberately misled by Karony, a man who sought to get rich quick by stealing and diverting millions of dollars,” stated U.S. Attorney Nocella. — US Attorney EDNY (@EDNYnews) May 21, 2025 In reality, the defendants retained full access to the liquidity pools. Consequently, they diverted millions of dollars’ worth of SFM tokens for their own profit. $2.2M Utah Home Among Assets Bought with Fraud Proceeds Prosecutors say the defendants repeatedly bought and sold tokens at market peaks. Moreover, they routed proceeds through private wallets and pseudonymous accounts. As a result, Karony alone netted over $9m. He used those funds to buy a $2.2m home in Utah and additional properties in Utah and Kansas. He also purchased a $277,000 Audi R8, another Audi R8, a Tesla, and custom Ford F-550 and Jeep Gladiator trucks. Co-defendant Thomas Smith testified against Karony after pleading guilty and could receive a lighter sentence, while platform creator Kyle Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and remains at large. The jury also ordered forfeiture of one residential property and the proceeds from another, totalling about $2m. ‘Pie in the Sky’ Ruling Highlights Investor Betrayal The Justice Department’s business and securities fraud section is handling the case. Additionally, Assistant US Attorneys Dana Rehnquist, Sara Winik and Jessica Weigel are leading the prosecution. Meanwhile, Assistant US Attorney Laura Mantell is overseeing forfeiture matters. They are supported by paralegal specialists Asher Martin-Rosenthal and Madison Bates. “At trial, we proved that the SafeMoon digital asset was anything but safe and turned out to be pie in the sky for investors,” said US Attorney Jaqueline Romero Nocella. “Karony used his scheme to purchase homes, sports cars, custom trucks, and other luxury goods. This verdict should warn fraudsters that we will vigorously prosecute those who prey on digital-asset investors.” Karony’s trial followed the January sentencing of former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky to 12 years in prison after a guilty plea, and the 25-year term handed to former FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried in 2023. Those cases, alongside Wednesday’s verdict, point to the Justice Department’s intensified focus on digital asset markets and signal that executives who breach investor trust will face severe penalties.

Trump Coin, Chainlink (LINK), and TRON (TRX) are also gaining attention. But quietly building beneath the surface is a new contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE — and it may be the one with the most explosive setup this quarter. Dogecoin (DOGE) – 990% Network Spike Sparks Bullish Buzz As of May 16, DOGE trades at $0.2249, but user activity has exploded — with active addresses surging nearly 990% in just seven days. Forecasts for May suggest DOGE could trade between $0.305 and $0.443, with year-end targets as high as $1.00, depending on momentum and ETF chatter. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Burn Rate Surge and Ecosystem Growth SHIB is up over 12% this week, now priced at $0.000026. Technical setups point to a breakout, especially as Shibarium expands and developers continue to burn supply. Analysts see potential highs ranging from $0.0000326 to $0.00008471 in a sustained rally. Chainlink (LINK) and Trump Coin (TRUMP) – Volatile but Back in the Spotlight TRUMP COIN sits near $13, climbing over 25% this week. Past rallies have sent it to $75, and 2025 targets range from $67 to $200. With U.S. election narratives heating up and ETF speculation swirling, the stage is set for renewed volatility — and opportunity. Trading between $16.39 and $16.77, LINK is up 29% this week. If it breaks the $15.30 level with volume, analysts forecast a move toward $19.50. LINK’s role in tokenized assets and cross-chain data flows makes it a top candidate for further institutional adoption. TRON (TRX) – Quiet But Consistent Gains TRX is trading at $0.268, up 7.23% this week and 107% year-over-year. Its leadership in stablecoins and growing DeFi adoption position it as a foundational blockchain. May price targets range from $0.271 to $0.35, with $0.75 on the table if momentum continues. MAGACOIN FINANCE – This Is Still the Beginning It’s not just the price point — although MAGACOIN FINANCE remains below $0.001. It’s the structure. Whales are stepping in because they recognize the power of early-stage projects with viral potential, political timing, and strong tokenomics. With over $8 million raised, the project has already exceeded early expectations — but this isn’t about past performance. It’s about what comes next. Stage 8 is live. Stage 9 is approaching. Each new phase increases exclusivity and upside. Insiders are anticipating a series of major announcements in the coming weeks — including integrations, expanded media coverage, and updated roadmap milestones. Built for scalability, not just hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has avoided early exchange dilution and is growing through community-first momentum. Investors using promo code MAGA50X receive a 50% token bonus, a key driver behind current whale accumulation. For those asking if they’re late — they’re not. Stage 8 is live. The door is still open — for now.

A Synthetix spokesperson told Cointelegraph on May 22 that its acquisition proposal, pitched to its community and to Derive’s , “did not resonate,” and both projects agreed to “step back from the proposed acquisition.” Synthetix said on May 14 that it would acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million, pending approval from both communities. Synthetix strategy lead Ben Celermajer told Cointelegraph that other community concerns were the three-month token lock-up period and the deal’s price, part of which Synthetix tried to address with no lock-up for holders of less than 1 million DRV. “While we understand the commercials did not resonate with all community members, a number of holders from both communities believed the deal was fair and acceptable,” he said. “However, we acknowledge that the response fell short of expectations, and we have no intention of moving forward with something that was intended to be a collaborative and constructive endeavor.” Celermajer said Synthetix will continue evaluating opportunities for building a decentralized derivatives platform on the Ethereum mainnet . Source: Synthetix Derive community concerned on deal’s benefits Derive community members expressed concerns over the deal on the project's forum, particularly around the token exchange rate and the deal's overall benefit to the platform. Derive user “Ramjo” wrote on May 14 that the token exchange rate is “a poor reflection of the value of derive as a platform,” and the “equivalent of selling the bottom and locking in lows.” Related: Synthetix founder threatens SNX stakers with ‘the stick’ to fix SUSD depeg Another user, “AlvaroHK,” called the deal “difficult to justify,” as they claimed that Derive generates more revenue than Synthetix, and there was no clause in the agreement to stop Synthetix from “printing millions of new tokens and keep diluting us.” AlvaroHK claims Derive generates more revenue than Synthetix, which makes the deal a tall order to justify. Source: Derive “I have found the guidance that Synthetix plans to issue an additional 170 million SNX to increase its supply to 500 million from 330 million,” AlvaroHK added in a follow-up post. “Why this information is not disclosed when asked about it? It will dilute an additional 60% off the value of the offer made to Derive,” they added. Derive, which Synthetix started in 2021 as Lyra, operated as a decentralized options protocol but remained part of the Synthetix ecosystem. It eventually rebranded to Derive and took steps to operate independently from Synthetix, such as moving away from using Synthetix’s sUSD stablecoin and liquidity.

The price is now rising and might aim for an upside break above $2.450. XRP price started a decent increase above the $2.3650 zone. The price is now trading above $2.380 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.3580 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.450 resistance. XRP Price Eyes Steady Increase XRP price started a fresh downside correction in a range and traded below the $2.380 zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.3650 and $2.350 levels. The price tested the $2.3350 zone. A low was formed at $2.33360 and the price is now moving higher.

The first major resistance is near the $2.4320 level. The next resistance is $2.450. A clear move above the $2.450 resistance might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance.

If XRP fails to clear the $2.450 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.3650 level. The next major support is near the $2.3580 level and the trend line If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.3580 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.320 support.

The massive bill combines tax, immigration, energy, defense, and debt-ceiling measures. It has also reopened many old divisions in the GOP and created a few new ones, a risky mix for leaders who can afford to lose only a handful of votes. Conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus are pressing hardest, according to Fox News . They want the bill to shrink Medicaid’s Affordable Care Act expansion and to implement work requirements for able-bodied adults on the healthcare program before the bill’s 2029 deadline. Most Republicans agree that people who are able to work should do so in order to keep government health coverage, but moderates warn that cutting too deeply into the Obamacare expansion could cost them support in tight districts. Freedom Caucus lawmakers say their goal is simply to move limited resources toward the poor, women, and children who need help the most. The same conservatives also demand a full reversal of President Joe Biden’s green-energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. That stance has put them at odds with Republicans from districts where companies have already based business plans on those incentives. At the same time, moderates from California, New York, and New Jersey are focusing on the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction cap. They argue that lifting that limit is essential for residents of high-cost areas such as New York City and Los Angeles. Several of those lawmakers say the issue will decide whether the GOP can keep its seats, and possibly the House majority, in 2026. They also note that their narrow 2024 wins relied on the same voters. GOP clash over raising the state and local tax deduction limit The $10,000 SALT cap first appeared in President Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It remains popular with most Republicans, especially those from lower-tax states. Republicans in Tennessee and Missouri say raising the cap gives unfair tax breaks to high-tax Democratic states. Republicans in coastal states say they send more money to Washington, which benefits low-tax states. Some Republicans in states with green-energy companies don’t want big cuts to those tax credits. Representatives from Arizona and Pennsylvania say taking the credits away now would hurt businesses that already counted on them. In March, twenty-one House Republicans sent a letter urging leaders to keep those benefits. “Countless American companies are utilizing sector-wide energy tax credits, many of which have enjoyed broad support in Congress, to make major investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure for traditional and renewable energy sources alike,” they wrote. Conservative fiscal hawks responded with their own letter, insisting that the fast-growing green-tech field is funded by government handouts, not genuine market demand. “Leaving IRA subsidies intact will actively undermine America’s return to energy dominance and national security,” they said. “They are the result of government subsidies that distort the U.S. energy sector, displace reliable coal and natural gas and the domestic jobs they produce, and put the stability and independence of our electric grid in jeopardy.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-22 05:00:38

While legacy giants like XRP and Ethereum (ETH) maintain solid footing, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) that’s rapidly shifting from outsider to headline contender. With price discovery still ahead and investor enthusiasm building, some are calling MAGA the next major altcoin explosion in waiting. Add in continued development from Solana (SOL) and Cosmos (ATOM) , and it’s clear: the next wave of crypto growth could be led by a mix of institutional favorites and politically charged newcomers. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW XRP Holds Steady, But Multiples Look Capped XRP continues to benefit from legal clarity and real-world utility. Its place in global remittance remains strong, and banking partnerships support the long-term outlook. However, for short- to mid-term traders, the ceiling may already be in view. Price forecasts range from $2.50 to $4 by year-end, representing 2x–4x potential for most buyers. That’s a solid return — but one that likely won’t satisfy those chasing exponential upside. Ethereum Builds Quietly Toward ETF Tailwinds Behind the scenes, Ethereum (ETH) is strengthening its foundations. The Pectra upgrade has boosted performance, and ETF rumors continue to swirl. Trading near $2,600, ETH remains the backbone of smart contracts and Web3 infrastructure. However, its size works against it for quick gains. Most analysts expect modest movement relative to small caps, pushing traders to explore higher-risk, high-reward altcoins in parallel. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Drawing Analyst Attention Unlike legacy tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fresh, politically charged, and deeply narrative-driven. With a strong cultural hook and emerging visibility across major media platforms like MSN and Google News, MAGA is being quietly loaded by traders who see a breakout forming. Its roadmap includes exchange listings, influencer partnerships, and growing community initiatives — all positioned to drive virality in Q3. Analysts are now projecting that MAGA could hit $0.007 , translating to up to 25x upside from current levels. And with a limited-time PATRIOT35X bonus , early buyers are maximizing their token counts — pushing projected returns closer to 35x. This is the type of asymmetric setup that retail and whale wallets alike are hunting for. Solana and Cosmos Gain Steam — But Eyes Are on MAGA Solana (SOL) continues to scale rapidly, gaining traction in NFT integrations and transaction speeds. Cosmos (ATOM) is also pushing forward with interchain interoperability, attracting developers and niche investors. Yet despite their growth, neither SOL nor ATOM offers the entry price or early-stage excitement that MAGACOIN FINANCE brings to the table. Traders seeking breakout returns are increasingly favoring MAGA as the go-to allocation heading into Q3. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Final Thoughts As the crypto market eyes its next explosive move, a new narrative is taking shape. Legacy tokens like XRP , Ethereum , Solana , and Cosmos remain solid picks — but for traders chasing 10,000% potential, the early signals point to MAGACOIN FINANCE . With a cultural edge, aggressive tokenomics, and rising analyst coverage, MAGA is quickly becoming a high-conviction bet for those ready to move before the listings go live.

Per the DOJ release , he used investors’ money to fund a lavish lifestyle. “Jordan-Jones’s alleged blatant lies funded his personal lifestyle at the expense of unknowing victims,” said Christopher Raia, FBI assistant director. The prosecutors noted that he falsely claimed that Amalgam had lucrative high-profile partnerships with major-league sports teams and prominent payment-processing platforms. He also made misleading statements regarding the blockchain firm’s financial condition, they added. “He touted his company as a groundbreaking blockchain startup, backed by high-profile partnerships,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “In reality, Jordan-Jones’s company was a sham, and investors’ funds were siphoned off to bankroll his lavish lifestyle.” Founder Touted Fake Amalgam Crypto Token Listing Additionally, Jordan-Jones solicited investments by promising that the money would be used to initiate the listing of Amalgam’s crypto coin. He also promised to use the investors’ money for hardware, software, and other expenses associated with the Amalgam’s operations. Further, he submitted falsified financial statements to a bank, the release read. The FBI warned users that fraudsters often use the “promise of new technology to cloak their schemes.” Last month, the Bureau had recorded a staggering $9.3 billion in losses to crypto-related fraud, scams and extortion.

This pressure came directly from Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who on Wednesday urged Trump to force Elon and all other employees in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to sign legal documents stating they won’t use non-public data gained while working for the government. This request followed concerns that Elon and his team had access to confidential data spanning a wide range of agencies, which could end up being used for personal gain once they leave public service. Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, pointed out that DOGE’s staff includes many former employees from Elon’s companies like Tesla and SpaceX, and that they’ve had what she described as “unprecedented” access to massive amounts of sensitive information. The agencies involved include the Social Security Administration, the Treasury, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and others that aren’t named. Shaheen’s concern is that without firm restrictions, some of these individuals could jump right back into the private sector and use what they’ve seen behind closed doors to strengthen their own businesses or those tied to Elon. Shaheen raises alarm over ethics risks with DOGE departures In her letter to Trump, Shaheen warned about what she described as the dangerous mix of tech insiders and government access. “I am very concerned that SGEs [special government employees], many of whom come from the tech field, may return to the private sector and use nonpublic information from the federal government to give their personal business activities an unfair and anticompetitive boost,” she wrote. Shaheen also said that Steve Bannon, a former White House strategist under Trump, shares this concern. Bannon told Semafor’s Ben Smith he wanted official proof that no one has taken data from the government. When asked whether that meant he didn’t trust Elon, Bannon replied, “Trust, but verify.” Despite all that, a White House official dismissed Shaheen’s letter as “pointless” and said the employees in question already have to follow federal ethics rules. That includes regulations that forbid them from misusing their position or any information obtained while in government service. Elon, who gave financial support to Trump’s 2024 campaign, currently leads a mix of high-profile companies. Those include Tesla, SpaceX, and Starlink, as well as xAI, which builds artificial intelligence tools like the Grok chatbot. xAI recently merged with X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, which is currently under investigation by Canada’s privacy regulator for allegedly using user data to train Grok without permission. These developments have fueled even more criticism of Elon’s access to government records during his term in DOGE. DOGE was created to help cut waste in federal operations, and Trump handed Elon the reins. Since then, Elon has slashed departments, gutted agencies, and proposed eliminating entire regulatory offices—most of which are directly responsible for overseeing his private companies. Elon’s 130-day term as an SGE is nearly up, and so is the term for several DOGE employees. While a few are expected to take permanent government jobs, others are planning a return to the private sector.

Big Bitcoin Moves The asset has now gained more than 17% since the beginning of the year and is up around 47% since its April 7 crash to $75,000. Momentum is being driven by institutions as spot exchange-traded funds and corporations continue to aggressively accumulate the asset. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have seen six consecutive trading days of inflows totalling more than $2 billion. Meanwhile, companies such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japanese investment firm Metaplanet continue to scoop up BTC for their treasuries. On May 22, Digital Capital Strategist Jeff Walton said , Strategy is “the apex Bitcoin accumulator,” having bought 324,000 BTC in the last 8 months. “That is 105,000 more Bitcoin than every single company that has BTC on balance sheets combined,” he added. Strategy’s unrealized profit soared to $23.5 billion with the new Bitcoin all-time high. The stash is now worth an eye-watering $63.7 billion, according to the Saylor Tracker. Nevertheless, things are relatively quiet on the retail front with macroeconomic clouds darkening, inflation woes increasing, and social sentiment and searches at bear market lows.

BTC rose nearly 3.5% to touch $111,878 during Asian morning hours, CoinGecko data shows, lifting overall market capitalization 1.7%. Major tokens from xrp to dogecoin (DOGE) showed little movement The demand isn’t just coming from crypto-native funds or retail traders. Publicly listed companies increasingly treat BTC as a treasury asset, using capital markets to raise cash and buy more of the token. “We think that large institutions are driving Bitcoin’s rally,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, said in a Telegram message. “This trend will likely continue, especially as more companies tap public markets and ETF inflows remain strong. May alone saw $3.6 billion in net ETF demand. ”Options traders have taken note. Contracts for $110,000, $120,000 — and even $300,000 — expiring in late June currently hold the most open interest on Deribit, suggesting traders are positioning for more upside before summer ends."" After years of public skepticism, JPMorgan Chase reportedly offers clients access to bitcoin, signaling a deeper shift in how traditional finance views crypto exposure. “As the largest bank in the U.S., its decision adds a new layer of legitimacy to Bitcoin, potentially nudging other traditional financial institutions toward similar offerings to avoid falling behind,” said Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, in a message to CoinDesk. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, including rising bond yields, geopolitical noise, and a downgraded U.S. credit rating, bitcoin has shown “remarkable resilience,” said QCP Capital in a Thursday note. “A breakout to new highs could ignite a fresh wave of FOMO,” they added, “dragging in sidelined retail capital and pushing prices even higher.”",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Pizza Day|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-22 05:24:48

That’s a sharp contrast from Trump’s usual public line, where he’s painted Putin as a leader who actually wants peace. This new take came during a private call that included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, according to The Wall Street Journal . Until now, Trump has avoided publicly stating that Putin has no interest in ending the war. That changed on this call. Despite this private acknowledgment, Trump hasn’t taken the action that Zelensky and the Europeans have repeatedly pushed for, he still hasn’t moved to put pressure on Russia with new sanctions. Trump changes his position before and after Putin call A day before that call, on Sunday, Trump spoke with Macron, Merz, Meloni, and new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He told them he might consider imposing sanctions if Putin rejected a cease-fire. Instead of sanctions, Trump said he wanted to speed up low-level talks between Ukraine and Russia, and have them take place at the Vatican. Zelensky was part of Monday’s call. European leaders had spent ten days building pressure on Trump, hoping he would use America’s influence to get Putin to stop. That effort didn’t work. Trump didn’t commit to anything serious. He just kept repeating that the war wasn’t his fight. “This isn’t my war,” Trump told reporters on Monday. “We got ourselves entangled in something we shouldn’t have been involved in.” Some of the Europeans on the call wanted any talks at the Vatican to include an unconditional cease-fire. Trump didn’t like that. He claimed he never used the word “unconditional,” even though his May 8 post on Truth Social clearly included it when he called for a 30-day cease-fire. Eventually, the Europeans gave up on using that word. Europeans test Trump after Merz takes power The diplomatic push got more aggressive when Friedrich Merz became chancellor earlier in May. Unlike former chancellor Olaf Scholz, Merz is more willing to take on Putin. His government even changed Germany’s constitution to allow for more military spending. On May 10, Merz, Macron, Starmer, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk made a surprise visit to Zelensky in Kyiv. During the visit, they called Trump directly using Macron’s phone and told him Ukraine was on board with the 30-day cease-fire. They warned Putin that Europe would push fresh sanctions if he didn’t go along. Putin responded to that warning by offering direct talks with Ukraine for the first time in three years. Trump jumped at that and even suggested he might travel to Turkey to join the talks. A meeting happened in Istanbul, but Putin didn’t show up. He sent mid-level negotiators instead, who repeated Russia’s usual demands, which Ukraine had already rejected. After that no-show, the European leaders came back to Trump again. They told him Putin’s behavior proved that stronger action was needed. They passed some minor sanctions, but bigger ones are still in the works. Trump said he had scheduled a new call with Putin because he believed that a peace deal couldn’t happen without a conversation between the two leaders. During the Sunday call with European leaders (before speaking with Putin) Trump said the US could team up with Europe on sanctioning Russian oil and banks. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, said Wednesday that he had already secured 81 co-sponsors for a bill that would hit Russia hard with energy and financial sanctions. That Sunday call also had moments of typical Trump. He praised Merz for his English. “I love it even more with your German accent,” Trump told him. But he also veered into attacking Europe’s migration policies, saying their countries were at the “brink of collapse.” Macron, who has known Trump longer than anyone else on the call, asked him to stop. “You cannot insult our nations, Donald,” he said. Even with that awkward moment, some on the call thought Trump might support new sanctions if Putin refused peace. But those hopes were short-lived. The Vatican talks are now scheduled for mid-June.

While Bitcoin explores historic highs above $110K, WLD exhibits a bullish structure, catalyzed by the latest sale of $135 million worth of tokens by World Foundation’s subsidiary World Assets. Notably, early supporters, including Bain Capital Crypto and a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), purchased the tokens. The announcement indicated that the funding will offer Worldcoin financial support to bolster its global expansion after its latest entry into the United States . Criptovaluta.it @CriptovalutaI · Follow . @Worldcoin raises 135M from Bain and Andreessen Horowitz 7:22 PM · May 21, 2025 20 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply Moreover, the latest move comes after previous investments from leading companies like Selini Capital, Artic Digital, and Miran Ventures, confirming impressive institutional appetite for Sam Altman’s project. Notably, Worldcoin remains in pursuit of its objective of introducing internet-verified biometric identification, a narrative that has attracted limitations in multiple jurisdictions. Recently, Kenyan regulators directed the AI project to suspend its operations in the country and delete the collected biometric data. Worldcoin’s biometric device, Orb, which scans irises to generate unique user IDs, has attracted controversy globally. Individuals can use the IDs to partake in the WLD ecosystem, verify their uniqueness, and access different online services. Despite setbacks from surveillance and privacy concerns, the AI project continues to onboard users. Worldcoin will use the latest funding to support biometric data collection and issue World IDs. WLD price outlook The alt jumped from the 24-hour low of $1.103 to $1.2536 (a 13.65% increase) hours after the funding news. WLD trades at $1.24 after brief corrections from its daily high, though still 11% up on its 24-hour timeframe. Its trading volume has increased by 92% within the past day, signaling renewed trader and investor interest in the altcoin. Chart by Coinmarketcap The bullish outlook suggests a positive reaction due to institutional backing and capital inflow. These elements could support Worldcoin’s long-term growth. Nevertheless, WLD should reclaim $1.30 to change its short-term outlook to bullish. A candlestick closing above this mark could support rallies to $3.30 before extending to $3.60. That would mean a 190% surge from current prices. Meanwhile, the $3.30 – $3.60 resistance will likely catalyze near-term pullbacks. That could print a “classic” head and shoulders formation, setting the grounds for bullish continuation. Nonetheless, intensified regulations could halt the projected uptrend. In the near term, the altcoin should stabilize above $1.30 for extended rallies. Broad market sentiments would be vital for shaping WLD’s trajectory in the upcoming sessions. Bitcoin trades at record highs, and analyst Ali Martinez anticipates continued upswings as the top crypto enters a price discovery phase. BTC bulls target the $116K mark to open the gates towards the $126K zone.

Just as the chart pattern emerged, Volatility Shares announced it will launch the first XRP futures ETF under the ticker XRPI on May 22, further solidifying XRP's growing appeal among professional investors. XRP Forms First-Ever Weekly Golden Cross Against Bitcoin, Marking Potential Turning Point in Crypto Market In what could mark a watershed moment for altcoin markets, XRP has just achieved a rare and historic technical milestone: its first-ever golden cross against Bitcoin on the weekly chart. The move, which occurred as XRP’s 50-week moving average crossed above its 200-week moving average, is widely interpreted by analysts as a powerful bullish signal and could foreshadow a long-awaited breakout from a years-long consolidation phase. The technical achievement comes amid strengthening fundamentals for the XRP Ledger and a wave of renewed investor interest driven by regulatory clarity, increasing network activity, and long-term accumulation trends. With this golden cross, XRP may be positioned to outperform Bitcoin for the first sustained period since the onset of its legal troubles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020. Golden cross on the XRP/BTC weekly chart (Source: TradingView) A golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average—in this case, the 50-week moving average—crosses above a longer-term moving average, typically the 200-week MA. This event is seen by many traders as a long-term bullish reversal indicator, suggesting a shift in momentum that favors upward price action. For XRP, the significance is heightened because the asset has spent nearly four years in a tight range against Bitcoin, mostly due to the chilling effect of regulatory uncertainty stemming from the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. The golden cross, appearing on a high timeframe like the weekly chart, signals a potential long-term reversal of that trend. Since late 2020, XRP has struggled to keep pace with Bitcoin’s explosive growth. While other altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche rode the wave of crypto adoption and institutional interest, XRP found itself sidelined due to legal constraints. The SEC’s case alleging Ripple Labs conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP significantly suppressed investor sentiment and exchange listings. However, the tide began to turn in mid-2023 when a US federal court partially ruled in Ripple’s favor, stating that XRP is not a security in itself—a legal nuance that opened the floodgates for renewed market participation. Now, with regulatory clarity, XRP is once again viewed as a viable long-term bet. Network Growth Confirms Strength Behind the Charts This technical breakout isn’t happening in a vacuum. According to Messari’s “State of XRP Ledger Q1 2025” report, XRP is experiencing a surge in fundamental usage that aligns with its bullish chart pattern. The report highlights that XRP’s market capitalization increased by 2% quarter over quarter, while Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) experienced a combined decline of 22%. On a year-over-year basis, XRP's circulating market capitalization has grown a stunning 252%, rising from $34.6 billion at the end of Q1 2024. Further reinforcing the bullish picture, XRP network activity has soared: Average daily active addresses surged by 142% quarter over quarter to reach 134,600. Total new addresses climbed 12% from the previous quarter, hitting 568,300—a 210% increase from Q1 2024. Daily receiver addresses rose by 168%, indicating strong user inflow and payment utility. Daily sender addresses grew by 14.5%, showing both new participation and ongoing transactional engagement. These metrics point to real usage growth, not just speculative trading, which adds credibility to the idea that XRP's current rally could have longer-lasting momentum. The golden cross also coincides with rising institutional and retail demand for XRP and XRPL-based services. With US-based exchanges re-listing the token and developers increasingly turning to the XRP Ledger for decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset tokenization solutions, interest in the ecosystem is ramping up. Blockchain intelligence firm Kaiko recently noted a “resurgence in XRP liquidity across major centralized exchanges,” particularly against BTC and stablecoins, which further validates the potential for increased trading volume and capital rotation. Additionally, tokenization efforts on XRPL, combined with Ripple’s ongoing global partnerships in cross-border settlements and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), are attracting long-term believers who see XRP as more than just a trading vehicle. Short-Term Outlook The market has already begun to price in XRP’s technical breakout against BTC, with some traders rotating from Bitcoin and Ethereum into XRP in anticipation of higher beta moves. The XRP/BTC pair is currently testing key horizontal resistance levels not seen since mid-2021. A successful breakout from this consolidation range could see XRP rapidly climb to higher satoshi values, with chart watchers eyeing the 0.00003000 and 0.00004500 BTC levels as possible upside targets. Analysts caution, however, that golden crosses do not guarantee sustained bull runs. Volatility Shares to Launch First-Ever XRP Futures ETF, Fueling Hopes for Spot XRP ETF Approval Meanwhile, Volatility Shares is set to launch the world’s first-ever 1x XRP Futures ETF on May 22, ushering in a new chapter in the institutional adoption of Ripple’s native token. The announcement, confirmed by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on X, has sent waves through the market as anticipation builds around XRP’s growing legitimacy in the eyes of regulators and traditional finance players. Trading under the ticker XRPI, the ETF will be part of the Volatility Shares Trust and represents the first XRP-linked futures exchange-traded fund to offer 1x exposure, a more conservative investment product compared to existing leveraged alternatives. The move positions XRP as the third major cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin and Ethereum, to receive such ETF treatment, reinforcing its standing as one of the most watched digital assets in the institutional space. XRP’s Institutional Milestone Volatility Shares’ decision to roll out the 1x XRP Futures ETF comes just 48 hours after the CME Group debuted XRP futures trading, a long-anticipated listing that finally opened the door for regulated futures exposure to XRP. That listing has proven to be a catalyst, rapidly expanding interest from hedge funds, market makers, and asset managers who previously lacked access to compliant XRP derivatives. Now, with an ETF product wrapping those futures contracts in a more accessible structure, institutional demand is expected to surge. The move by Volatility Shares also sets the stage for potential competition with Tectrium’s 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, which was launched just a few weeks earlier. While Tectrium’s product offers double the daily gains of XRP, it carries higher risk due to its leveraged structure. Despite the volatility, Tectrium’s ETF already commands $120 million in AUM and sees $35 million in daily trading volume, making it a significant player in the crypto ETF space. However, many analysts argue that a non-leveraged product like XRPI will attract a wider class of investors, particularly conservative institutions and retirement-focused funds that are often barred from investing in leveraged ETFs. The timing of Volatility Shares’ ETF could not be more strategic. XRP futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are already drawing attention, as the listing provides legally compliant access for US-based institutions. The trading pairs offer monthly and quarterly contracts, settled in cash, and are already showing signs of robust liquidity. By providing 1x exposure through an ETF, Volatility Shares bridges the gap between complex derivatives markets and traditional ETF rails, allowing investors to trade XRP indirectly via any brokerage account that supports ETFs. This structure mimics the success of BITO (ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF) and BTF (Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF), which are based on CME Bitcoin futures. Spot XRP ETF on the Horizon? With the launch of XRPI imminent, speculation has reached fever pitch regarding the fate of a spot XRP ETF. While the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to publicly comment on such an application, insiders suggest that the groundwork is being laid. Ripple’s partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023 provided regulatory clarity around the non-security status of XRP in secondary markets, and the successful launch of CME XRP futures appears to have removed one of the biggest hurdles for spot ETF approval—regulated market surveillance. Industry observers are drawing parallels to the Bitcoin spot ETF approval process, which also began with the launch of CME futures followed by years of market maturation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-22 05:30:00

The token's ability to recover from a sudden drop to 0.0000143 with extraordinary volume support suggests institutional accumulation rather than retail panic. With the psychological support at 0.000015 holding firm and multiple tests of upper resistance, SHIB appears poised for potential continuation of its upward trajectory if current accumulation patterns persist. Technical Analysis Highlights SHIB demonstrated remarkable resilience over the 24-hour period, climbing from 0.0000146 to 0.0000150, representing a 2.85% gain with a range of 0.00000081 (5.64%). The token experienced significant volatility at 17:00 when price plummeted to 0.0000143 before finding strong volume support. A massive 2.83 trillion volume spike—nearly 4x the average—provided crucial support during the recovery phase. Key resistance at 0.0000151 was tested twice during the period, with accumulation patterns forming in the final hours. Three consecutive high-volume candles (23:00-01:00) established a solid foundation above the 0.000015 psychological level. In the last hour, SHIB exhibited notable volatility with a significant price surge at 01:22 when it broke above the 0.0000151 resistance level, reaching 0.00001514 by 01:31. Elevated trading volumes supported the bullish momentum, particularly during the 01:36 candle which recorded nearly 80 billion in volume. A sharp correction at 01:37-01:38 dropped the price 5% to 0.00001505, before establishing a consolidation pattern.

Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Still Outside Of Overbought Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the NVT Golden Cross for Bitcoin. The NVT Ratio is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the BTC market cap and transaction volume. If the utility of the network (measured in terms of the transfer volume) is considered as a reflection of its ‘true’ value, then this ratio can be used for judging whether the price is undervalued or overvalued. Related Reading: $3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows When the value of the indicator is high, it means the value of the network (that is, the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins. Such a trend may be a sign that the asset is becoming overpriced. On the other hand, the indicator being low could imply room for growth in the cryptocurrency’s market cap, as its value is low when compared to the transaction volume. In the context of the current topic, a derivative form of the NVT Ratio is the indicator of interest. This metric, known as the NVT Golden Cross, is a signaling indicator for the NVT Ratio similar to the Bollinger Bands, telling us about whether the ratio’s value is near a top or bottom. The NVT Golden Cross compares two moving averages (MAs) of the NVT Ratio in order to determine this: the 10-day MA to gauge the short-term trend and the 30-day MA for the long-term one. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has been on the rise recently as the cryptocurrency’s price has rallied to a new ATH. At present, the indicator is sitting at a value of 1.5. In the chart, the quant has highlighted two zones for the metric that have been of significance in the past. The region beyond 2.2 (shaded in red) corresponds to the territory where tops generally occur for BTC and that under -1.6 (green) to the bottoming zone.

Tether’s decision to pull USDT from top European exchanges stems from MiCA’s tight rules with no interest payouts, strict cash reserves, capped issuance/redemptions, and required links to EU banks. With USDT gone, RLUSD might be the top contender poised to dominate, since Bitstamp, the leading European cryptocurrency exchange, has already listed RLUSD stablecoin , making it a prime fit. As crypto analyst Jake Claver put it, “Tether took one look and said, ‘we’re out.’” And just like that, a $150 billion liquidity engine exited one of the largest crypto markets. The EU lost its most widely-used stablecoin with USDT being pulled from major exchanges across Europe, all thanks to new MiCA regulations—and Tether’s decision not to play along. That opens up a huge opportunity in the market. But the real question is: who’s going to benefit? The… pic.twitter.com/aqM5WWYTPg — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) May 22, 2025 Ripple Moves In: RLUSD Grabs the Spotlight Without USDT, Europe’s crypto trading landscape looks dented. Liquidity is drying up, and users are slowly shifting to platforms outside the EU. Meanwhile, he said Circle is stepping in with MiCA-compliant USDC and EURC, but their combined market size is still small compared to USDT. While Circle offers compliance, it lacks the scale to replace Tether’s dominance fully. Claver explains, “USDC is compliant but small. Tether is massive but non-compliant. Ripple’s RLUSD brings the best of both worlds.” USDC vs RLUSD: Who Can Fill Tether’s $150B Shoes? Claver highlights that Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could quietly become the biggest winner in this scenario. RLUSD launched in December, fully compliant with MiCA, runs on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, and is supported by Ripple’s institutional partnerships. Unlike other projects focused on the US, Ripple had already built strong global connections, particularly in Asia, where regional stablecoins are gaining popularity. However, Ripple’s early preparation is now paying off. RLUSD offers a rare combination of regulatory alignment and global reach. According to Claver, this positions Ripple as the most likely candidate to fill the stablecoin gap in the EU. With USDT stepping aside and Circle struggling to scale, Ripple has a clear opportunity to reshape the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Launches Digital Asset Authority to Regulate Crypto, Targeting $25B Market , On the Contrary… Hey Jake, How does Tether not being MiCA compliant and not being compliant with the Genius act , affect Bitcoin.

Tether withdrew USDT due to MiCA’s strict regulations, which impose tight rules on stablecoin issuers, including no interest payouts, strict cash reserves, capped issuance, and mandatory links to EU banks. What is MiCA and how does it affect stablecoins in the EU? MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) is a comprehensive EU framework that sets stringent rules for stablecoin issuers, demanding full reserves, regulatory authorization, and transparency to enhance consumer protection and market stability. How does RLUSD compare to Circle’s USDC in the EU market? While USDC is MiCA-compliant, it lacks the scale to fully replace USDT. RLUSD, also compliant, offers a combination of regulatory alignment and Ripple’s global reach, positioning it strongly. What are the broader implications of USDT’s departure for the EU crypto market? USDT’s exit is causing liquidity drying up and users shifting platforms.

According to the official announcement , USD1 will begin trading at 12:00 UTC on May 22 and withdrawals will open the following day. USD1 is a fiat-backed stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. It was launched in March by World Liberty Financial, a Miami-based fintech firm tied to Donald Trump and his family. The token is backed by cash, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and dollar deposits and is issued and managed by BitGo Trust Company, a regulated U.S. trust entity. While reserve audits are conducted regularly, detailed breakdowns remain private. The Binance listing could significantly boost USD1’s liquidity and visibility. Already listed on exchanges like KuCoin, USD1 has quickly become the seventh-largest stablecoin by market cap, surpassing a $2.1 billion market capitalization in May. You might also like: World Liberty Financial approves proposal to airdrop a fixed amount of USD1 to WLFI holders Its rapid rise has been fueled by institutional backing, including a $2 billion investment agreement with Abu Dhabi’s MGX, as well as its growing application in retail payments and decentralized finance platforms. USD1 currently operates on Ethereum ( ETH ) and BNB Chain ( BNB ), with plans to use Chainlink’s ( LINK ) cross-chain protocol to expand to other networks. USD1 aims to become a major competitor to well-known stablecoins like Tether ( USDT ) and USD Coin ( USDC ) by offering features like fee-free minting and institutional-grade custody. But there has been some controversy surrounding stablecoin’s rise. U.S. lawmakers, particularly Senate Democrats, have expressed concern about the Trump family’s close ties to WLFI. The company’s “Chief Crypto Advocate” is Donald Trump, and its “Web3 Ambassadors” are his sons. Given that stablecoin regulation, including the proposed GENIUS Act, is still a contentious topic, critics argue that this raises the possibility of conflicts of interest. Despite the political scrutiny, WLFI maintains that USD1 is fully compliant with U.S. regulations, including anti-money laundering and know-your-customer standards. A recent legal response to a congressional probe dismissed the concerns as “fundamentally flawed.” As USD1 prepares to debut on the world’s largest crypto exchange, all eyes are on whether its momentum can continue.

It took just over four months, but bitcoin managed to do what many thought was impossible just 45 days ago when its price slumped beneath $75,000 and broke its January all-time high of over $109,000. In the following hours, it retraced hard to $106,000, but the bulls took over once again and sent it flying to almost $112,000, which is the current peak. This puts the asset in a price discovery mode, which means a couple of things: 1) all investors are in profit, and 2) there are no historic resistances ahead.

In a market saturated with speculation and short-term gains, UGO takes a bold step toward creating a more balanced and inclusive Web3 economy. Traders can now access UGO through decentralized trading on PancakeSwap, while the token’s user-centric reward structure seeks to empower users, promote longevity, and foster true ecosystem participation. “This isn’t just another token launch—it’s a reimagining of how Web3 ecosystems can and should operate,” said the UGO founding team. “We believe that sustainability, fairness, and utility must coexist from day one. The Hybrid Token Model is our answer to that challenge.” The UGO Difference: A Launch Built for Long-Term Value UGO moves away from traditional crypto launch tactics that favor insiders and early profit takers.

44939942,https://coinpaper.com/9219/genius-act-seen-as-turning-point-in-stablecoin-legitimacy,1747892768,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,GENIUS Act Seen as Turning Point in Stablecoin Legitimacy,https://coinpaper.com/9219/genius-act-seen-as-turning-point-in-stablecoin-legitimacy,"People in the industry like Andrei Grachev argue it could legitimize stablecoins as financial instruments and serve as a cornerstone for a global, programmable financial system. However, some people like Bitget’s Vugar Usi Zade warn that the bill could hurt US-based issuers by placing them at a regulatory disadvantage against dominant offshore players like Tether. The rise of yield-bearing stablecoins also triggered pushback from traditional banks, who are accused of lobbying to block interest payments on stable assets. Meanwhile, Hong Kong passed its own fiat-backed stablecoin legislation, opening the door to licensed issuance by year-end. GENIUS Act Advances Stablecoin Legitimacy The adoption of stablecoins by institutional investors could be poised for massive growth as the United States Senate moves forward with its landmark bill to regulate the sector. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act aims to create a clear legal framework for stablecoin collateralization and enforce Anti-Money Laundering compliance. It advanced past a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and will now proceed to full Senate debate. The GENIUS Act is a big step toward mainstream acceptance of stablecoins. Industry leaders like Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance, believe the bill goes beyond regulation and effectively legitimizes stablecoins as financial instruments. In a Chain Reaction X Spaces interview on May 20, Grachev said that the clarity provided by the legislation could be the confidence booster institutions have been waiting for. According to him, stablecoins have moved beyond the experimental stage and now offer a superior alternative to traditional fiat money by delivering benefits in speed, simplicity, and transparency. Grachev also described the GENIUS Act as potentially the first building block of a more unified digital financial system that is borderless, programmable, and efficient. He noticed that when the US moves on digital asset policy, the global market tends to follow. Co-sponsor of the bill, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, indicated that Memorial Day could be a realistic timeline for the bill’s passage. However, Grachev still warned that regulatory clarity alone will not be enough to trigger widespread institutional adoption. He specifically brought up the need for products that offer stable and predictable yield, and pointed to Falcon Finance’s development of a synthetic yield-bearing dollar product that is tailored for this purpose. On the other hand, not all voices in the industry are entirely satisfied with the bill. Vugar Usi Zade , COO of the Bitget exchange, pointed out that the GENIUS Act does very little to address the influence of offshore stablecoin issuers like Tether, which continue to dominate global liquidity markets. He warned that increased regulatory burdens could place US-based issuers at a disadvantage, and could potentially drive market consolidation and favor larger firms that can afford to meet compliance demands. Despite these criticisms, Zade conceded that the legislation could introduce greater stability to the US stablecoin market if its provisions are implemented effectively. Stablecoins Threaten Bank Monopoly Meanwhile, the rise of yield-bearing stablecoins is igniting tensions between traditional banks and the crypto industry, and critica are accusing the banking sector of lobbying to protect its monopoly on interest-bearing financial products. Austin Campbell , a professor at New York University and founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting, warned in a May 21 social media post that the powerful American banking lobby is ”panicking” over stablecoins' growing ability to disrupt conventional financial services—particularly those that offer yield. Campbell’s post was titled “The Empire Lobbies Back,” and it criticized the banking industry’s efforts to sway lawmakers into opposing interest-paying stablecoins. He mostly directed his comments at Democratic policymakers, and argued that banks are seeking protectionist policies under the guise of safeguarding consumers, while in reality trying to maintain their hold on a system that offers depositors minimal returns. He pointed out that fractional reserve banking allows banks to profit immensely while giving customers very little back, and stablecoins offering interest threaten this model. He also said that the claim stablecoin interest payments would ”harm” banks is little more than an appeal for cartel protection. Campbell urged lawmakers not to back any form of legislation that imposes a blanket ban on stablecoin yield, and warned that doing so would serve banks at the expense of everyday voters. He has been a longtime advocate for practical and transparent stablecoin regulation in the United States and previously warned a Congressional subcommittee in 2023 that failure to pass legislation will push innovation offshore. His comments were made as yield-bearing stablecoins are gaining more traction in the market. In February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first stablecoin security to offer yield, which was Figure Markets’ YLDS token, which pays 3.85% interest. Since then, other initiatives followed suit. Tether co-founder Reeve Collins introduced the Pi Protocol’s USP stablecoin, which is minted in exchange for an interest-bearing counterpart called USI. Meanwhile, Spark Protocol's USDS stablecoin distributes interest derived from decentralized lending and tokenized Treasury products. Industry voices argue that it is no longer acceptable for stablecoin holders not to receive at least the equivalent of the risk-free rate on their assets. Spark Protocol CEO Sam MacPherson explained to Bloomberg that fair yield is a necessary evolution in stablecoin utility. Growth of stablecoins (Source: S&P Global ) According to Coinbase Canada CEO Lucas Matheson , global stablecoin volumes now surpass those of traditional payment giant Visa by a factor of nearly three. For now, the fight over who controls access to interest-bearing products is escalating. Hong Kong Passes Stablecoin Bill Hong Kong officially passed its Stablecoin Bill, which is a major step toward establishing itself as a global hub for digital assets and Web3 development. The region’s Legislative Council approved the bill on its third reading. According to council member Johnny Ng Kit-Chong , the legislation sets the foundation for a regulated framework that will allow major institutions to apply for stablecoin issuer licenses with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority by the end of the year. The bill requires that all stablecoins be backed by fiat currency reserves for investor protection and to ensure the integrity of the digital asset ecosystem. In his announcement, Ng extended a welcoming message to global enterprises that are interested in issuing stablecoins in Hong Kong, and even offered personal assistance to facilitate introductions and strategic partnerships. Ng said that this legislative milestone is just the beginning of a broader push to develop real-world applications for Web3 technologies. He believes stablecoins will play a crucial role in modernizing payment systems, enabling more efficient cross-border transactions, and empowering peer-to-peer commerce. He also advocated for sharing interest earnings with stablecoin holders, and framed it as both an innovation and a tool to enhance financial market stability. With this bill, Hong Kong positions itself as a first mover in the Asia-Pacific region.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-22 05:46:08

The Theory Has Emerged,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/claims-deepen-in-this-huge-altcoin-did-the-founder-sell-a-large-amount-of-coins-the-theory-has-emerged/,"Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson has denied allegations that he embezzled more than $500 million worth of ADA from community funds, but the suspicions of investors and community members remain lingering. Hoskinson, who announced that his company Input Output Global (IOG) would be opened to full auditing after the scandal and handed over control of his social media accounts to independent researchers, continues to be the target of criticism despite this. While all eyes are still on the details of the so-called “redeem scandal” involving 318 million ADA, the audit process continues. In this atmosphere of uncertainty, a new theory has emerged on social media: the claim that Hoskinson indirectly made a fortune from unsold ADA. According to critics, although Hoskinson said he did not sell ADA directly, he may have transferred or directed the assets to asset managers, who in turn sold shares to individual investors through ADA-backed exchange-traded products (ETPs). Allegedly, Hoskinson may have received shares of these funds and then cashed out using capital channeled into ETPs by third-party investors. This method would allow him to claim he did not sell ADA directly, while potentially allowing him to profit indirectly. Related News: New Development in GENIUS Bill That Will Determine the Fate of Cryptocurrencies in the US Some ETP structures allow large investors to redeem their shares in exchange for cash, provided they pay certain transaction fees. This allegedly allowed Hoskinson to technically access cash in exchange for unsold ADAs. Some ETPs with 100% allocation to Cardano include 21Shares Cardano ETP, CoinShares Physical Staked Cardano, WisdomTree Physical Cardano, Bitwise Physical Cardano ETP, Wave ADA Yield Fund, and Valour Cardano ETP. Apart from that, there are also many public altcoin and cryptocurrency index funds that include ADA. However, there is no public information on whether Hoskinson or his affiliates provide ADA to these funds. Charles Hoskinson has often expressed his long-term commitment to ADA and its community. Hoskinson, who often refers to his background as one of the co-founders of Ethereum, has repeatedly said that he has no need to sell ADA. Hoskinson, who categorically denied the allegations, stated that he fully supported the process carried out by the independent auditing firm BDO and the law firm McDermott Will & Emery. IOG said in a statement that the allegations were “unfounded and malicious” and were the product of a “coordinated FUD campaign” designed around the ADA refund program for Japanese investors. *This is not investment advice.

BTC jumped as much as 2.2% before dropping slightly. This is mainly driven by progress on a stablecoin bill in the U.S. Senate that traders believe will bring more straightforward rules and reduce long-standing uncertainty in the crypto industry. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin gains strength as U.S. optimism and institutional demand grow Crypto investors are now more confident about how the U.S. government handles crypto regulation after lawmakers moved forward with a stablecoin bill (Genius Act). The bill creates clear rules for how stablecoins should work and who can issue them. Crypto supporters say the bill shows the U.S. is slowly opening the door to a legal framework that will let companies operate without constantly worrying about getting sued or shut down. If the bill becomes law, the firms will gain more trust from the public and investors. At the same time, Bitcoin prices keep rising because large companies continue to buy more with Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, purchased over $50 billion worth of Bitcoin to become the biggest Bitcoin-holding public company in the world. Saylor has built his entire business strategy around buying and holding as much of it as possible, as he believes Bitcoin is the strongest form of money, inspiring many small-cap companies and newly listed public firms to copy his approach and start putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets. These companies raise money by offering convertible bonds, selling preferred stock, and using SPACs or PIPE deals to buy Bitcoin. Twenty-One Capital Inc., a new firm backed by powerful financial players like Cantor Fitzgerald, stablecoin issuer Tether, and Japanese tech investment firm SoftBank, has also come into play with backers working together to build a company that holds Bitcoin as its main asset and mirrors Strategy’s model. Strive Enterprises Inc., co-founded by entrepreneur and political figure Vivek Ramaswamy, also has one of its subsidiaries merging with Nasdaq-listed Asset Entities Inc. Traders bet big on future highs as Bitcoin regains momentum On Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange, the highest number of open option contracts has gathered around strike prices of $110,000, $120,000, and even $300,000. These contracts are set to expire on June 27, which shows many traders believe Bitcoin will hit or get close to these levels in the near term. Global co-head of markets at crypto platform FalconX, Joshua Lim, explained that Bitcoin is rising slowly and steadily in what he called a “slow-motion grind” into new all-time highs. Much demand is coming from SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) and PIPE deals (private investments in public equity) as companies rush to raise funds quickly. Lim also said that one of the most popular crypto exchanges in the U.S., Coinbase, is showing a price premium on spot Bitcoin trades because people are willing to pay more to buy Bitcoin directly on Coinbase compared to other platforms when demand is much stronger than supply. Tony Sycamore from IG Markets explained that Bitcoin’s big drop from its January high of over $100,000 down to below $75,000 in April was a normal correction inside a larger uptrend. This kind of dip is common during long bull markets and helps reset the market before prices increase. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Jeremy Jordan-Jones was arrested and indicted on May 21 and charged with wire fraud, securities fraud, making false statements to a bank, and aggravated identity theft, the Department of Justice said on May 21. Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton claimed Jordan-Jones “touted his company as a groundbreaking blockchain startup,” but alleged that, in reality, the “company was a sham, and investors’ funds were siphoned off to bankroll his lavish lifestyle.” FBI Assistant Director Christopher Raia alleged that Jordan-Jones defrauded investors of more than 1 million dollars through “misrepresentations of his purported company's capabilities, partnerships, and investment intentions.” Raia claimed the Amalgam founder’s “blatant lies” funded his personal lifestyle at the expense of unknowing victims. An excerpt from the indictment of Jeremy Jordan-Jones. Source: US Department of Justice According to an indictment filed in a Manhattan federal court, from January 2021 to November 2022, Jordan-Jones deceived investors and financial institutions using fabricated documents, fake sports partnerships, and misleading claims, ultimately misappropriating over $1 million for personal use. Related: Ex-Cred execs plead guilty to wire fraud over $150M crypto collapse Amalgam claimed to offer point-of-sale systems and blockchain-based payment and security solutions, the filing states. The indictment alleged the firm had “no operable products, few, if any, customers, and zero legitimate business partnerships.” The filing alleged that instead of channeling the funds into tech development and crypto exchange listings as promised, Jordan-Jones spent the money on luxury vehicles, high-end vacations, clothing and fancy restaurants in Miami. Charges carry decades in prison Jordan-Jones was also accused of submitting a fake bank statement claiming Amalgam held over $18 million in order to secure a company credit card, but prosecutors claimed there were no funds in the bank account and it had been closed in late 2021. Wire fraud and security fraud carry potential penalties of up to 20 years in prison per count, while making false statements to a bank carries up to 30 years. Jordan-Jones was also charged with one count of aggravated identity theft , which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison. The government is seeking forfeiture of any property or money traceable to the fraud, including substitute assets if the original funds are unavailable.

Will DOGE Break $0.25 After Elon’s Latest Endorsement? Could The SEC’s 90% LTC ETF Approval Odds Push Prices Past $120? Why Are Investors Racing To Secure BitLemons Before Stage 4? The crypto market is showing impressive strength with DOGE surging 10% on renewed risk-on sentiment and LTC bouncing 7% on promising ETF developments. Meanwhile, BitLemons ($BLEM) continues to captivate investors with its revolutionary GambleFi protocol and deflationary tokenomics. With Stage 3 now 11.23% complete and Stage 4 on the horizon, this could be your last chance to enter before prices increase from $0.03 to $0.04. Is BitLemons ($BLEM) Positioned To Dominate The Trillion-Dollar Gambling Market? BitLemons ($BLEM) has emerged as the frontrunner in analysts’ top crypto picks for 2025, with its revolutionary approach to disrupting the $450 billion traditional casino industry. Early investors have already witnessed the project’s explosive potential, with the presale already raising an impressive $2,045,922.01 to date. With Stage 3 currently active at $0.03 per token and Stage 4 priced at $0.04 just around the corner, market sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish on this GambleFi powerhouse. What sets BitLemons apart is its robust revenue-sharing model and deflationary tokenomics. This Ethereum-based crypto-betting protocol allocates a substantial 30% of its Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) toward creating sustainable value – 15% for token buybacks and burns, reducing supply to drive prices upward, while the remaining 15% flows directly to $BLEM stakers as rewards. This ingenious strategy transforms $BLEM into a deflationary, passive income-generating asset with built-in upward price pressure. The project has achieved what many crypto projects only dream of – a fully functional platform generating real revenue 24/7 across 8,000+ games from premium providers like Evolution and Pragmatic. While other projects are still developing prototypes, BitLemons is already capturing market share in the massive online gambling sector. Security-conscious investors will appreciate BitLemons’ dual audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, providing a level of validation that competitors simply can’t match. With the current token price at $0.03 and a projected listing price of $0.17-$0.18, early investors stand to gain potentially 6x returns from the current stage price. The presale has already sold 3,670,604 BLEM tokens with 29,021,703 BLEM remaining in Stage 3, explaining why investors are rushing to secure their positions before the next price increase. Will DOGE Break $0.25 After Elon’s Latest Endorsement? The original meme coin shows no signs of slowing down as DOGE surged 10% to $0.226 over the past week. This impressive rally comes amid renewed “risk-on” sentiment in the broader crypto market, bolstered by positive developments in U.S.-China trade relations and growing optimism around crypto ETFs. The technical picture for DOGE looks increasingly bullish as trading volume has spiked 35% week-over-week. After establishing solid support near the $0.20 psychological level, DOGE is now testing critical resistance at $0.24. Analysts suggest that a decisive break above $0.25 could trigger a rapid ascent toward the $0.30 mark. However, failure to breach this level could result in consolidation within the current range. With Elon Musk’s continued endorsements fueling retail interest, DOGE remains a strong portfolio addition for 2025, though its potential returns pale in comparison to what $BLEM offers at this early stage. Could The SEC’s 90% LTC ETF Approval Odds Push Prices Past $120? Litecoin has captured significant attention after the SEC delayed Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin ETF decision on May 6th. Despite the delay, market sentiment remains overwhelmingly positive as industry analysts assigned a 90% probability to eventual approval, triggering LTC’s 7% climb toward the critical $100 threshold. On the charts, LTC has transformed the $95-$100 zone into a robust support level, with bulls defending this area vigorously during recent market fluctuations. Trading volume has increased by 28% as investors position themselves ahead of potential ETF approvals. The technical indicators suggest LTC is coiled for a substantial move, with the $105 resistance representing the final barrier before a potential rally to $120. While LTC presents attractive upside potential with its “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” narrative and renewed interest in fast, low-fee payment networks, early $BLEM investors stand to capture significantly greater returns in the same timeframe. Why Are Investors Racing To Secure BitLemons Before Stage 4? The clock is ticking for investors looking to capitalize on BitLemons’ incredible value proposition at current prices. With Stage 3 already 11.23% sold and the price set to increase from $0.03 to $0.04 in Stage 4, smart money is moving quickly to secure positions. How often does an opportunity arise to invest in a fully functional platform already generating revenue, backed by dual security audits, and offering a proven deflationary tokenomics model? BitLemons represents that rare convergence of timing and value that seasoned crypto investors recognize as potentially life-changing. Unlike speculative projects with nothing but promises, $BLEM offers a tangible product disrupting a massive global industry, with 30% of all gaming revenue flowing back to token holders through burns and staking rewards. The project’s momentum is undeniable – having already raised over $2 million with 3,670,604 BLEM tokens sold to date. With multiple payment options available, including direct crypto purchases and credit card payments, BitLemons has made it remarkably simple for investors of all backgrounds to participate in this groundbreaking opportunity before prices increase again.

Fueled by a bold political identity, rising visibility, and a carefully crafted token structure, this project is striking a chord with both retail speculators and strategic traders. It offers a rare blend of cultural relevance and structural integrity—two traits that rarely align this early in a project’s life cycle. With a target listing price of $0.007 and current entry levels still deeply undervalued, analysts estimate a 25x upside in the months ahead. And with a promotional bonus still available through the PATRIOT35X code, some are projecting up to 35x returns through increased token allocations for early backers. Here’s why traders are increasingly betting on MAGACOIN FINANCE: It taps directly into the U.S. political narrative—perfectly timed for 2025 election-driven attention Its media presence is expanding across major platforms like Google News and MSN , increasing visibility The project is aggressively incentivizing early buyers through exclusive bonus offers, drawing in high-risk capital XRP: Institutional Use, But Limited Multiples Ahead XRP continues to deliver value as a payment-focused asset, supported by global settlement use and a strong institutional narrative. However, with prices hovering near $2.30 and short-term projections topping out around $5–$10, the upside is relatively capped. For long-term holders, it remains a core part of the portfolio—but for aggressive growth, many are reallocating toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum: Solid Infrastructure, Slower Growth Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady around $2,700 , buoyed by ETF optimism and Layer-2 expansion. While ETH remains the dominant Layer-1 for smart contracts, it’s less attractive to risk-on traders in search of outsized returns in the current market environment. That gap in potential is drawing capital toward emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin and Polkadot Stay Grounded Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating above $104,000 , acting as a macro anchor. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT) is gradually reawakening, with developers revisiting parachain projects and investors watching for renewed activity. Both remain solid foundations—but in terms of breakout narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is pacing ahead. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion The 2025 cycle may ultimately belong to the unexpected. While XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and Polkadot continue to play important roles, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s capturing real FOMO among high-risk portfolios. With Stage 8 nearly filled and listings on the horizon, MAGA could be the surprise altcoin that defines this cycle’s upside.

Hyperliquid Sees Record Trades Led by Bitcoin and a $1B Bet from Top Trader Hyperliquid’s trading volume reached $19.15b over the past 24 hours. BTC alone accounted for $11.5b of that, followed by ETH at $4.03b and SOL at $1.2b. Meme coins such as HYPE, kPEPE, and FARTCOIN also saw substantial activity, with HYPE crossing $454m in volume. One of the most notable developments was top trader James Wynn Real’s leveraged position on BTC, which became the first to exceed $1b on Hyperliquid. His position used 40x leverage and involved over 10,000 BTC. The entry price was $108,084, while the liquidation price was $103,640. As a result, the unrealized profit stood at $17.5m at the time of reporting.

Interestingly, as ETH climbs, tokens built on its platform often follow, and PEPE is no exception, thanks to its strong community support and steady price action. However, one new ETH token, Remittix (RTX) , is quietly stealing the show. It emerges with a focus on making online payments easy and reliable. Find out what is currently making these tokens key players to watch in the market. Ethereum Price Eyes Recovery As Whale Activity And ETF Inflows Rise Source: Glassnode Ethereum’s supply on major exchanges has dropped to a 10-year low as large investors buy and hold more ETH. Over 1 million ETH were removed from exchanges in just one month, indicating strong confidence in Ethereum’s future. Since late April, large holders have added over 450,000 ETH , reaching their highest ownership since March.

Dormant PEPEWhale Sparks Major Market Rally Source: X/LookOnChain A dormant PEPE whale re-emerged after two years, withdrawing over 2.2 trillion PEPE tokens worth approximately $29 million from Binance in two separate transactions within 24 hours. This large-scale withdrawal, moving roughly 2% of Binance’s PEPE reserves into self-custody wallets, signals a shift toward long-term accumulation and renewed confidence in the meme coin’s future. Source: Coinmarketcap Following the whale’s activity, PEPE’s price surged significantly, marking a 72% gain over the past month. PEPE price rally also boosted derivatives markets, with $2 million in short position liquidations and a 15% increase in futures open interest, which now exceeds $500 million. Remittix: Making Crypto Payments Actually Useful What sets Remittix apart isn’t flashy branding or speculative frenzy. It’s the fact that it works, and it solves a problem most crypto users have run into at least once: how to send money using crypto and have the other person receive actual fiat in a bank account. Remittix makes that possible in just a few clicks. Users connect their wallet, enter recipient details, and send crypto. Conversely, the recipient receives fiat directly into their bank account. There are no extra apps, no exchange logins, no blockchain learning curve, just results. This simplicity hides a powerful engine behind it. Remittix uses Ethereum’s smart contracts and local payment networks in over 100 countries to quickly convert crypto to fiat, often on the same day. It supports more than 30 local currencies and ensures no foreign exchange markups or hidden fees, so what you send is exactly what they receive. From freelancers invoicing across borders to businesses settling payments in real time, Remittix opens up various possibilities. It’s a DeFi solution built with TradFi usability, bridging two worlds that usually struggle to communicate. Remittix Presale Momentum Builds With Over 537 Million Tokens With the current price set at $0.0781, RTX has already seen a whopping $15.2 million raise in presale. The next phase will push the price to $0.0811, offering a final opportunity for investors to lock in at a competitive rate before broader market exposure. Adding to the excitement, the token’s limited supply of 1.5 billion ensures scarcity, further driving potential value. Participants also have the chance to enter a $250,000 giveaway, with 10 winners sharing the prize. So, don’t wait on the sidelines. Join the new PayFi revolution with Remittix’s presale.

With XRP now priced at $2.33 after a meteoric 500% uptick late last year, analysts are setting even more bullish XRP price predictions with targets set at $20 per XRP. Stellar’s XLM is also making a huge comeback, as seen by its 165% uptick in the last year. Both XLM and XRP price predictions are bullish. However, for those looking to ride the PayFi wave, no other token offers a better chance for a 100x gain than Remittix . This emerging PayFi protocol has seen its presale raise over $15.2 million in a brief spell and analysts say it could rally 3,000% on launch. Bullish XRP price predictions resurface while institutional FOMO sets in XRP will now be incorporated into UAE banks thanks to a partnership between Ripple and the UAE’s Zand and Mamo bank. In addition to increased efficiency through XRP’s cross-border payment network, Ripple’s partnership with UAE banks will also reduce fees and shorten transaction settlement periods. There’s more: XRP’s institutional adoption is taking off as seen by Dubai’s move to adopt XRP’s ledger for the tokenization of its real estate market. Also, with the easing of US regulatory standards, XRP price prediction forecasts a brighter future for XRP and its legal battle with the SEC. Increased demand for XRP internationally and among institutions in the US could lead to increased buying pressure that could see XRP reach new highs. Image Source: Coingecko On the charts, XRP is setting up for a bullish resurgence above $3.0. In the last month, XRP’s price has surged 13.7%, but its year-to-date uptick is over 350%. With XRP’s increasing institutional appeal, a bullish XRP price prediction could materialize. Stellar XLM sets up a bullish Gartley pattern with a price set to reach $0.90 The PayFi sector is growing and institutional adoption is not just focused on XRP price predictions but also on XLM’s progress. With a reputation for running on one of the most interoperable blockchains, XLM’s chart has set up a Gartley pattern with Fibonacci support showing imminent bullish potential. Image Source: CoinMarketCap From its current price of $0.28, analysts are forecasting a potential upward move that could see XLM break the $0.50 resistance zone and settle at the $0.65 to $0.75 range. XLM’s price is gaining bullish momentum as seen by its year-to-date uptick of over 165%, adding to a monthly price increase of 16.9%. While XLM still faces short-term risk if it fails to hold the $0.27 support level, its upward potential in the long run is inevitable. Remittix’s RTX presale shakes up the PayFi space Remittix’s RTX is the new kid on the PayFi block. Remittix plans to reinvent cross-border payments in a way that rivals what XRP and XLM have done in the past. Remittix has gained the attention of investors who have raised over $15.2 million in its ongoing presale. RTX is now priced at $0.0781 and the next stage of the presale will see the price increase to $0.0811. Analysts are forecasting a potential 3,000% uptick that would turn a modest $1000 investment into millions. At its core, Remitix is a revolutionary PayFi protocol that prioritizes simplicity and affordability. Crypto holders can use Remittix to send funds to a recipient’s bank account across more than 30 fiat currencies. There is also a PAY API that businesses can use to accept crypto payments from their customers. All transactions come at a flat fee and there are zero hidden costs. With a focus on serving everyone, no matter their location and economic standing, Remittix is gearing up for mass adoption. Could RTX lead the future of remittances?

Cointelegraph shared the exciting news on X. This initiative aims to facilitate the integration of traditional financial instruments, such as stocks and bonds, onto blockchain platforms, potentially unlocking a market valued at approximately $30 trillion. Following this announcement, Sistine Research drew attention to Robinhood’s acquisition of Bitstamp , which is building a perpetual Decentralized Exchange (perp DEX) on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), exciting the XRP army as the digital asset and its network are prime candidates for RWA tokenization. Robinhood is also acquiring Bitstamp which is building a perp dex on XRP Ledger. https://t.co/Q0rYwm6c7R — Sistine Research (@sistineresearch) May 20, 2025 Robinhood’s Major Moves in the Crypto Space Last year, Robinhood acquired Bitstamp for approximately $200 million, and the company recently commended Ripple’s success in tokenization on the XRPL . Its acquisition of Bitstamp is more noteworthy as the perp DEX on the XRPL could start a broader range of tokenization services on the ledger. Bitstamp holds over 50 active licenses and registrations worldwide, providing Robinhood with an immediate expansion into global markets. In early 2024, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev emphasized that the absence of clear regulations in the U.S. hampers innovation and could result in the country lagging behind other global financial markets in adopting tokenized securities. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This proposal aims to fix that problem, offering a framework for regulating RWAs. A regulated environment for these products would ensure investor protection while facilitating broader market participation. This is a critical step toward bridging traditional finance with emerging blockchain infrastructure. Tokenization on the XRP Ledger Tokenization involves creating digital representations of RWAs on a blockchain, enabling improved liquidity, faster settlement times, and fractional ownership. Robinhood’s initiative formalizes how blockchain technology can serve established financial systems. Tokenization has numerous benefits for XRP and the broader ecosystem. By enabling the representation of RWAs on-chain, tokenization can increase utility and demand for XRP as a bridge currency in transactions. It enhances liquidity, reduces settlement times, and lowers costs. Dubai Land Department recently launched tokenized land deeds on XRPL . With Robinhood leading the charge for regulated RWA tokenization, XRP will get the chance to fulfill its goal of dominating the tokenization market and integrating into traditional financial circles.

Frog memecoins are established within the decentralised space and have been consistently set in motion by high profile references to the Pepe meme. These mentions have been made by the likes of Elon Musk and even Donald Trump. Frogger is setting the trend and aligning itself in a similar manner which led these memecoins to billions in market cap. A key differentiator for Frogger is its broad token distribution—less than 55% is held by the top 100 holders, with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as the largest holder. This distribution resembles other memecoins such as $DOGE $PEPE and $SHIBA before they went parabolic. Recognition and Growing Credibility Frogger has already captured attention and recognition amongst multiple social media influencers and content creators. This was expected as Frogger has History, Culture and Relevance. The 1981 arcade Frogger game was one of the most popular and most sold out during the Arcade Era grossing $135million in North America for Sega/Gremlin becoming their most successful release. Additionally Vitalik Buterin is the top holder having acquired Frogger organically. What’s more is the Pepe Deployer is also one of the top 100 holders garnering watchful eyes within domain. Frogger isn’t just riding a wave—it is the wave. With deep roots in internet lore, cultural cachet from day one, this isn’t another memecoin—it’s a movement. Tokenomics Frogger’s decentralized ethos and simple tokenomics mirror those of other major memecoins like $SHIBA, $PEPE, $DOGE, $WIF, and $FLOKI. A rapidly growing community, zero tax and a burnt liquidity pool. Thanks to its minimalist contract design, transactions are seamless and scalability is built-in, ensuring new holders can join easily—crucial in the swift-moving meme coin market. Will Frogger be the next Frog meme to hit BILLIONS in market cap? Historically, frog memes have proven to be some of the most powerful and enduring symbols in the meme coin world. Take $Pepe, for example — it dominated the last cycle, soaring to a fully diluted valuation exceeding $12 billion. This undeniable success highlights one clear truth: frog-themed tokens have a unique ability to capture the hearts of retail investors. So, the question is — could Frogger be the defining frog meme of this cycle? With its community-driven story and a rapidly growing base of over 2,000 holders, Frogger is poised to be far more than just another meme coin. It represents an evolving narrative that every participant can shape, potentially leading the next wave of meme coin culture. Get Involved with Frogger Frogger offers something new in the Memecoin space. An evolving frog-themed cryptocurrency attracting new investors and arcade game lovers from the 80s and 90s.

The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) will serve as a regulatory body to oversee licensing, regulate exchanges , custodians, wallets, tokenized platforms, stablecoins and decentralized finance applications, according to a May 21 report from the state-owned broadcaster, PTV. Muhammad Aurangzeb, federal minister for finance and revenue, told the broadcaster, “Pakistan must regulate not just to catch up, but to lead” in the industry. “With the PDAA, we are creating a future-ready framework that protects consumers, invites global investment, and puts Pakistan at the forefront of financial innovation,” he said.

The new regulatory body was part of a recommendation from the Pak­istan advisory body, the Cryptocurrency Cou­ncil, which was launched on March 14 and has former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao as an adviser . “This is not just about crypto — it’s about rewriting our financial future, expanding access, and creating new export channels through tokenization, digital finance and Web3 innovation,” said Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of Pakistan's Crypto Council. Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency previously proposed a regulatory framework for digital assets designed to address terrorism financing, money laundering provisions, and Know Your Customer concerns, according to am April 10 report from local newspaper, The Express Tribune. Pakistan crypto market rises despite early skepticism In May 2023, former Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Aisha Ghaus Pasha said that Pakistan would never legalize cryptocurrencies due to the potential for digital assets to circumvent regulations created by the Financial Action Task Force, the supranational organization that polices finance for money laundering.

XRP is not left out, especially after a major update on the XRP ETF, the U.S. Senate’s surprising approval of a stablecoin regulation bill, and the rise of a game-changing player in crypto-to-fiat payments—Remittix. While the XRP news continues to spark investor excitement, many eyes are now on the practical side of crypto adoption. Since linking digital money and traditional banks is so important today, Remittix is taking the lead by redesigning how payments are made between countries. Let’s learn more about Remittix and the recent XRP news. XRP news: XRP’s ETF delays, Stablecoin expansion, and Ripple–Circle rumors fuel market buzz The crypto world is buzzing after the U.S. SEC again delayed its decision on a spot XRP ETF. Analyst James Seyffart noted that while key deadlines loom, no action is expected until late June or possibly year-end. Despite the ETF delays, there’s some positive news for the XRP ecosystem. The Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin, XSGD, has officially launched on the XRP Ledger. Developed by StraitsX and supported by major banks DBS and Standard Chartered, XSGD offers faster, more secure, and lower-cost digital transactions. Meanwhile, a new rumor is swirling: Ripple may have secretly acquired Circle, the company behind USDC, the second-largest stablecoin. Source: Coinmarketcap While unconfirmed, the speculation has stirred excitement in the XRP community. Ripple recently launched its stablecoin (RLUSD), but acquiring USDC would instantly boost its position in the stablecoin market. XRP is currently up 10% this month. Remittix Simplifies Asset Transfer—Presale Raise Surpasses $15M Imagine being able to send crypto like USDT or ETH and having it instantly arrive as dollars, euros, or naira in a local bank account—no conversion fees, no delays, and no technical fuss. That’s precisely what Remittix does. Unlike traditional remittance systems that involve third-party banks, wire fees, or clunky wait times, Remittix lets users connect their wallets and instantly send funds that land in over 30 fiat currencies. This isn’t just theory. Remittix is making it a tangible reality! Instead of waiting endlessly for a money transfer and getting ripped off by the usual exorbitant transfer fees, anyone can use Remittix’s PayFi solution to facilitate instant money transfers globally with no surprise deductions. Security and transparency are integral to Remittix. Every transaction is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, and Remittix smart contracts have undergone audits to ensure safety. The user interface mimics familiar banking apps, making it easy even for non-tech-savvy users. The recipient never has to know the payment started as crypto; they just receive their money as a standard bank deposit. Many industry experts believe that this smooth crypto-to-fiat layer will finally push mainstream adoption. RTX Presale Momentum And Price Outlook Remittix’s native token, RTX, powers its ecosystem and is currently in presale. The token has already raised over $15.2 million in its ongoing presale, offering early investors a front-row seat in this financial revolution. Analysts are already buzzing with bullish forecasts. With the current presale price at $0.0781 and the next tier set to rise to $0.0811, early RTX holders could see a substantial upside if adoption continues on its current trajectory.

The Bitcoin price has now surged and marked new highs a few moments ago. This move seems to have flipped the market trajectory, as the altcoins like Solana are close to validating a bullish breakout. The SOL price seems to be at the foothill of a massive explosion, and hence, a rise above $220 seems to be imminent. The crypto markets have turned bullish as Bitcoin smashed a new ATH close to $112K. Despite the rise, the bearish activity is restrictive, suggesting more upside potential for the token. As a result, the top 10 cryptos, including Solana, are believed to remain elevated, while the pace of the rally may fade to some extent. Currently, the SOL price is working hard to validate a rebound from the crucial support. A successful rise could elevate the levels by nearly 8%; however, a final correction could be in place before rising above $200. As seen in the above chart, the Solana price is trading close to the apex of the rising wedge. The price triggers a rebound from the support and seems to be advancing towards the resistance close to $195. The CMF has been rising since the start of the month, while the MACD is about to undergo a bullish crossover, being within the positive range. Hence, the price could be poised to maintain a healthy upswing ahead. Meanwhile, after a breakout from the rising wedge, the token may face a correction that could drag the levels back to $180 or slightly lower. After squeezing out all the selling pressure, the bulls are believed to take over the rally and push the levels back above $200 in a short time. However, the Solana (SOL) price may face some bearish action at these levels, but the bulls could have held a tight grip over the rally, which may keep up the bullish momentum over the rally and test the higher targets at $220 initially and later at $250.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 06:16:16

According to Mister Crypto, daily gains of up to 40% may soon become the norm. Three of the top altcoins investors can buy in anticipation of gains like these are Ethereum (ETH), Unilabs (UNI), and Cardano (ADA). Let’s see how high these altcoins are set to go in the coming altseason. Ethereum (ETH) Could Peak At $10-20K This Year Since the Pectra upgrade launched, Ethereum has been one of the most bullish coins in the market. Starting the month as low as $1,750, the Ethereum price soared to a monthly high of $2,700. While it faced a rejection at this level, there are hints that the ETH altcoin price could be ready for a massive pump. Crypto_Goos has spotted a golden cross on the 12H Ethereum price chart. This bullish pattern often happens just before a massive Ethereum price pump. A repeat of the golden cross pattern could see Ethereum set a new ATH above $5,000. Another crypto commentator, Friedrich, has set his price target as high as $10k for Ethereum. The prediction from the popular crypto signal channel, Crypto GEMs is more bullish. According to Crypto GEMs, ETH is behaving like it did in the 2016-2017 bull cycle. With the same bullish breakout expected, they predict that the Ethereum price could soar above $20k, possibly reaching $35k this year. Whales Jump on Unilabs (UNIL) For Next Level Profitability Unilabs (UNIL) has emerged among the top crypto coins receiving massive whale interest ahead of the altseason. Unilabs launched to huge early interest from investors because of its unique positioning as the world’s first AI-backed DeFi asset manager. Unilabs uses advanced AI technology to review the crypto market and discover the best crypto investment selections. People who invest in Unilabs can join one of four funds, the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and the Mining Fund. AI insights are used at Unilabs to control every fund to maximize their profitability. Unilabs also automatically rebalances the portfolios of its investors to make the most profit from different assets. So, investors on every level can begin earning money without effort. While just beginning its crypto ICO phase, Unilabs already manages over $30 million in AUM for investors. The high number of happy clients suggests Unilabs has the potential to play a leading role in the crypto investment market. Another reason why UNIL has been in great demand is because of its high APY, up to 122%. Over 163 million $UNIL has been sold, helping Unilabs raise over $750k in presale. While $UNIL is still priced at $0.0051, experts believe it could crack the top 50 cryptos as more investors register on Unilabs. Cardano (ADA) Set for Massive Pump Ahead of Upgrade Just like Ethereum, Cardano (ADA) is anticipating a major blockchain upgrade. Charles Hoskinson recently said that Cardano’s Leios upgrade could potentially reach 11,000 TPS, outperforming Solana. With this excitement, experts believe the Cardano price could experience a massive pump could happen soon. JRNYTV predicts that the Cardano update will propel the $ADA price to a new all-time high of $10 in 2025. TapTools also posted an update implying that the Cardano coin could experience a major pump soon. According to TapTools, over $932 million in Cardano has been removed from controlled exchanges (CEXs) since the beginning of 2025. They announced that the last time we saw ADA outflows of this level was in 2021. Similarly, in 2021, Cardano was one of the top altcoins to buy, as it pumped to its current ATH of $3.10. If the trend repeats, Sssebi believes ADA could easily pump by 10-20x. The Best Crypto To Buy As the altseason nears, investors seeking big returns are jumping on Ethereum and Cardano. This is understandable as they are among the top 10 altcoins. However, $UNIL looks set to deliver the biggest gains. Because Unilabs generates massive profits for its investors, it could potentially secure up to 0.1% of traditional investors, giving $UNIL massive upside potential.

Microsoft said in a May 21 blog post that a federal court in Georgia allowed the firm’s digital crimes unit to take down, block or suspend nearly 2,300 websites critical to Lumma’s operations, and it has collaborated with local and international law enforcement agencies to dismantle the project’s infrastructure. The company said the US Department of Justice seized Lumma’s central command structure and disrupted marketplaces where the tool was sold to other cybercriminals. Microsoft says that Lumma has been sold via underground forums since 2022 and that it has undergone multiple upgrades since its launch. Domains seized by Microsoft. Source: Microsoft Blog Europol’s European Cybercrime Center and Japan’s Cybercrime Control Center also facilitated the suspension of locally based Lumma infrastructure. Lumma is a malware tool that allows malicious actors to steal everything from passwords, credit card information, bank account details, and crypto wallet information. Between March 16 and May 16, Microsoft said it identified over 394,000 Windows computers infected by the Lumma malware and worked with law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity firms to sever communications between the tool and the infected devices. Malicious activity on the rise Crypto drainers are software designed to steal the contents of crypto wallets and are common on phishing sites, malicious extensions, fake airdrops and more. Earlier this week, Chinese printer manufacturer Procolored had reportedly distributed Bitcoin-stealing malware alongside its official drivers, resulting in the loss of around $953,000 worth of crypto. Related: Beware of ‘cracked’ TradingView — it’s a crypto-stealing trojan Last month, an AMLBot report said that crypto drainers are now being sold as a SaaS product, allowing unsophisticated bad actors to rent the service for as little as $100. A Feb. 7 report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said that almost $51 billion worth of crypto was lost in 2024 due to fraudulent activity and that professional crime networks, fraud cartels, nation-state-sponsored hackers and AI-powered scams have taken center stage. The FBI’s cyber arm reported that Americans lost around $9.3 billion in 2024 through crypto scams and frauds. The most vulnerable age group was above the age of 60. Meanwhile, North Korean hackers have stolen nearly $3 billion worth of cryptocurrencies between 2017 and 2023, which crypto firm Paradigm said have become more sophisticated over the years.

The milestone follows a brief dip to $106,000 and shows growing investor appetite for alternative assets amid rising macroeconomic uncertainty. The immediate catalyst appears to be the weak demand in the U.S. Treasury’s $16 billion 20-year bond auction on May 21. Investors pushed for lower prices, which in turn drove bond yields above 5.1%. In bond markets, yields and prices move inversely, meaning that when demand falls, prices drop and yields rise. Bonds are usually more appealing when yields are higher, but when yields rise too quickly because of poor demand, it may be an indication that people are losing faith in government debt. The ripple effect extended across other maturities, with the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields climbing to 4.58% and 5.08%, respectively. Additionally, Japan’s 30-year yield jumped to a record 3.19%. Given that long-term government debt is typically seen as a safe haven in the global bond market, these moves point to a wider sense of unease.

Trenchev cited soft U.S. inflation data, a U.S.-China trade de-escalation, and Moody’s downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. “It’s possible a three-month window has opened for risk assets to thrive,” he added. On-chain data supports this rotation. Bitcoin’s realized market cap has crossed $912 billion, marking a $27 billion capital inflow since early May. Exchange inflows have dropped 82% since November, according to CryptoQuant, suggesting fewer holders are selling. Meanwhile, Tether ( USDT ) balances on exchanges, seen as a proxy for crypto buying power, have hit a record $46.9 billion. Bitcoin just hit a new all-time high.

In a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Ohio-based Strive says it is joining hands with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to secure Bitcoin holdings at a discount price. The plan is to go after BTC claims that have already received definitive legal judgments but are still awaiting distribution. Strive is interested in the Bitcoin claims related to Mt. Gox. The now bankrupt crypto exchange operated between 2010 and 2014 and oversaw more than 70% of Bitcoin transactions at its peak. The Tokyo-based firm collapsed following a security breach that led to the theft of 750,000 BTC. The 75,000 BTC claims from the Mt. Gox estate are currently worth over $8.2 billion based on the flagship crypto asset’s price of $109,963. “This strategy is intended to allow Strive the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin exposure at a discount to market price, enhancing Bitcoin per share and supporting its goal of outperforming Bitcoin over the long run.” Strive submits the disclosure as it plans to team up with the social media marketing firm Asset Entities to form the first publicly traded asset management Bitcoin treasury company.

44942568,https://nulltx.com/?p=149831,1747897473,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Tron Surpasses $75B in USDT Supply as Network Solidifies Its Role in Global Settlement,https://nulltx.com/tron-surpasses-75b-in-usdt-supply-as-network-solidifies-its-role-in-global-settlement/,"Tron has become a powerhouse in the stablecoin ecosystem. The total supply of Tether (USDT) on the network hit a significant milestone last week, surpassing $75 billion. That figure represents over half of the total supply of USDT across all blockchains (most of which is on Ethereum), and signals not just explosive growth since the start of 2025, but also a shift in how and where stablecoins are being used. The upsurge in USDT supply is only one facet of this complex tale. Tron has emerged as a favored infrastructure layer for a range of applications. These include cross-border payments, retail transfers, and exchange settlements. This places Tron in the center of a burgeoning financial services ecosystem. Its rapid growth positions it as a key player, if not the key player, for the aforementioned applications. Tron Becomes the Leading Chain for USDT Activity Although Ethereum is still a key space for DeFi and high-end, institutional applications, Tron has established itself as the go-to place for some very specific decentralized finance activities—and the only place for some of this activity. It has become the dominant chain for Tether activity. More than half of the USDT circulating in the world today is on Tron, and it might as well be a kind of central bank for stablecoin liquidity. Even more remarkable is how big the scale of this activity is. Last week, the on-chain volume for USDT on Tron hit an all-time high of $166.5 billion — the highest weekly volume the network has ever seen. And this uptick in USD(T) not only translates into a lot more tokens floating around, but also seems to indicate a fair amount of actual usage, with all kinds of money-moving happening from Tron’s user base. Tron has been integrated into almost all of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, and has very low transaction fees. Because of these two reasons, Tron’s blockchain has become a great layer for moving funds around swiftly and at a very low cost, especially when you compare it to Ethereum, which has a layer that’s far from speedy, and whose transaction fees (known as “gas” fees) tend to spike during times when the network is congested. Retail Usage Dominates by Count, But Volume Comes from Big Players The other thing that makes the Tron network so dominant is that it has the most user activity of all the networks. It hosts about 75% of all USDT addresses. And those addresses, on average, do about 2.15 million transfers a day. On average. The vast majority of those transfers are between $10 and $10,000. So these are not big transfers. For everyday users, the utility of stablecoins is growing, as seen in the current explosion of small transfers. This trend seems most pronounced in regions where limited access to traditional banking and volatile fiat currencies push people toward more reliable financial instruments. In such places, USDT on Tron seems a go-to option for a simple, stable way to store value, make payments, and access the global economy. The USDT supply on @trondao surpassed $75 billion last week, following explosive growth since the start of the year. Let's dive into Tron's stablecoin success pic.twitter.com/TbHBgN3RpS — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 20, 2025 However, even though retail is very active in terms of the sheer number of transactions, it is still large-scale movement of funds that drives the major share of retail’s outsize appearance in the flat little pie charts that crypto exchanges like to publish. Approximately 71% of all USDT volume on Tron comes not from people buying and selling, but from transfers of a better-than-average-size using the network for settlements and managing treasury functions. This two-fold structure — a large number of small transfers counterbalanced by a handful of large ones — demonstrates that Tron is becoming ever more vital as both a means for retail transactions and a vehicle for settling wholesale accounts. Illicit Use Declines as Legitimate Activity Surges One area where Tron has made remarkable strides is in mitigating the obscene behavior associated with transfers of stablecoins. In 2023, the network drew the ire of many in the crypto world for being the home of a huge volume of dubious transactions. But by April 2024, when we crunched the numbers, they showed that the share of these kinds of transactions had dropped by nearly half, suggesting that the network is being used in a more legitimate way and is maturing, in the regulatory sandbox sense. This decrease occurs as the crypto sector makes a concerted effort to clean up on-chain finance. By using on-chain finance, a person should comply with global regulations. The current effort by the crypto sector makes a clear case for the sustainable and transparent ecosystems that should accommodate the building blocks of on-chain finance. If on-chain usage continues to attract business flows in a legitimate way, then the on-chain finance that it uses has the potential to be a strong signal for all who are likely to build on-chain finance next. Conclusion The stablecoin economy is now receiving a huge boost from the blockchain network Tron. It had no share, as all, of USDT (the Tether stablecoin) in 2019. Now, Tron has the majority share of USDT in 2025, making it the network that serves the greatest number of USDT users globally. Alongside this, Tron serves over two million users a day who rely on its various smart contracts to complete their business transactions — making Tron into something not at all unlike the traditional global payments network, Visa. The network is developing rapidly under an ever-watchful eye of regulators, and it remains to be seen whether Tron can keep the system compliant while also yielding the efficiencies of a finance protocol working in the real world. For now, though, Tron’s success with a stablecoin seems like a step toward making its network more suitable for all kinds of crypto activities, from trading to lending.

This incident underscores the growing risks of social engineering attacks in the crypto sector and highlights the urgent need for tighter operational security at major exchanges. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With Bitcoin having recently broken the $107,000 mark for the first time since January, much excitement has spilled over into discussions around several other big-name tokens. Attention has been focused once more on Bitcoin and on its fundamental role as a hedge against inflation and as a long-term store of value. Yet at the present moment, a rather mixed bag of assets—DeFi tokens, politically linked assets, stablecoins—are generating their own waves of conversation and speculation, not all of which is entirely sane. Bitcoin Eyes New All-Time High, Social Buzz Follows Bitcoin is still the leading topic in the cryptocurrency discussion as it nears what could be a new all-time high. After breaking through the $107,000 level, the number one cryptocurrency seems to have a renewed engagement on social media. The dialogue appears to have shifted back to some of its long-standing talking points, and they are as follows: 1. Long-term investment case (still valid, still holding strong, still a conversation point). 2. Ability to withstand macroeconomic shifts (Bitcoin “isolationism”). 3. Safety and soundness: decentralized, not controlled by anyone, and no one can mess with it. Renewed momentum has long-term holders celebrating, while new entrants wonder if they have missed the boat or if this is still a very early stage. Analysts are watching the institutional inflows closely and, in the context of inflation and global economic uncertainty, are drawing Bitcoin’s newfound status as a modern digital reserve asset into the appeal conversation. Altcoins in the Spotlight: From Politics to DeFi Innovation Bitcoin may yet lead the way in value, but a range of altcoins commands attention for reasons that go beyond price action. Among the most talked-about is TRUMP ($TRUMP), a politically charged token that keeps the waters stirred. Recently, a surge of media coverage and online chatter spilling over from discussions about Donald Trump, both in his capacity as former U.S. president and as a current player in global politics, has lent the coin an ever-increasing visibility. In the decentralized finance space, Aave ($AAVE) is making all the right headlines. The on-chain lending platform has posted stellar performance numbers—its Total Value Locked (TVL), by various estimates, is now somewhere between 25 and 40.7 billion dollars (for contrast, Aave’s all-time low TVL, in October 2022, was 6.7 billion). Its actual $AAVE token price has increased this past week between 15% and 25%, and the trading volumes have been very healthy—up between 35% and 50% (depending on the source) over this past week—across the three major exchanges. Overall, Aave provides a clear compliance pathway for regulatory acts like the GENIUS Act. As Bitcoin has climbed above $107K for the first time since January, teasing a new all-time high, these are the coins seeing the top rises in talks across social media: Bitcoin $BTC : Crypto's #1 coin breached $107K, closing in on a new ATH. Chats include long-term… pic.twitter.com/DeoHORxZaL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 20, 2025 Ankr ($ANKR), meanwhile, sits at a crossroads. Community sentiment has split, with some users expressing frustration over perceived delays and poor communication from the team. Criticism focuses on what some see as stagnation and unmet expectations. But others point to ongoing development, like integration with Neura and enhancements to token utility. They’re call for transparency and community engagement. Leader’s gonna lead. Stablecoins and XRP: Financial Infrastructure Under the Microscope The stablecoin sector is also creating a stimulating social media discourse, with USD Coin ($USDC) at the center of all the speculation. As a cornerstone of digital finance, USDC’s role is being analyzed and reanalyzed as the same old, same old conversation around USDC’s purported liquidity starts to bubble up again. Why? Because once again, people are asking whether USDC might be sort of kinda close to maybe, possibly, a stablecoin under threat from the same forces that seem to be threatening a lot of crypto: regulation and litigation. Now, XRP is becoming all the more relevant, and not by coincidence. The various converging factors influencing some recent price momentum make an up-to-the-minute look at XRP quite interesting. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity service, which uses XRP as a bridge currency, is now operational in 24 countries. The service, underscoring XRP’s cross-border utility, attracts very little of the front-line attention that is quickly funneled to Ripple’s many efforts to scale this product. Introducing XSGD, a Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin deployed on the XRP Ledger, and Ripple’s push into global payments and finance have made XRP a key player in the crypto infrastructure. The ongoing competition between Ripple and Coinbase in places like the institutional finance adds to the intrigue. Conclusion With Bitcoin almost touching its all-time high, the larger crypto universe is abuzz with talk, speculation, and even some intrigue. From DeFi breakthroughs and regulatory optimism to political narratives and stablecoin skirmishes, the market’s complexity is on full display. And all these stories, increasingly, seem to point in the same direction: That crypto, once a fringe movement, is quickly becoming a central force in the future of finance, and by some accounts, the future of politics and global technology.

44942709,https://nulltx.com/?p=149829,1747897737,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,AI Agent Market Surges to $10.87B as Virtuals Ecosystem Expands Despite Price Dip,https://nulltx.com/ai-agent-market-surges-to-10-87b-as-virtuals-ecosystem-expands-despite-price-dip/,"The AI agent sector keeps growing at a dramatic pace. The sector’s total market capitalization has climbed nearly 3% in the last 24 hours, reaching $10.87 billion as of May 21st, 2025. The latest growth spurt detailed in that day’s Virtuals Daily Update shows a renewed wave of inflows into the sector and highlights a pretty sizable bump in mindshare — one of the AI agent industry’s long-favored key performance indicators. The compound ecosystem, one of the most closely watched projects in the space, had a mixed week. Even though the price of its native token, $VIRTUAL, slid a little over 3%, other indicators pointed to an almost alarming surge in the ecosystem’s attention and relevance to both the crypto and wider AI agent landscapes. With a modest gain in market cap for the DeFi products within the ecosystem and what can only be described as a week where Virtuals shot up in everyone’s mind (no doubt thanks to that ‘next-gen’ appearance at these events), the project seems to be positioning itself for some degree of long-term influence. Mindshare Reaches Record Highs as Sector Accelerates The latest data yield an impressive highlight: agent mindshare reached an unprecedented 43.33% high for the first quarter of 2023, with gauge 43.33% high for the first quarter of 2023. Mindshare gauges how much attention, interaction, and activity AI agents are commanding across digital environments—and it is quickly becoming the new benchmark for evaluating protocol influence. This jump indicates growing agent engagement and utility, but perhaps more importantly, it underscores how entrenched these systems are becoming in digital businesses and consumer applications. AI agents’ total market capitalization increased 2.98% over the last 24 hours, not just showing interest from speculators but also signaling some increasingly substantive investments. The Virtuals ecosystem itself, now valued at $2.39 billion, posted a 0.53% gain over the same period. While just a modest increase, if you will, this gain puts it among the broader top contributors to the sector’s growth and solidifies its role as a critical part of the AI agent economy. The more general lesson is that while the prices of individual tokens may bounce around, fundamental parameters like market capitalization and the amount of attention being paid to the space—mindshare, in the old marketing term—are moving in a clearly positive direction. Virtuals Sees Short-Term Price Pressure, Long-Term Ecosystem Strength Even though the sector is on the upswing, the $VIRTUAL token is facing some challenges in the market. For the last 24 hours, it has dipped by 3.11% to its current price of $1.9275. Market analysts see this price dip as a result of some short-term profit-taking and a bit of the volatility that is currently buffeting the broader crypto market. They do not see it as any sort of fundamental weakness in the Virtuals platform itself. Actually, the ecosystem-level metrics for Virtual tell a much more positive story. The platform’s mindshare increased by a robust 8.26%. This fair value estimate pushed its total share of attention in the AI agent sector to 21.25%. Meanwhile, over the weekend, the Discord team reported a remarkable 1,200 new members in just two days. The last time we checked, there were approximately 14,000 members in the Virtual Discord server. Virtuals Daily Update | May 21st 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/MpYha0mWFW — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 21, 2025 The gap between token value and ecosystem performance is typical of emerging tech, and Virtuals is handling that by the book. It today has a user and developer count that is both meaningful and rapidly growing—an absolute necessity if Virtuals is to be any sort of long-term player in this AI agent economy that is maturing so quickly. Small-Cap Breakout Leaders: SANTA, STATE, and HANA Stand Out While the expanded ecosystem demonstrates resilience and forward movement, a few smaller-cap gaining projects are turning heads with their stunning weekly growth. At the top of the list is SANTA (@santavirtuals), which saw a not-to-be-missed 140.5% increase in its market cap over the past seven days. That move makes it a breakout project, and it’s attracting a lot of eyeballs from both investors and analysts. STATE (@State_Of_Mika) and SQDGN (@helloSQDGN) are making significant strides, with growth rates of 42.97% and 36.87%, respectively. These niche projects, focused on unique applications of AI agents, seem to be much more tightly targeted than the average crypto project. Indeed, they are in the midst of some serious momentum right now. The top five are rounded out by RWAI (@RWAIAgent) and HANA (@HanaPersona_), who post 28.41% and 27.62% gains, respectively. HANA’s rise, in particular, reflects and is creating an area of significant interest in the coming months: personalized AI personas. Gains of these tokens underscore a repeated theme in emerging technology markets: small-cap projects tend to be the early movers in adoption, and they tend to be the ones that perform fastest and the ones that perform best during that early adoption period. Of course, there’s a reason for that: these small-cap tokens offer access to nascent projects that have a real shot—however slight it might be—of becoming something huge. Conclusion The artificial intelligence agent sector keeps developing at a dazzling pace. Reinvented capital, a rising profile, and new focus projects push its plotlines forward. At the same time, our nearest rival — despite some momentary price volatility — keeps showing up as a leading influence and generator of engagement across the space. With this combination of institutional and grassroots interest, the market is rarin’ to expand — and these guys are at the center of what’s shaping up as a next big thing.

44942800,https://nulltx.com/?p=149828,1747897882,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Sky Protocol launches SKY token as new governance standard, urges MKR holders to upgrade promptly",https://nulltx.com/sky-protocol-launches-sky-token-as-new-governance-standard-urges-mkr-holders-to-upgrade-promptly/,"An important shift is taking place in the decentralized finance space. Sky Protocol, which used to be known as MakerDAO , is rebranding and moving forward with a new token that will act as the “exclusive governance asset” for its ecosystem. Meanwhile, the MKR token has been “retired from all governance responsibilities” and is on a trajectory to a skyward future. The current holders of MKR tokens are being urged to upgrade their holdings to SKY, lest that influence and benefits the holders get from the ecosystem be lost as the MKR fades into obsolescence. This alteration embodies a decisive movement in the arrangement and appearance of the future decentralized governance, staking, and performance-based incentives envisaged by the Sky Protocol team. This remaking of Sky Protocol, according to the team, is not simply a rebranding effort. It represents a complete makeover—a total transformation from a governance model based largely in Web2 to one designed for Web3. If this next-generation governance system works, it should allow for totally decentralized decision-making by a community of nearly 6,000 Sky Protocol token holders. From MakerDAO to Sky Protocol: A New Era of DeFi Governance Sky Protocol signals the evolution of MakerDAO—not only one of the earliest but also one of the most influential DeFi projects—into an even more expansive and forward-thinking protocol. With the introduction of the SKY token, governing MakerDAO becomes even simpler and fairer. The SKY token offers even greater accessibility and flexibility to users, and it incentives long-term performance of the protocol by linking much of its governance directly to the performance of SKY. The governance model we are introducing empowers holders of the SKY governance token with an array of rights, including the right to vote on protocol changes (as well as the ability to direct this voting power to trusted representatives, if desired) and the right to significantly influence the development direction of Sky Protocol. Sky Protocol Introduces SKY as Exclusive Governance Token — MKR Holders Urged to Upgrade! @SkyEcosystem (prev. Maker DAO) has officially transitioned $MKR to $SKY , which is now the sole governance token powering the protocol’s future. Holders of $MKR must upgrade to $SKY to… pic.twitter.com/DiRXTjUIWv — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) May 21, 2025 We hope that also makes our governance mechanism more robust and responsive—in other words, capable of being both well-run and well-scaled. Sky Protocol has stressed that all holders of MKR must upgrade their tokens in order to still take part in governance decisions and receive protocol rewards. The upgrade rate has been set at 1 MKR = 24,000 SKY, a rate that highlights the protocol’s desire to grow its community and governance participation. Time-Sensitive Transition: Penalties Begin in September 2025 To promote fast engagement in the upgrade process, Sky Protocol has put forward a penalty mechanism that operates on a time basis. Beginning on September 18, 2025, holders of MKR who have not yet completed the transition to SKY will suffer a devaluation in their conversion rates; in other words, the MKR holdouts will get precisely 0.78 SKY tokens for every MKR they do manage to convert, instead of the 1.0 SKY tokens the protocol would otherwise issue. Although this is the first time we have seen a penalty mechanism employed in this context, and it almost seems like a more sophisticated version of the nudges used to promote health behaviors or save money for retirement, in Sky’s case, it’s all about getting its community up to speed on a new and better version of its decentralized operating system. Individuals who finish the update prior to the deadline of September 18 will obtain the entire 24,000 SKY for each MKR token and will enjoy unhindered governance and staking benefits. On the other hand, users who upgrade after the deadline may have less governance power and diminished opportunities to earn rewards, reinforcing the importance of upgrading sooner rather than later. Unlocking New Features with the Sky Staking Engine A feature that stands out with the launch of the SKY token is the Sky Staking Engine, a new rewards system that allows for returns earned on SKY that are based on how well the protocol performs. When users stake SKY, they are doing more than just supporting the network’s security and decentralization; they are now co-investing (with the protocol) in the protocol’s success. And the rewards scale with how well the protocol performs. Sky Protocol’s mission is to align community incentives with long-term growth. The staking engine is a component of that. It is said to be a core component, but not the only one, obviously. The way I look at it, there are two main parts to what the engine does. The first part has to do with rewards. Our reward models are very unlike the static reward models that are common in the blockchain space. Those models often tend to be somewhat inflationary, and they don’t really give you any signals. When you stake in Sky Protocol, what you’re effectively doing is issuing a performance-based model in which your returns are much more influenced by the productivity of the protocol and the overall economic health of the ecosystem. This aligns very well with the broader philosophy of Sky Protocol: to empower not just with voting rights, but with a stake in the very outcomes of the protocol, token holders. This is, in fact, an articulation of the shift from governance that is by the few to governance that is by the many—economically incentivizing more community members to engage in and with the governance of the network. Conclusion The initiation of the SKY token and MakerDAO’s complete shift to the Sky Protocol symbolizes a crucial moment for one of the DeFi sector’s cornerstone ecosystems. With a clear roadmap, enhanced governance tools, and the innovative Sky Staking Engine, the protocol now stands ready to facilitate a new era of decentralized coordination and rewards. For holders of MKR right now, the message couldn’t be clearer: upgrade to SKY immediately in order to keep influencing the future of Sky Protocol, or else face what could be some hefty penalties come September 18. For some acts of congress, as DeFi acts go, this one’s pretty important. The Shapeshift Foundation, which oversees Sky Protocol, has made it known that if you want to engage with this newly DeFi’d ecosystem, you might want to upgrade. And it could be pretty essential to do so. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO up today? JTO’s price gained strong buying demand around the low of $1.9. As a result, buyers gained confidence and pushed the price above $2.1. Will JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a continuation of the current upward trend. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

Bitcoin surged past $111,800 early Thursday, setting a fresh record. 15 years ago on this day developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas, then worth roughly $40. The May 22, 2010, purchase marked the first recorded commercial transaction using BTC, a turning point that took the asset from cypherpunk code to actual currency. That same 10,000 BTC can buy over 70 million pizzas at current prices. It is worth over $1.1 billion as of Thursday. Hanyecz has long shrugged off the missed fortune” tag, telling CBS in 2019 that the transaction made bitcoin “real” to him. He mined the coins back when BTC was under a penny, and few could have predicted the multi-trillion-dollar asset it would become. Still, the transaction remains a cultural milestone for the crypto market — a moment that showed internet money could work as actual currency. Now, it’s not just pizza being paid for with bitcoin.

BTC Reaches All-Time High as $609 Million Inflows Into Spot Bitcoin ETFs This strong capital inflow coincided with Bitcoin breaking a new record, surpassing its previous peak of $108,000. The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading above $111,000. According to experts, Bitcoin’s recent surge is largely due to institutional factors, with major funds turning to spot ETFs and public companies raising funds for Bitcoin investments being among the main drivers of the rise. “Today’s demand is driven by institutional infrastructure and a clearer regulatory environment. Investor sentiment has now shifted significantly in favor of institutional-grade allocations,” said Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets. According to data provider SoSoValue, the largest portion of net inflows on Wednesday was made to BlackRock’s IBIT fund: a full $530.6 million. Other major ETFs, including Fidelity’s FBTC, Bitwise’s BITB and Grayscale Mini BTC Trust, also recorded positive inflows exceeding $20 million. VanEck, Ark & 21Shares and Valkyrie funds also finished the day with net inflows. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $7.64 billion in trading volume on Wednesday, the highest daily volume since Feb. 25. Net inflows of $4.24 billion were made to the ETFs in May, bringing the total cumulative inflow to $43.38 billion.

One bill would allow public pension funds to invest in Bitcoin through regulated exchange-traded products. Another bill proposes a state-level ban on supporting or promoting a U.S. central bank digital currency. Michigan lawmakers introduced four new crypto-focused bills on Wednesday, signaling a growing state-level push to define digital asset policy and limit federal influence over financial innovation. Rep. Bill Schuette (R-MI) introduced House Bill 4510 , which would authorize the state treasurer to invest retirement funds in cryptocurrencies, provided the assets averaged a market cap of at least $250 billion over the prior year. This effectively limits the scope to Bitcoin, which hit a record $111,000 this week. The bill mandates such investments be made through exchange-traded products managed by registered investment firms to ensure oversight. Another Bill Targets CBDCs A second bill, House Bill 4511 , sponsored by Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-MI), targets federal efforts to roll out a central bank digital currency (CBDC). It proposes a ban on any state agency or department from supporting, testing, or promoting a U.S. CBDC. The legislation also seeks to shield digital asset holders from additional state-level restrictions or taxes. On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Mike McFall (D-MI) filed two companion bills—HB 4512 and HB 4513—focused on Bitcoin mining and environmental remediation. One bill outlines a “Bitcoin Program” that would grant private firms temporary rights to mine Bitcoin at abandoned oil or gas well sites, using leftover fuel. In return, companies would be responsible for site restoration. The accompanying bill offers state tax deductions for income generated through this type of mining activity. The program would be regulated by the Supervisor of Wells, who would oversee a public registry of eligible sites, conduct annual bidding rounds, and enforce restoration obligations. Michigan’s proposals add to a growing patchwork of crypto legislation emerging across the U.S. Earlier the same day, Texas lawmakers passed a bill to establish a state-run Bitcoin reserve. New Hampshire recently became the first state to authorize crypto and precious metal investments for public funds. Blackstone Makes First Crypto Move On May 20, Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, made its first move into crypto markets , purchasing shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares as of March 31, valued at approximately $1.08 million. Prior to that, shares of Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp surged by over 91% on May 19 , after the Nasdaq-listed company announced plans to raise $100 million to initiate Bitcoin purchases as part of a new treasury strategy. The Jakarta-based firm revealed that its board has approved the creation of a Bitcoin treasury reserve. DigiAsia says it intends to allocate up to 50% of its net profits toward acquiring Bitcoin, signaling a shift in how it plans to manage its capital amid growing corporate interest in digital assets. Notably, public companies continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, leading the charge.

This time, the finance guru insists that “the party is over” and “the end is here.” In a tweet addressing the latest developments in the U.S. bond market, Kiyosaki affirmed that millions of Americans are about to be wiped out financially. However, those who hold bitcoin (BTC), gold, and silver will be safe. The End is Here: Kiyosaki The Rich Dad Poor Dad author claimed that no one showed up for the Federal Reserve’s auction of U.S. bonds on May 20, so the Fed bought $50 billion of the bonds itself. He called both the bonds and the U.S. dollar fake money. Despite Kiyosaki’s claims that no one showed up to the auction, data from TreasuryDirect shows that the Fed recorded over $69 billion in bids for its 42-day bills with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.97. Regardless of the bond auction outcome, Kiyosaki’s message remains the same: buy bitcoin because the U.S. economy is collapsing. He claims the dollar is hyperinflated, and the end he has warned about is here. While the dollar faces the risk of collapsing, Kiyosaki believes the value of gold could surge to $25,000, while silver could touch $70. On the other hand, BTC could be worth between $500,000 and $1 million. At the time of writing, gold was worth $3,300, silver was trading at $33, and BTC shot up to a new all-time high today of over $111,000. Moody’s Downgrades U.S. Debt Kiyosaki’s latest doom forecast comes as the credit rating agency Moody’s downgrades U.S. debt from Aaa to Aa1. Aaa is the highest rating possible, while Aa1 is one notch down the scale. The agency cited a sharp rise in U.S. federal debt over the past decade due to a continuous fiscal deficit. According to Moody’s, federal spending has risen while tax cuts have declined, significantly increasing interest payments on government debt. This comes as successive U.S. administrations and Congress fail to implement measures to reverse the trend of annual fiscal deficits. Reacting to the downgrade of U.S. debt, Kiyosaki recommended that more people become entrepreneurs and invest in real estate as “America is in serious trouble.” Most importantly, saving in BTC and precious metals.

Pepe’s whale-driven momentum signals a potential rally, while Mutuum Finance’s innovative DeFi model fuels demand. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) raising $9,000,000 and selling over 500 million tokens to 11,000 holders since its presale began, its phase 5 is underway at $0.03. Investors are flocking to these top cryptocurrencies, chasing high returns. As the market shifts, positioning in these new crypto coins could unlock significant gains. Let’s explore why Pepe and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are among the best cryptocurrencies to buy now. Pepe’s Whale Surge Sparks Rally Hopes Pepe (PEPE) is riding a wave of whale accumulation. A dormant investor recently scooped up 1.79 trillion tokens, worth over $22 million, from Binance. This massive buyup hints at a looming liquidity crunch. Despite a recent 8.64% price drop to $0.00001246, crypto charts show volatility. The Relative Strength Index sits at 63.23, just below oversold levels. Bollinger Bands signal heightened price swings. Historically, Pepe thrives in May, boasting an 82.3% average monthly gain since 2023. This month’s 40.4% surge keeps it on track. Investors eyeing the next big crypto see Pepe as a speculative bet, but its meme-driven nature lacks Mutuum’s stability. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi Edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in DeFi with its lending model. Unlike Pepe’s hype-fueled swings, it offers real utility. Lenders deposit assets into pools, earning interest via mtTokens like mtETH or mtDAI. These tokens accrue value over time, ensuring passive income. Borrowers access funds by posting collateral exceeding loan amounts, minimizing default risks. This overcollateralized system stabilizes the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also supports peer-to-peer lending, letting users negotiate terms directly. Such flexibility sets it apart in the crypto market. Investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in find Mutuum’s practical approach compelling, especially with its presale momentum. Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting investor fervor in phase 5 of its 11-phase presale. Priced at $0.03, a 200% jump from the $0.01 opening phase, it reflects surging demand. Phase 4 sold at $0.025, meaning current phase 5 buyers gain 16.7% when phase 6 opens at $0.035. The tokenomics guarantee a 100% ROI at the $0.06 launch price. Analysts predict a post-launch climb to $2.50, yielding an 8,233% ROI. The first phase sold out swiftly, and phase 5 is following suit, creating urgency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for holding their spots, further driving engagement. Buy Pressure Fuels Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is bolstering its value with a buy-and-distribute mechanism. Platform revenue buys back MUTM tokens, redistributing them to mtToken stakers. This creates constant demand, supporting price growth. A $100,000 giveaway adds excitement, offering ten $10,000 prizes to presale participants. The team is finalizing a Certik smart contract audit, with results soon to be shared on social platforms. This focus on security builds trust. As crypto prices rise, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a top crypto to buy. Its structured growth and DeFi utility make it a safer bet than Pepe’s volatility. Why These Coins Shine Pepe (PEPE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer distinct paths to profit in the crypto market. Pepe’s whale-driven surges appeal to short-term traders betting on the next crypto to explode. Its historical May gains fuel optimism, but volatility demands caution. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, blends DeFi innovation with presale gains. With phase 5 at $0.03 and a guaranteed 100% ROI at launch, it’s a prime pick for long-term investors. As crypto investing heats up, these altcoins top the list of best cryptos to buy now.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-ledger-is-quietly-becoming-the-core-settlement-layer-heres-the-latest/,"On May 20, 2025, StraitsX officially announced the deployment of its Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin, XSGD, on the XRP Ledger. The move marks a significant milestone in the development of real-time, regulated digital payments infrastructure across Asia. This is meant to increase access to compliant and efficient financial rails. StraitsX, a key Southeast Asian digital payment infrastructure provider backed by institutions such as Standard Chartered and DBS, announced a partnership with Ripple. This deployment aims to enable faster, cost-effective, and more secure transactions denominated in Singapore dollars using the XRP Ledger’s advanced capabilities. XRP Ledger as a Settlement Core in a Global Financial System In response to this development, well-known crypto investor Mr. Man commented on the broader implications through a tweet that presents the XRP Ledger as a central framework within the emerging global financial system. We’re witnessing the formation of a unified global financial operating system, and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is quietly becoming the core settlement layer, the heart that pulses liquidity, compliance, and interoperability across this multi-rail ecosystem. Ripple has built… pic.twitter.com/f7wiX3M4v0 — Mr. Man (@MrManXRP) May 19, 2025 According to the pseudonymous investor, what is unfolding is not simply a regional deployment of a stablecoin, but rather the continued establishment of a unified global operating structure for finance. Mr. Man describes the XRP Ledger as quietly becoming the core settlement layer—a foundation through which liquidity, compliance, and interoperability can move seamlessly across interconnected financial systems. From RLUSD to Multi-Chain Interoperability He emphasizes that Ripple has already constructed a robust institutional-grade infrastructure, referencing the RLUSD stablecoin recently launched, along with innovations such as cross-chain liquidity bridges, burn-to-mint protocols, decentralized recovery (DeRec), and multi-party computation (MPC) custody features. All of these developments collectively support an ecosystem in which stablecoins issued by sovereign-regulated entities, such as XSGD, AUDD, and BBRL, are now being integrated into the XRP Ledger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Mr. Man also points to Ripple’s growing network of wallet tooling and custody solutions through collaborations with Metaco and Hedera and the firm’s alignment with major financial standard-setting bodies such as ISDA and the CPMI. These components, he argues, are elevating the XRP Ledger from the status of a traditional blockchain to what he calls a “crossledger liquidity router.” Global Financial Entities Integrate into XRPL The tweet further underscores the strategic nature of Ripple’s relationships across the global financial sector. Mr. Man mentions entities such as HashKey Capital, Temenos, FedNow gateways, Aave, and CME futures, suggesting that each layer of the system is aligning to use XRPL as an underlying connectivity and liquidity framework. He argues that XRP is not positioned to compete with other ledgers but to interlink them as a neutral settlement asset. Singapore Deployment Seen as Global Layer 1 Model He concludes his analysis by stating that Ripple has successfully built a universal settlement graph, with XRP functioning as the “connective tissue” between different financial networks. The new arrangement in Singapore, according to Mr. Man, represents a Global Layer 1 (GL1) designation, where local and international institutions adopt the XRP Ledger not as a peripheral blockchain but as a core infrastructure layer. As more sovereign-backed stablecoins integrate into the XRPL ecosystem, the foundation for a harmonized, real-time, and compliant global payment network continues to solidify.

More than 200 guests reportedly spent millions of dollars just to meet him in person. Big names in crypto like Justin Sun, founder of Tron, were among the attendees. Critics argue this isn’t just about buying coins—it’s about buying private access to Trump. For the unversed, the event attendees have reportedly spent over $100 million for a chance to meet the US President. Lawmakers and Protesters Push Back Democrats and protest groups are speaking out, accusing Trump of using his influence to profit from crypto deals tied to him and his family. While a bill has not yet been introduced, Congresswoman Maxine Waters and others are planning to push legislation that would ban presidents, lawmakers, and their families from making money off cryptocurrency. On May 22, several protests and press events are planned around the Capitol and near Trump’s golf club. Groups like Public Citizen, along with Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Murphy, and Jeff Merkley, are set to lead rallies under the slogan “America Is Not for Sale.” Critics are also worried that some of the biggest memecoin buyers could be foreign investors, raising questions about who really gets access to power. The controversy over Trump’s crypto connections has even slowed progress on important U.S. stablecoin legislation, though the bill has recently moved forward in the Senate.

Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) price is up 15% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $35.50, with the trading volume surging 130%. With this surge, the price has now broken the local resistance at $28, marking the upper boundary of the consolidation range that held for almost two weeks after the previous leg up in early May that had lifted the price 30% to $25 level. The $28 level was also the key horizontal resistance that held firm from late December through late February. With all the post-ATH resistances broken, the path is now clear to retest the $35 peak, after which HYPE would enter price discovery territory. Moreover, today’s swing high marks the fifth consecutive higher high since HYPE price bottomed below $10 in early April. During this entire uptrend, the price has remained above both the 20 EMA and 50 SMA, with a bullish crossover between the two moving averages occurring in mid-April, further confirming the uptrend. Momentum is decisively bullish, with MACD line over the singal line and green historgram rising. RSI is at 76, in the overbought territory, potentially signaling a short-term pullback or consolidation.

David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s top advisor on crypto and artificial intelligence, said the administration expects the U.S. Senate to pass the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill that he claims could drive massive new demand for U.S. Treasuries. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Sacks said there are already over $200 billion in stablecoins, though currently unregulated, adding that providing legal clarity and a proper framework could create “trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight, very quickly.” The bill, officially known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, cleared a key Senate hurdle this week when 66 senators voted to advance it, including 15 Democrats, giving the legislation enough support to avoid a filibuster. Sacks said the administration now has every expectation that the bill is going to pass, though he didn’t respond to a question about potential conflicts of interest involving Trump and his family’s crypto businesses. You might also like: With the Genius Act vote nearing final passage — who wins, and who loses? Critics have pointed to Trump’s financial ties to the crypto sector as the Trump family is backing World Liberty Financial, which recently launched a stablecoin called USD1. It’s backed by U.S. Treasuries and dollar deposits. Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund invested $2 billion in USD1 in Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange that admitted to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws in a $4.3 billion plea agreement. The GENIUS Act would create a federal framework for stablecoin issuers and bring dollar-backed digital currencies under U.S. oversight. Sacks framed it as an economic opportunity, saying that stablecoins offer a “new, more efficient, cheaper, smoother payment system — new payment rails for the U.S. economy.” Still, the bill’s final passage could be delayed.

However, the ongoing battle at the $2.69 resistance continues to weigh on investor sentiment and casts doubt on an immediate breakout. XRP Price Analysis Crypto analyst CasiTrades recently pointed out on X that XRP has successfully bounced off the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $1.90 and reclaimed the 0.382 level at $2.25 , showing signs of bullish momentum. However, he also noted that XRP has yet to form a new local high , a key signal for confirming a trend reversal. “XRP is holding $2.25 and building structure, but needs a breakout above $2.69 to confirm a bullish trend,” – CasiTrades When Will XRP Price Go Up? Technical analysis shows that XRP faces a strong resistance at $2.69 , a level it has failed to break several times. On May 12 , XRP reached $2.65 but fell short, and on May 14 , another attempt was met with heavy selling pressure. Between May 14–17, the price dropped by over 8.85% , highlighting ongoing market uncertainty. As long as XRP trades below $2.69 , analysts warn that a downside move toward $1.50 remains on the table . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple’s RLUSD Poised to Replace USDT in Europe After MiCA Shake-Up , What Next For Ripple (XRP)? According to CasiTrades, XRP is currently in a Wave 4 consolidation phase , which typically signals sideways movement as the market builds structure. This phase suggests a potential setup for a strong move— up or down . In the past 24 hours, XRP posted a modest 0.8% gain , with a daily close at $2.3950 , after briefly pushing above a short-term resistance at $2.375 . However, at the time of writing, XRP is trading slightly below that level again. Key Levels to Watch Support: $2.25 Short-term Resistance: $2.375 Major Resistance: $2.69 Downside Risk: $1.50 The analyst emphasized that holding above $2.375 is crucial for any continued upside. A breakdown below this level could trigger another retest of the $2.25 support —and possibly lower. Conclusion: XRP’s price action remains at a critical juncture. While bulls are defending key levels , the lack of a breakout above $2.69 continues to limit upside potential. If momentum builds, XRP could target a new high—but if support fails, traders should be prepared for a dip toward $1.50. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to World Foundation’s official fundraising announcement on May 21, the funds will be used to expand its iris-based identity network, World ID. Leading the raise were Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Crypto, who purchased Worldcoin ( WLD ) tokens at market value, increasing the supply of tokens in circulation. With more than 26 million users and 12.5 million Orb-verified IDs in oved 160 countries, this institutional support lends more credibility to the project. The market has responded positively to the news. Trading volume is up 87% to over $508 million, while derivatives volume has exploded by 112% to $879 million. Open interest is also up 23%, now sitting at $280 million, as per Coinglass data . After months of decline, this steep increase points to a change in trader sentiment as capital moves back into WLD. However, the token is still 89% below its peak of $11.74 in March 2024.

After recovering from support around $1.00, it has climbed back to $1.24. The move is accompanied by strong momentum and rising volume, indicating that bulls might be regaining control. The price is trading above the short- and mid-term moving averages, which are currently trending upward, often a bullish sign. Worldcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The relative strength index is slightly above 60, indicating that there is still potential for growth without reaching an overbought level. The expanding Bollinger Bands suggest a possible breakout move. If bulls can break through the crucial resistance level, which is around $1.30, the next major barrier is near $1.38. On-chain fundamentals continue to be a risk as well as a strength. More WLD is now in circulation as a result of the recent token sale, which could put short-term pressure on the price. But the fact that this was not a VC dump, but rather a sale to two long-time backers at market price, changes the narrative. Furthermore, if Worldcoin can use the new funding to successfully scale its World ID infrastructure, especially in jurisdictions like the U.S., where digital identity regulation is tightening, it could carve out a unique niche at the intersection of AI, privacy, and identity. If the current momentum holds, WLD might move in the $1.37–$1.50 range. A breakout above that area could result in a more pronounced rally as shorts are squeezed. However, if buyers lose interest and the token falls below $1.20, a retrace to $1.10 or even $0.95 is still possible.

Cardano (ADA) continues to attract long-term believers with its development roadmap, while Hypeliquid (HYPE) draws attention through community-driven appeal. Meanwhile, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has surged rapidly, capturing retail interest through viral traction and unexpected market performance. As the Bitcoin price climbs, it often signals the beginning of broader interest across the market , especially in promising altcoins that tend to outperform during bullish trends. These three altcoins mentioned above are highlighted as the best performers this cycle, with FloppyPepe (FPPE) standing on top. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Meme Coin Built To Outpace Bitcoin (BTC) FloppyPepe (FPPE) is reshaping the meme coin space by combining viral culture with real, AI-powered functionality. It's tools like Meme-o-Matic, which instantly turns text into memes, and FloppyX, a video generator, that empower users to create and engage with content effortlessly. Inspired by Matt Furie’s legacy, FloppyPepe (FPPE) raised nearly $1 million in its private sale, moving over 5 trillion tokens in just 24 hours. This kind of early momentum has attracted attention not just from meme investors but from traditional Bitcoin (BTC) holders looking for high-upside altcoins this cycle. With a deflationary supply model and constant utility upgrades, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out among altcoins positioned to outperform the Bitcoin price this cycle, especially as social-driven tokens dominate short-term momentum. Low-Cap, High-Speed: Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Dominating This Cycle FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining attention for its explosive early performance, with sharper returns than Bitcoin (BTC) in this cycle. While the Bitcoin price moves steadily, this altcoin surged in its presale, attracting thousands of buyers within hours, outpacing even top altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Hypeliquid (HYPE) in early growth. With a presale price of just $0.0000002 and an ongoing 80% bonus using the promo code FLOPPY80, retail investors are flooding in to capitalize on its low-cap upside. This early traction fuels fast gain. While Bitcoin (BTC) anchors the market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) rides the wave of meme culture, speed, and scarcity, proving that in this cycle, agility and attention can outperform tradition. Analyzing Cardano (ADA)’s Technical Strength In The Current Bull Cycle Cardano (ADA) is showing steady technical strength in this cycle, which renews investor confidence. According to crypto analyst Ali, Cardano (ADA) is holding above $0.72 within an ascending channel, which could open the path toward a short-term target of $0.92 if support holds, especially as the broader market, led by Bitcoin (BTC), continues to gain traction. Another top analyst, Tyler Burke, forecasts a major breakout, predicting Cardano (ADA) could hit $8 by August 2025. Backed by continuous development and strong on-chain activity, Cardano (ADA) is positioning itself as one of the top altcoins, potentially outperforming the Bitcoin price as excitement builds around scalable, utility-rich blockchain platforms. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price At Crossroads: Breakout Or Breakdown? Hyperliquid (HYPE) has shown impressive strength this cycle, trading near $25.82. Its rapid growth is fueled by surging trading activity on the Hyperliquid platform, attracting both retail and institutional interest. Despite its gains, technical indicators suggest that Hyperliquid (HYPE) may be entering a cooling phase as bitcoin price consolidation influences short-term sentiment. Recent price action shows Hyperliquid (HYPE) is struggling to break above resistance around the $27 level, forming a lower high and showing signs of weakness. If selling pressure continues for Hyperliquid (HYPE), a pullback toward the $21–$22 support zone is likely. This setup, while still within a broader uptrend, is unfolding in a market closely tracking the Bitcoin price. What This Cycle’s Top Altcoins Are Telling Us In a market where Bitcoin (BTC) often leads, some altcoins are rewriting the script this cycle. Cardano (ADA) brings long-term vision, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) shows short-term strength, but FloppyPepe (FPPE) is capturing momentum with both utility and energy, echoing the kind of breakout potential once seen in early Bitcoin (BTC) moves. Backed by a vibrant community and an active 80% bonus campaign, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly positioning itself as a serious competitor to outperform the Bitcoin price. For those tracking high-growth opportunities, this meme-powered movement might just lead to the next altcoin breakout story.

Two Papa John’s Pizzas, 10,000 BTC, and a Billion-Dollar Lesson appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today isn’t just any other day for the crypto world. It’s Bitcoin Pizza Day , a quirky, legendary anniversary that marks one of the most famous transactions in financial history. And in a fitting twist, Bitcoin hit a brand new all-time high today, soaring to $111,861.22 — making this year’s Pizza Day extra legendary. Fifteen years ago, on May 22, 2010, a Florida-based programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz was craving pizza. Instead of paying in dollars, he made an unusual offer on a Bitcoin forum — 10,000 Bitcoins for two large Papa John’s pizzas. At the time, those Bitcoins were worth about $40. 15 years ago, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Floridian programmer, bought 2 Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 $BTC . Today, those pizzas would be valued at over $1.07B today. Happy #Bitcoin Pizza Day, everyone! pic.twitter.com/H7oeBTEIJM — CoinGecko (@coingecko) May 22, 2025 A fellow forum user accepted the deal, placed the pizza order using his credit card, and had it delivered to Hanyecz’s doorstep. What seemed like a simple food trade became a historic moment. Because if you check today’s Bitcoin prices, those same 10,000 BTC would be worth over $1.07 billion. Yes — two pizzas for a billion bucks. But it wasn’t about getting rich. Hanyecz was proving a point: that Bitcoin could actually work as money — something you could use to buy real, everyday stuff. And what better than pizza, the universal fuel for programmers and crypto enthusiasts alike? Since then, Bitcoin Pizza Day has become a fun, annual tradition. Every May 22, crypto fans around the world grab a slice, post pizza memes, and reflect on how far the industry has come — from an obscure internet experiment to a multi-trillion-dollar global market.

The move is being driven by institutional activity, particularly in futures, where open interest has hit a record $72 billion . That’s 8% higher over the last week, which means big players are getting directional. Over $3 billion in short positions are concentrated between $107,000 and $108,000, which is now a liquidation cluster. If Bitcoin breaks $113,369, it could trigger a short squeeze and send price parabolic. Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72B today as institutional leverage climbs. Around $1.2B in shorts between $107 K and $108 K could be liquidated, boosting breakout odds. CME leads with $16.9 B in OI, while Binance follows at $12 B. pic.twitter.com/spdzrWek9G — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) May 20, 2025 “$108K flipped resistance into support. This structural shift could accelerate price discovery into the $117K-$120K range,” a senior derivatives analyst said. Key support has moved up to $108,000, which was previously resistance. This reassignment of support levels means more confidence in the market and is bullish in the short term. Golden Cross Formation Signals Potential Breakout Above $110,000 The technical analysis indicators are even more bullish with a golden cross coming on the daily chart. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is closing in on the 200-day EMA—an event that has historically led to big upside. Bitcoin is about to flash a Golden Cross, shortly after a Death Cross. Insanely bullish. pic.twitter.com/M8oRuUfA1b — CryptoGoos (@crypto_goos) May 20, 2025 Golden cross has preceded 45-60% gains in past BTC cycles A close above $110,000 would be a 17% May gain Current monthly performance is nearly double the 10-year average of 9.2% If Bitcoin holds these levels into month-end, May could be the strongest month since 2019. That would be more evidence of demand and set up for fresh inflows into the second half of the year. Bitcoin Key Levels: $113K Resistance, $117K-$120K Target From a price structure standpoint, Bitcoin is still in a steep ascending channel that started in early April. The MACD histogram is still bullish but is flattening out—a sign that the move may need a consolidation phase before it extends. Resistance is at $113,369. A daily close above that would be a breakout and open up $117,141 and $120,913. If rejected, we could see a retest of the $108,000 breakout zone, which would be a re-entry point for trend followers. Resistance zones: $113,369 → $117,141 → $120,913 Support zones: $108,000 → $106,500 Technical signal to watch: Spinning top or rejection candle near $113K Short term momentum may pause at resistance but overall structure is still bullish as long as price is above $106,500 and the channel midline. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.98M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As BTC holding near $104K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $6.06 million out of its $6.98 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,062,795/ $6,981,682 Token Price: $0.00252 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

Besides, the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price is also inching close to its ATH at $35. After maintaining consecutive higher highs and lows, the HYPE price is expected to trigger a 30% upswing in the coming days and mark new highs. The Hypeliquid price is marching strongly past $30 after breaking above the consolidated zone around $25. The rise reflects a massive increase in the trader’s confidence as whales and influencers are stacking, fueling a blend of retail FOMO and deep-pocket conviction. As the price surged, the Open Interest of the token also marked new highs which has reaching over $1.1 billion. An increase in the open interest suggests that new money or capital is entering the market, potentially signaling a continuation of the current trend. It also indicates that more traders are actively holding positions in a particular market. The higher open interest is considered a positive sign as it indicates greater market participation and liquidity. The historical chart of HYPE suggests the price is strongly heading towards the highs as it is working hard to secure the highs above the 0.786 FiB levels at $29.64. A daily close above this level is expected to keep up the trend, as the technicals also point towards a bullish continuation. The DMI has displayed a bullish divergence while the ADX is heading towards the upper threshold. Meanwhile, the RSI, which was consolidating along the upper threshold, is rising into the overbought zone. This suggests the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price is poised to maintain a healthy ascending trend and test the ATH at $35. With this, the price is believed to enter the discovery phase and eventually reach the 1.2 FIB at $42.15, marking new highs for the current price cycle.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 07:48:13

It’s often the one quietly accumulating in institutional wallets while the broader market watches the headlines. These wallets don’t chase hype—they anticipate where the momentum is building next. In 2025, investors are paying closer attention to wallet activity rather than influencer commentary. With more capital flowing into blockchain assets that blend utility, innovation, and narrative strength, tracking wallet movements offers an early view of which cryptocurrencies are positioned for a strong long-term presence. One project slowly appearing on the radar is Dawgz AI —an Ethereum-based coin that merges meme culture with AI-driven technology. While it remains early-stage, its presence alongside other AI-integrated tokens hints at a broader institutional interest in combining familiar formats with emerging tech. Why Institutional Wallet Activity Signals Long-Term Potential Institutional wallets operate with a different objective than retail traders. They don’t chase short-term price spikes or follow hype-driven trends. Instead, they allocate capital based on research, long-term value, and underlying utility. When these wallets begin acquiring a specific cryptocurrency, it often signals a calculated move based on internal modeling and market potential. Analysts tracking smart money behavior have observed that large funds typically enter before major price movements. According to CoinDesk , institutional inflows into crypto funds returned sharply in late 2024. The interest was focused on coins with real use cases, including tokens in the AI, infrastructure, and Ethereum-based ecosystems. This activity helps build a baseline of support that tends to reduce volatility and create momentum that retail investors follow later. Watching what institutional wallets do, not what they say, can offer an advantage. These wallets often interact with smart contracts, DeFi protocols, or accumulate in stages using centralized exchanges and multi-signature cold wallets. By observing these behaviors through platforms like Nansen or Arkham , investors can see early signs of accumulation. These patterns provide more than a trading signal. They reflect confidence in a token’s ability to hold value for the long term. What Are Institutions Actually Buying in 2025? In 2025, institutional wallets are not focused on hype coins or trend-based tokens. Their attention is shifting toward blockchain projects that solve real problems or offer scalable infrastructure. Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions remain a priority because they support transaction throughput and lower gas costs. Projects like Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism are still seeing steady inflows based on their foundational role in decentralized applications. AI-powered coins are also gaining traction. A recent feature by Forbes pointed to an increase in trading volume for coins that link artificial intelligence with blockchain automation. Investors are not only looking at the tech. They are also tracking how these tokens are being used. It includes decentralized data processing, AI agents for smart contracts, and even AI-supported community tools. These trends reflect a search for practical application, not just narrative appeal. Projects like Dawgz AI are appearing within this momentum. As a token that connects meme coin virality with AI-based development tools, it fits a new category of utility-backed community tokens. While it does not offer NFTs or traditional staking, its smart contract framework on Ethereum and focus on AI integration make it a project that on-chain data analysts are beginning to track. Investors watching this segment are not always focused on immediate returns. They are often building positions in tokens that have technical or cultural significance that can grow over time. Dawgz AI — Where Blockchain Meets Artificial Intelligence The rising interest in AI-linked blockchain projects is not limited to enterprise solutions. Some tokens are building attention by combining narrative strength with real development focus. Investors are not only tracking price movements but also watching which projects are building tools that align with future use cases. As a result, some lesser-known coins are gaining quite traction, particularly those that merge community-driven appeal with technological potential. AI-based tokens are no longer seen as speculative. They are now part of portfolios that prioritize long-term experimentation with smart contracts, data flow, and decentralized logic. While most large-cap tokens still lead the market, there is a separate tier of coins that are pulling in attention because of their integration with blockchain utilities. These include tools for decentralized automation, generative agents, and platform-native AI infrastructure. Dawgz AI runs on Ethereum and connects artificial intelligence capabilities with meme coin appeal. What separates it is not just branding but how it approaches smart contract interaction. The project is gaining attention from crypto enthusiasts tracking new hybrid formats. It focuses on building an AI-informed system that can eventually be applied across Ethereum-based tools. While still early, on-chain data from April shows a steady pattern of accumulation in smaller wallet clusters, which signals early interest that could scale with broader recognition. For more insights, please check out this video: What On-Chain Wallet Data Is Revealing Institutional wallets often leave digital trails that can be tracked using public blockchain data. These wallets do not move in and out of positions frequently. They accumulate over time and often spread large buys across multiple transactions. Platforms like Arkham Intelligence and Nansen allow users to monitor wallet tags and smart contract interactions. This kind of tracking helps investors see which tokens are being accumulated before they trend across exchanges. In April, analysts using Lookonchain reported increased wallet activity in coins related to artificial intelligence and community-driven utility. While large-cap tokens like Ethereum and Solana still dominate the charts, a growing number of wallet clusters are focusing on small-cap coins that combine purpose with cultural traction. These projects include early-stage tokens that offer something new, such as a different approach to automation or blockchain-based tooling. Consistent accumulation across unrelated wallets is often a signal of interest based on utility, not speculation. Tokens like Dawgz AI have started to appear in data dashboards that track long-hold behavior. These wallets are not buying based on price spikes. They are acquiring during periods of low volatility, which often suggests positioning ahead of broader exposure. While Dawgz AI remains under the radar of most mainstream platforms, its presence on Ethereum, paired with its AI focus, has made it one of the projects investors are quietly tracking as the next potential long-term hold. 3 Cryptos Investors Are Tracking Closely in 2025 Dawgz AI – AI Utility Meets Meme Culture Alongside larger tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors are quietly tracking a handful of smaller coins that show early signs of traction. These tokens often sit outside the spotlight but still register meaningful wallet activity. Some of them combine familiar branding with actual blockchain use cases. One project that has entered this conversation is Dawgz AI. Built on Ethereum, Dawgz AI is currently priced at under $0.00438 and has raised over $3.6 million during its presale. It merges meme coin simplicity with a clear direction in AI tooling. While it does not include staking, NFTs, or DeFi layers, it has gained attention by positioning itself as a utility-focused meme token backed by real smart contract infrastructure. According to its SolidProof audit, the project has passed multiple contract checks related to safety, ownership, and token mechanics. Dawgz AI is not being traded based on hype cycles. Wallet tracking tools show gradual accumulation, often in smaller, longer-hold addresses. This kind of behavior typically reflects conviction or interest in a utility-based future use case. While it remains under most retail radar, the intersection of AI and cultural tokens continues to attract capital from investors who are planning for a longer horizon. Bitcoin (BTC) – The Original Store of Value Bitcoin remains a priority for institutional investors in 2025. It continues to serve as a digital store of value, offering predictability in a market full of speculation. As of May 21, 2025, Bitcoin is trading at around $106,395.53 with a market cap of over $2.11 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap . Its capped supply of 21 million coins still plays a key role in its long-term appeal. Wallet tracking platforms regularly show steady Bitcoin accumulation by long-term holders. These include hedge funds, treasury wallets, and public companies. Investors often treat Bitcoin as a macro hedge, similar to gold. This perspective makes it one of the few cryptocurrencies that attract capital even in downtrends. Its liquidity, market depth, and institutional-grade products like ETFs make it accessible for large-scale entry. Analysts from CNBC reported that Bitcoin ETFs have driven consistent inflows since Q4 2024. This activity reflects a rising interest in long-term hold strategies over short-term trading. While Bitcoin lacks the programmability of other coins, it offers unmatched consistency. For many institutional players, it remains a core part of their digital asset portfolios. Ethereum (ETH) – Layer 1 With Real Utility Ethereum has secured its place as the infrastructure layer for much of the crypto ecosystem. It powers decentralized finance, smart contracts, and token issuance. As of May 21, 2025, Ethereum is priced around $2485.80 with a market cap of nearly $300.10 billion, according to Binance . Its transition to proof-of-stake and integration with Layer 2 solutions has improved scalability while reducing energy use. Ethereum remains at the center of DeFi, NFTs, and DAO frameworks. Institutional wallets are drawn to it for its flexibility. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum allows investors to back programmable assets and long-term application platforms. Wallet activity often includes staking, liquidity provision, or participation in governance. It makes Ethereum both a holding asset and a tool for engaging with blockchain-native finance. In April, data from DeFiLlama showed Ethereum still holding the highest total value locked (TVL) across DeFi protocols. That dominance reflects a network effect that is hard to replace. For investors building multi-year positions, Ethereum’s role in powering blockchain-based applications continues to make it one of the best crypto assets for long-term exposure. Timing the Market vs. Tracking the Smart Money Trying to time the crypto market often leads to missed opportunities or late entries. Retail traders tend to react to social trends or sudden price spikes. In contrast, institutional wallets depend on measured accumulation and structured allocation. This approach is not based on guessing short-term moves. It is grounded in data, protocol fundamentals, and long-term value storage. As reported by Coinbase Institutional , major funds continue to build exposure over time rather than chase short-term highs. It is where wallet tracking offers insight. By observing patterns in wallet behavior, investors can follow where capital is being deployed with intent. These signals are especially useful when identifying tokens that have not yet entered a high-volume exchange cycle. In 2025, this method has gained more relevance. According to The Guardian , institutional interest in AI-integrated tokens has been growing based on long-term thematic positioning. This interest is not speculative. It comes from models built around utility, token supply, and developer activity. For investors researching the best crypto to buy now , the answer may not lie in trending hashtags. It often appears in on-chain data, audit reports, and smart contract deployments. Projects like Dawgz AI, which blend clear utility with forward-looking narratives, are being watched by wallet clusters that have historically entered before major listings. These patterns can offer signals that are more reliable than short-term price charts or influencer sentiment. How to Track Institutional Wallets Without Guessing Tracking institutional wallets does not require advanced coding skills or private data access. Most of the insights are drawn directly from public blockchain records. Platforms like Nansen allow users to monitor labeled wallets linked to funds, market makers, and smart money accounts. These labels include purchase history, token allocations, and interactions with DeFi protocols. Users can identify which coins are being bought, how long they are held, and whether the wallets are still active. Another tool worth using is Dune Analytics , which offers free dashboards built by the community. These dashboards often display live on-chain data like token transfers, exchange movements, and staking behavior. Some analysts build custom trackers to follow wallet clusters linked to early-stage tokens. It is useful when researching lesser-known projects such as Dawgz AI. Seeing how tokens are moving between wallets can give a better sense of whether accumulation is based on conviction or trading patterns. Platforms like Arkham Intelligence have also introduced wallet intelligence layers, combining blockchain data with entity mapping. It helps users identify how funds move between exchanges, cold wallets, and protocols. For investors building long-term strategies, tools like these offer a more reliable entry point than guessing price swings. Wallet tracking shows action, not opinion—and that makes it valuable in a market where timing and research matter equally. Bottom Line: Why This Matters Now More Than Ever The crypto market in 2025 is not being shaped by hype alone. Data, smart wallet behavior, and the steady movements of institutional capital are shaping it. Investors who depend on signals from retail channels often arrive after the momentum has passed. Those who track wallet activity and focus on utility-driven tokens position themselves with more intention and fewer surprises. As more projects connect blockchain functionality with AI, identity, and automation, the types of coins drawing institutional interest are changing. These are not always the most talked about or highest ranked. They are often the most quietly accumulated. Following where capital flows—not what headlines say—remains one of the clearest ways to build conviction in a crowded market. Dawgz AI is one of the few early-stage projects aligning with that quiet accumulation trend. It brings AI integration into a meme-format token without losing focus on actual smart contract use. For those looking beyond short-term gains, it's worth understanding how tokens like this are structured and why they're beginning to show up in wallet data. Explore Dawgz AI further to see how it fits into the growing category of AI + utility tokens. The best opportunities often appear before they trend.

The “G6 plus one” meeting ended with the hosts Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, and Italy unitedly concerned and disappointed over Trump’s tariffs. The G7 finance ministers and central bank governors were striving to issue a joint communiqué covering non-tariff issues, including support for Ukraine, the threat from non-market economic policies of countries including China, and combating financial crimes and drug trafficking. Particularly, the finance leaders were trying hard to avoid a repeat of a shattered G7 finance meeting hosted by Canada in 2018, when Trump’s first-term steel and aluminum tariffs made the joint statement impossible. However, French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said there was a marked improvement in the mood and that the discussion between the allies was both sincere and honest. Lombard earlier said that he was willing to live without a joint statement as long as the G7 reached a better understanding of how to reduce trade imbalances, better growth policies, and the war in Ukraine. Giorgetti says reaching a communique compromise is crucial Ministro Giorgetti al #G7 di Banff: “Italia continua a lavorare affinché si possa raggiungere il comunicato finale di compromesso. Un passaggio che consideriamo cruciale”. #G7Canada #G7Kananaskis2025 pic.twitter.com/72QQXk1MnU — MEF (@MEF_GOV) May 21, 2025 Italian Economy and Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said reaching a communiqué compromise was a crucial step that needed careful consideration. A European source said U.S. officials wanted to delete language describing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “illegal” from the draft, but Giorgetti said Italy was pushing a proposal to bar countries that had supported Russia’s war effort from being part of Ukraine’s reconstruction. The G7 finance ministers also put a positive spin on discussions in Banff, Alberta, to try to reach an agreement on a joint communique largely covering non-tariff issues. They agreed that excessive forex movements could negatively impact economies. As such, they were looking for closer coordination to stabilize currency and financial markets, particularly in the face of trade tensions and protectionist measures. However, Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato called out recent U.S. tariffs for creating market uncertainties, emphasizing the need for freer trade regimes. “Making progress is what matters ultimately. It’s not just a question of agreeing on a statement today for the sake of it.” – Eric Lombard , French Finance Minister With discussions set to close Thursday, hopes for a final communique reflecting unity among the Group of Seven advanced economies remained uncertain as tensions persisted on Trump’s trade policies. Champagne urges ‘common ground’ as he talks of bridging differences The meeting’s host, Canadian Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, said there was always tension around tariffs, as would be expected, but at the same time, there was a lot that could be achieved together. He, however, declined to say whether he raised the issue of tariffs in his bilateral meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent but insisted the pair “get along very well.” He added that he and Bessent wanted to build on the positive tone Trump struck with Prime Minister Mark Carney at their meeting in Washington earlier this month. Champagne brought Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko to his opening press conference Tuesday and talked of bridging differences even as G7 member countries grappled with a raft of steep tariffs that the U.S. imposed on them. He largely avoided commenting directly on U.S. tariffs but said the G7 for him was “going back to basics,” quickly adding that for him, the basics also meant a “fair, free and rule-based multilateral trading system” — a counterpoint to unilateral actions by Trump that were disrupting international commerce. Champagne also said he wanted to coordinate with the U.S. to tackle challenges such as “overcapacity” and “non-market practices,” where countries like China subsidized industries and overproduced products that could flood world markets and swamp foreign competitors.

With XRP currently trading around $2.39, there are signs that something big could be coming. According to Dr. Martin Hiesboeck, Head of Research at Uphold , if things go well, June might be a turning point for the token. XRP ETF Approval Around the Corner One of the biggest things fueling this optimism is the possibility of a spot XRP ETF finally getting approved. The U.S. SEC is expected to decide on Franklin Templeton’s application by June 17. If it gets a green light, this would be a huge step forward, bringing XRP closer to mainstream finance and making it easier for big investors to jump in. Of course, not every ETF leads to a price boom, as seen with Ethereum last year. But given XRP’s unique legal journey and strong community backing, many believe this one could be different. Fed Meeting Could Unlock Crypto Flows Another key moment is coming with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s next meeting. If they decide to cut interest rates, investors may start looking for better returns in places like crypto. That could bring more attention and money into altcoins like XRP. Meanwhile, lower rates mean cheaper money, and that usually drives up interest in altcoins like XRP. Ripple’s Big Developer Event in Singapore On top of all that, Ripple’s developer event , XRPL APEX, is set for June 10–12 in Singapore. These events often include major announcements, updates, or new partnerships. If Ripple reveals something big, it could boost confidence in XRP even more. June Might Be a Turning Point Dr. Hiesboeck isn’t the only one who thinks something big might be coming. Many analysts are watching XRP closely, and some believe June could be the month when it finally breaks out of its long-term range.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 07:59:13
44944413,https://coinpedia.org/?p=459275,1747900761,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,MicroStrategy Records $15 Billion Profit as Bitcoin Hits All-Time High,https://coinpedia.org/news/microstrategy-records-15-billion-profit-as-bitcoin-hits-all-time-high/,"The post MicroStrategy Records $15 Billion Profit as Bitcoin Hits All-Time High appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MicroStrategy (MSTR) is back in the spotlight, and this time, it’s not just about Bitcoin buys. With BTC hitting a new all-time high of $109,500 , the firm is set to record a staggering $15 billion gain in a single quarter, positioning it for entry into the S&P 500 for the first time ever. But beyond the numbers, industry watchers like Jeff Walton believe MSTR is quietly shaping the entire crypto investment landscape. $MSTR is the apex Bitcoin accumulator. They've accumulated 324,000 BTC in the last 8 months That is 105,000 more Bitcoin than EVERY SINGLE company that has BTC on balance sheet COMBINED Lots of people sour on $MSTR 's future because of a single day of price action need to zoom… — Jeff Walton (@PunterJeff) May 21, 2025 The Apex Bitcoin Holder According to Walton, MSTR has accumulated 324,000 BTC in the last 8 months alone, an amount that surpasses the combined holdings of every other company with Bitcoin on their balance sheet by 105,000 BTC. This makes MicroStrategy the undisputed leader in corporate Bitcoin holdings . While short-term market swings may raise eyebrows, Walton urges investors to “zoom out.” He argues that MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation isn’t just about speculative plays, it’s about long-term structural shifts. “This ecosystem exists because of MSTR’s continued accumulation,” he said. Not Just Holding—Redefining Investment Infrastructure Walton further calls MicroStrategy the “500 lb Gorilla” of crypto, meaning it’s the biggest and most powerful player in the space. He believes the company can pull money out of traditional markets like real estate and bonds and redirect it into Bitcoin using smart financial tools like STRK and STRF. He also says MicroStrategy is “the moon that controls gravity,” meaning its moves have a big impact on the whole crypto market. When MSTR makes a move, it influences everything around it. Strong Performance Since the 21/21 Plan Since announcing its “ 21/21 plan” on October 30, 2024 , MicroStrategy’s stock has surged 63.9%, outperforming Bitcoin’s own 47.1% rise in the same period. While critics argue that the growth could be even better, Walton counters that the current trajectory is impressive enough and the future holds more promise. I’m sure a good chunk of the “negative on MSTR” folks are bots or engagement farming. I for one appreciate your signal though the noise right now . MSTR is the kind of stock I’d like to keep for decades and Saylor is building a foundation of granite to make this feasible. — News Reader (@2836P) May 21, 2025 He also noted that most of the recent FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) around MicroStrategy comes from low-engagement accounts, possibly bots or trolls, echoing the sentiment manipulation seen in stocks like GME. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ‘America Is Not for Sale’: New Bill Targets Trump’s Crypto Cash-Grab , S&P 500 Entry Could Change the Game BTC ATH! $MSTR Q2 Pro Forma earnings With BTC at $109,500, $MSTR has ~ $15B single quarter gain Estimated EPS of Q2 ~ $54 per share (7.7 P/E ratio) This would qualify $MSTR for S&P 500 for the first time, leading to Billions of dollars in passive inflows Higher pic.twitter.com/XcdAmFMFMr — Jeff Walton (@PunterJeff) May 21, 2025 If Bitcoin keeps trading near its highs, MicroStrategy is set to report a massive Q2 earnings bump, which would be around $54 per share, with a price-to-earnings ratio of just 7.7. That kind of performance could finally push MSTR into the S&P 500, opening the door to billions in passive investment flows. And it wouldn’t just be a win for shareholders, it would also be a major validation of MicroStrategy’s bold, high-stakes Bitcoin strategy. It could be the spark that draws even more institutional players into the space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As the flagship crypto nears the next barrier, some analysts suggest that this cycle’s top isn’t in yet. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For Another Leg Up – Is $5 The Next Target? Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High On Wednesday, Bitcoin hit a new ATH of $109,800 after breaking out of the $107,000 short-term resistance, eyeing the $110,000 barrier as its next target. The cryptocurrency has significantly recovered over the last seven weeks, surging around 47% from its five-month low of $74,000 toward its current levels. Amid its May rally, BTC couldn’t break the crucial $106,000 resistance, trading between the $102,000-$105,000 range for nearly two weeks. However, its consolidation ended over the weekend as Bitcoin Weekly Closed above this barrier for the first time in history. Since reclaiming this crucial level on Monday, Analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that the flagship crypto appeared to be forming an ascending triangle pattern in the lower timeframes, which suggested a rally toward the $115,000 level once the price broke above the $107,000 mark. In the early hours of Wednesday, BTC’s bullish breakout saw it retest the $108,000 barrier, facing rejection toward the $106,000 support before bouncing and smashing this barrier and rallying toward its new ATH. Rekt Capital affirmed that the Second Price Discovery Uptrend is ahead for the cryptocurrency, as its First Price Discovery Correction is finally over. The analyst previously highlighted that Bitcoin would rally to a new ATH after Weekly Closing above its re-accumulation range and post-breakout retest. BTC Preparing For Another 20%-30% Jump? Analyst crypto Jelle suggested that BTC’s news target is around the $140,000 mark, pointing to a Power of Three (PO3) setup on Bitcoin’s chart. The pattern divides the price action into three phases: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. In the first phase, a consolidation near the recent high occurs after a strong price performance. This is followed by a token’s price falling below the accumulation phase’s support level in the second phase, trading within a range below the recently lost zone. Lastly, the distribution phase consists of a strong price breakout, with momentum building and participants entering the market. Based on this setup, the flagship crypto started the accumulation phase during the Q4 2024 rally, entering the next phase during the March-April retraces. Amid its late April-May rally, Bitcoin has arrived at the setup’s final phase, with the analyst forecasting $140,000 as the next target after breaking above the $108,500 mark. Related Reading: Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs Similarly, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted the same Po3 pattern on BTC’s chart, affirming that investors could expect a “strong expansion” toward the $125,000-$130,000 levels after breaking out of its previous ATH levels. He previously pointed out that “BTC is clearly repeating the summer 2021 price action and trading in a perfectly bullish structure on high time frame,” which could suggest that the cycle’s top isn’t in yet. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades 1.8% below its new ATH, at $107,502.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. MultiBank Group brings institutional weight to web3 with MBG utility token, deflationary model, and plans for real-world asset tokenization. Table of Contents Utility in token design Deflationary mechanisms and token economy Real-world asset tokenization: Future plans Implications for the web3 ecosystem The digital asset industry is evolving, with more major financial institutions applying their knowledge to web3. MultiBank Group, a significant financial derivatives institution based in Dubai, demonstrates this tendency. The MultiBank Group’s size and regulatory compliance have garnered it several awards in 2025, including “Most Reputable Forex Broker” at Money Expo Abu Dhabi and “Best Global ECN Broker” at the Forex Traders Summit in Dubai. These awards recognize MultiBank’s strong presence in traditional markets as well as its continuous commitment to responsible technology integration. Utility in token design The impending launch of MultiBank’s utility token, MBG, in mid-2025 will be essential to the company’s web3 expansion. Unlike many previous tokens that were largely driven by speculation, MBG was designed from the start to have actual purposes. It enables users to pay fees across MultiBank platforms, collect loyalty incentives, and stake tokens for native returns. This utility-focused design represents a larger industry movement toward tokens that provide concrete value and user advantages while adhering to regulatory norms and consumer security. Deflationary mechanisms and token economy One defining aspect of MBG is its deflationary buyback and burn scheme. MultiBank Group has pledged to eliminate up to half of the token’s entire supply during the next four years. In the first year alone, $58.2 million worth of tokens will be removed from circulation. This method seeks to decrease supply in order to possibly promote long-term value through scarcity, a notion well known in traditional finance but less prevalent in the cryptocurrency sector. This endeavor demonstrates how experienced institutions are using existing capital market methodologies in blockchain ecosystems, indicating a developing approach to token economics. You might also like: A look into the growing role of real-world assets and tokenization in web3 finance Real-world asset tokenization: Future plans Beyond utility tokens, MultiBank is working to tokenize real-world assets , including a $3 billion real estate portfolio that will be reflected on the blockchain. The Group plans to build a crypto-focused electronic communication network (ECN) and prime brokerage service by 2026, followed by a decentralized infrastructure in 2027. These developments point to a future in which traditional banking and blockchain technology are more interwoven, with huge institutions using their regulatory experience and size to create more robust and transparent markets. Implications for the web3 ecosystem As web3 grows, the presence of licensed financial institutions such as MultiBank Group is expected to have a substantial influence.

BTC recently broke through a new all-time high, surpassing $111,000. According to the official announcement , xBTC is a wrapped token that is pegged on a 1 to 1 ratio with the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Users can start simultaneously depositing and withdrawing xBTC on May 22 at 3:00 AM UTC. The product will be initially available on three major chains, including Solana ( SOL ), Sui ( SUI ), and Aptos ( APT ). xBTC is fully managed and supported by EURUSD. Users can verify the transparency of their assets in real time through the on-chain Proof of Reserve . By launching this product on its exchange, OKX hopes to boost cross-chain liquidity for BTC ( BTC ) and keep up with the rising demand for Bitcoin-related products among their user base. On May 21, Bitcoin recently hit a new all-time high , soaring past the $111,000 threshold and reaching a peak of $111,544 in the past 24 hours. Ever since BTC reached its new high, BTC Futures Open Interest jumped by more than 16%. BTC Futures Open Interest is currently sitting at nearly $80.9 billion, according to data from CoinGlass.

Then they would need to select the asset BTC and choose one of the three supported networks, either Solana, Sui, or Aptos. Next, the user has to copy the deposit address and deposit xBTC from an external wallet. After submitting the request and gaining the on-chain confirmation, xBTC will be automatically converted into BTC at a 1:1 ratio and transferred to the intended account. The same process applies to xBTC withdrawals that can be accessed through the withdrawal page. Users can also earn rewards through the exchange’s xBTC “Learn and Earn” campaign. Traders can unlock Bitcoin staking activities and generate yields by taking part in a series of tasks provided by the campaign. Additionally, OKX Wallet plans to launch an xBTC-based income product, which is connected to the Solana, Sui, and Aptos chains. As previously reported, OKX recently unveiled its own self-custodial platform that enables gasless crypto payments dubbed OKX Pay. The platform was launched on April 28 and can be accessed through the crypto exchange’s app. It allows users to send USDT ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) stablecoins without incurring fees.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to a new all-time high of $111,544 on Thursday, May 22, afternoon Asian time, breaking past its previous record of $109,400 from just the day before. This new high marks a 48% jump from the April 7 low of just under $75,000, making it the second all-time high for BTC in 2025. Alongside the price surge, Bitcoin’s market cap hit $2.2 trillion, while its realized cap also reached a new peak at $915 billion, highlighting how much value is flowing into the network. A sharp uptick in trading activity has driven the rally. CoinGecko data shows 24-hour volume surged to $73.7 billion, compared to $50 billion on Wednesday and $40 billion on Tuesday. That’s a noticeable jump, especially considering that earlier this month, daily volume had fallen below $30 million, its lowest since February. BTC’s futures open interest also hit a fresh record of $81.35 billion, up sharply from the $46 billion level seen in early March. That signals growing confidence from institutional and leveraged traders. You might also like: Bitcoin reaches new all-time high above $111K as macro tailwinds drive safe-haven demand Earlier this year, BTC faced strong headwinds as it tumbled more than 30% from January’s high of $109,588, bottoming below $75,000 in early April. That correction came shortly after President Trump hinted at new tariffs on major U.S. trading partners. But sentiment improved mid-April, especially after the U.S. reached fresh trade agreements with several nations. Another major factor driving the surge is the continued demand from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen over $7.4 billion in net inflows over the past five weeks, including $609 million just on Thursday. This has been backed by Bitcoin’s growing role as a treasury asset, prompting a wave of public companies to load the flagship crypto onto their balance sheets. Strategy, for example, has continued its aggressive accumulation , now holding over 2.7% of all Bitcoin in circulation. BTC technicals flash bullish patterns On the 1-day BTC/USDT chart, Bitcoin has flipped the 21-day EMA into support after weeks of acting as resistance. More importantly, the 50-day SMA (blue) just crossed above the 200-day SMA (green), forming the highly watched golden cross pattern. Historically, BTC rallied over 37% in just 3 months following a similar pattern in October 2024.

BTC has broken out of a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart | Source: crypto.news The measured target of this breakout points toward $150,000, matching projections based on the flagpole height added to the breakout zone. If the golden cross plays out fully, the next realistic stop could be around $153,600. Veteran trader Peter Brandt acknowledged BTC’s new highs but reminded followers that hitting all-time highs is just what bull markets do. In an earlier May 1 X post , he predicted that Bitcoin could reach the bull market cycle top in the $125k to $150K level by Aug-Sep 2025, although he warned of a possible 50% correction afterwards. Meanwhile, analyst Gert van Lagen is far more bullish, predicting BTC could reach $300K to $320K by the end of the bull cycle. He based his outlook on a breakout from a 4-year Megaphone Pattern, which features widening price swings and often precedes sharp moves upward. Short-term risks still in play Despite the overwhelming bullish momentum, a short-term pullback can’t be ruled out. BTC’s RSI and Stochastic Oscillator have both entered overbought territory, indicating the rally may be due for a pause or short-term consolidation. BTC 21-day EMA and RSI chart — May 22 | Source: crypto.news If that happens, Bitcoin could briefly fall toward its support zone near $93,500, which lines up with its simple moving average supports. So, while a run toward $150K looks increasingly likely, it may not happen in a straight line. A short-term correction could offer a healthier setup for long-term gains.

Judge Torres recently declined a joint request from both Ripple and the SEC seeking an “indicative ruling” that would permit settlement discussions to proceed based on revised terms. The proposal aimed to replace the previously ordered $125 million penalty and permanent injunction against Ripple with a significantly reduced $50 million fine and no injunction. Her rejection of the motion was not based on the content of the agreement but rather on procedural deficiencies in the request submitted to the court. While the parties are anticipated to file a corrected version of the motion shortly, Prosper has suggested that certain high-level interventions or disclosures could alter the trajectory of the case, potentially leading Judge Torres to vacate her prior judgment. Circumstances That Could Justify a Reversal According to Prosper, one possibility is the submission of confidential evidence showing that XRP holds strategic relevance to the federal government. This may include classified documentation from agencies such as the U.S. Treasury or the Department of Justice (DOJ). #XRP #XRPCommunity What Could Force Judge Torres to Vacate her Judgment? A. Classified or Confidential Federal Interest If either the SEC or Ripple presents sealed evidence (e.g., ex parte communications from the U.S. Treasury, Fed, or DOJ), Judge Torres would be required to… — Ashley PROSPER (@AshleyPROSPER1) May 21, 2025 For instance, internal memos indicating XRP’s potential role in a proposed national digital currency infrastructure, or security assessments warning that the continuation of the lawsuit could negatively affect financial or diplomatic stability, could compel the court to reconsider. Such materials would likely be presented under seal due to their sensitive nature. Prosper noted that courts sometimes adjust or vacate rulings when matters of national interest are credibly demonstrated, particularly if high-ranking government agencies are involved. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Executive Branch Involvement Could Influence Outcome Another pathway to reconsideration, Prosper added, would be direct involvement from the federal executive branch. If entities like the Treasury Department or the Federal Reserve were to submit an amicus curiae brief urging the court to reconsider its position, this could introduce significant legal weight. These agencies might argue that XRP plays a critical role in the national or international financial system. Prosper further explained that the court could apply the principle of Chevron deference, which allows judicial bodies to give weight to federal agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous legislative provisions, especially in matters falling within their expertise. Although infrequent, similar interventions have led to judicial reversals in past financial and regulatory cases. Implications and Community Response If either classified documentation or federal agency participation redefines XRP as essential to government financial strategy, Judge Torres could vacate her original ruling. Such a decision could mark a shift in how XRP is legally classified and utilized, potentially positioning it as a key tool in national financial infrastructure rather than a conventional crypto asset. Nevertheless, some voices within the cryptocurrency community have expressed skepticism, arguing that the scenarios proposed are largely speculative and improbable. Despite this, Prosper maintains that these legal avenues remain viable, depending on the direction taken by both Ripple and the U.S. government in the coming months.

The project has just surpassed 11,000 holders, marking a key milestone in its presale journey. That kind of adoption, especially before a token even hits exchanges, suggests something more than short-term interest: it signals confidence. But what’s driving that confidence? Part of it comes down to a powerful combination of price, product development, and perceived upside. And with the current presale price set at $0.03 — and scheduled to rise to $0.035 in the next phase — many believe this may be the best cheap crypto to buy now before the next move. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Crossing the 11K holder mark isn’t just a vanity stat. In presale environments, where early support often dictates long-term success, these numbers represent a growing base of investors with real conviction. That kind of adoption before launch sets the stage for stronger liquidity, faster exchange traction, and greater price stability once trading begins. Mutuum has built credibility through a clear roadmap, ongoing product development, and utility that resonates with long-term holders. As a result, analysts and investors alike are starting to treat MUTM not just as a speculative play, but as a potential cornerstone in DeFi portfolios. Mutuum’s presale has already advanced from $0.025 to $0.03, marking a 20% increase ahead of its public launch. With the next phase set to raise the price to $0.035 — and a confirmed listing price of $0.06 — those entering now are positioned for a potential 100% gain before the token reaches exchanges. Alongside this price growth, the project has raised nearly $9 million, reinforcing that strong demand is coming from across the investor spectrum — not just small buyers. In fact, several major crypto investors are reportedly accumulating MUTM due to its utility-rich design and still-low entry price. That combination — high-level interest, low-cap pricing, and rising participation — is what sets the stage for a potential breakout once public trading begins. A broader vision: layer-2, efficiency, and scale While much of the DeFi market remains focused on short-term hype, Mutuum Finance is building for longevity. One area that hasn’t received as much attention — but deserves more — is its layer-2 scalability plans. As part of its post-launch roadmap, the team is actively working to ensure that its platform can handle growing user demand without compromising transaction speed or cost-efficiency. Layer-2 integration means faster execution, lower gas fees, and better performance, which will be essential as lending and borrowing activity scales. By moving core functionality onto more efficient infrastructure, Mutuum is creating a system that won’t buckle under pressure — a common challenge for earlier DeFi protocols. This kind of forward-looking design is why serious investors — including some who previously backed blue-chip DeFi names — are turning their attention to MUTM. Mutuum’s strength lies in the way its features work together. From Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending pools that automate yield based on usage, to Peer-to-Peer (P2P) agreements that support more volatile or niche assets, the platform offers flexibility that few DeFi projects can match. And it doesn’t stop there. The upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin will bring additional functionality, allowing users to mint a dollar-pegged token backed directly by assets within the protocol. Combined with mtTokens — which grow in redeemable value based on borrower interest — Mutuum is shaping up to be a full-scale ecosystem for both casual users and high-volume DeFi participants. This multi-layered structure is what makes it more than just another presale — it’s a functioning economy in the making. With 11,000+ holders, rising price stages, a confirmed launch price of $0.06, and a product suite that supports real use cases, Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in now — particularly for those seeking strong upside with real fundamentals behind it. It’s not just the price that’s attracting attention; it’s the structure, utility, and steady execution. And with the next price increase to $0.035 coming soon, the window to enter at these levels may be closing. For investors searching for the next big crypto before the market catches on — MUTM is making a strong case for itself. The question is whether you’ll be in before the rest arrive.

Two names dominate the conversation: Nexchain and BlockDAG. While both are creating waves, they take quite different approaches. Nexchain combines artificial intelligence with a lightning-fast blockchain, providing holders with daily passive income. BlockDAG, on the other hand, combines DAG technology and Proof of Work to prioritize speed, security, and decentralization. Both projects offer significant upside potential, but investors seeking near-term usefulness and clever tokenomics may choose Nexchain. With presales heating up and FOMO rising, it’s time to determine which cryptocurrency presale offers the best combination of innovation, sustainability, and development potential. Nexchain: The Future of AI-Powered Finance Nexchain is more than simply a presale token; it is a fully functional AI-driven ecosystem built for scalability, cross-chain interoperability, and long-term benefits. Currently at stage 14 of its presale, NEX tokens are available for just $0.054, with over $2.6 million raised so far. What distinguishes Nexchain is its novel compensation model: 10% of gas fee revenue is automatically dispersed daily to token holders in non-custodial wallets. That means no staking or lockups—just passive revenue every day. Nexchain is designed for speed and reliability, with the ability to process up to 400,000 transactions per second. Its hybrid consensus methodology combines Proof-of-stake security with AI optimization to achieve maximum throughput while minimizing gas costs. Smart contracts respond in real-time to network demand, making the ecosystem more intelligent, efficient, and egalitarian. Tokenomics are similarly strong, with a restricted supply of 2.15 billion NEX, a structured burn mechanism, and transparent allocations for ecosystem development. Nexchain is one of the top crypto presales to watch in 2025, leading the way for utility-focused, investor-friendly enterprises. BlockDAG: Infrastructure Built to Withstand the Bull Run BlockDAG is not relying on meme value or excitement cycles. Its true strength is rooted in practical basics, technological efficiency, scalability, and accessibility. The hybrid infrastructure of DAG and Proof of Work enhances transaction speed while simultaneously strengthening security. While other cryptocurrencies fighting for headlines still deal with congestion and expensive gas expenses, BlockDAG’s design addresses these concerns at their core. That is precisely why many believe BDAG will be the cryptocurrency that leads the next bull run. BlockDAG’s design ensures it can withstand widespread adoption without faltering. Add to it an increasing number of mobile and hardware miners, and you have a decentralized engine that relies on both community engagement and technological accuracy. It’s an infrastructure-first strategy that stands out in a market rife with vaporware and unsustainable tokenomics. BlockDAG is a solid candidate for long-term investors, with a high ceiling, especially if market momentum kicks in. Nexchain Emerges as the Best Presale Crypto for 2025 When it comes to determining the best presale cryptocurrency to purchase before prices spike, Nexchain leads with a genuine value proposition that is currently producing results. Its mix of AI-powered smart contracts, quick passive incentives, and lightning-fast perform ance offers it an advantage over even the most technically proficient rivals, such as BlockDAG. While BlockDAG shows potential in infrastructure, Nexchain provides value immediately with a demonstrated use case and rising community support. As stage 14 unfolds and prices stay around $0.054, the opportunity to buy early in Nexchain remains available. Nexchain isn’t simply the finest cryptocurrency presale today for those looking for huge profits supported by actual functionality and beneficial tokenomics; it might be the breakout presale of 2025.

Then they became a movement. From viral tweets to billion-dollar market caps, they’ve managed to turn community hype into serious momentum. In 2025, these coins are still part of the conversation, just with new rules. Crypto investors are no longer looking for noise.

That’s why many are watching how artificial intelligence could shape the next wave of meme coins to buy. Some believe the best meme opportunities in 2025 won’t just be about price spikes. They’ll be driven by interaction, storytelling, and tech. Dawgz AI is one example that reflects this new model. It blends humor with AI features, showing how meme tokens can grow beyond short-term hype to become something built to last. Why Meme Coins Still Matter in 2025 Meme coins still dominate attention in crypto for one reason—they move with people, not just markets. These tokens rise because of jokes, tweets, and trends. They tap into culture and emotion in ways that traditional cryptocurrencies don’t. Dogecoin, for example, still holds a strong following in 2025. Its trading volume crossed $500 million in April alone, according to CoinMarketCap , showing that meme-driven value hasn’t disappeared. What’s changed is how people view these coins. Investors no longer see them as just funny tokens. Meme coins now represent digital identities. Shiba Inu built an ecosystem that includes a decentralized exchange and metaverse plans. These moves weren’t just for show. They were designed to keep the community active and involved. Pepe, another meme token, continues to trend on CoinGecko because of strong meme appeal and consistent engagement, even when the market slows. Meme coins are also a way for new investors to join crypto. Not everyone wants to study whitepapers or tokenomics. Meme tokens bring in users through humor and storytelling. That’s why analysts on CoinDesk note that meme coins outperformed several utility-based tokens in Q2 2024. Whether or not they keep rising depends on how well they hold attention. But in 2025, it’s clear these tokens still matter—and they’re not going away. The Shift from Pure Hype to Hybrid Utility In 2025, meme coins are starting to reflect something more than trends. Investors are now looking for tokens that offer both hype and a real experience. This shift isn’t about technical complexity. It’s about utility that fits the meme space. The rise of artificial intelligence in crypto is a key example. Tokens that include AI features are drawing attention because they give users a reason to interact beyond price speculation. AI in meme coins can drive creative tools, personalized content, and dynamic storytelling. These are features that traditional meme coins never offered. According to Coinbase , AI tokens are growing fast across multiple sectors, from trading bots to content tools. When those features meet a meme-driven community, they create something different—an ecosystem where memes aren’t just viral, they’re built into the experience. Projects like Dawgz AI are getting noticed because they match this direction. The token doesn’t depend on NFTs or metaverse hype. Instead, it focuses on AI tools that help the community share stories, create content, and stay engaged. This kind of utility supports long-term value in a way that early meme coins never did. Crypto investors are watching for projects that mix humor with tech, not just to speculate but to participate. Dawgz AI – How One Token Reflects the New Meme Narrative Many meme coins have chased hype. But only a few have started to build tools that help their communities stay active and creative. That shift matters because in 2025, investors are less interested in one-time pumps. They want tokens that offer ongoing participation. Meme coins that provide creative utility are getting more attention, especially those tied to artificial intelligence. This blend of meme energy and AI tools is creating a new category of tokens. Dawgz AI fits into this shift without trying to copy older meme models. It’s built on Ethereum, and it avoids NFTs or staking gimmicks. Instead, it offers AI-powered tools designed to let users create content and grow their communities. SolidProof audited the project, and the early support has been strong. As of May, it has raised over $3.6 million during its presale at a rate of $0.00438 per token, showing that people are backing meme tokens with more than just a name. What makes Dawgz AI different isn’t just the tech. It’s the way it’s trying to use AI to keep the meme space alive with fresh input, not recycled trends. That’s where long-term value might come from. If a token helps people create, rather than just hold, it stays active. Meme coins like Dawgz AI suggest that 2025 won’t be about choosing between fun and function. Some tokens may offer both, without trying to be everything at once. For more information, please check out the following video: How Analysts Are Reading the AI-Meme Coin Convergence The link between artificial intelligence and meme coins is becoming harder to ignore. In April, AI-based tokens surged more than 15% across major exchanges, according to CoinGecko . While not all of them were memes, several meme tokens with AI components saw notable spikes in both trading volume and search interest. This trend signals more than speculation. It shows how investors are beginning to connect memes with interactive tech. Crypto analysts from CoinDesk noted that meme coins with real tools and user-facing features have started to outperform many traditional altcoins in early 2025. In their April market report , they highlighted how the combination of community energy and AI utility is giving some meme tokens a second life. This insight shifts the view of meme tokens from short-term bets to assets that can build on cultural relevance. Tokens like Dawgz AI are part of this larger conversation. It’s not being judged just on memes or buzz. Analysts are tracking how it builds tools and keeps its audience active. That utility has started to matter. A meme coin that doesn’t just go viral but gives users something to do may last longer. AI is helping turn some of these tokens into interactive spaces, not just names on a chart. What Investors Are Watching in the Meme Coin Space Crypto investors are asking better questions in 2025. They’re not only chasing trending names. They want to know what keeps a meme coin active after the first surge. According to CNBC , recent trading activity around Pepe and Floki shows that investors still follow meme tokens closely. But this time, they’re focused on features that can sustain community growth, not just early momentum. One of the biggest signals investors watch is the presence of real utility. Tokens that offer creative tools, AI features, or interactive rewards tend to get more long-term interest. These traits help separate hype-based coins from those building actual ecosystems. On Binance’s trending list , AI-powered tokens have stayed near the top in April due to growing search demand. These aren’t all traditional meme coins, but many use humor and design in ways that appeal to meme-focused buyers. As the market shifts, some investors believe the best meme coin to buy may be the one that balances energy with usefulness. That doesn’t mean every token must offer full-scale platforms. It means the coin has to give something back—tools, community features, or cultural relevance. Projects like Dawgz AI are gaining attention in this space. Not because they shout the loudest, but because they’re building something people can return to over time. Key Differences Between 2021 Meme Coins and 2025 AI Tokens The meme coin market in 2021 was shaped by raw hype. Tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu surged because of social media waves and celebrity tweets. Many had no product, roadmap, or function beyond their meme status. Traders bought in for the trend, not the tech. But four years later, the expectations are different. Investors now expect a reason to hold beyond virality. In 2025, meme coins are judged on what they can do, not just how loud they are. A good example is the shift toward utility-focused memes. Shiba Inu now runs a decentralized exchange and is building out a digital space known as Shib: The Metaverse. According to Forbes , these additions have helped it stay relevant long after its original hype. While Dogecoin still trades heavily on CoinMarketCap , its lack of utility has made it harder to attract new types of users. Tokens that succeed today are finding new ways to keep their communities involved. Dawgz AI, for instance, uses AI-based tools that invite participation and creation. It doesn't just depend on meme value. Instead, it invites holders to engage through content, interaction, and storytelling. That shift marks a clear difference between meme coins that fade and those building steady traction. In 2025, coins that keep attention through use, not just price, are the ones being taken more seriously. Where Meme Coins Might Go Next Meme coins have always followed attention. But in 2025, they may begin shaping how attention works inside crypto communities. Instead of depending on viral trends alone, some tokens are using tech to help users create the next trend themselves. Artificial intelligence is becoming part of that shift, letting users generate stories, videos, or images tied to the tokens they hold. According to CoinDesk , AI is helping projects stand out by giving holders new ways to interact. This trend is important because it speaks to long-term participation. When a meme coin helps people contribute, not just consume, it becomes more than a short-term bet. Tools that let holders shape content or interact with features built into the token can turn a coin into a creative space. Dawgz AI is an example of this direction. Its AI tools give users the chance to take part in meme creation rather than waiting for the next headline. That shift adds utility without losing the core appeal of memes. If this direction continues, meme coins become platforms for creative energy. Instead of watching a token rise and fall, users would help drive the next campaign, image, or story. It’s not just about value—it’s about presence. Projects that build tools for interaction may lead to this change. The meme coins of tomorrow won’t depend on luck. They’ll rely on what their communities are able to build together. Final Take: Why AI-Backed Meme Coins Could Define 2025 Meme coins have always followed culture. They’ve reflected what people talk about, laugh at, and rally behind. In 2025, that pattern hasn’t disappeared. But the way these coins operate is changing. Investors are starting to look for tokens that offer more than just fun. They want something they can return to—something that builds with them. Artificial intelligence has opened the door for that kind of interaction. It allows meme coins to offer new tools, not just new jokes. It gives communities the chance to create instead of waiting for the next tweet. That shift makes AI-powered meme coins one of the most watched categories in the market today. It’s not about replacing humor with tech. It’s about letting both work together. If you’re watching this space closely, Dawgz AI is one of the projects worth your attention. It brings AI into the meme world with a focus on participation, not just promotion. Its tools are built to keep the community active. If you're curious about what meme coins might look like in the future, explore Dawgz AI and see how it’s helping change the story. FAQs Section What is a meme coin in crypto?

This private dinner, starting at 7 p.m., invites the biggest investors of the TRUMP coin launched by Donald Trump himself during his second presidency. Here’s what to expect from the event? What’s on the Agenda? About two weeks ago, President Trump offered a special invite to the top 220 holders of his TRUMP coin—a fancy dinner at his golf club near Washington, D.C., and a White House tour the next day. But that’s not all—out of those 220 guests, the top 25 holders will receive an exclusive VIP tour of the White House with Trump himself. However, the discussions about the future of crypto regulations and industry growth are expected, as Trump has shown ongoing interest in shaping crypto policies. Who Will Be The Attendees? In total, these 220 attendees have spent nearly $394 million on TRUMP coins, an average of $1.79 million each. Some major crypto names are joining Trump’s dinner. Leading the list is Justin Sun, founder of Tron , who holds $75 million worth of TRUMP coins. Another major guest is the mysterious co-founder of MemeCore, a crypto company from Singapore. Though not much is known about them, they’re among the top holders. Also on the guest list is Australian crypto investor Kain Warwick, who founded Infinex. Interestingly, 19 of the top 25 holders used Binance, a platform currently not operating legally in the U.S. Political Backlash and Controversies Despite the excitement, the dinner faces criticism, some people are calling it a “pay-for-access” event. Trump’s team reportedly earned about $900,000 in fees soon after announcing the contest for invitations. Senator Chris Murphy said the dinner is like a secret meeting where rich people, maybe even from other countries, could try to influence Trump. Even critics like former official Robert Reich have openly called the event corrupt. Will TRUMP Coin’s Price Be Affected? Today’s dinner is more than just a social event, it could influence the TRUMP meme coin massively. Since its launch in January 2025, the TRUMP coin quickly hit a $15 billion market cap before experiencing a sharp drop. However, news of the gala dinner helped boost the coin again, pushing its price to about $14.60 , and it is up by 14% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $2.92 billion. Many experts believe the coin could climb further, possibly reaching $25 or more, as bullish trends strengthen in the crypto market.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 09:22:16

BTC’s price action has entered a consolidation phase, with traders waiting for a clear breakout or correction. But while many eyes remain fixed on Bitcoin’s next move, some investors are already looking elsewhere — and that’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in. Far from stalling, MUTM has been steadily building momentum in the background. The token is still priced at $0.03, but with growing traction in its presale and clear signs of rising interest, its first major price breakout is likely not far off. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now before the next wave of retail attention, MUTM is beginning to look like a standout pick. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) What sets Mutuum Finance apart from the usual lineup of early-stage cryptocurrencies is its steady delivery on promises. Rather than relying on hype-driven marketing cycles, the project has focused on building real infrastructure — and it shows. At its foundation, Mutuum operates as a decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing, featuring two separate models. In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system, users deposit digital assets into shared liquidity pools, earning yield that adjusts dynamically based on pool utilization. For passive income seekers, this model offers a hands-off way to generate returns while contributing to the protocol’s liquidity layer. In contrast, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model enables users to set and agree on loan terms through direct negotiation. This approach is particularly beneficial for trading tokens that don’t typically appear in traditional lending environments — including memecoins or high-volatility assets. With P2P, users gain flexibility that’s hard to find elsewhere, making it especially appealing to those with niche strategies or less mainstream tokens. In addition to its lending features, Mutuum offers mtTokens — interest-generating tokens minted at a 1:1 ratio to user deposits. These tokens automatically increase in redeemable value over time as interest is collected across the platform. Unlike fixed staking setups, mtTokens stay completely liquid and transferable, allowing users to manage their assets freely while still earning yield. Adding another layer of depth is Mutuum’s upcoming stablecoin, which is being designed as an overcollateralized, decentralized asset. Minted directly from excess collateral supplied through the protocol, this dollar-pegged token will serve as a reliable unit of account for users who want to borrow against their holdings without leaving the platform. With the supply adjusted dynamically and transparently through smart contracts, it offers an alternative to centralized stablecoins — and brings meaningful utility to the protocol’s economy. This blend of features — layered yield, customizable lending, and an integrated stablecoin — makes Mutuum Finance more than just a presale token. It places the project as a full-scale DeFi ecosystem, prepared to go live with practical applications from the very start. A presale that’s attracting major attention With these utilities in place and a product launch timed with the token listing, it’s no surprise that investor interest is building. The ongoing presale has already brought in nearly $9 million, with the community now exceeding 11,000 holders — a rare milestone for a token that hasn’t even launched yet. What’s more telling is the quality of interest. Several notable crypto investors — including those previously active in top-tier DeFi projects — are now shifting part of their focus to MUTM. The combination of a low entry price and real utility is proving to be a compelling mix, especially for those seeking the next big crypto with high-growth potential. While Bitcoin takes a breather, tokens like MUTM are being positioned by early buyers for potentially massive upside. With a strong foundation already in place and several mechanics designed to reward long-term holders, Mutuum Finance is now preparing for what could be its first major price jump — one that may not wait until listing day to begin. And at $0.03, the token still qualifies as one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. But based on the momentum it’s gaining and the tools it’s offering, that label may not stick for long. In addition to everything already outlined, Mutuum is also giving early participants another reason to act. The project is currently running a $100,000 promotional campaign, with details available through the official platform channels. Ten winners will be selected, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM — an added incentive for those stepping in before the presale progresses further. For investors who believe in utility-backed projects, scalable platforms, and entry prices with serious upside, MUTM continues to check all the right boxes. And while Bitcoin consolidates, it’s becoming clear that Mutuum Finance is quietly making its move — and smart money is paying attention.

SafeMoon CEO Karony pleaded guilty to securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy following a 12-day trial in the Eastern District of New York. Karony faces up to 45 years in prison. The lawsuit alleged that Karony and his accomplices misled investors about the structure and security of SafeMoon, an altcoin issued in 2021 that imposes a 10% transaction tax on transfers. Karony and others reportedly maintained their access to the SafeMoon liquidity pool and took significant amounts of money for personal use. Although Karony and his accomplices said they did not hold or trade SafeMoon (SFM), the lawsuit alleges they repeatedly bought and sold SFM at peak prices. It was also stated that Karony traded on centralized exchanges using pseudonymous wallets and unhosted accounts, concealing the use of investor funds. Karony alone allegedly received more than $9 million in benefits and used this money to buy luxury assets such as luxury real estate, two Audi R8 sports cars and a Tesla. “SafeMoon was initially considered very safe. However, investors were deliberately scammed by a man named Karony who wanted to steal millions of dollars and get rich quick, and it turned out to be a figment of imagination for the believing investors. When SafeMoon’s market capitalization reached over $8 billion, Karony and his accomplices fraudulently obtained and misused millions of dollars worth of liquidity from the SafeMoon liquidity pool for their personal gain. Karony defrauded investors and used them to purchase multiple homes, sports cars, custom vans and other luxury items.” Following this news, SafeMoon (SFM) is down nearly 10% in the last 24 hours. *This is not investment advice.

With over $300,000 raised in its first week of presale, the crypto community is beginning to wonder: Is this the next 100x opportunity since the explosive rise of PEPE? Why Wall Street Ponke is Gaining Traction Fast Unlike many memecoins that launch with little more than a logo and some community memes, Wall Street Ponke entered the scene with a mission, real-world utility, and a strong roadmap. Its first week has been nothing short of impressive—rapid fundraising, growing community buzz, and increasing mentions across crypto forums. This isn’t a random frog-themed pump-and-dump. Wall Street Ponke is blending the entertainment of meme culture with serious crypto innovation. A Secure Ecosystem, Not Just a Token What’s driving the buzz? For starters, WPONKE offers a platform that addresses one of crypto’s most pressing issues: security. At its core, Wall Street Ponke features an AI-powered detection system that continuously scans new tokens across the market. This system flags red flags like fake liquidity, suspicious smart contract behavior, and developer manipulation, helping traders avoid scams before they commit their funds. In a landscape filled with rug pulls, this alone is a major selling point. The Future of Meme Coins: Education and Empowerment Wall Street Ponke goes beyond protection—it educates. The platform includes a full e-learning ecosystem, featuring easy-to-follow courses on DeFi, staking, tokenomics, and smart contract analysis. Whether you’re just starting in crypto or looking to level up your skills, WPONKE has positioned itself as a hub for smarter trading. It’s this blend of fun and functionality that’s earning it comparisons to early-stage PEPE—but with more tools and a clearer vision. High Staking Rewards and Real Community Utility One of the project’s standout features is its staking model. Early investors are being rewarded with a staggering 1232% APY. This system doesn’t just create FOMO—it builds long-term commitment. Instead of encouraging a quick flip, Wall Street Ponke incentivizes holders to become part of a sustainable ecosystem. With staking, AI security tools, and educational resources all rolled into one, it’s no surprise that WPONKE is being called one of the most complete meme coin launches in recent memory. How to Join the Presale and Buy $WPONKE It’s easy and beginner-friendly to join the Wall Street Ponke presale. Create a crypto wallet to deposit funds. Then use a popular wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. You first need to buy some crypto from a central exchange. Use a central exchange like Binance or Coinbase to buy some ETH, USDT, or BNB. Next, go to wallstreetponke.com and connect your wallet to the presale interface. After that, simply select your payment of choice, enter the amount you’d like to invest and hit confirm. At the end of the presale, you will be able to claim your $WPONKE tokens in your wallet. Those who join the presale early will be able to stake their tokens and begin earning up to 1232% APY immediately. Wall Street Ponke isn’t just riding the meme coin wave—it’s reshaping it. If PEPE were a flash, $WPONKE could be the real fire.

With a strategy focused on delivering immediate utility and lasting value, this emerging DeFi project is becoming a serious contender among early-stage cryptocurrencies. And as the launch date approaches, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Mutuum isn’t just preparing for a price jump — it’s laying the groundwork for long-term growth, while offering yield-generating tools from the very beginning. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) When investors hear “Day One,” it often signals a token release with promises of future utility. But for Mutuum Finance, Day One means something more concrete. The team plans to launch a beta version of the platform at the time of the token listing, ensuring users can immediately interact with the protocol and start earning. This move positions Mutuum ahead of many other DeFi tokens that delay functionality post-listing. With core features like lending, borrowing, and passive yield set to go live from the start, the platform is already being watched by investors who prioritize working products over whitepapers. At its current price of $0.03, MUTM remains one of the best cheap cryptocurrencies to invest in right now, particularly when you factor in the expected $0.06 listing price. That’s a built-in 100% gain for anyone entering during the current phase. And with the next stage set to raise the presale price to $0.035, early entries are securing more than just a low cost — they’re locking in position ahead of rising demand. So far, the presale has attracted over 11,000 holders and raised nearly $9 million, underscoring the project’s strong early traction. What’s particularly notable is the rise in long-term holders — participants who are not just flipping for a quick gain, but are staying for the utility and potential ecosystem growth. That kind of holder base adds stability and increases the likelihood of post-listing sustainability. A balanced, yield-driven ecosystem Mutuum Finance isn’t attempting to redefine the entire DeFi sector — it’s focused on streamlining and improving the core features that users already rely on. At its core, the platform provides two parallel lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Users supply crypto to shared liquidity pools and earn yield based on pool utilization. Interest rates are dynamic, increasing as demand for borrowing grows. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): For more tailored arrangements, users can negotiate loan terms directly. This system is ideal for borrowing or lending tokens that may not fit in standard liquidity models, including volatile or niche assets. But Mutuum doesn’t stop at lending. The platform will also launch mtTokens, which are generated when users deposit their assets into the protocol. These tokens accrue value over time, increasing in redeemable worth as borrowers pay interest. Unlike typical staking models that require users to lock funds, mtTokens remain fully liquid — allowing holders to move or trade them while continuing to earn. Another significant component is Mutuum’s upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be minted from user-supplied collateral and pegged algorithmically to the US dollar. This stablecoin offers added utility within the ecosystem and serves as a borrowing option for users who want to unlock capital without selling their crypto. While dozens of DeFi tokens are entering the market each month, few are backing their promises with functional products and aligned incentives. Mutuum Finance stands out because it’s focused on real revenue, passive income, and decentralized mechanisms that benefit every participant — not just early insiders. This structure is already catching the attention of investors familiar with larger DeFi protocols. The difference? Mutuum is still early, still underpriced, and still accessible to new participants. As momentum builds, many believe this could be the next big crypto to hit $1, especially considering the low market entry and growing platform utility. MUTM’s current setup — a working platform launching with the token, interest-generating tools like mtTokens, and a community of 11,000+ holders — is exactly what seasoned investors look for in a long-term position. And with exchange listings expected shortly after the presale ends, demand is likely to rise fast as the broader market catches up. Mutuum Finance isn’t just offering short-term returns. It’s building a DeFi ecosystem that delivers value on day one — and continues to scale from there.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $12.59. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $34.29 and $39.7, with an average value of $35.49. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031.

The price has climbed to $0.781, breaking above the middle Bollinger Band ($0.740) with a solid green candle, a bullish signal suggesting potential for further upside. The MACD histogram is still negative but flattening out, hinting at building momentum. OBV is rising, which confirms growing buying pressure.

Price is holding strong at $0.781, with consistent green candles and the Alligator lines (green, red, blue) clearly fanned out and pointing upward. The Balance of Power is strong at 0.40, showing buyers are in control, and CMF at 0.19 reinforces solid capital inflow.

If OP holds above $0.75, a move toward $0.80–$0.82 is likely. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi altcoin, is drawing intense demand. The project has raised $9,000,000 since its presale began, selling over 500 million tokens, and attracting 11,000 holders. Trading at $0.03 in phase 5, MUTM’s price has surged 200% from its opening phase at $0.01. Promising a 100% ROI at its $0.06 launch, MUTM’s structured tokenomics fuel optimism. But can Dogecoin’s meme-driven rally outpace MUTM’s calculated ascent to $1? The crypto news today suggests a thrilling race. Dogecoin’s Rally Stumbles Dogecoin is clawing its way back, trading at $0.2207 as of May 19, 2025. A 2.28% daily gain signals resilience, yet it lags far from its 52-week peak of $0.4743. The crypto’s Relative Strength Index hovers at 64.57, nearing overbought terrain. This hints at a possible pause or reversal. However, the MACD at 0.09 screams bullish momentum. Support at $0.215 holds firm, a critical base for any upward thrust. Breaking $0.236 resistance could propel Dogecoin toward $0.25, but sustaining that push demands robust buying. The Fear & Greed Index at 74 reflects investor zeal, yet volatility looms. Dogecoin’s meme-fueled charm struggles against structured DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Ignites Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is commanding attention in the crypto market. Phase 5 is underway, with tokens priced at $0.03, a 200% leap from the first phase’s $0.01. Investors are rushing in, driven by a guaranteed 100% ROI at the $0.06 launch price. The project has raised $9,000,000, with over 500 million tokens sold and 11,000 holders onboard. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing a leaderboard of top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. This fuels FOMO as the opening phase sells out swiftly. The next phase looms, promising a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, offering current investors a 20% gain from the $0.025 phase 4 price. MUTM’s DeFi Edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t chasing hype; it’s building utility. Its decentralized lending platform lets users borrow, lend, and earn passive income. Unlike Dogecoin’s speculative swings, MUTM’s overcollateralized model ensures stability. Borrowers lock assets exceeding loan values, slashing default risks. Lenders deposit into liquidity pools, earning dynamic interest based on demand. The buy-and-distribute system funnels platform revenue into repurchasing MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates relentless buy pressure, bolstering long-term growth. Analysts predict a post-launch price of $2.50, yielding an 8,233% ROI from the current $0.03. The team is auditing its smart contract with Certik, with results soon to be shared on socials. Dogecoin’s Uphill Climb Dogecoin’s path to $0.40 faces hurdles. Trading volume at $2.62 billion shows active interest, but crypto prices often sway with sentiment. Forecasts for July 2025 peg DOGE between $0.177 and $0.189, signaling consolidation. By December 2025, an average price of $0.221 is expected, with $0.226 as a high. Long-term, 2026 projections see $0.25 to $0.30, but broader adoption is key. Dogecoin’s community thrives on enthusiasm, yet lacks the structural depth of DeFi projects. Investors eyeing the best crypto to buy now may hesitate, as DOGE’s momentum hinges on fleeting market vibes rather than tangible utility. Race to $1 Intensifies Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is outpacing Dogecoin in the race to $1. Its presale success, with $9,000,000 raised and a 200% price surge, underscores investor trust. The crypto investment offers a clear 100% ROI at launch, with a $2.50 crypto prediction promising exponential gains. Dogecoin, despite its loyal base, struggles to break $0.40, let alone $1. Its reliance on retail hype pales against MUTM’s DeFi framework. As crypto prices today fluctuate, MUTM’s structured growth makes it a top crypto to buy. Investors seeking the next big cryptocurrency should act fast—phase 5 tokens are vanishing and so is your chance of investing early in the crypto.

Despite coming from a team with a large community, the Ethereum Layer 2 network has struggled to stay relevant in the fierce competition among Ethereum Layer 2 networks. After the initial run fueled by the anticipation of the launch, the Shibarium network is dealing with low participation as new account numbers flatline. New Accounts On Shibarium Fall Below 100 The new account metric tracks the total number of brand new accounts that are created on the Shibarium network daily. This is different from the total daily users as it only tracks new accounts and not existing accounts. It also helps to show the adoption rate as more new accounts signing up shows adoption is rising and the number falling means the opposite. Related Reading: Did Cardano Founder Steal $619 Million? Hopkinson Makes Shocking Revelation Presently, the Shibarium network is falling behind as the total number of new accounts signing up have fallen below the 100 mark. This comes after a major spike at the beginning of May 2025 when a total of 5,111 new accounts were created on May 6th alone. Since then, the number has crashed by over 99%, dropping first to just above 200 new daily accounts, before bottoming out below 100. Data from ShibariumScan shows that in the last four days, fewer than 100 new accounts have been recorded daily. This also coincides with a sharp decline in the active accounts on the network, going from over 21,000 daily at the start of May to less than 15,000% by the middle of the month. New transaction figures have also fallen with 1.87 million recorded on Tuesday compared to the 3 million average at the start of the month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Closes Above Range High Despite Crash From $107,000, Why The Bulls Are Still In Charge Shiba Inu Follows Bearish Trend The trend of low adoption recorded on the Shibarium blockchain has also been felt in other areas such as the total addresses holding the Shiba Inu token. According to IntoTheBlock, the total addresses holding Shiba Inu have seen a decline over the last couple of days. This metric went from above 1.4 million to 1.39 million addresses. A small decline, but nonetheless pointing to an exit from the cryptocurrency by investors. At the same time, the Shiba Inu price has also struggled to stay afloat at this time. Caught in a power struggle between the bears and the bulls, Shiba Inu has seen its price constrained to a tight range of $0.000014 and $0.000017. If the sell-offs continue, then the meme coin could break below the support currently being established at $0.000014.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is doing exactly that. With over 11,000 investors now on board, the project has officially entered Phase 5 of its presale, and the token price has just hit $0.03 — triple the price it launched at during Phase 1, which was $0.01. That growth hasn’t gone unnoticed. Long-term investors and crypto strategists are beginning to take a closer look at MUTM, and for good reason. With the next phase set to increase the price to $0.035, and a confirmed launch price of $0.06, this phase may represent the last window to buy in before significant upside kicks in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Crossing the 11K holder threshold is more than just a milestone. In the presale world, it signals trust, traction, and a network effect that can carry momentum forward. Unlike speculative projects built around hype alone, Mutuum has been attracting steady interest from a wide range of buyers — including major crypto investors who recognize the value of its utility-driven model. The presence of these high-value participants gives early buyers even more confidence. And with a price structure that already shows a 100% gain from the current $0.03 to the $0.06 launch, it’s easy to see why more people are jumping in while the opportunity still exists. Mutuum isn’t just capturing investor attention with price movement — it’s offering a system that delivers real value. When users deposit assets into the protocol, they receive mtTokens, which are pegged 1:1 to the original deposit and gradually increase in redeemable value over time. These tokens are fully liquid, meaning users can transfer or trade them freely while still earning interest generated by borrower activity. This design combines the best aspects of passive yield with on-chain flexibility, giving long-term holders a reason to stay active and committed to the protocol. Unlike staking models that lock assets or require withdrawal waiting periods, mtTokens maintain accessibility while generating returns — something increasingly rare in today’s DeFi crypto space. Stablecoin in development — backed on-chain Another utility investors are watching closely is the upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be minted directly from the assets users already deposit as collateral. Designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, this stablecoin introduces a new layer of functionality to Mutuum’s lending and borrowing ecosystem. What sets this development apart is its decentralized foundation and full transparency on the blockchain. Rather than relying on off-chain reserves or opaque governance models, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be fully aligned with the protocol’s core infrastructure — and that gives it a major advantage in the evolving stablecoin market. While the $0.06 listing price is already double today’s value, analysts believe that won’t be the ceiling for long. With utilities like mtTokens and a stablecoin launching alongside the token, plus a growing community of committed users, MUTM is expected to surge sharply after going live. Some projections suggest the token may rise as much as 2500% shortly after launch, especially if it gains traction on exchanges and draws more capital from larger market players. While that kind of move depends on market sentiment, the structure is in place — and the presale is giving investors a rare chance to enter before the broader market catches on. Mutuum Finance is delivering more than just a token — it’s introducing a protocol with real earning potential, long-term appeal, and a community that’s already growing fast. With over 11,000 holders, nearly $9 million raised, and utilities that go live from day one, it’s positioned to be a serious player in the next wave of DeFi. But with Phase 5 now live and the next price jump to $0.035 approaching, this may be the last opportunity to enter at $0.03. For anyone asking what’s the best crypto to buy now before the next breakout, MUTM is quickly becoming one of the clearest answers.

TICKER: XRPI pic.twitter.com/hukzoHtOWf — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 21, 2025 With the launch scheduled for today, market participants across the cryptocurrency landscape, particularly within the XRP community, are closely watching for its potential impact. The ETF marks a significant milestone not only for XRP but also for the broader evolution of regulated crypto investment products in the United States. XRPI Launch Marks Regulatory Progress for XRP Volatility Shares, an asset management firm previously known for launching leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs, is now venturing into the XRP ecosystem by offering institutional and retail investors indirect exposure to XRP through a futures-based financial product. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike spot ETFs, which require the issuer to hold the underlying asset, a futures ETF tracks the price of XRP through futures contracts listed on regulated exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) . This structure allows traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP price movements without holding the asset directly. The product’s approval and listing come at a time when market sentiment surrounding XRP is showing signs of renewed optimism. Following a pivotal court ruling in the SEC v. Ripple case that clarified XRP is not a security in secondary market transactions, the digital asset has regained favor among institutional players and high-profile investors. The timing of the XRPI launch is expected to capitalize on this momentum, offering a regulated gateway for capital inflow into XRP derivatives. Market watchers are now turning their attention to XRPl’s performance on its first day of trading. Volume, investor interest, and initial pricing behavior will be closely monitored as indicators of institutional sentiment towards the recent development.

Most notably, $RLC’s economics are underpinned by a fixed supply of about 86 million tokens, with no new token unlocks or inflation planned, so value must be driven by genuine usage rather than dilution. Furthermore, broadly speaking, all of the ongoing initiatives introduce a circular economic framework designed to make $RLC (the platform’s native asset) more useful for powering computing services rather than sitting idle in wallets, thus pivoting from the traditional mindset of holding tokens (that has permeated the crypto industry at large) to actively using $RLC as fuel for its privacy-focused cloud network. In this context, the message from company CEO Gilles Fedak has been clear, that moving forward iExec is going to keep increasing the utility of $RLC, with him adding: “Our latest initiatives encourage people to use RLC instead of holding it, driving a circular token economy that creates value through utility.” With such developments continuing to unfold, iExec is expanding its footing within emerging realms like decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) and AI, where trust and data confidentiality are paramount. Simplifying Web3 building using vouchers One of the most noteworthy announcements of Tokenomics Week has been the introduction of the iExec ‘Voucher system,’ a novel approach to streamlining how developers interact with the blockchain backend of the platform’s operations. To elaborate, each voucher comes preloaded with $RLC and allows developers to pay for computing resources without manually handling crypto wallets or gas fees. For developers used to wrestling with on-chain transactions, the model allows users to redeem them to run computations or deploy applications, and the blockchain interactions happen behind the scenes. iExec RLC @iEx_ec · Follow Tokenomics Announcement 2: The iExec VoucherFrom a dev’s first line of code to every time a user runs the app, $RLC circulates.This is how devs should interact with utility tokens. Watch on Twitter View replies 8:30 pm · 20 May 2025 344 Reply Copy link Read 22 replies This is how iExec intends on lowering the barrier for Web2 and enterprise developers to leverage a decentralized infrastructure by making token usage invisible yet integral to every app run. Importantly, the voucher system is tiered to support both newcomers and production-grade deployments. The first tier, called BUILD vouchers, is tailored for experimentation and onboarding. New builders can obtain BUILD vouchers at no cost, giving them a sandbox to test and develop applications on iExec without an upfront token commitment. Moreover, this free tier encourages devs to play with iExec’s tools and confidential computing environment (powered by Trusted Execution Environments, or TEEs) early on. Once projects move to real-world usage, they can transition to using EARN vouchers. The EARN tier is designed for production apps that require private, secure execution in iExec’s TEE-enabled network. By loading $RLC into EARN vouchers, developers can get predictable pricing and access to the network’s privacy-preserving computing power, while iExec handles the crypto transactions under the hood. Planting the roots for a new revenue-sharing model Perhaps the most transformative aspect of iExec’s tokenomics overhaul is the revenue-sharing loop unlocked by the voucher system. In traditional cloud platforms, spending tokens or credits is a one-way street, i.e. once an individual pays for a service, their value is gone. iExec’s approach differs from this insofar that when developers spend their $RLC (in the form of vouchers) to run their dApps, those tokens don’t just vanish. Instead, the spent $RLC is channeled back into the ecosystem, where it is redistributed as rewards to the people who make the ecosystem thrive. iExec RLC @iEx_ec · Follow Tokenomics Announcement 3: $RLC Revenue SharingBuilders use RLC. Users engage with apps. Revenue flows back through the ecosystem.This is how a circular token economy is built. Watch on Twitter View replies 8:30 pm · 21 May 2025 243 Reply Copy link Read 16 replies Both the builders and the end-users get a share of the value based on actual usage and engagement. In other words, the more an application is used, the more its developer can earn in RLC rewards, and users might be incentivized for their participation as well. This creates a feedback loop of value so that developers are motivated to build useful, privacy-preserving apps, and users are encouraged to use them, knowing their activity contributes to the economy and even rewards them in return. Aligning with a privacy-first future From the outside looking in, one can see that iExec has long been at the forefront of confidential computing and data privacy contributing to initiatives like the Linux Foundation’s Confidential Computing Consortium and pushing the envelope with advanced TEE technologies (including new TDX enclaves beyond Intel SGX). Additionally, recent collaborations with tech giants such as NVIDIA and Intel — alongside a focus on Trusted AI agents — have further indicated that iExec is aligning its token incentives with cutting-edge tech development. Simply put, the company has established a virtuous cycle where $RLC’s worth is defined by its utility in enabling privacy-preserving computing. As the Web3 and tech world watches, iExec’s move to favor “using over holding” could well serve as a template for other projects aiming to build sustainable token economies rooted in real-world use.

The bills were introduced in the Michigan House late Wednesday, joining a growing trend of state-level efforts to define the role of digital assets in public policy and economic frameworks. Michigan House to consider four new crypto-related bills One of them is Rep. Bill Schuette’s (R-MI) House Bill 4510, which seeks to allow Michigan’s state treasurer to invest retirement funds in crypto, as long as they averaged a market cap of at least $250 billion over the previous year and are held via exchange-traded products. The Michigan House introduced four new bills to clarify and promote Bitcoin in the state. Source: Bitcoin Laws The $250 billion threshold effectively limits the eligibility to Bitcoin, which has set a new all-time high amid renewed institutional interest. Assets will have to be held through exchange-traded products issued by registered investment firms, ensuring regulatory oversight, according to HB 4510. The next bill, House Bill 4511, was introduced by Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-MI), and focuses on the federal government’s push for central bank digital currencies. The bill proposes a state-level ban on any licensing, taxation, or restriction of digital asset holdings and prohibits state agencies from advocating for a U.S. CBDC. The other two bills were both introduced by Rep. Mike McFall (D-MI) as companion bills, HB 4512 and HB 4513, focused on Bitcoin mining and tax reform. One seeks the establishment of a “Bitcoin Program” that will allow private firms to plug abandoned oil or gas wells in exchange for temporary rights to mine Bitcoin using residual fuel sources. The other offer links crypto directly to remediation efforts as it affects income and corporate tax deductions for revenue earned through such mining efforts. If approved, the program would be administered by the state’s Supervisor of Wells, who would maintain a public registry of eligible well sites, solicit annual bids, and ensure that participating miners carry financial responsibility for site restoration. Michigan’s legislative push occurs as several U.S. states race to either welcome or restrict crypto adoption. American states are warming up to cryptocurrency ideals The four new bills are proof that Michigan is on the pro-crypto side, making similar legislative efforts as states like New Hampshire, Arizona, and Kentucky, where laws have been passed or proposed to legalize Bitcoin reserves, protect self-custody rights, or incentivize crypto mining. For example, New Hampshire became the first state to approve a Bitcoin reserve in 2025. Kentucky’s 2025 Blockchain Digital Asset Act legalized crypto mining with incentives. Also, some hours earlier, the Texas House passed a bill to create a state-managed Bitcoin reserve and sent it to Governor Greg Abbott’s desk. According to reports, the bill would allow the state comptroller to invest in any digital asset with a market cap above $500 billion, a criterion that only Bitcoin matches at the moment. New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte also signed a similar bill into law earlier this month, confirming her state as the first in the country to formally authorize crypto and precious metal investments for public funds. The new Michigan bills are a step in the right direction, but even though they’ve been introduced, these bills have a long way to go before they become law. They have to pass through committee reviews, House votes, Senate approval, and the governor’s signature. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for bills to be rejected. States, like Florida and Pennsylvania, have seen similar crypto-oriented bills fail to garner enough support.

Brandt, who boasts over four decades of trading experience, suggested that the current formation could see the leading cryptocurrency trading at $125,000, or even $150,000, this August, according to his X post on May 21. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Peter Brandt His analysis highlighted Bitcoin’s breakout from a bull flag pattern after retesting the $102,400 level. The asset also recently confirmed an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the weekly chart, strengthening the long-term bullish case. Previous consolidation patterns, like a symmetrical triangle and double-top retest, have also resolved upward. With a steady trend of higher highs and higher lows, Bitcoin has entered record territory, which Brandt sees as a natural progression in an ongoing bull cycle rather than isolated technical events. Bitcoin golden cross formation Other technical indicators support Bitcoin’s potential surge to new highs, adding to the bullish outlook. Notably, the digital currency is approaching its first golden cross since October, a technical event in which the 50-day moving average ( MA ) crosses above the 200-day MA. Historically, this pattern has signaled the beginning of powerful uptrends for Bitcoin. To illustrate, the last time a golden cross formed, BTC surged 46% in just two months. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Barchart Overall, Bitcoin’s current rally is driven by strong positive momentum in the broader market, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and rising institutional interest. Despite declining U.S. stock markets, this latest uptrend has emerged, marking a rare divergence from Bitcoin’s typical correlation with equities. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $110,900, gaining nearly 4% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, the asset has posted gains of over 7%.

According to a May 21 report from state-owned broadcaster PTV, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the move is part of a broader push to modernise Pakistan’s financial system and position the country as a serious player in the digital economy. What is the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority? The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) is a newly approved regulatory body that will oversee the country’s blockchain-based financial infrastructure and digital asset ecosystem. Its mandate includes licensing, compliance, and innovation across platforms dealing with crypto and tokenized services . The PDAA will supervise entities such as cryptocurrency exchanges, custodians, digital wallets, stablecoins, and decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols, and is designed to streamline oversight under a single, agile framework tailored for digital finance. Beyond regulation, the authority is expected to play a key role in tokenizing national assets and government debt. Officials say this could open new channels for economic participation and transparency. The agency will also focus on monetising Pakistan’s surplus electricity through regulated Bitcoin mining. Regulators have already begun talks with various industry stakeholders to explore competitive energy pricing for the sector without subsidies. Among other duties, the PDAA will support Web3 startups and developers by providing legal clarity and an innovation-friendly environment. With over 60% of Pakistan’s population under 30, the country’s youth-driven tech-savvy talent is seen as a strategic advantage. According to Finance Minister Aurangzeb, the PDAA is central to Pakistan’s strategy, which seeks to balance innovation with consumer protection. “Pakistan must regulate not just to catch up — but to lead,” he said, adding that the goal is to invite global investment while ensuring FATF-compliant oversight. Pakistan softens crypto stance Under the previous administration, Pakistan took a hardline approach to crypto. In 2023, then Finance Minister Aisha Ghaus Pasha made it clear that the country had no intention of legalising digital assets, citing FATF concerns and the risks of regulatory evasion. Meanwhile, regulatory bodies like the State Bank of Pakistan reinforced that stance, repeatedly warning against crypto use and classifying assets like Bitcoin as illegal tender. But over time, that rigid stance began to soften , as grassroots-level adoption grew and policymakers started to explore the sector’s potential. By late 2024, the government proposed key amendments to the SBP Act to allow the central bank to issue digital currency and manage both physical and digital money. It was one of the first real signs that the country was preparing to embrace digital finance in a more structured way. That momentum continued into 2025 with the formation of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), an advisory body launched under the Finance Division to guide policy on digital assets. The PDAA was among the key recommendations put forward by the council. Led by Web3 advocate Bilal Bin Saqib, the PCC has been vocal about the country’s potential to become a hub for blockchain innovation. Commenting on the recent development, Saqib said the effort goes beyond just crypto, framing it as a broader push to reshape Pakistan’s financial future by “expanding access, and creating new export channels through tokenization, digital finance and Web3 innovation.” The post Pakistan sets up Digital Assets Authority to oversee crypto regulation appeared first on Invezz",Crypto|Crypto regulation|Crypto wallets|Pakistan|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-05-22 09:48:38

The crypto and web3 sectors are notorious for their volatility — a byproduct of the industry’s young age and lack of regulatory oversight. Unlike traditional markets, many of these digital assets are not regulated securities, allowing founders and early holders with significant portions of the token supply to liquidate their positions with little restriction. This was starkly illustrated in the recent Mantra ( OM ) crash, where a rapid sell-off by a small number of wallets contributed to a dramatic market collapse and the token lost 90% of its value, erasing $5 billion in minutes. You might also like: AI could’ve predicted—even prevented—the Mantra crash | Opinion Events like these continue a pattern of token sell-offs by large holders, whether founders, early investors, or affiliated market makers, that have disrupted market stability. When large holders offload tokens, it often triggers red flags and panic selling among retail investors—many of whom lack the experience or context to respond rationally. One potential solution is private selling. This is exactly the kind of infrastructure Panther is working to establish, aiming to bring more responsible practices to the forefront of web3, and helping to normalize structured exits and reduce volatility. The exact cause of the collapse remains under investigation, but several factors have been identified:​ Forced liquidations : Mantra’s CEO, John Patrick Mullin, attributed the crash to “reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges,” suggesting that a large OM holder’s collateral was liquidated, leading to a cascade of sell-offs. ​ Token supply concentration : Before the crash, concerns were raised about the concentration of OM tokens, with reports indicating that a small number of wallets held a significant portion. ​ Investor activity : On-chain data revealed that 17 wallets moved approximately 43.6 million OM tokens (worth around $227 million) to exchanges shortly before the crash. Some of these wallets were reportedly linked to major investors like Laser Digital and Shorooq Partners, though both firms have denied involvement in any token sales during this period. ​ Why crashes like these happen While there is no confirmed evidence that the Mantra founding team directly initiated the sell-off, the lack of transparency and concentration of token holdings contributed to speculation and market instability. It’s worth noting that large-scale liquidations may originate from affiliated entities such as market makers, who often receive allocations from core teams or venture investors. There are several reasons behind these types of market events. In some cases, bad actors exploit the system through rug pulls or deliberate market manipulation. However, more commonly, founders and core contributors are simply realizing profits. While this can be unsettling for investors, this volatility is a characteristic of the wider cryptocurrency market. The issue arises when these exits are not managed transparently or responsibly, often triggering panic among holders, especially those who may lack experience and are more vulnerable to market volatility. The difference often lies in how these events are structured. Take Mantra, for instance. When a single individual or entity controls a large portion of the token supply without proper legal or technical safeguards like vesting schedules, it introduces significant sell pressure risk to the market. This concentration of control becomes a red flag for investors. Contrast that with Binance’s approach to Binance coin ( BNB ). While the founding team also held a significant allocation, the process was handled with structured vesting and supply controls, allowing for a healthier ecosystem and long-term growth. That said, there’s a delicate balance. Overly restrictive vesting or regulatory frameworks can deter early contributors and investors from launching new ventures. If the path to realizing returns is blocked entirely, the broader industry risks stagnation. Traditional finance—A stark difference In traditional equity markets, such as those governed by the Nasdaq, NYSE, or London Stock Exchange, insider activity is subject to strict oversight. Major shareholders and company insiders are legally required to disclose any significant sales or changes in ownership, regardless of the transaction size. These disclosures are part of a broader compliance framework designed to protect investors. Public companies often spend tens of millions annually on regulatory filings, audits, and transparency measures—costs incurred specifically to ensure accountability and mitigate the risk of insider manipulation. Without such safeguards, market participants would be exposed to unchecked selloffs and price manipulation by those with privileged information. In contrast, the lack of standardized regulatory enforcement in many crypto markets allows insiders to operate with far fewer restrictions, increasing risk for everyday token holders. While the crypto space has democratized token issuance and fostered rapid innovation, it has also enabled scenarios where individuals and teams can issue tokens with minimal governance or compliance obligations. While this drastically lowers the barrier to entry and fuels rapid innovation, it also introduces risk for token holders. Without enforced disclosure requirements, vesting mechanisms, or accountability standards, insiders can offload large portions of their holdings without warning, often leaving retail participants exposed to abrupt market shocks. Privacy swap—How to find that balance One emerging concept in Panther’s architecture is the idea of Privacy-Preserving Swaps in entity-managed trading zones. These are envisioned as environments where regulated entities (such as virtual assets service providers) could facilitate DeFi transactions while leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactional data, without exposing sensitive transaction data. For instance, ownership concentration risks could be mitigated through auditable privacy frameworks that confirm vesting compliance or sell limits without revealing wallet identities. When stakeholders fear large, undisclosed liquidations, a privacy-compliant system could support structured transparency, alerting the market while preserving privacy, and reducing the risk of panic-induced volatility.

Additionally, Kaito Yappers will get 0.2% of the supply through Kaito-hosted campaigns. Most airdrop rewards will be fully unlocked at TGE, except for institutional LPs and ecosystem partners, whose rewards will follow a vesting schedule, with 1/3 unlocking at TGE and the rest over the next six months. In terms of tokenomics , 31% of the total supply is allocated to support liquidity and ecosystem development, 20.6% is reserved for investors, 19.3% goes to the Huma team and advisors, and 11.1% is held in the protocol treasury. Tokens allocated to the team and investors will remain locked for the first 12 months, after which they’ll vest gradually over a three-year period. As for LP and ecosystem rewards, these will reduce by 7% every quarter, though the rate can be changed through governance depending on the project’s growth and strategy. What is Huma Finance? Huma Finance is a Web3 protocol aiming to bring real-world assets (RWAs), such as invoices, payroll, and subscription payments, onto the blockchain. The project focuses on developing a decentralized credit infrastructure known as PayFi, designed to provide financing options based on future income streams. Rather than relying solely on crypto collateral, Huma enables the tokenization of real income, offering a mechanism for businesses and individuals to access upfront capital against future payments. This approach supports a range of use cases, including income-based lending and subscription financing. The network is powered by the HUMA token, which serves functions across governance, reward distribution, and transaction processing within its ecosystem. The token is also central to the protocol’s incentive mechanisms, including staking and airdrops. In 2025, Huma Finance secured $38 million in funding from investors including Circle, HashKey Capital, and the Stellar Development Foundation. The project has also received backing from executives and contributors associated with firms such as Solana Foundation and Distributed Global.

Many crypto investors in Singapore are locking in gains and rebalancing their portfolios instead of jumping into the recent market rally, according to the 2025 Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index. The survey found that 49% of Singaporean crypto investors had sold part or all of their holdings in the past year, and of those, 67% had made a profit. Lasanka Perera, CEO of Independent Reserve Singapore, said the data from this year’s IRCI indicated not a retreat from crypto “but a recalibration.” Crypto ownership dropped to 29% from 40% in 2024, despite rising awareness and prices. Still, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) remain the most held assets, at 68% and 48%, respectively. Investors appear more selective, with 65% holding only two to five cryptocurrencies. “Singaporeans now have a more thoughtful, disciplined approach to investing in crypto. They have been making smart plays and know that being in the right asset class matters. It’s been exciting to witness the market becoming more informed and mature when it comes to digital assets.” Lasanka Perera You might also like: Franklin Templeton gets regulatory approval to launch a tokenized fund in Singapore One in five Singaporeans invests in crypto, compared to nearly half in stocks or fixed deposits, the data shows. The shift comes amid global uncertainty and a rising preference for safer options. Many are putting more money in savings, with 49% favoring cash or fixed deposits, up from 42% last year. Confidence among existing crypto holders still remains strong. Over half — around 53% — said they are likely to buy more within the next 12 months. At the same time, public awareness reached 94%, though trust still depends on stronger rules and company conduct, per the survey. In early April, a survey by crypto payment firm Triple-A found that more than half of Singapore holders are using digital assets for payments. Among these holders, around 52% said they have used crypto to pay for goods and services, while 67% said they plan to use it more often in future.

SOL/USDT up against major resistance barrier Source: TradingView For the SOL/USDT pair, it can be seen that the $SOL price is now right up against the first of a band of very strong resistances. With the Stochastic RSI indicators on the weekly approaching the top of their trajectory, $SOL bulls have to take this chance to pierce through this daunting barrier. If they can do so, the next target would be the $202 resistance. What $SOL bulls want, isn’t for the Stochastic RSI indicators to just cross over and turn down, but to stay at the top for an extended period of time, just as was the case for a 7-week period in Q4 of 2023. Price momentum soon to pass from $ETH to $SOL Source: TradingView Against $ETH (SOL/ETH) the $SOL price has been under the cosh for the last month, as $ETH went into an extended surge against USDT. That said, if one looks at the SOL/ETH chart it can be noted that this was likely just a corrective impulse. As long as $SOL can stay above the ascending trendline, and the strong support levels below, the tables could start to turn in $SOL’s favour soon. The Stochastic RSI in the weekly time frame has the indicators still heading downward, but they could hit bottom in the next couple of weeks or so, and then turn back up to pass price momentum back to $SOL. $SOL has much to do against $BTC Source: TradingView Against its $BTC pair (SOL/BTC), $SOL has a lot to do. After falling out of the big triangle SOL/BTC found itself below two major horizontal resistance levels. $SOL is battling against the first one without success so far, and time is running short with the Stochastic RSI indicators starting to approach the top. If $SOL could break the resistances, get back into the triangle, and break out of the top, this would be a wondrous sequence of events for the $SOL bulls. As it stands, this is not looking likely. Huge price momentum needs to come in for $SOL and it needs to arrive soon. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin Hits $112K, Ethereum Price Jumps 5.5% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin smashed through the $110,000 mark for the first time, pushing even higher toward $112,000 in early trading. Ether joined the rally, jumping 5.5%, as optimism spreads across the crypto market. The overall sentiment is clearly bullish, with rising institutional interest , regulatory progress, and geopolitical uncertainty acting as fuel for this impressive rally. Meanwhile, global markets, especially in Asia, are feeling the pressure from rising US bond yields and political risks, keeping all eyes on Washington as key economic data rolls in. Crypto Market 24H Overview! $BTC is on a strong rally, trading at $110,707.60 with solid daily growth of +3.72% $ETH is holding steady at $2,616.98, gaining +2.23% and slowly increasing its market dominance. pic.twitter.com/7ERU6d1d4o — Crypto.Andy (@oksandy_d) May 22, 2025 Bitcoin Bull Run : BTC Price Bounces Back Strong Bitcoin has surged over 30% from its April low near $74,000, which came right after Trump’s “ Liberation Day” tariff announcement . The recent rebound gained momentum following a May 12 U.S.-China trade deal that paused most tariffs for 90 days. Meanwhile, poor U.S. bond auctions and falling stock indexes pushed investors toward alternative assets like Bitcoin, reinforcing its role as a hedge. According to Santiment , Bitcoin reached a fresh milestone at $109,500, beating its previous high set on Trump’s inauguration day. Institutional players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest have poured billions into BTC, with BlackRock’s spot ETF IBIT now holding over $20B. Because many retail traders remained cautious, the market avoided excessive hype, giving Bitcoin a clean runway to soar. Santiment also warned that the brief surge in FOMO around $109.5K might cause a short-term dip. However, if the excitement cools quickly, Bitcoin could still aim for $115K–$120K soon. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : What is Bitcoin Pizza Day? Two Papa John’s Pizzas, 10,000 BTC, and a Billion-Dollar Lesson , Why is Bitcoin Price Up Today? BTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler says the rally is being driven by better infrastructure for institutions and improving regulatory clarity. That’s reflected in major legislative moves like the GENIUS Act , which just passed a procedural vote in the U.S. Senate. The bill sets clear rules for stablecoins, helping legitimize them in the eyes of big investors. Andrei Grachev from DWF Labs called it a turning point, noting it could help stablecoins move from being a crypto “experiment” to a global standard for digital money. Texas Takes a Bold Step Meanwhile, Texas is making headlines with the passage of SB 21, a bill to create a state-managed Bitcoin reserve. It passed the Texas House in a strong 101–42 vote and is now waiting for Governor Abbott’s signature. With a GDP of $2.7 trillion, Texas could soon become the second U.S. state, after New Hampshire, to officially hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset, an idea that once seemed radical but now feels forward-thinking. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In addition to the token purchase, World Liberty Financial also called on other crypto projects to adopt USD1 as their primary trading pair, highlighting its role in increasing liquidity and price stability across platforms. BUILDon recently gained initial visibility within the trading community by being listed on Binance Alpha. Following World Liberty Financial’s announcement, the token experienced a significant temporary price increase of over 140%, reflecting increased investor interest and renewed momentum around the project. This move points to a growing trend of institutional interest in niche crypto assets and suggests a broader shift in market dynamics that favors memecoins with strong community and ecosystem support. *This is not investment advice.

44948617,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=30650,1747907895,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,"Supra Introduces Their New AI Oracle Protocol, Making Web3 Smarter and More Secure",https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/supra-introduces-their-new-ai-oracle-protocol-making-web3-smarter-and-more-secure/,"Zug, Switzerland, May 22nd, 2025, Chainwire Supra, the first Layer-1 blockchain built for Automatic DeFi (AutoFi) via vertical integration, today announced the debut of its latest innovation: Threshold AI Oracles, a breakthrough protocol that embeds rich data from on-demand AI queries natively on-chain for the first time. Their novel protocol brings intelligence to on-chain applications . This marks a new era of smart contracts with integrated intelligence, powered by real-time AI reasoning along with cryptographic proof, transforming how decentralized applications built on Supra will be able to interact with the real world. Oracles are the lifeblood of decentralized applications, but until now they’ve been limited to price feeds and raw data pipes. Supra’s Threshold AI Oracles introduce multi-agent AI committees that can reason, deliberate, and deliver cryptographically verifiable insights to smart contracts on-chain. This is a groundbreaking shift in the kind of data and information that dApps can access, bringing the fast-evolving world of AI-based queries to dApps securely, verifiably, and in a trustless manner. “Bringing intelligence on-chain is the natural next step for both AI and blockchain,” said Joshua Tobkin, CEO and Co-Founder of Supra. “Threshold AI Oracles will bring active reasoning and all kinds of rich information to dApps on Supra, way beyond just price feed data, while ensuring that every piece of data driving their smart contracts has been validated for security.” This evolution in AI and blockchain oracles opens up a world of new possibilities for dApps on Supra, unlocked by three novel capabilities: Context-Aware Reasoning: Unlike legacy oracles that stream raw inputs, Threshold AI Oracles deliberate over questions like “Did this regulatory change really occur?” or “Should this liquidation execute given the current market sentiment?” The threshold AI oracle protocol can query and return a consensus-based, verifiable response to such complex questions on-chain. Verifiable AI Logic: Each AI query response comes with a compact, threshold BLS signature, providing cryptographic proof that a quorum of AI agents reached the decision, verifiable in milliseconds, and trustless at scale. Just-in-Time Execution: These AI agents operate on-demand, only activating when a smart contract explicitly queries them or when a condition is met. This prevents gas bloating or wasted computation, resulting in lean and intelligent responsiveness. New Class of Intelligent On-Chain Applications From DeFi and DAOs to prediction markets and real-world event triggers, Supra’s Threshold AI Oracles open doors for a richer category of intelligent dApps that can now get datasets of complex information on demand natively, with no centralized off-chain intermediaries or unverifiable black-box AI outputs. “Until now, developers had to bolt AI onto crypto applications with off-chain hacks and centralized APIs to tap into this kind of intelligence,” said Jon Jones, CBO and Co-Founder of Supra. “But with Threshold AI Oracles being built into the Supra network, we can bring a new class of intelligence to on-chain applications natively with logic that is on-chain, verifiable, and secure.” This new oracle layer is planned to roll out in three progressive phases in upcoming network upgrades on Supra Layer-1: Phase 1, Numerical Judgments: Yes/no verdicts, sentiment numerical scores, and binary validations. Phase 2, Structured Commands: JSON-based automation instructions for DeFi logic and DAO actions. Phase 3, Code-Generating Oracles: Supra’s long-term roadmap includes full generation of smart contract logic, enabling dApps that adapt, evolve, and govern themselves adaptively. As the crypto industry matures and on-chain governance becomes increasingly autonomous, the need for intelligent, verifiable decision-making is now absolutely crucial. Supra’s Threshold AI Oracles address this importance, fusing LLM-powered reasoning with threshold cryptography, bringing intelligence on-chain without compromising decentralization or security . “AI-enabled Oracles are the missing link between data and decision,” added Tobkin. “Supra is proud to bring this to Web3 in a way that is scalable, verifiable, and deeply integrated into our Layer-1.” This protocol adds to Supra’s existing vertically integrated stack of native oracle price feeds, system-level automation and bridgeless cross-chain messaging — all of which are built into the Supra Layer 1 blockchain network. Supra’s distinguished Research Team is proud to have published an elaborate whitepaper on this pioneering technology, which was made available this week for free download and review. Supra invites developers to review and test the Threshold AI Oracle module (coming soon to public testnet) with support materials available through its Developer Hub . With Supra’s Threshold AI Oracles, the next generation of dApps can now reason, react, and evolve on-chain and in realtime. About Supra Supra is the first chain built for Automatic DeFi (AutoFi), a novel self-operating automated financial system that also serves as the perfect framework for crypto AI Agents, built upon its vertically integrated Layer-1 blockchain with built-in high-speed smart contracts, native price oracles, system-level automation and bridgeless cross-chain messaging. Supra’s vertical stack unlocks all-new AutoFi primitives that can generate fair recurring protocol revenue and redistribute it across the ecosystem, reducing reliance on inflationary block rewards entirely over time. This stack equips on-chain AI Agents with all the tools they need to run a wide variety of powerful DeFi workflows for users automatically, autonomously, and securely.

With 636,000 BTC now under management, the world’s largest asset manager sits behind only the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto , who is estimated to hold 1.1 million BTC, according to new data from CryptoRank . The milestone cements BlackRock’s dominance not just in traditional finance, but now in crypto markets as well.

As gold and cash ETFs slip down, the leaderboard is slowly turning back into 2024. pic.twitter.com/pyosSuuptU — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 21, 2025 IBIT has attracted nearly $8.9 billion in net inflows, placing it ahead of long-established funds and signaling strong institutional appetite for crypto exposure. Bitcoin ETFs overall have reached a historic milestone, with total cumulative inflows surpassing $40 billion as of May 2025. Much of that growth has come from institutional investors seeking regulated, liquid, and tax-efficient exposure to Bitcoin, particularly via spot ETFs like BlackRock’s. For many large asset managers, pension funds, and sovereign institutions, ETFs remain the most practical or even the only route to gain exposure to Bitcoin, due to internal compliance restrictions or regulatory mandates. This trend is shifting the Bitcoin ownership structure itself: an increasing share of circulating BTC is being absorbed by ETF issuers, further centralizing holdings among a few major financial players. Notably, the growing institutional presence is contributing to Bitcoin’s evolving narrative from speculative asset to macro hedge and strategic reserve. With Bitcoin currently trading above $100,000, BlackRock’s position represents a powerful vote of confidence in crypto’s long-term viability.

Some of them are gearing up to trigger a strong breakout, but the XRP price appears to remain restrained from the ongoing bullish trend. The price is closely consolidating below the pivotal resistance, which could point towards a breakout, but careful observation hints that the price rally could be restrictive, as suggested by a couple of on-chain data points. The XRP price had been tightly consolidating below $1 for over a couple of years and triggered a massive breakout during Q4 2024. This was when the bulls, retail traders and whales all together pushed the price above $2. Since then, the price has remained consolidated between $2 and $3, failing to keep up with the growing market trends. The massive drop in the active addresses hints towards a sudden decrease in the users’ participation. The drop in the active address hints towards a decrease in the number of traders contacting the network to perform a trade. This also indicates a drop in the volatility, which has kept the levels consolidated and prevented a breakout. On the other hand, Open Interest has also plunged, which was in recovery mode. This suggests the traders are closing the futures positions either to take profits, cut losses or adjust their overall portfolio exposure. Moreover, some on-chain reports suggest the whales have off-loaded over 60 million XRP in the last 72 hours, which raises concern over the short-term price action. Will XRP Price Fail to Reach $3? The XRP price is closely consolidating but the token is accumulating gains between the range of 2018 and 2021 highs. Moreover, it has formed a massive bull flag and hence a breakout from the resistance could push the price into the discovery phase. The rebound from the lows has not triggered a rebound with the RSI levels, which remain consolidated along the average range. This suggests the rally remains within a decisive phase and hence a rise in the RSI could eventually push the XRP price beyond the consolidated range; else a drop could drag the levels to the support close to $2 or slightly lower.",Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 10:02:11

Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469. Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase. Source: Binance Pay, Travala Juan Otero, CEO of Travala, attributed these travel preferences to the flexible nature of Web3 jobs: “Many also work in the digital asset industry or have flexible, remote work lifestyles, which makes them more likely to travel frequently and stay in one place for longer while seeking out destinations that support seamless, global payments.” Crypto-based transactions have become more common in the travel sector and beyond. Airlines that have integrated digital currencies into their booking systems have seen a 40% boost in bookings, with travel and hospitality representing 14% of all crypto transactions in 2024, according to a Feb. 21 report by Triple-A . Related: Crypto spending will grow, but fiat isn’t going anywhere: Mercuryo CEO The main benefit of using crypto for travel is its borderless, global utility, Jonathan Lim, the global head of Binance Pay, told Cointelegraph. “Travelers can skip currency exchange lines, avoid foreign transaction fees, and pay instantly using assets they already hold,” he added. A growing number of crypto users also drives the increase in travelers using crypto to pay for trips. Triple-A’s report shows that cryptocurrency ownership has a compound annual growth rate of 99%, significantly outpacing the growth of traditional payment methods. Among crypto owners, 65% express interest in using it for payments. Founded in 2017, Travala is among the most popular crypto-native travel platforms, which enables users to pay for services like flights, hotel stays and tours with 141 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and USDC ( USDC ) via Binance Pay.

Since then, crypto payments have expanded into high-end retail, luxury goods and more recently, fast food. First real-world purchase using BTC Source: bitcointalk.org The first retail businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments were primarily targeted at high-income consumers. In 2021, fashion brand Philipp Plein became one of the pioneers in accepting crypto, followed by Gucci , luxury watchmakers Franck Muller and Norgain , as well as high-end car dealerships and manufacturers. As the crypto holder base expands, more retailers are beginning to accept digital currencies for everyday transactions. On May 16, American fast food outlet Steak’n Shake began to accept Bitcoin as payment. Yet even with the Lightning Network implementation, a Steak’n Shake customer revealed that a $5 burger could cost over $8 with network fees and take over 20 minutes to confirm payment. Related: Bitcoin accepted at fast food chain Steak ’n Shake from May 16 With Binance Pay, payments are confirmed within seconds. Lim told Cointelegraph that’s because “Binance Pay operates as an offchain, closed-loop payment solution within the Binance ecosystem.” Still, most crypto travel payments on Travala are made using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) and Cricle’s USDC ( USDC ). Binance Pay transactions are ultimately converted into fiat at the point of sale by the merchant or payment partner based on a predetermined exchange rate.

The current historic surge in Japanese bond yields is threatening to blow up the exact strategy Warren used to justify his billion-dollar bets on Japan’s five major trading houses. While global investors are flooding into crypto and banking record profits, Warren is doing the exact opposite—selling off his only crypto exposure and doubling down on a play that’s now bleeding from all sides. Warren raised ¥281.8 billion in October 2024, then followed up with a much smaller ¥90 billion in April 2025 through yen-denominated bonds. Those funds were used to build positions close to 10% in Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, Marubeni, and Sumitomo. It worked at first. Borrow at 0.5% interest, buy stocks paying ~5% in dividends. Easy cash. But now, as Japan’s bond yields rise fast, that carry trade strategy is getting torched. New bond issues cost more. The interest spread shrinks. The profit vanishes. Japanese stocks drop as yields kill equity valuations Shares of the five trading houses aren’t holding up either. In 2025 alone, Mitsui’s down 20%, Itochu has lost 16%, and the rest are sliding. Higher yields usually signal tighter policy, and tighter policy kills equity valuations—especially ones built on stable dividends. Berkshire’s portfolio in Japan is loaded with those. The damage gets worse when you factor in the trade tensions triggered by Donald Trump’s latest tariffs, which rattled Japanese markets earlier this year and forced companies like Asahi and Suntory to walk away from bond deals completely. Berkshire didn’t back out, but the ¥90 billion bond it issued this April was the company’s smallest ever. That’s not a flex. That’s caution. The situation’s turning so fast that the same assets Warren called “long-term holdings” are now dipping below what he paid. And while he’s always claimed to like cheap stocks, these ones might get cheaper than he’s willing to admit. Currency swings and bond pressure weaken Berkshire’s hedge There’s another issue Berkshire can’t dodge: the yen. The company’s bonds and dividends are all yen-based, which was supposed to act as a hedge. If the yen dropped, Berkshire’s debt would be easier to repay. That hedge only works when the yen stays weak. But in July 2024, when the Bank of Japan surprised markets with a rate hike, the yen got stronger, fast. If yields keep going up, the yen could climb again. That turns the hedge against Warren. It slashes the dollar value of dividends, hurts returns, and messes with the company’s ability to balance its foreign books. Still, despite the rising risks, Warren’s been stubborn. He hasn’t sold his Japanese positions. He hasn’t moved away from the bond strategy. And he sure ain’t touching Bitcoin, which just set back-to-back all-time highs this week. That’s after Berkshire dumped its entire stake in Nu Holdings, the Brazilian fintech firm behind crypto-friendly Nubank. Bitcoin explodes after Warren exits Nubank and ditches crypto Warren’s firm closed out of Nubank in Q1 2025, walking away with $250 million in profit. That move officially ended Berkshire’s one and only link to crypto. While Warren was cashing out, Bitcoin surged to $109,800, then jumped again to $111,762 on Wednesday, fueled by renewed institutional interest and support for the GENIUS Act in the Senate. That bill lays out new rules for stablecoins and has been a major boost for confidence in the space. Traders also took advantage of the momentum, with over $900 million in short positions liquidated, based on data from CoinGlass. Ethereum, XRP, and Solana all followed Bitcoin’s lead, climbing as the crypto market roared. Meanwhile, Berkshire boosted its cash pile to $347.8 billion, mostly held in US Treasurys, after also unloading shares of Citigroup and Bank of America. Warren once called Bitcoin “rat poison squared,” and it doesn’t look like his opinion has evolved. Despite the rally, despite the regulation, despite even Jamie Dimon, longtime Bitcoin skeptic and JPMorgan CEO, telling clients they can now buy the coin through the bank, Warren hasn’t budged. At Berkshire’s latest shareholder meeting, an attendee named Jackie Han asked about the company’s take on real estate. Warren laughed and said if he had to pick between real estate and stocks for life, he’d go with stocks every time. “There’s just so much more opportunity, at least in the United States, that presents itself in the security market than in real estate,” Warren said.",OP-ED|Berkshire Hathaway|BoJ|BTC|JPY|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-22 10:02:14

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-forms-first-ever-golden-cross-against-bitcoin-heres-the-significance/,"XRP has recorded a key technical milestone by forming its first-ever golden cross against Bitcoin on the weekly timeframe, a development that analysts are viewing as a strong indicator of long-term strength. This event occurs as XRP continues to display growing momentum both on-chain and in market activity, despite years of subdued performance due to regulatory overhang. A golden cross is defined in technical analysis as the point at which a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, typically interpreted as a potential shift from a bearish to a bullish trend. In this instance, XRP’s 50-week moving average has moved above the 200-week moving average against Bitcoin. It’s the first time this crossover has occurred for the XRP/BTC trading pair, and it suggests a possible reversal in the relative underperformance XRP has experienced since late 2020. Potential Implications for XRP Price Performance This formation is attracting attention because it follows nearly four years of sideways movement in the XRP/BTC ratio, a period during which XRP was largely unable to capitalize on broader market rallies due to its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Now, with more clarity surrounding Ripple’s position and increasing on-chain activity, the market is reassessing XRP’s relative valuation. Some market participants see this technical shift as a sign that XRP may outperform Bitcoin in the coming months, particularly as altcoin markets gradually recover and investors begin rotating capital outside Bitcoin. The move is seen as particularly notable because most altcoins are still trailing Bitcoin in terms of year-to-date performance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Ledger Sees Strong Q1 2025 Growth Accompanying this technical signal is data indicating significant growth in XRP’s network activity. According to Messari’s “State of XRP Ledger Q1 2025” report, XRP’s circulating market capitalization rose by 2% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), contrasting with a combined 22% decline across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, XRP’s market cap surged by 252%, growing from $34.6 billion at the end of Q1 2024. Other key metrics also reflected sustained momentum. Daily active addresses increased by 142% QoQ to reach 134,600. The number of new addresses rose by 12% from the previous quarter, totaling 568,300, a 210% increase from the same period a year ago. Notably, the number of receiver addresses on the XRP Ledger continued to exceed sender addresses for the fourth consecutive quarter, signaling an expanding base of transaction participants. Daily average receiver addresses climbed by 168% to 127,800, while average daily senders grew by 14.5%, reaching 34,300. XRP’s first-ever golden cross against Bitcoin on the weekly chart, coupled with positive growth across its core network metrics, may mark a turning point in its long-term trajectory. As technical indicators and adoption metrics align, investor sentiment toward XRP appears to be improving, potentially positioning the asset for stronger relative performance in the broader crypto market.

The announcement was made via an official notice dated May 21, in which Johnson noted she had fulfilled her term, which officially ended in April. Appointed in March 2022 by then-President Joe Biden, Johnson served as one of the Democratic voices on the panel and played a crucial role in shaping the agency’s approach toward emerging financial technologies, particularly digital assets. During her tenure, Johnson acted as the sponsor of the Market Risk Advisory Committee, a body tasked with addressing novel challenges introduced by decentralized finance (DeFi), cryptocurrencies, and other evolving markets. She emphasized the importance of thoughtful regulatory responses to these rapidly developing sectors, especially as digital assets blur traditional lines between commodities and securities. Johnson’s upcoming departure adds to a growing list of high-level exits at the CFTC. Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Christy Goldsmith Romero have also announced their plans to resign by the end of May. Potential Trump-Driven Overhaul Acting Chair Caroline Pham has hinted at leaving for the private sector if Brian Quintenz—nominated by Donald Trump in February —is confirmed by the Senate as the next agency head. This wave of resignations, coupled with the already-vacant seat left by former Chair Rostin Behnam in February, opens the possibility of a complete leadership reshuffle at the CFTC by 2026. However, under current rules, commissioners may continue to serve past their term until successors are appointed and qualified, provided it occurs before the next congressional session. The delay in the Senate’s confirmation process for Quintenz, who has now waited over three months, further complicates the transition timeline. But if the confirmations align with Trump’s future plans, the CFTC may soon reflect a significantly different regulatory philosophy. Regulatory Uncertainty Amid CFTC Leadership Shifts The CFTC, alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), plays a key role in overseeing the United States’ digital asset market. Yet, industry participants and lawmakers alike have criticized the fragmented approach between the two regulators. Johnson’s departure underscores the need for legislative clarity. Without well-defined jurisdictional boundaries, the U.S. risks regulatory paralysis at a time when the crypto industry is seeking stability and clearer compliance pathways. As Washington navigates this leadership churn, the future of crypto regulation may hinge as much on personnel changes as on policymaking.

SOL soared from $0.52 to $259 in 2021, yielding an incredible 11,672% return on investment. In other news, SHIB saw a phenomenal 88,449,900% return after skyrocketing from $0.0000000001 to $0.00008845. Now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi altcoin, is capturing investor fervor. Its presale, now in phase 5 at $0.03, has raised $9,000,000, with over 500 million tokens sold to 11,000 holders. Could this new crypto coin outshine the best cryptos of yesteryear? Solana’s 2021 Surge In 2021, Solana (SOL) sparked the cryptocurrency market with a tremendous rise. It began at a low of $0.22 and, due to its fast blockchain and expanding DeFi community, reached a peak of $259 by November. This translated to an 11,672% ROI, turning small investments into fortunes. However, SOL’s reliance on technical prowess faced challenges, with network outages tempering enthusiasm. Today, investors wonder if SOL can recapture that explosive momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresh angle, blending utility with presale allure, drawing eyes away from SOL’s past glory. Shiba Inu’s Meme-Fueled Frenzy Shiba Inu (SHIB) defined 2021’s meme coin mania. From a microscopic $0.0000000001, it rocketed to $0.00008845, driven by social media hype and whale activity. This yielded an 88,449,900% ROI, making early adopters millionaires. Yet, SHIB’s lack of utility left it vulnerable to crypto crashes, with prices now languishing below 2021 highs. Investors seeking the next big crypto are pivoting to projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which promises tangible DeFi value over speculative fervor, signaling a shift in what crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is electrifying the crypto market with its phase 5 presale underway at $0.03, a 200% leap from the opening phase’s $0.01. Investors snapping up tokens now face a 16.7% price hike to $0.035 in phase 6, securing a 20% gain from the current $0.025. The project’s tokenomics guarantee a 100% ROI at its $0.06 launch price, with analysts eyeing a $3 post-launch target, promising a 9,900% return. This structured growth fuels FOMO, as phase 5 tokens dwindle rapidly, urging investors to act swiftly. Innovative Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) redefines DeFi with its overcollateralized lending system. Borrowers lock assets like ETH to access funds, ensuring lender security. The platform’s mtTokens, like mtETH, accrue interest, offering passive income. A buy-and-distribute mechanism funnels revenue into repurchasing MUTM tokens, boosting demand. Recently, the team unveiled a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining ranks. This gamified approach sparks investor zeal, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to invest in for 2025. Security and Community Drive Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is bolstering trust by pursuing a CertiK audit for its smart contracts, with updates soon to hit socials. A $100,000 giveaway sweetens the deal, offering ten winners $10,000 in tokens, amplifying presale excitement. Unlike SHIB’s hype-driven spikes, MUTM’s utility-driven model promises stability. Its 11,000 holders reflect surging confidence, with $9,000,000 raised signaling robust demand. As phase 5 nears sell-out, the crypto investment window narrows, making MUTM a prime pick for those eyeing the next crypto to explode. Why MUTM Could Lead in 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands poised to outpace Solana and Shiba Inu’s 2021 triumphs. While SOL and SHIB rode technical and social waves, MUTM blends real-world DeFi utility with presale momentum. Its 100% ROI at launch and potential 9,900% post-launch surge dwarf past altcoin gains. Investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in are flocking to MUTM’s phase 5, wary of missing the cheapest cryptocurrency entry point.

Cynthia Lummis, chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, was abruptly canceled, sending shockwaves through Crypto X. Speculation erupted, with many pointing to Lummis’ son-in-law, Will Cole—a vocal Bitcoin maximalist known for reposting anti-Ripple content—as a potential influence behind the snub, fueling fresh waves of XRP FUD. The timing of this cancelled meeting only fuels the fire as it coincides with the alleged behind-the-scenes negotiation between Circle and Ripple, with the latter attempting to buy the former. Another company interested in buying Circle is Coinbase, a company that gets along with Lummis better, according to observers. Ripple has the money to bid for Circle solely due to dumping XRP. They are trying to buy Circle because stablecoins make the usecase XRP was supposed to fulfil utterly useless. They know this, they've known it for years while they dumped billions of dollars worth of XRP on… https://t.co/qV28WzPzHC — Rex (@R89Capital) May 20, 2025 Ripple critics again alleged that the real reason behind buying Circle is dumping XRP coins in exchange for fiat money. Ripple is an American company behind one of the top five cryptocurrencies, XRP. From the start, Ripple took a path different from the mainstream anti-banking ethos of the crypto community. XRP was supposed to be a cryptocurrency integrated into the traditional banking system. XRP is in control of Ripple. It has high transaction speed and network capacity; however, many doubt that Ripple can be called decentralized. The company was founded by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen. Brad Garlinghouse became CEO in 2016. Possible reasons for meeting cancellation Lummis is hands down one of the most prominent pro-crypto U.S. lawmakers of the 2020s. As the CEO of one of the biggest cryptocurrency brands, Ripple, Garlinghouse believed he would be involved in the high-profile stakes discussion over stablecoin legislation in the US. However, it seems the CEO is being ghosted by the regulatory circle around Lummis, with observers noting that there may be a rift forming between the two. Garlinghouse himself took to X to voice these concerns. Heading to DC to champion sensible pro-crypto legislation around stablecoins and market structure, and I’m very encouraged to see our elected officials look at crypto as it should be – a multichain industry. That said, @SenLummis , as Chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee,… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 19, 2025 There may be many reasons for the cancellation of this meeting. One of the first things that comes to mind is that these days the Senate turned into a battlespace around the Genius Act, a bill aimed to create a framework for the U.S. stablecoin issuers. The bill was blocked by the Senate Democrats earlier this month. Lummis and her colleagues in the Senate were working for two weeks to make amendments to win the Democrats’ vote on May 20, when the Senate voted on the latest iteration of the bill, right after the planned meeting with Garlinghouse.

A lifetime of bashing bitcoin and shilling your pre-mined central bank token has locked you into a zero-credibility prison of your own making. No amount of lobbying will change this, Brad. — Joe Consorti ⚡️ (@JoeConsorti) May 19, 2025 Will Cole’s alleged influence & political tensions This is what @SenLummis son-in-law thinks about XRP. If she has the same views you can understand why she may not want to meet with @bgarlinghouse Imagine the effect on her inner circle and the criticism. https://t.co/luOrOVVCYz pic.twitter.com/Xxg3DDzPYd — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 20, 2025 An avid Bitcoin advocate, Pierre Rochard, derided Garlinghouse’s publication in which the latter informed the public about the sudden cancellation of his meeting with Lummis. The fact that Cole reposted these publications and posts of other people bashing Garlinghouse after the meeting cancellation caught the eye of Ripple supporters, who found out there is a connection between Cole and Lummis. Hey @bgarlinghouse , look into Will Cole who is Senator Lummis’ son-in-law. He’s seen below reposting Pierre’s dig on you. He is Head of Product for a $BTC payments company and hates seeing @Ripple do well. Now we know why Lummis won’t meet with you. Her financial contributors… https://t.co/U59VqCyHfD pic.twitter.com/p4IYFHA6OW — Cowboy.Crypto (@cowboycrypto313) May 19, 2025 Rochard’s criticism of Ripple explains the essence of the problem why many people don’t trust Ripple. Rochard believes that the company is selling its coin XRP all the time to get revenue. It makes him think that Ripple is kind of a centralized fraud company that creates XRP coins out of thin air and sells them in exchange for fiat money. Bitcoin purists voice similar accusations against Ethereum as well. I will continue to speak out against Ripple XRP, it’s not a real blockchain and it’s not decentralized. Brad Garlinghouse has created a Potemkin village to trick retail investors into giving him money. pic.twitter.com/m4VfwgIac4 https://t.co/i3csSrSf4I — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) May 20, 2025 Rochard, just like Donald Trump, has a sharp anti-CBDC stance; thus, he is criticizing Garlinghouse for advocating for CBDCs. The central bank-issued cryptocurrencies are an approach that has become mainstream in Europe. The GOP, however, opposes a digital dollar and prefers stablecoins issued by the companies, as they don’t compromise operational privacy. Read more: Senate crypto bill collapses: Is partisan divide or Trump’s digital fortune to blame? Pierre Rochard himself points to the pro-Democrat sentiment of Ripple’s co-founder Chris Larsen, who donated $10 million worth of XRP to Kamala Harris when she was running for the office. This donation made Larsen the biggest individual sponsor of the Harris. Larsen explained in the X post that he believes Harris will ensure that American technology will dominate the world. Garlinghouse distanced himself from the support for Harris, but emphasized that the Biden-era approach to crypto should be changed for a better one. The fact of the donation became another reason to accuse Ripple of dumping its coins in bulk. https://twitter.com/Hexologist31/status/1848410473575649766 While it is clear why Cole or like-minded people sharply oppose Ripple, it is still not clear why Sen. Lummis should cancel the meeting with Garlinghouse based on her political leanings. While criticism persists, Ripple continues to struggle legally, as on May 15, a judge denied the SEC settlement, which could help Ripple solve its problems. It seems that 2025 is a harder year for Ripple than for many other U.S. crypto giants.

But who is the trader behind this bold move and what other high-stakes plays has he made? More importantly, which coin is he betting on now? James Wynn, who recently placed a $1.1 billion bet on Bitcoin ( BTC ) perps on HyperLiquid , identifies as a “high-risk leverage trader and memecoin maxi” on X. He built this position starting with just a $400K margin about five days ago, steadily increasing his exposure and eventually leveraging 40 times to control the $1.1 bet. He entered the position at an average BTC price of roughly $108K, according to Coinglass . Source: Hyperliquid whatle tracker / 0x507 | Coinglass The trade has since suffered extreme volatility, with the position showing a paper profit of $17 million at one point before swinging into a $15.6 million unrealized loss. Despite this, the position currently holds a profit of approximately $14 million, with Bitcoin trading above $110K. Wynn’s liquidation price sits near $95,805, meaning his position remains safe for now.

The world’s football governing body FIFA is creating its own blockchain on Avalanche , named the FIFA Blockchain, as the latest move in its web3 strategy focused on digital collectibles and fan engagement, starting with hosting its digital collectibles platform, FIFA Collect. In a blog announcement on Thursday, Avalanche said the new platform wil lbe designed to offer “high throughput, low latency, and full governance control.” FIFA said the move is aimed at delivering more scalable and consistent digital products for its global fan base, which spans over five billion people. Amid the news, the price of Avalance ( AVAX ) soared 10.49% to $24.92, per data from crypto.news’ price tracking page.

The announcement follows earlier talks from FIFA’s leaders about digital tokens. In early March, FIFA boss Gianni Infantino told U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House Crypto Summit that FIFA was very interested in developing a FIFA coin to engage the five billion soccer fans worldwide.

Kazakhstan plans to bring crypto exchange operators under formal regulation, with the National Bank tasked with licensing those converting digital assets into fiat. Yerlan Ashykbekov, head of the National Bank’s payment systems department, said during a recent briefing that a new category of participants is being introduced under Kazakhstan’s jurisdiction — providers of cryptocurrency exchange services, operating under a license and supervised by the National Bank. He added that their functionality will include crypto-to-fiat exchange operations, and that the list of cryptocurrencies available for purchase or sale by such organizations will be established by the central bank. According to Ashykbekov, the new legislation will formally define the legal status of crypto exchange operators. He also noted that the National Bank will supervise platform operators responsible for issuing and circulating digital financial assets, including stablecoins.

The bill, which aims to bring regulatory clarity to a $200 billion stablecoin market, has cleared an important procedural hurdle with the support of 15 Democrats , making its passage highly likely. Sacks framed the bill as a long-overdue regulatory fix and a geopolitical and financial inflection point. He argued that by legitimizing dollar-pegged digital assets under federal law, the legislation could dramatically increase global demand for U.S. Treasuries, potentially injecting trillions of dollars into the American financial system. White House crypto czar David Sacks says stablecoin bill will unlock 'trillions' for U.S. Treasury https://t.co/SfOw09ZRAq — CNBC (@CNBC) May 21, 2025 “We already have over $200 billion in stablecoins—it’s just unregulated,” Sacks told CNBC. “If we provide the legal clarity and framework for this, I think we could create trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight.” Generally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act , the bill is the most advanced federal effort to date to establish legal guardrails for stablecoins. If passed, it would authorize the issuance of stablecoins fully backed by U.S. dollars or Treasuries, subject to licensing and reserve requirements under federal oversight. Trump Ties and Political Tension Cloud Stablecoin Bill Momentum While the bill’s technical merits have drawn rare bipartisan support, controversy continues to swirl around potential conflicts of interest. Critics point to the Trump family’s ties to World Liberty Financial , a crypto firm recently launching its stablecoin, USD1, which U.S. Treasuries and fiat reserves reportedly back. The token has secured a $2 billion investment commitment from Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund via Binance, raising questions about whether the administration’s policy initiatives are aligned with private family investments. Sacks, who says he divested $200 million in crypto holdings before joining the administration, declined to comment on whether Trump or his family stands to benefit from the bill’s passage. Trump's AI and Crypto Czar @DavidSacks confirmed he sold all direct crypto holdings before the President’s administration began. #DavidSacks #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/TpZaVpYl1J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 3, 2025 When pressed on the ethics of presidential crypto ventures, he avoided specifics, instead emphasizing the bill’s transformative economic potential. Still, the GENIUS Act’s path to final passage isn’t entirely smooth. Senator Josh Hawley recently added a provision capping credit card late fees amendment that could alienate key financial industry backers and complicate the coalition needed to pass the bill. Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Signal Industry Shift Meanwhile, the broader stablecoin ecosystem is evolving rapidly. Once considered regulatory gray zones, yield-bearing stablecoins are gaining legitimacy under the Trump administration’s regulatory shift. In February, the SEC approved such tokens as “certificates” governed under securities laws rather than banning them. This move opened the door to compliant products offering interest to stablecoin holders, provided they meet disclosure, registration, and investor protection standards. This move is backed by the growing momentum around the stablecoins. Yield-bearing stablecoins surged to $11 billion in circulation from just $1.5 billion at the start of 2024, now accounting for 4.5% of the total stablecoin supply . Stablecoin supply reaches $200B, signaling increased liquidity across exchanges. Historical patterns suggest this could impact $BTC and broader #CryptoMarkets . #Blockchain #Stablecoins https://t.co/uiSRxnoEtz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 31, 2025 Decentralized protocols like Pendle have emerged as primary beneficiaries. Pendle, which allows users to lock in fixed yields or speculate on variable interest rates, currently holds nearly $3 billion in total value locked (TVL) from yield-bearing stablecoins, making up 30% of the sector’s TVL. Stablecoins now represent 83% of Pendle’s total TVLup, up from less than 20% a year ago, while traditional assets like ETH have fallen to under 10%. This shift indicates growing user preference for stablecoin-based yield opportunities at a time when traditional tokens remain volatile and the Federal Reserve maintains high interest rates. While dominant, legacy stablecoins such as USDT and USDC still do not pass on yield to holders. With over $200 billion in circulation and Fed rates hovering at 4.3%, Pendle estimates that stablecoin holders forgo more than $9 billion in annual interest.

If you’re scouting the best opportunities for this month, keep a close eye on Solana (SOL), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and the emerging contender Yeti Ouro (YETIO) . Each brings its own unique energy to the market, whether through technical innovation, community rallies, or groundbreaking GameFi utility. Solana Solana recovered some of its luster in early 2025 as a string of new DeFi protocols joined its lightning-fast network. In May, several more decentralized exchanges launched cross-chain bridges to Solana, facilitating asset transfers from Ethereum and BNB Chain. Credits: CoinmarketCap This new influx of liquidity is driving daily gas fees higher, proof that demand is on the rise. As growth picks up, SOL staking rewards are drawing institutional treasuries seeking yield above Bitcoin. With high-profile NFT drops on Metaplex’s On-Chain Marketplace this month, SOL should deliver a good May, provided the wider crypto market remains strong. Solana price is currently at $168 at time of writing. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu kicked off 2025 relying on nostalgia for its 2021 bull run, but May is showing SHIB’s steady progression toward utility. Shibarium Layer-2 chain, much anticipated, began onboarding DeFi projects in early May, with quicker transactions and stacking rewards for holders connecting assets. This year, the ShibaSwap team issued statements of massive burns , a reversion to monthly token burns on the order of some billion SHIB per burn, much bigger than previous ones. On the community front, Shiba Inu’s social media accounts have begun an influencer-driven NFT art competition, with the winners earning SHIB grants and governance tokens. Shiba Inu price is currently at $0.00001449 . So, as SHIB is growing its uses beyond just meme speculation, retail investors are gazing into their wallets, hoping Shiba Inu can regain some of its former luster more organically. Dogecoin Dogecoin has always been the poster child of pure community devotion, and in May 2025, it’s proving that behind every meme is a resilient network. After a quiet Q1, Dogecoin has improved transaction confirmation speeds and optional transaction privacy layers. Credits: CoinMarketCap It’s a small but very important step that shows DOGE’s core developers are committed to evolving the network. Lastly, institutional experiments with DOGE-settled payments for micro-transactions (like tipping content creators) have gained traction, hinting at a future beyond tweets and TikToks. Dogecoin price is currently at $0.2257 at time of writing. Yeti Ouro Amid these blue-chip stars, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is carving out its own niche, positioning itself as the GameFi alternative that crypto whales quietly accumulate. While SOL, SHIB, and DOGE run for headlines, YETIO’s May calendar is packed with milestones: Yeti Go Development : The long-awaited Play-to-Earn racing game is now in the last few stages of development. Yeti Go pulls you into a fast-paced, visually bold world where every moment is built for impact. Created with the expertise of the studio behind gaming greats like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, it’s more than a game—it’s a cinematic thrill ride. The soundtrack, crafted by audio pros who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists including Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid, gives the experience its pulse, adding emotion and urgency to every scene. Yeti Ouro is rolling out major incentives for its community. All token buyers receive a 20% bonus, with an additional 5% awarded on purchases exceeding $500. Alongside this offer, the project has launched a $100,000 giveaway—five winners will each be awarded $20,000 worth of YETIO tokens. For more information and to enter the raffle, visit the official Yeti Ouro website . YETIO’s combination of high-quality gaming, deflationary tokenomics, and high staking rewards makes it the altcoin to watch. While Solana, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin offer proven track records and community heft, Yeti Ouro promises explosive potential as YetiGo ignites a genuine player base. For investors looking beyond May’s headlines, YETIO presents a fresh, high-upside way to diversify alongside the established meme and DeFi favorites.

Trading volume jumped by 74% in the past 24 hours as traders attempted to position themselves, however the majority of these traders are opting to go short -- or bet on bitcoin moving downwards. Coinalyze data shows that the long/short ratio is at its lowest point since September 2022, which was the midst of crypto winter. This trend began on April 21 as traders aggressively shorted the breakout above $85,000, seemingly under the impression that bitcoin had already formed its cycle high and that any subsequent move would form a double top. However, despite a lack of retail participation , bitcoin continued to grind higher, taking out levels of resistance at $97,000 and $105,000 on its path. The move can be attributed to a number of factors; a recovery in U.S. equities as tariff concerns cooled, a rise in institutional activity on exchanges, like the CME, and crucially a wealth of short positions to squeeze and force prices higher. While these short positions might be considered bearish in terms of market structure, they are actually fanning the flame to the upside as it gives bullish traders areas to target and conduct stop-loss hunts like we saw earlier this week. Shorting an asset's record high is not necessarily a bad strategy; a trader will often opt to enter a short position at a level of resistance, whether that be technical or psychological, and layer stop losses above where the thesis of a short trade would be invalidated. In this case, if a trader shorted $105,000 on each of BTCs three tests of that area, they could have closed their position in profit on three occasions at $102,000, meaning that even if they were stopped out of the trade at $109,000, it would be a profitable week. Alongside the continued rise in short positions we have seen open interest jump disproportionately to BTC. Over the past 24 hours BTC is up 4.8% while open interest is up by 17% despite hundreds of million being liquidated. This indicates that the record high break is driven by leverage and might be less sustainable that the initial drives above $100,000 in December and January. It remains to be seen whether interest in short positions continues to rise if BTC rolls on with its momentous move above $111,000, but there is certainly a minefield of short positions to squeeze if it needs some ammunition.

A filing with the Maine Attorney General’s Office outlines the massive scope of the breach, which happened in late December but was not discovered by Coinbase until earlier this month. The exchange says criminals bribed a small group of overseas customer support agents to copy the data of less than 1% of the firm’s monthly transacting users. Coinbase notes that hacked information includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, masked social security numbers (the last 4 digits only), masked bank-account numbers, some bank account identifiers, government-ID images, account data and limited corporate data. The exchange says impacted customers were notified by email on May 15th. Coinbase learned about the hack after receiving an email earlier this month demanding a $20 million Bitcoin ( BTC ) payoff in exchange for not releasing the illegally obtained info. The company refused to give in to the hackers’ demand and estimates it will pay $180 million to $400 million in remediation costs and voluntary customer reimbursements. In a video posted to the social media platform X, Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong promised the exchange would pay back impacted customers, increase cyberattack defenses and relocate certain overseas customer support operations.

With Bitcoin bulls now eyeing the next target at $120,000, investors are looking for opportunities to activate their Bitcoin capital. Bitcoin Pepe , the first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network gives crypto enthusiasts a chance to rake in hefty gains from Bitcoin’s uptrend and the broader crypto bull run of 2025. With slightly over a week left to the announced CEX listing, it is no wonder investors are rushing to amass some BPEP tokens at the currently affordable price of $0.0359. Bitcoin hits fresh all-time high as market sentiment improves Bitcoin price remains on an uptrend, holding steady above the psychologically crucial zone of $110,000. In fact, as seen on its daily chart, the crypto major formed the bullish three white soldiers pattern; bolstering Bitcoin price to a new all-time high of $111,881 in early Thursday session. The risk-on mood has kept the bulls in control with the crypto fear & greed index rising from the previous session’s greed level of 68 to 69. After a period of consolidation, Bitcoin price has regained the bullish momentum to break the resistance around $106,600. In the short term, I expect Bitcoin price to continue soaring as investors move from the sidelines and buy. The most likely scenario is where it rises to $120,000 by the end of the week.

With the presale slated to end on 31st May, crypto enthusiasts are rushing to amass some BPEP tokens before the price skyrockets. It has become one of the highly talked-about projects in the meme crypto space. In addition to the limited time, confirmation of CEX listing has further bolstered the project’s virality and subsequent FOMO. So far, the project has raised over $10 million, with over $1 million in just a week. As Bitcoin’s market cap remains steady above $2 trillion, investors are looking for opportunities to benefit from the uptrend and the broader crypto bull run of 2025. Being the first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe is an ideal investment opportunity. What’s more, with its robust growth potential, its current token price of $0.0359 will likely be the lowest it will ever get to moving forward. Ripple price defies upside limit as XRP ETFs launch XRP price chart | Source: TradingView For more than a week now, Ripple price has been under pressure as the market processes the recent rejection of the joint agreement request by Ripple Labs and SEC. However, with the improved risk-on mood and launch of XRP futures ETF, the altcoin rallied to a one-week high in early Thursday session. Data from CoinMarketCap showed a price increase of 2.61% over the past 24 hours. Besides, its trading volume has surged by 45.56%. An increase in trading volume usually signals heightened investor interest. A look at its four-hour price chart shows the 25 and 50-day EMAs converging at the support zone of $2.3865. In the near term, I expect the altcoin to hold steady above that zone with $2.4550 being the resistance level to beat. Beyond that zone, the bulls will have cleared their path to the psychologically crucial level of $2.5000. The bulls remain in control for as long as Ripple price continues to trade above $2.3434.

Source: DeBank Trader loses out on $2.67 million gain With ETH up over 70% since the sale, the trader lost out on over 1,000 ETH, or roughly $2.67 million, in the process of buying back in. If the trader had decided to hold on to their Ether, the assets would be worth about $6.7 million. As ETH rallied, the asset surpassed the market capitalization of big companies like Coca-Cola and Alibaba. At the time of writing, company data tracker 8marketcap shows that Ether’s $321 billion market capitalization makes it the 38th most-valuable asset in the world, surpassing the pharmaceutical company AbbVie and inching closer to the Bank of America. Ether’s upswing was largely fueled by the successful launch of its Pectra upgrade . The update improved the network’s scalability, validator user experience and smart-wallet functionality. These updates are expected to drive broader adoption of the Ethereum mainnet.

A May 19 report from digital asset manager CoinShares revealed that US crypto investment products saw $785 million in inflows last week. This development pushes the year-to-date (YTD) total for crypto ETPs to $7.5 billion. ETH was the top performer among the crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), attracting $205 million in inflows last week. This represented 26% of all the inflows within the time period. This also brought ETH’s YTD total to over $575 million. The CoinShares report attributed the increased inflows to renewed investor optimism following the Pectra upgrade and also the Ethereum Foundation’s appointment of Tomasz Stańczak as a co-executive director.

The city’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) has issued updated rules that now officially allow issuing and listing RWA tokens on secondary markets, a move that legal experts say could finally turn the long-hyped idea into a working market model. Regulatory update from Dubai's VARA The Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority has released Version 2.0 of its Rulebooks — tightening rules on margin trading, token distribution, and collateral wallet arrangements Compliance deadline: June 19 #Dubai #VARA pic.twitter.com/7tcSM1xVLG — TheNewsCrypto (@The_NewsCrypto) May 19, 2025 Dubai’s ARVA Framework Explained The newly updated Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook , released on May 19, sets a clear legal path for tokenizing real-world assets like real estate, bonds, and other physical investments. Issuers and platforms now have until June 19 to fully comply with these changes. According to Irina Heaver, a UAE-based crypto lawyer, these updates mark a key shift as issuing real-world asset tokens and listing them on secondary markets is no longer theoretical, it has become a regulatory reality in Dubai and the broader UAE market. From STO Failures to RWA Success Heaver compared RWAs to security token offerings (STOs), which tried to tokenize traditional securities but failed back in 2018–2019 due to a lack of regulatory clarity and trading infrastructure. This time, she believes Dubai is solving those issues upfront. RWAs in Dubai will be regulated as Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA), and exchanges are now legally allowed to list and trade these tokens. Unlike in other jurisdictions like Switzerland, where tokens can be issued but secondary trading remains murky, Dubai offers both issuance and trading under a well-defined regulatory umbrella. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Launches Digital Asset Authority to Regulate Crypto, Targeting $25B Market , License and Capital Requirements To launch an ARVA token in Dubai, issuers must hold a Category 1 license, prepare a detailed white paper, and publish a risk disclosure statement. They also need to meet capital requirements, either 1.5 million AED (~$408,000) or 2% of reserve assets, and undergo monthly independent audits while staying under continuous regulatory supervision. As Heaver puts it, Dubai’s approach is moving tokenization “from theory to execution.” With the legal groundwork in place, the UAE is shaping up to be a global hub for regulated real-world asset tokenization. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This rally has pushed the total crypto market cap to an impressive $3.5 trillion, a 4.5% increase. Meanwhile, daily trading volume has soared to $197.45 billion, marking a sharp 53.67% rise. BTC dominance currently sits at 62.9%, and is expected to fade based on past experiences, and many believe the tide to altseason is about to return. Among the top contenders poised for strong performance are Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Chainlink, and SUI. Top 5 Altcoins to Buy Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum has shown a notable 5.15% gain in the last 24 hours, taking its price to $2662.56. Its run is fueled by a sharp increase in volume to $37.92 billion, a jump of nearly 65%. ETH’s recent rally represents a 50% increase from its pre-Pectra upgrade days, and many analysts expect this upward trend to continue. The price appears poised to break through the $3000 level in the coming weeks. Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Solana (SOL): Solana is once again grabbing the spotlight with a 6.38% price surge since yesterday, taking its price to $178.72. Trading activity has intensified, with daily volume rising by more than 72% to $6.24 billion. Solana’s 2021 bull run performance, where it delivered a 100x return, continues to resonate with investors. With strong community support, an expanding DeFi ecosystem, and high-speed capabilities, SOL could soon reclaim the $200 mark. Technical indicators suggest that price targets of $220 and even $250 are within reach. XRP: XRP price has seen a 4.20% rise in the past 24 hours, changing hands at $2.43 after ranging between $2.34 and $2.45. Volume has also jumped to $4.29 billion, up over 43%. The renewed bullishness around XRP is supported by a surge in open interest, which now sits at $4.69 billion, and the fact that XRP futures are outperforming Ethereum ETFs. On a technical level, the XRP/BTC chart shows bullish RSI divergence, suggesting a potential reversal is near. In a bullish case, XRP could defy odds to hit $3 soon, as seen on the XRP/TetherUS chart. Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink, aka LINK price, is up 6.66% to $16.64 over the past day. Its price was assisted by a volume increase of nearly 63% to $784.63 million. LINK is expected to do good, thanks to its critical role as a decentralized oracle provider, integral for the functionality of DeFi, insurance protocols, gaming platforms, and real-world asset tokenization. Additionally, Chainlink staking has added a compelling incentive for long-term holders, with competitive yields attracting both retail and institutional interest. If LINK can break through resistance at $17.40, a move toward $19.80 is the next technical target. SUI SUI is rising as a standout in the Layer-1 category, posting a strong 8.98% gain over the past 24 hours to reach $4.18. It has traded in the range of $3.84 to $4.19, with volume spiking by nearly 74% to $2.14 billion. Backed by increasing development activity and rising social volume, SUI appears well-positioned for a breakout. Analysts are optimistic about its potential to reclaim its previous high of $5.37 and even eye $11. Also read our SUI Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Is now a good time to invest in altcoins? Yes, with Bitcoin hitting new highs and its market dominance expected to decline, altcoins are likely to outperform in the short to mid-term. When will altseason start? Now that Bitcoin has created a new ATH with a price surge of over 10%, we can expect an altseason once BTC dominance falls below 60%. What altcoins should I buy?

He got indicted on wire fraud, securities fraud, making false statements to a bank, and identity theft. If convicted, Jones faces a maximum of 72 years in prison, though actual sentencing will be decided by a judge. The FBI and SEC have both played key roles in the investigation. However, the commission is also filing a parallel civil action. The case is being handled by the US Attorney’s Securities and Commodities Task Force. FBI and DOJ slam Amalgam Capital executive Jordan-Jones ran Amalgam Capital Ventures, a startup that he claimed was building cutting-edge point-of-sale and blockchain payment tech. He went on to boast about “big league” partnerships and breakthrough blockchain products, but prosecutors say the whole thing was a sham. He even showed off mockups of functioning software and claimed the firm was preparing to list a native token on global exchanges. The DOJ says Amalgam had no working products, zero real partnerships, and barely any customers. Meanwhile, Jordan-Jones was faking bank statements and submitting phony financials to secure investments and loans. The indictment alleges that Jones used investor money to bankroll his personal lifestyle, leaving backers with empty wallets and zero returns. By late 2022, Amalgam folded, and investors were left holding the bag. He is now facing multiple federal charges, including aggravated identity theft, which is a serious count that carries a mandatory 2-year prison term on top of any other sentence. Clayton calls out tech-driven frauds The release stated that investors’ funds were siphoned off to bankroll Jones’s lavish lifestyle. US Attorney Jay Clayton summed it up and stated that, “This should be an example to would-be financial fraudsters that the women and men of the Southern District and the FBI are watching and to the investing public that fraudsters often use the promise of new technology to cloak their schemes.” Clayton has served as the US SEC chairman from May 2017 to December 2020. During his time, the commission brought over 2,300 enforcement actions. This resulted in over $10 billion in fines while returning more than $3 billion to harmed investors. Clayton led the SEC when it sued Ripple Labs in December 2020. Recently, Ripple announced that the watchdog has dropped its lawsuit against the company. As the crypto scams make their way through the investing public, the FBI’s annual report revealed that the IC3 received more than 140k complaints referencing cryptocurrency in 2024, which has resulted in around $9.3 billion in losses. Amid all the frauds and scams, the global digital assets market has hit the $3.5 trillion cap. The biggest crypto, Bitcoin , went on to register its new all-time high of $111,800 on Thursday.

IBIT attracted $8.9 billion in inflows year-to-date, surpassing many established ETFs and highlighting growing mainstream acceptance of bitcoin exposure. There are concerns to consider, however, with signs of exhaustion in Bitcoin's weekly chart as well as a lack of demand for the other BTC ETFs in the US. I remain bullish BTC and by extension IBIT but think the top isn't terribly far away at this point. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hitting a fresh all-time high of $110,000 per coin, capital flows into the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT ) are surging. Despite still personally having an affinity for fundamentals and usage, I've been making the case that Bitcoin's price has been entirely driven by capital flows for awhile. Demand from ETF buyers and from companies like Strategy ( MSTR )( STRF ) is what has been driving the coin's price. Thus, with a new all-time achieved on May 21st, we can look at metrics like net flow, supply, volume, and price moving averages to ascertain whether this is likely the start of a new leg that will take the coin much higher, or if it's more of a sign that we're close to the price top for this cycle. iShares Has Gone 'Full Pac-Man' Credit to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas for the 'full Pac-Man' characterization. What he's referring to is the IBIT ETF chewing up Bitcoin as though it were the vintage video game character eating dots in a maze. As of May 20th, IBIT had experienced $8.9 billion in net flow year to date: ETF Flows YTD (Eric Balchunas/X) That level of capital flow makes IBIT far and away the biggest beneficiary of investment demand relative to all of the other spot Bitcoin ETFs. Not only that, but IBIT has had the 5th largest year to date inflows of all ETFs . IBIT's hoard of BTC is now so large, that the 636k BTC held through IBIT is currently larger than the BTC supply held by the remaining US-based spot ETFs combined: Spot BTC Fund BTC Held USD Value Share of Supply iShares Bitcoin Trust 636,120 $69,798m 3.03% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) 199,840 $21,927m 0.95% Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) 187,870 $20,614m 0.90% ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) 49,166 $5,395m 0.23% Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ( BTC ) 42,718 $4,687m 0.20% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) 38,268 $4,199m 0.18% VanEck Bitcoin Trust ( HODL ) 14,763 $1,620m 0.07% Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ) 8,780 $963m 0.04% CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ) 6,554 $719m 0.03% Franklin Bitcoin ETF ( EZBC ) 5,097 $559m 0.02% WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ( BTCW ) 3,746 $411m 0.02% Sum ex-IBIT 556,802 $61,049m 2.65% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries, as of May 21st IBIT now controls more than 3% of BTC supply and holds more Bitcoin than Strategy. What I find so interesting about the surge in IBIT net flows this year is it is unique to this fund when factoring in the other spot ETFs in the US. Consider the year to date changes in supply held through each product: Fund BTC Balance 5/21/25 1/1/25 YTD Change iShares Bitcoin Trust 636,120 552,168 15.2% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund 199,840 202,800 -1.5% Grayscale Bitcoin Trust 187,870 206,835 -9.2% ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF 49,166 46,729 5.2% Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust 42,718 38,342 11.4% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF 38,268 40,196 -4.8% VanEck Bitcoin Trust 14,763 13,716 7.6% Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF 8,780 8,780 0.0% CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund 6,554 8,846 -25.9% Franklin Bitcoin ETF 5,097 7,567 -32.6% WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund 3,746 3,841 -2.5% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries, as of May 21st The 15% growth in BTC year to date for IBIT is top among all funds and IBIT is one of just four US spot ETFs that has positive BTC-denominated net flow year to date. One of the other funds with positive net flow in 2025 is Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust. However, aggregating net flow totals for both of Grayscale's spot products has the issuer negative year to date as well. The VanEck fund's YTD net flow Is just 1,000 BTC year to date. ARK has done slightly better than that. But the point is, what IBIT is doing is impressive. Can This Continue? One thing that I think is worth paying attention to is the volume surge that took place in IBIT shares during the May 21st session. The fund did just under 99 million shares traded intraday. IBIT Daily Chart (TrendSpider) The chart above shows just three instances of at least 98 million shares traded intraday during green sessions so far this year; today is the third such instance. The prior two instances of green candle volume to this degree happened on days of significant directional pivots. The first such instance happened on January 23rd. IBIT subsequently fell by nearly 28% through the beginning of March. It happened again on April 7th. Much like what we saw in a volatile session for stocks that day, this spike signaled the low and IBIT has rallied more than 45% since. This spike is obviously coming after a large surge in price over a relatively short amount of time. The implication here being any directional price pivot in tandem with this volume surge would actually be to the downside. Taking a more long-term view of Bitcoin, the weekly chart might be exhibiting signs of impending exhaustion as well: BTC Monthly Chart (TrendSpider) I've marked moments where the 8 week MA flips over the 20 week MA with arrows. You can see this just happened for BTC this week (the week of May 19th). The last time it happened was the week of October 14th and the cross preceded a 56% surge over the next 2 months. However, at that time Bitcoin hadn't yet broken resistance and the coin was coming off seven months of sideways action. This time is a bit different. The coin is already working on a 7th consecutive green week and there is an obvious RSI-divergence concern to boot with RSI-14 quickly approaching overbought. Investor Takeaways While I don't think this BTC rally is over quite yet, I'm definitely getting a sense that we may be quickly careening to the peak for this cycle. Based on indicators that I follow, I wouldn't rule out a rally up to $120-125k BTC before we see a deep pullback in the coin. There are a variety of ways one can express that bullish BTC belief. My personal choice is FBTC. But there is no doubt that IBIT is the clear favorite among the spot ETFs in the US market. The fund has a competitive expense ratio, tremendous liquidity, and brand recognition. It also happens to be the outlier fund so far in 2025. Most of the spot ETFs have actually endured BTC-denominated outflow so far this year and IBIT currently controls more BTC supply than the rest of the funds combined. I'm of the view that this rally is getting close to its conclusion for this halving cycle. This coin goes as capital flows go and there is no question IBIT is acting like a BTC sponge - or as Pac-Man if you like that analogy better.",BTC-USD|IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-22 12:00:00

While the event promises VIP access and limited-edition NFTs, many investors are cashing out their holdings, signaling skepticism about the long-term value of Official Trump (TRUMP). FloppyPepe (FPPE) is making waves with AI-fueled creativity, a mission-driven community, wildlife conservation efforts, and a limited-time 80% token bonus. The AI token has already raked in over $1.84 million, with its presale 96% full—early buyers are locking in at just $0.0000002 before the price jumps. Beyond The Hype: How FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Strategy Sets It Apart In The Meme Coin Race While high-rollers flock to be part of the Official Trump (TRUMP) dinner in hopes of political proximity, savvy investors are steering their funds elsewhere, straight into FloppyPepe (FPPE) . This rising meme token is proving that hype alone isn’t enough; it takes smart strategy, global vision, and real momentum to earn serious market attention. Here’s how FloppyPepe (FPPE) is outmaneuvering the competition: Exchange Launches Incoming Uniswap listing is imminent Tier 1 centralized exchanges are on deck Global visibility through CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listings Marketing Goes Global Influencer partnerships across the crypto world KoL alliances to boost credibility Community airdrops and worldwide contests to drive hype FloppyPepe (FPPE) is not playing small—it’s laying a global foundation for meme coin dominance. Most importantly, the project has secured an audit from SolidProof, a stamp of trust that signals seriousness about transparency, investor protection, and long-term impact. Official Trump (TRUMP) Holders Dine With Power, But Bet Against The Coin Ahead of an exclusive dinner with Donald Trump, many top Official Trump (TRUMP) holders who won their seats by buying large amounts of the memecoin have quietly sold or moved their coins, signaling doubts about its long-term value. Despite the promise of a rare NFT reward for holding through the event, nearly half of the attendees, including most VIPs, have offloaded their stakes. One VIP known as Woo seems to have pocketed a $2.5 million gain from their Official Trump (TRUMP), transferring the tokens to Binance, likely gearing up for a sale. While the event positions Official Trump (TRUMP) as a utility token offering access to President Trump himself, investors are cautious. This sell-off highlights how speculative hype may not guarantee lasting investor confidence. Despite growing skepticism surrounding Official Trump (TRUMP), one analyst suggests the memecoin might not be finished just yet. With Trump’s birthday approaching on June 14, they predict a fresh surge could be brewing. Hinting at a possible price upswing to the $20–$25 range as momentum builds toward the celebration. Official Trump (TRUMP) Fades, FloppyPepe (FPPE) Rises With Real AI Tools Official Trump (TRUMP) might grab headlines, but FloppyPepe (FPPE) is stealing the spotlight with real substance. Far from being just another AI-themed meme coin, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is a full-fledged creative powerhouse. Its AI-driven ecosystem empowers users to generate viral content at lightning speed. The Meme-o-Matic turns trending news into share-worthy memes for Telegram users and holders, while FloppyX , its smart video engine, automates editing and delivers punchy clips optimized for meme culture. At the core is FloppyAI — a dynamic dashboard fusing real-time token analytics, trend spotting, and creative tools, all crafted to give the community a viral edge. Get In Or Watch It Fly: FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Window Is Closing Fast FloppyPepe (FPPE) burst onto the crypto scene with its private sale selling out in under 24 hours, raising nearly $1 million and drawing major attention. With its powerful Floppynomics and real-world utility, the AI coin delivers value with a triple-impact model: 1% of every transaction rewards holders with passive income, 1% is burned to boost long-term value, and 1% goes to charity, turning every trade into a purposeful act. Now priced at just $0.0000002 and with an exclusive 80% bonus for early investors using the code FLOPPY80 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) is buzzing. Stage 2 is fast approaching, and once it hits, this window of opportunity could slam shut. Miss it now, and might be watching from the sidelines as the next big breakout leaves the station.

McKinlay reveals a strong link between XRP’s explosive price surge and the recent political shift in the U.S. , following Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Let’s break down the key insights from the report. The report highlights that Trump’s crypto-friendly policy proposals played a significant role in XRP’s 443% rally between November 5 and December 2, 2024 , when the price jumped from $0.50 to $2.72 . By mid-January 2025 , XRP touched a 7-year high of $3.40 , reflecting growing investor confidence after Trump’s promise to: Support innovation in the crypto sector Establish clearer regulations Reduce government interference in digital assets In contrast, Kamala Harris’s stance was less defined, leading to market uncertainty before the election results. Ripple’s Legal Battle Gets Boost After SEC Leadership Change One of the most critical factors behind XRP’s rise, the report notes, is the replacement of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler with Paul S. Atkins , a move widely seen as favorable for the crypto industry. Ripple’s long-running legal dispute with the SEC under Gensler had cast a shadow over XRP for years. The new leadership brought renewed hope for resolution and regulatory clarity, which triggered a bullish rally in the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Doubles Its Bid to $11B to Acquire Circle — But Coinbase Wants In Too! , Bitcoin & Ethereum Also Benefit from Political Shift While XRP was the biggest gainer, Bitcoin and Ethereum also posted notable gains in November 2024: Bitcoin (BTC) rose 37.4% , eventually hitting the $100K milestone Ethereum (ETH) surged 47.4% during the same period The report praises Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake for its reduced energy use, while also criticizing Bitcoin’s centralized mining practices and environmental impact . XRP and the Trump Effect: A Turning Point for Crypto? The report concludes that Trump’s regulatory stance , combined with the SEC reshuffle , created a favorable environment for XRP to thrive. With clearer policy directions and reduced legal risks, XRP attracted significant investor interest.As the U.S. regulatory landscape evolves, XRP’s performance may become a case study in how politics can reshape crypto markets . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” He also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener , showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours. Some tokens, such as Lombard Staked BTC (LBTC) or AXOLcoin (AXOL) lost the near totality of their value on Cetus. The top 15 losers all lost in excess of three-quarters of their price. Cetus DEX-listed asset pricing data. Source: DEX Screener Outside Cetus, LBTC appears to have gained over 4% in value over the last 24% according to CoinMarketCap data . Others, such as Axol (AXOL), have not been as fortunate, with CoinMarketCap data showing a loss of nearly 99.5%. The alleged exploiter’s address contains nearly $52 million of Sui ( SUI ) tokens, $4.9 million of Haedal Staked SUI (HASUI), over $19.5 million of Toilet (TOILET), nearly $19.5 million of wrapped USDt ( USDT ) and many other assets. The official Cetus X profile confirmed that an incident on the protocol was detected, and the smart contract was paused for safety. It added that an investigation is ongoing.

The move has fueled speculation of another major Bitcoin purchase, though no plans were explicitly confirmed. The stock offers a 10% annual dividend and redemption rights tied to tax events or major company changes. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, known for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, has announced plans to raise as much as $2.1 billion through the sale of its 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock. The disclosure was made in a filing dated May 22, 2025, outlining a sales agreement with TD Securities, Barclays Capital, and The Benchmark Company to issue shares on an ongoing basis. The preferred stock, trading under the ticker “STRF” on Nasdaq, closed at $100.65 on May 21. Strategy to Buy More Bitcoin? The capital raise follows a similar structure to Strategy’s previous fundraising rounds, many of which directly funded large-scale Bitcoin purchases. While the filing does not explicitly state that the proceeds will be used to buy Bitcoin, the move has sparked speculation across markets that another major crypto buy may be in the works. The offering allows MicroStrategy to sell shares at market prices or through negotiated deals and block trades. There’s no escrow arrangement — sales will be conducted over time at the company’s discretion. The agents involved are entitled to up to 2% in commission from gross proceeds, and the preferred stock itself carries a 10% annual dividend, paid quarterly in cash if declared by the board. BREAKING: Strategy to sell up to $2.1 billion of 10% preferred stock. pic.twitter.com/80oWuoGg79 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 22, 2025 The latest issuance comes in addition to the 8.5 million shares of the perpetual preferred stock already outstanding. The new shares will carry the same terms, including a $100 liquidation preference and voting rights. Investors are entitled to regular dividends and redemption rights in the event of significant changes, such as tax events or structural shifts in the company’s business. Strategy also retains the right to redeem the preferred stock if the outstanding share count drops below 25% of the total ever issued or if a qualifying tax event occurs. If a “fundamental change” takes place, such as a merger, sale, or delisting, shareholders can require the company to repurchase their shares at face value plus unpaid dividends, per the filing. Strategy Could Become Top Publicly Traded Company in World Jeff Walton, an analyst at Strategy, has said the firm may one day rise to become the top publicly traded company in the world. Walton believes the company’s unprecedented exposure to Bitcoin, which recently crossed $104,000, gives it a unique edge. “Strategy holds more of the best asset and most pristine collateral on the planet than any other company, by multiples,” he said. As reported, Strategy added another 7,390 BTC to its growing Bitcoin treasury, spending $764.9 million during the week of May 12–18 at an average price of $103,498 per coin. T As of May 18, Strategy held a total of 576,230 BTC, acquired at an average cost of $69,726 per coin, totaling $40.18 billion. The company’s Bitcoin-focused strategy has yielded a 16.3% return so far in 2025, supported by Bitcoin’s rally above $104,000.

The rally is being driven by strong capital inflows, particularly from institutional investors. Despite concerns of a pullback, new data suggest that the Bitcoin market is still in a healthy upward phase. Market Calm as Bitcoin Soars According to a report by CryptoQuant, the funding rate, which is commonly used to gauge speculative pressure, shows a recent uptick in long positions, but the scale remains modest when compared to previous market tops. Similarly, data on coins traded within a 1-week to 1-month timeframe, which is often used to assess short-term capital inflows, indicates that current inflows are relatively subdued, especially when measured against the rapid influxes seen during earlier bull runs. Notably, short-term holders have shown little inclination to take profits amid the recent rally. In contrast to the heavy profit-taking that triggered a correction in March 2024 and again in November 2024, current selling pressure remains limited, even among large whale accounts. Additionally, Bitcoin holdings in US-listed spot ETFs have also reached record highs, reflecting strong demand from investors. Overall, CryptoQuant believes that the current rally is being driven by sustainable factors as overheating signals remain relatively muted. Institutions Take the Lead Bitcoin’s latest ATH appears to be structurally different from past retail-driven rallies, according to experts. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Kushal Manupati, Binance’s Regional Growth & Ops Lead of South Asia, also echoed a similar sentiment. “Bitcoin has surged past the $111,000 mark, setting a new all-time high and reinforcing its position as the bellwether of the virtual digital assets revolution. This exponential rally is the result of increasing institutional participation, maturing global regulations, and growing mainstream recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value. From a technological curiosity to a globally held asset, Bitcoin’s rise has been powered by transparency.” Instead of speculative hype, the current uptrend is fueled by disciplined institutional accumulation, Santiment said in its update , while highlighting six consecutive days of ETF inflows and reduced retail FOMO as signs of a maturing market. The standout performer is BlackRock’s spot ETF, IBIT, which now holds over 636,000 BTC, which, interestingly, happens to be more than the next 14 U.S. spot ETFs combined. Institutional giants like Mubadala and Citadel are increasing exposure through IBIT. Meanwhile, corporate buyers like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet continued to ramp up their BTC holdings with more purchases. With Bitcoin gaining over 25% in the past 30 days and nearly 60% year-over-year, Santiment expects the rally could extend to $115K-$120K. Meanwhile, the low retail interest may be contributing to the rally’s stability, creating a clear runway for institutional capital to lead the charge.

That’s a big deal. It means miners had to dip into their reserves, signaling financial pressure across the industry. Despite Bitcoin trading near $111,000 - close to its all-time high - the economics of mining have gotten tougher. The 2024 halving slashed rewards, and rising energy costs have squeezed profits. Many miners took the opportunity to sell while prices were high, helping them stay afloat. This wave of selling added a lot of Bitcoin to the market, boosting trading volumes and triggering short-term price swings. Some traders saw it as a bearish signal, while others - especially institutions - used the sell-off to buy more. ETF inflows stayed strong, showing long-term confidence. Miners are adapting. They’re upgrading to more efficient machines, hunting for cheaper or renewable energy, and even offering services like AI computing. Still, some are being forced to sell more frequently, especially those with older setups or in regions with high costs. What’s next? With fewer new coins entering circulation and more BTC moving to cold storage, supply is tightening. That could help support prices in the long run. But keep an eye on miner reserves, regulation changes, and whether institutions keep buying. Those will be key drivers for Bitcoin going forward.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-22 12:22:10

The price remains above key short-term moving averages, including its 10-day, 30-day, and 60-day moving averages on the 4-hour chart.

This allows the pool to provide accurate pricing, trade execution, and other features based on the external information it receives.

Michael Saylor Says: ‘No One Has Ever Lost Money’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is back in the spotlight, loud and clear. The world’s leading cryptocurrency surged past $111,800 on Thursday, hitting a new all-time high after Treasury yields climbed due to a weak 20-year U.S. bond auction. Just days ago, Bitcoin briefly dropped to $106,000, only to bounce back strongly, breaking its previous peak of $109,200 on Wednesday and touching nearly $112,000. This sharp rally has reignited bullish energy across the market with major players weighing in. Saylor Doubles Down on Bullish View Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), took to X to proclaim, “No one has ever lost money buying Bitcoin.” Crypto influencer Altcoin Daily echoed this , noting that in Bitcoin’s 16-year history, 100% of holders are currently in profit. 100% of Bitcoin holders (in it's 16 year history) are in profit. https://t.co/4ROYGryVfD — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) May 22, 2025 On-chain data from IntoTheBlock backs this up, revealing all 19.89 million BTC in tracked wallets are “in the money,” with profitable holdings valued at a staggering $2.21 trillion.

He noted that XRP is crucial to currency flows on the ledger and will benefit from every transaction.

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Growing Crypto Prominence in Brazil Since the country legalized crypto payments in 2022, Brazil has made significant progress in the market, making significantly more progress than most other countries. Brazil also recently launched the first-ever spot XRP ETF , and these major steps coincide with another major development in Brazil’s digital economy: the launch of the BBRL stablecoin on the XRPL. Announced by Braza Group and Ripple in February 2025, BBRL is designed to strengthen Brazil’s position within South America’s growing digital currency ecosystem. According to Ripple’s official press release, the BBRL stablecoin aims to support cross-border commerce and enhance financial inclusion in the region. XRP as a Bridge Between Currencies The XRPL functions as the backbone for the BBRL stablecoin’s operations. Unlike traditional currency conversion networks, which often require multiple intermediary steps, the XRPL enables direct, efficient value transfers between currencies using XRP as a central bridge asset . As illustrated in the shared Ripple diagram, this simplifies a web of potential bilateral currency exchanges into a simple system where XRP connects each currency. This architecture significantly reduces complexity, latency, and cost in cross-border transactions. XRP’s Role in the New Financial System In this configuration, XRP is an essential layer of the system. Mr Man stated, “BBRL may be the cargo, but XRP is the infrastructure carrying it.” The XRPL routes transfers through XRP, even when both endpoints are stablecoins or fiat-backed tokens. This ensures liquidity, speed, and neutrality, positioning XRP as a non-discretionary component of every transaction within the system.

FIFA has chosen Avalanche for its L1 blockchain Alongside technical advances, Avalanche is making strides in real-world adoption, exemplified by its landmark deal with FIFA. The world’s governing body of soccer has migrated its FIFA Collect NFT platform from Algorand and Polygon to a dedicated Avalanche Layer-1 blockchain. FIFA Collect @FIFACollect · Follow 🚀 Big News: FIFA Collect Has Migrated to the New FIFA Blockchain! 🌍⚽️ FIFA Collect is now live on the newly launched FIFA Blockchain. This move enhances our ability to deliver unique digital collectibles and immersive fan experiences, powered by the speed, scalability, 11:04 AM · May 21, 2025 133 Reply Copy link Read 51 replies This move reflects FIFA’s confidence in Avalanche’s speed, scalability, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, which collectively enable seamless wallet integration and user accessibility. Moreover, this partnership signals a broader trend of institutional and enterprise adoption, which could drive further demand for AVAX and related blockchain services. 4.5 million AVAX burned through fees and staking Avalanche’s tokenomics are also playing a critical role in bolstering investor confidence and long-term sustainability. With over 4.5 million AVAX already burned through fees and staking, the network is demonstrating strong deflationary dynamics. This trend is expected to intensify as new subnets like Beam and Coqnet launch, each requiring validators to stake 2,000 AVAX and burn approximately 1.3 AVAX monthly to remain active. As a result, AVAX is evolving beyond a simple gas token into a foundational economic asset that powers an expanding multichain ecosystem. The increasing demand for staking and transaction validation creates a reflexive pressure on AVAX’s supply, potentially pushing it into full deflationary territory later this year. AVAX price prediction The AVAX token’s price has ranged between $22.45 and $24.80 in the past day, holding strong support at $21 while targeting a bullish breakout above the resistance of $26. Analysts note that recent technical signals, including a bullish engulfing candle following a downtrend breakout, suggest that the momentum could continue upward in the near term. If the price breaks past the resistance at $26, it could rally towards the next resistance level at $34.50, with a further upside towards $40 and beyond if there is continued subnet growth and institutional deals. Avalanche price chart | Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 61.24 supports the bullish case, and there is room for more gains before hitting the overbought region. In the long term, if AvaxFusion adoption scales and more brands follow FIFA’s lead, AVAX could rise to $80 before the end of the year. However, cautious optimism remains prudent as the market digests ongoing developments.

It was a period when network participation — not price speculation — was the primary driver of value accumulation. That phase gave early adopters long-term upside unmatched by nearly any asset class in the decade since. Now, a growing number of analysts are pointing to Bitcoin Solaris as the first credible protocol in years to recreate the mechanics that defined Bitcoin’s early trajectory. The comparison is not aesthetic or thematic. It’s based on structure: fixed supply, decentralized distribution, and real earnings tied to user activity. Mobile Mining Replaces Hardware Dependency Bitcoin Solaris allows users to mine BTC-S tokens directly from their smartphones through the Nova App. By allocating 1–5 GB of device storage and light background CPU usage, users will earn BTC-S passively — especially while devices are idle or charging. There is no staking mechanism, no validator configuration, and no reliance on token trading to receive rewards. This mirrors Bitcoin’s early mining economy, where participation rewarded technical contribution. The difference is accessibility. With Bitcoin Solaris, the requirement is not a GPU or ASIC — but a smartphone, making it feasible for millions of users globally to participate directly in the protocol. Infrastructure Built for Passive Income The blockchain is structured across two integrated layers. The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) to maintain ledger integrity efficiently. The Solaris Layer leverages Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) to execute mobile mining and smart contracts at 10,000+ TPS, with a finality time of 2 seconds. This design supports high-volume mining across thousands of nodes simultaneously and ensures that protocol rewards are distributed quickly, securely, and without congestion. It’s optimized not just for performance — but for continuous, low-friction earnings. BTC-S Presale Mirrors Early BTC Conditions Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 4, with BTC-S priced at 4 USDT. A total of 4.2 million BTC-S — 20% of the fixed 21 million supply — is allocated to presale participants. There is no inflation mechanism; future distribution will be governed strictly through mining or validator activity. Early buyers are not only accessing BTC-S at a fixed price—they’re securing network entry before Nova App mining begins. Once the app goes live, mining competition will increase, and token availability will decrease. The current presale offers an asymmetry similar to Bitcoin’s early distribution era, where those who engaged before market saturation saw long-term exponential returns. In a recent analysis, Crypto Volt highlights the structural parallels between Bitcoin in 2013 and Bitcoin Solaris today. The video outlines how Nova App mining, capped supply, and presale conditions offer a rare chance to replicate early-stage crypto dynamics — with the benefit of mobile-first design and audited infrastructure. Fully Audited and Verified Bitcoin Solaris has undergone comprehensive third-party verification to confirm the integrity of its smart contracts, token emission structure, and mobile mining architecture. A full audit conducted by Cyberscope reviewed the protocol’s contract logic and validated its compliance with emission parameters. A separate evaluation by Freshcoins examined system scalability, ensuring the infrastructure could reliably support high-volume mining and real-time transaction processing. The team has also completed KYC verification , providing transparency around governance and project oversight. These layers of independent review offer assurance that Bitcoin Solaris operates on verifiable code, not trust—critical for retail users entering before broader market exposure. Bitcoin’s 2013 phase was marked by low entry points, direct protocol rewards, and exponential upside for early participants. Bitcoin Solaris is now being compared to that period not for nostalgia, but for structure. It offers real earnings from a fixed-supply network, distributed via mobile mining, with the core mechanics already in place. Now in Phase 4 at 4 USDT, it remains one of the few retail-accessible opportunities in the current market cycle that resembles the conditions that built the first generation of crypto wealth.

But there’s a new crypto presale that could offer a rare second chance — BlockchainFX (BFX) . With strong fundamentals, built-in utility, and generous rewards, BlockchainFX presents a compelling opportunity to get in early on a project with 1000x token potential. Unlike the speculative trends that come and go, BlockchainFX is focused on delivering long-term value to users and investors. For anyone still searching for the next 1000x crypto, this could be it. Use bonus code BLOCK30 to receive an extra 30% in tokens! BlockchainFX: The Super App Behind the BFX Token BlockchainFX is positioning itself as the first comprehensive crypto trading super app, integrating multiple key features into a single, seamless platform. Designed to attract both novice and professional traders, it offers instant multi-asset swaps, high-level liquidity, and institutional-grade security. Standout features include: Daily staking rewards in USDT and BFX Potential to earn up to 25,000 USDT/day in passive income Exclusive BFX Visa cards (metal and gold versions) usable globally $10,000 monthly ATM withdrawals and up to $25,000 in free trading credits for presale buyers What sets it apart is its simplicity and value proposition. BlockchainFX isn’t just about trading — it's about building a financial ecosystem for everyday users and long-term holders alike. Why the BFX Crypto Presale Stands Out The BlockchainFX crypto presale offers early access to the BFX token at its lowest price point. This is not just an entry — it’s a strategic position ahead of the platform’s full-scale launch. Benefits include: First-access to platform features Long-term passive income generation A chance to enter before major market exposure For those who missed early Uniswap or Pepe token gains, this is a rare opening for high-upside participation in a well-structured project that’s still under the radar. Pepe Coin: Meme Magic or Missed Opportunity? Pepe, the viral memecoin, delivered huge returns for early adopters. But its value was driven more by internet hype than any real utility. Once the buzz faded, so did its price — leaving many investors with little to show. By contrast, BlockchainFX is rooted in utility and long-term user rewards, not just momentum. It’s designed for sustainability, not speculation. Uniswap: The DEX That Changed Everything Uniswap transformed DeFi with its decentralized exchange model, enabling permissionless token swaps. While early users benefited enormously, the market is now saturated, and the explosive growth phase is behind us. BlockchainFX builds on that legacy, adding ease-of-use and broader financial functionality for everyday users. Is BlockchainFX the Next 1000x Token? With Pepe fading and Uniswap maturing, BlockchainFX offers a new frontier for investors looking for the next 1000x crypto opportunity. By merging utility, rewards, and accessibility, its crypto presale could be the beginning of something big.

That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast , hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake. Understanding staking Jeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers. “By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.” To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton. Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet “So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.” Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.” PoW vs PoS Jenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin ( BTC ) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked. “The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.” Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped to a record high of $111,860, while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies jumped to $3.5 trillion. In contrast, the Dow opened lower by around 100 points, adding to Wednesday’s 816 point drop. Bitcoin and altcoins are climbing after the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act , a first-of-its-kind cryptocurrency regulation focused on stablecoins. The legislation requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 100 percent reserve backing with high-quality assets such as U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. It also mandates monthly disclosures detailing reserve composition. Other provisions include federal and state oversight. Stablecoin issuers with assets above 10 billion dollars will be regulated at the federal level, while states will oversee smaller issuers with less than 10 billion dollars in assets. The passage of the GENIUS Act is significant, as it helps safeguard the crypto industry, especially following the collapse of Terra in 2022 and other major failures, like FTX. It also provides long-awaited legal clarity. Bitcoin as a safe haven after the US credit rating downgrade Bitcoin and altcoins are rising because investors see BTC as a safe haven asset after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating . The safe-haven appeal has pushed investors into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have added over $4.2 billion in inflows this month, bringing the cumulative total to $43 billion. In its statement, Moody’s pointed to the rising US debt and interest payments and the policies in Washington. For example, the House of Representatives passed the “big, beautiful bill” that will add around $3.8 trillion in additional debt , according to some estimates.

On the daily chart, it has formed a cup and handle pattern while narrowly avoiding a death cross. A death cross occurs when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross while trending downward. This same setup nearly played out in August last year but was avoided. The cup pattern has a depth of about 30 percent.

Shiba Inu gained notoriety by transforming modest investments into substantial fortunes, soaring by over 80,000,000% from its initial price to its peak, securing its place among cryptocurrency’s top success stories. Pepe followed a similar trajectory, making headlines with a rapid ascent that propelled it into the meme coin elite, offering significant profits to early adopters. However, as both tokens have matured, their growth potential appears to have diminished, making it more challenging to replicate past performances. With Shiba Inu’s valuation now entrenched in the billions and Pepe maintaining elevated price levels, the opportunity for similar explosive gains has narrowed. This shift in the landscape has prompted investors to explore emerging alternatives with high growth potential. Enter Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) , a new entrant capturing attention with its bold narrative, expanding community, and practical utility. INPEPE aims to revolutionize the influencer economy by offering instant, borderless payouts, eliminating middlemen and platform fees, and providing on-chain proof of performance and engagement. Priced at just $0.0000002042 per token, INPEPE presents a unique early-stage opportunity. As anticipation builds for its upcoming listings, many believe INPEPE could be the next significant player in the meme coin space. Pepe and Influencer Pepe (INPEPE): The Rumors, Shiba’s History, and Why INPEPE Could Be the Next Big Winner Buzz continues to grow around the rumored connections between Pepe and INPEPE , fueling discussions across the crypto community. INPEPE claims to embody the complete vision, offering genuine long-term value and real-world utility that transcend the typical meme coin. With features like instant, borderless payouts and on-chain proof of performance, INPEPE is positioning itself as a stronger contender than both Shiba and Pepe. As interest surges, many now believe INPEPE has the potential to achieve gains equal to or even surpassing those witnessed with Shiba and Pepe. Can INPEPE Deliver 100x Returns Like PEPE? If you invest $10,000 in Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) at the current price of $0.0000002042, you’d be holding nearly 49 million tokens. Should INPEPE climb to PEPE’s peak price of $0.00001308, that investment could skyrocket to over $640,000—offering a potential 60x+ return. Considering both projects share the same token supply and INPEPE is gaining traction with rumors of a Tier 1 exchange listing, the upside remains significant. With investor attention rapidly growing, INPEPE may be on the verge of a breakout moment. INPEPE Presale Enters Its Final Stretch Ahead of Exchange Launch Investors can still acquire INPEPE at the presale rate of $0.0000002042.

Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor. “You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said. NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response. Source: Raoul Pal “There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification. “For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.

Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.” Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: Christies Some digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

Shiba Inu gained widespread fame by turning small amounts into life-changing profits, climbing more than 80,000,000% from its debut price to its peak, making it one of crypto’s biggest stories. Pepe followed closely, surging rapidly and delivering strong returns to its initial supporters as it rose through the meme coin ranks. However, both projects now seem to have limited upside. Shiba Inu’s market cap is deep in the billions, and Pepe remains close to its highs, making it difficult to see the same kind of explosive growth again. Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is gaining traction as the next-gen memecoin, uniquely positioned at the intersection of Web3 and the booming $25+ billion influencer economy.

Momentum indicators such as RSI and MACD suggest cooling off after short-term overbought signals. A sustained move above $31 could open doors to $33.80, while key support sits near $28.50. After a spectacular rally earlier this week, the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price today is trading near $30.95, marginally down from its recent high of $31.91. The sharp breakout from the $27–$28 accumulation range has drawn attention to the token’s short-term trajectory, particularly as technical indicators begin flashing early signs of exhaustion.

The football association plans to develop a dedicated blockchain platform to support its digital infrastructure. On Thursday, Avalanche announced that FIFA will launch a purpose-built blockchain called the FIFA Blockchain. The network will be developed on Avalanche’s architecture for FIFA’s digital products, beginning with the migration of FIFA Collect, the organization’s official digital collectibles marketplace. FIFA and Avalanche join forces to build L1-network According to Avalanche’s press statement , the FIFA Blockchain will operate as a sovereign layer-1 network with high throughput, low latency, and governance autonomy. Despite its independence, the blockchain will remain interoperable with Avalanche’s ecosystem and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). FIFA intends to use Avalanche to host fan experiences, trading platforms, and digital collectibles that can scale to match its five-billion-strong global audience. “ By selecting Avalanche, FIFA is not simply embracing blockchain, it is establishing a long-term digital foundation capable of supporting the scale, speed, and flexibility required by the world’s most-watched sport ,” the statement read. FIFA sets sights on EVM-compatible blockchain, migration from Algorand Prior to Thursday’s announcement, FIFA had announced its blockchain network will support its NFT platform, FIFA Collect. As part of the transition, FIFA Collect will migrate from the Algorand blockchain to the new network. The association also stated that the migration will begin no earlier than May 20, promising to provide step-by-step instructions on what holders need to do. After the move, Algorand-based wallets such as Pera and Defly will no longer be supported. Users will instead connect to FIFA Collect using MetaMask or other EVM-compatible wallets via WalletConnect.

Authorities are ramping up enforcement, including asset seizures and cross-border crackdowns. Garantex exchange was dismantled after processing $96B linked to illicit activity since 2019. The number of Finnish taxpayers reporting cryptocurrency trades has nearly doubled, rising from 8,200 to 16,000 in just one year, according to local media outlet Uutissuomalainen . Despite the surge, the figure still pales in comparison to the estimated 300,000 Finns believed to hold digital assets. In last year’s filings, declared crypto-related gains reached €230 million, with losses totaling €30 million—both significantly higher than the combined €50 million declared two years ago. Finland’s Crypto Boom Outpaces Tax Compliance The data points to rising engagement in crypto markets, but also highlights the gap between actual ownership and compliance. Since May 2019, Finland’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) has been responsible for overseeing the country’s crypto sector, including exchanges and wallet providers. Under Finnish law, all crypto service providers operating domestically must register and comply with financial regulations. The latest numbers suggest enforcement and awareness are growing—but full transparency remains elusive. In January, Finnish police seized around $2.68 million worth of luxury watches from Hex founder Richard Schueler, also known as Richard Heart, as part of an ongoing investigation into tax fraud and assault. The 20 high-end watches, mostly Rolexes, were discovered in a residence in Espoo and are believed to belong to Schueler. Authorities used intelligence efforts to trace the abandoned collection, with purchases made in both Finland and the U.S. Eight of the watches were officially confiscated, according to Inspector Harri Saaristola, who is leading the investigation. In March, the US Justice Department, in coordination with Germany and Finland, dismantled the online infrastructure of Garantex , a cryptocurrency exchange accused of facilitating money laundering for criminal and terrorist organizations. The exchange, which has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since 2019, has been taken offline following law enforcement action. Denmark Considers Taxing Unrealized Crypto Gains Denmark’s Tax Law Council has proposed a bill that would tax unrealized gains and losses on crypto holdings, potentially starting in 2026. The recommendation is detailed in a 93-page report and suggests a unified tax model for all digital assets. The council evaluated three frameworks for crypto taxation: capital gains, warehouse taxation, and inventory accounting. This initiative mirrors a growing international shift toward stricter tax enforcement on crypto and other financial assets. Italy is also tightening its stance. Vice Economy Minister Maurizio Leo recently announced plans to raise the capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies from 26% to 42% , specifically citing Bitcoin.

The project has raised $9,100,000 since its presale began, selling over 505 million tokens to 11,000 holders. Currently in phase 5 of an 11-phase presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tokens at $0.03. This is effectively a 200% jump from the opening phase’s $0.01. This structured presale fuels urgency, as phase 6 looms with a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. Investors buying now secure a guaranteed 100% return at the $0.06 listing price. This momentum positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending system With its dual financing strategy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reinventing DeFi. Users may lend or borrow with ease because to the platform’s integration of peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models. Lenders get mtTokens, which gradually earn interest, in exchange for deposits of assets like ETH or DAI. As borrowers pay back their loans, the value of these mtTokens—like mtETH or mtDAI—increases, providing passive income. Borrowers provide overcollateralized assets, ensuring stability and minimizing defaults. For instance, a $5,000 ETH deposit could unlock $3,500 in USDT, preserving asset ownership. This system drives liquidity, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout in the crypto market. Its practical utility attracts investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Tokenomics and buy pressure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs a buy-and-distribute mechanism to sustain demand. A portion of platform revenue repurchases MUTM tokens, redistributing them to mtToken stakers. This creates constant buy pressure, stabilizing prices and rewarding long-term holders. The presale, now in phase 5 at $0.03, has seen investors from phase 4 at $0.025 gain a 20% increase. At listing, the $0.06 price guarantees a 100% ROI for phase 5 buyers. Analysts forecast a post-launch surge to $2.50, yielding an 8,233% ROI. This structured tokenomics model positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto for long-term investment. Phase 5’s rapid sell-out amplifies FOMO in the crypto market. Security and community incentives The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, bolstering investor trust. Results will soon appear on official social channels, reinforcing transparency. Recently, the project launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 token holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. This initiative sparks engagement, driving community growth. A $100,000 giveaway further fuels excitement, offering ten investors $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. These efforts enhance the project’s appeal, positioning it as the best crypto to buy now. As phase 5 nears capacity, investors rush to secure tokens before the price climbs to $0.035 in phase 6. Stablecoin and ecosystem growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, minted through user-deposited collateral. This decentralized approach ensures stability, unlike centralized stablecoins. The stablecoin, tied to platform activity, boosts liquidity and expands borrowing options. Interest from these loans feeds the Mutuum DAO treasury, strengthening the ecosystem. This innovation aligns with the growing DeFi crypto trend, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a top cryptocurrency to watch. The project’s focus on real-world utility, not speculation, draws investors seeking the next big crypto. As crypto prices rise, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s scalable model promises sustained growth in 2025. Path to prominence in 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto market with its robust lending system and strategic tokenomics. The ongoing Certik audit and transparent dashboard foster trust, while the stablecoin plan signals ambitious ecosystem expansion. With phase 5 underway, investors face a narrowing window to buy at $0.03 before the 16.7% jump to $0.035. The guaranteed 100% ROI at listing, paired with a potential $2.50 post-launch target, makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a top crypto to invest in.

If you’re holding Solaxy or looking at it, there’s something you should know now that the market is heating up. With Bitcoin breaking above $110,000 and XRP moving higher , the whole crypto space is getting attention again. Investors are rushing to look at new projects , especially meme coins. That’s why Solaxy is starting to trend. It calls itself the first Layer 2 built on Solana , and yes , that sounds exciting. But let’s take a closer look. Layer 2 technology helps slow and expensive blockchains like Ethereum. It makes transactions faster and fees cheaper. But Solana is already one of the fastest and cheapest chains in crypto . So adding a Layer 2 doesn’t really fix a problem , because there wasn’t one to begin with . That’s where the question comes in. Solaxy might still grow , maybe even 5x , but it might not go much further, simply because its technology doesn’t bring major change to the Solana ecosystem. That’s why some investors are saying:. And that’s exactly when Pepeto enters the picture , with real tools, a deep story, and growing momentum . Pepeto Has a Stronger Foundation , Tech, Story, and Real Market Impact If Solaxy is catching early interest, Pepeto is quickly turning into the headline. It’s not just another meme coin, it’s a full-on crypto platform being built piece by piece. The team behind Pepeto is launching a dedicated exchange , where many of the newest meme coins of 2025 will be listed. That means daily users, daily traffic, and most importantly , real value for the $PEPETO token . Every coin that launches on the Pepeto exchange will bring new eyes and new utility. But Pepeto goes even further. It’s building PepetoSwap , a special swap platform that connects multiple blockchains , thanks to bridge technology . Want to move your tokens from Ethereum to Solana? Or from BNB Chain to Avalanche? PepetoSwap makes that easy, fast, and cheap. It’s solving a real problem that many traders face today , and doing it with a fun, meme-powered brand that also delivers value. Here’s what makes Pepeto one of the most talked-about meme coins right now : A new exchange just for meme coins launching in 2025 PepetoSwap a tool for trading across blockchains Fast and cheap bridge technology for better access A staking system that rewards token holders An active, growing community that supports the project Tier 1 exchange listings already in the works A unique backstory that links it directly to Pepe the Frog The Real Story Behind Pepeto and Why It’s Bigger Than Just Hype Many believe that the meme coin world changed when Pepe the Frog launched but not everyone knows the full story. Some say Pepe’s success came from stealing four original documents from an early-stage project called Pepeto. These documents were titled P, E, P, and E , standing for Precision, Energy, Power, and Efficiency . Pepe launched fast, grabbed the spotlight, but left out two important parts: T for Technology , and O for Optimization . That’s what the word “ Pepeto ” really means. It’s the full picture. And that’s why Pepeto calls itself the God of Frogs , not just another copy. https://www.instagram.com/reel/DB1QEqrP96L/?igsh=MzdsbGxoaHRmazJt Now, rumors are growing people believe that the original Pepe founder , who was left out and betrayed, is actually the one now building Pepeto. If that’s true, this isn’t just a comeback — it’s a mission to finish what was started, with the right tools, a powerful brand, and a strong plan to grow. The Bottom Line: Pepeto Brings Real Utility in a Time When Meme Coins Must Offer More With Bitcoin surging past $110K and XRP regaining momentum , the crypto market is clearly waking up. But investors are getting smarter. Hype isn’t enough anymore. Projects need real value, real tools, and real communities . That’s where Pepeto checks every box. It has the exchange . It has the bridge tech . It has the story . And it might just have the founder who started it all . Stay in touch with Pepeto announcement via tg : https://t.me/pepeto_channel Solaxy might still rise maybe a clean 5x , as the first of its kind on Solana. But if you’re looking for the next big meme coin that mixes humor, hype, and serious tools, Pepeto may be the one that leads the next era . Joining the $PEPETO project takes just a few simple steps: Set Up a Crypto Wallet – Use a wallet that supports Ethereum, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Deposit Funds – Add ETH, USDT, or BNB to your wallet. Participate in the Presale – Go to pepeto.io to purchase your $PEPETO tokens. Stake Your Holdings – Access the staking platform to start earning passive rewards. Why $PEPETO Stands Out $PEPETO brings together the viral appeal of meme coins with real blockchain utility. From a zero-fee trading platform and cross-chain bridge to high staking incentives, it’s positioned as a major contender in the evolving crypto landscape, especially heading into 2025.

The flagship cryptocurrency smashed its previous all-time high, surging past $110,000 late Wednesday after teasing the move since the beginning of the week. Momentum sustained itself even after US equity markets closed for the day. BTC is up nearly 4% over the past 24 hours, trading around $111,400. Buoyed by BTC, Ethereum (ETH) also registered a notable rally, rising almost 2% to reclaim $2,600 and move to $2,636. Ripple (XRP) also registered a substantial rise of over 1% and moved to $2.41, while Solana (SOL) is up nearly 4% as it looks to move towards $176. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Polkadot (DOT), and Litecoin (LTC) also registered notable increases. What’s Driving Crypto’s Latest Rally? Bitcoin (BTC) shattered its previous all-time high as the flagship cryptocurrency surged past $110,000 and moved to its current level above $111,000. The rally puts BTC in uncharted territory as it enters a price discovery phase. Others, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA), also rallied, pushing the crypto market cap into positive territory. Data from Coinglass revealed the rally led to over $500 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, highlighting the intensity of the breakout. The main factor driving the crypto market’s latest rally is BTC surging past $110,000 and entering uncharted territory. Analysts suggest the rally could continue, and the price could hit $120,000. Stablecoin Bill Could Unlock Trillions For US Treasury White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks believes the stablecoin legislation could unlock trillions for the US treasury by boosting Treasury demand. Sacks also said he believes the bill will pass through the Senate with significant bipartisan support. Sacks stated in an interview, “We already have over $200 billion in stablecoins. It's just unregulated. If we provide the legal clarity and legal framework for this, I think we could create trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight, very quickly.” The GENIUS Act cleared a procedural vote in the Senate, with 15 Democrats voting for it to pass the threshold this week. This means the bill's proponents have the necessary votes to avoid a filibuster. “We have every expectation now that it's going to pass.” Democrats had previously rejected the GENIUS Act, flagging concerns about President Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures, including a personal meme coin and a stablecoin from his family’s crypto business. According to Democrats, this created an unprecedented conflict of interest. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to a real-world asset. The stablecoin market is dominated by Tether’s USDT, which has a 60% market share. According to Deutsche Bank, stablecoin transactions hit a staggering $28 trillion in 2024, surpassing Mastercard and Visa combined. Sacks believes the GENIUS Act is more than just a crypto breakthrough, describing it as a national economic strategy. “Stablecoins offer a new, more efficient, cheaper, smoother payment system — new payment rails for the US economy. It also extends the dominance of the dollar online.” Binance To List USD1 Stablecoin Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, will list World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin on May 22, with withdrawals opening the following day. The listing marks a major milestone for the controversial digital Dollar alternative. USD1 is a fiat-backed stablecoin that maintains a 1:1 peg with the US Dollar. USD1 is backed by cash, short-term US Treasuries, and Dollar deposits and is issued and managed by BitGo Trust Company. World Liberty Financial conducts regular reserve audits, although detailed breakdowns remain private. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) shattered its previous all-time high as it surged past $110,000 late Wednesday. The flagship cryptocurrency had teased a move past $110,000 earlier in the week when it briefly crossed the $107,000 mark before losing momentum and registering a marginal decline. BTC has gradually pushed higher during the week despite a tumultuous start, which saw the price dip to a low of $102,135 on Monday. However, the price gradually recovered before moving past its all-time high on Wednesday. BTC reached an intraday high of $111,726 during the ongoing session before registering a marginal decline and moving to its current level of $110,604. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of the digital asset trading platform Nexo, stated, “Now that January's high has been surpassed - and the 50 percent upside from April's lows has been achieved - bitcoin enters blue sky territory with tailwinds in the form of institutional momentum and a favorable U.S. regulatory environment.” BTC sometimes trades in tandem with tech stocks and assets that rise in value when investor sentiment is in positive territory. Earlier in the week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will allow its clients to purchase Bitcoin . Dimon is a long-time crypto skeptic who has criticized BTC and other digital assets on several occasions. “We're still in year four of the bitcoin price cycle - the year after the bitcoin halving when miner rewards are slashed in half - which historically means its best days are still ahead of it and - while macro uncertainty and the threat of further volatility remains, a target of $150,000 in 2025 is still very much on the cards.” BTC’s rally mirrors the broader recovery in US equities. The increase comes despite Wednesday’s selloff. The S&P 500 has registered a 15% increase since late April, while the Nasdaq is up over 21%. Analysts attribute the bounce in the traditional and crypto markets to growing optimism about less aggressive trade policies. BTC started the previous week on a volatile note as buyers and sellers struggled for control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a drop of 1.04% and settled at $102,728. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123, but fell back on Wednesday, dropping 0.53% to $103,568. The price plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, the price rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Selling pressure returned as BTC registered marginal declines on Friday and Saturday, registering marginal declines and settling at $103,235. Source: TradingView Despite the negative sentiment, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a decline of nearly 1%. Market sentiment turned bullish on Tuesday as BTC rose 1.21% and settled at $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rose almost 3% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,604, settling a new all-time high. BTC extended its gains during the ongoing session, reaching an intraday high of $111,726 before registering a marginal decline to its current levels. Analysts believe BTC’s rally could continue as it enters a price discovery phase. The immediate target is $115,000, but a move past this level could see the price reach $120,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) price action has stabilized after a volatile start to the week, with the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency reclaiming the $2,600 level as buying activity picks up. ETH bulls will look to build momentum and push towards $2,800. ETH’s recovery and stunning increase over the past month mean ETH holders are back in profit, increasing the chances of the price crossing the $3,000 mark. However, ETH must first cross the $2,800 resistance, a level where it has faced rejection earlier. Around 2.27 million ETH could be sold at this level. ETH’s latest rally has pushed it above its realized price or cost basis. ETH holders returning to profit after registering unrealized losses has also provided financial relief for holders, reinforcing a bullish outlook for the asset. Despite ETH’s recent positivity, it started the previous week facing volatility and selling pressure. The price ultimately registered a marginal decline after sellers gained the upper hand. Despite a negative start, ETH rebounded on Tuesday, rising over 7% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,681. However, it lost momentum on Wednesday, dropping 2.64% and settling at $2,610. ETH declined on Thursday, falling over 2%, slipping below $2,600, and settling at $2,548. Buyers attempted a recovery on Friday as the price rose to an intraday high of $2,648. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $2,537, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Saturday as ETH fell 2.44% to $2,476. The price overcame volatility to register an increase of almost 1% on Sunday and end the weekend on a bullish note. ETH plunged to an intraday low of $2,326 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 1.19%, reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,527. The price registered a marginal decline on Tuesday before rising 1.11% on Wednesday and settling at $2,552. The current session has seen ETH extend its gains, with the price up over 4%, trading around $2,663. Buyers will look to maintain momentum and test the $2,800 resistance. A break above this level could see ETH surge to $3,000. A bullish MACD indicates buyers have the upper hand. However, the RSI is in the overbought zone, suggesting a decline is inevitable. Despite ETH’s price jump, analysts pointed out that the Active Realised Price sits around $2,900 and remains a key level that must be reclaimed to support continued price appreciation. “The $2,400–$2,900 range remains a crucial area for Ethereum, acting as both a resistance zone and a potential breakout level essential for maintaining upward momentum.” Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is rising toward the $180 mark as the blockchain gears up for the release of Seeker. SOL started the previous week positively despite facing volatility, increasing 0.60% to $174. The price plunged to an intraday low of $165 as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 5.50%, crossing $180 and settling at $183. SOL lost momentum after reaching this level and fell nearly 4%, slipping below $180 and the 200-day SMA and settling at $176. The price continued downwards on Thursday, falling over 4% to $169. Sellers retained control on Friday as SOL fell almost 1% and settled at $167. Source: TradingView SOL started the weekend in the red as its downtrend continued, dropping 0.89% and settled at $165. The price rebounded on Sunday, rising over 4% to reclaim $170 and settle at $173. Despite the positive sentiment, SOL plunged to an intraday low of $159 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. The price rebounded from this level to reclaim $160 and settle at $166, ultimately registering a drop of almost 4%. SOL recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.05%, and continued to push higher on Wednesday, registering an increase of nearly 3% and settling at $173. The current session sees SOL up almost 4% and trading at $180. If buyers break and close above this level, the price could surge past $200. Polkadot (DOT) Price Analysis Polkadot (DOT) registered a substantial decline last week but has rebounded to retake key levels. The altcoin is looking to build momentum and reclaim $5 during the week. DOT encountered considerable selling pressure and volatility last Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $5.07. DOT plunged to an intraday low of $4.83 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded, increasing 2.56%, and settled at $5.20. DOT lost momentum after reaching this level, falling over 4% on Wednesday, slipping below $5 and settling at $4.98. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday and Friday as the price registered declines of 4.22% and 0.42% to settle at $4.75. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Saturday as DOT registered a drop of nearly 3% and settled at $4.61. The price rebounded on Sunday, rising 4.12% and settling at $4.80. However, it was back in the red on Monday, dropping over 4% to $4.59, but not before reaching an intraday low of $4.42. Despite the bearish start to the week, DOT recovered on Tuesday, rising over 2% to $4.69. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 1.28% and settling at $4.75 after reaching an intraday high of $4.88. The current session sees DOT up nearly 4% as it looks to reclaim $5. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) started the previous week on a bearish note, dropping 4.57% and settling at $0.430 after facing significant volatility. ARB recovered on Tuesday, rising over 6% to $0.457, but was back in the red on Wednesday, falling nearly 7% and settling at $0.426. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as ARB dropped almost 7%, slipping below $0.40 and settling at $0.398. The price reached an intraday high of $0.417 on Friday as buyers attempted a recovery. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped over 2% to $0.389. Price action remained negative on Saturday as ARB fell 3.51% to $0.376. The price rebounded on Sunday, rising over 5% to end the weekend positively at $0.395. Source: TradingView ARB plunged to an intraday low of $0.364 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, the price rebounded from this level to settle at $0.391, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.46% to $0.939. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ARB rose over 4% to reclaim $0.40 and settle at $0.411. The current session sees the price up 4.11% as buyers look to push ARB towards $0.450. Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap’s (UNI) recent lawsuit concerns did not seem to have much of an impact on its price action, as it continued to push higher during the ongoing session. UNI started the previous week with a marginal decline before rising nearly 3% on Tuesday and settling at $7.09 despite facing volatility. However, the price was back in the red on Wednesday, dropping almost 7%, slipping below $7 and settling at $6.60. Sellers retained control on Thursday as UNI fell nearly 6% and settled at $6.22. UNI reached an intraday high of $6.46 on Friday but lost momentum, dropping 2.42% to $6.07. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Saturday as UNI fell nearly 6%, slipping below $6 and settling at $5.73. The price rebounded on Sunday, rising almost 7% to reclaim $6 and settle at $6.12. UNI plunged to an intraday low of $5.66 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, the price recovered to settle at $5.93, ultimately registering a drop of 3.03%. UNI recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to reclaim $6 and settle at $6.01. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 3.51% and settling at $6.22, but not before reaching an intraday high of $6.58. The current session sees UNI up 3.52%, trading at $6.44.

44956569,https://bitzo.com/2025/05/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-shatters-110000-sets-new-all-time-high,1747921896,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/44956569.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Shatters $110,000, Sets New All-Time High",https://bitzo.com/2025/05/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-shatters-110000-sets-new-all-time-high,"Bitcoin (BTC) smashed its previous all-time high and crossed the $110,000 mark for the first time. The flagship cryptocurrency had teased a move higher earlier in the week when it briefly crossed $107,000. BTC is up nearly 4% in the past 24 hours as it tests the waters above $110,000. BTC’s rally puts the flagship cryptocurrency in uncharted territory as it enters a period of price discovery. Bitcoin hit an intraday high of $111,726 earlier in the session before retreating to current levels. Bitcoin (BTC) Surges To New All-Time High Bitcoin (BTC) shattered the $110,000 level and surged to a new all-time high of $111,726 as market sentiment improved. The flagship cryptocurrency had teased a move past this level earlier in the week as markets recovered from the trade war and tariff-induced selloffs. Bitcoin’s rally was driven by several factors, including easing trade tensions, clarity around tariffs, and Moody’s downgrade of US sovereign debt, prompting investors to seek alternative investments. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of digital asset trading platform Nexo, stated, “Now that January's high has been surpassed - and the 50 percent upside from April's lows has been achieved - bitcoin enters blue sky territory with tailwinds in the form of institutional momentum and a favorable U.S. regulatory environment.” Market watchers also highlighted growing institutional interest and participation as another driver of the rally. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime crypto skeptic, recently said the bank would allow its clients to purchase Bitcoin. Coinbase was also added to the S&P 500 index, further boosting investor sentiment. “We're still in year four of the bitcoin price cycle - the year after the bitcoin halving when miner rewards are slashed in half - which historically means its best days are still ahead of it and - while macro uncertainty and the threat of further volatility remains, a target of $150,000 in 2025 is still very much on the cards.” What’s Behind The Bitcoin (BTC) Rally? BTC soared past its previous all-time high, set at the beginning of the year, rising to $111,726 after registering a sharp increase of above 4% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has risen over 23% in the past month, posting a sharp reversal from April’s downturn. The flagship cryptocurrency’s rally mirrors the ongoing recovery in US equities despite Wednesday’s selloff. The S&P 500 has risen 15% since late April, while the Nasdaq is up over 21%. Analysts have attributed the increase to growing optimism about President Trump’s trade policies and easing trade tensions between the US and China. Texas Approves Bitcoin Reserve Bill Texas is close to becoming the third US state to establish and manage a Bitcoin reserver after the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Investment Act, SB 21, was approved by the House of Representatives with a vote of 101-42. The bill will now be sent to Governor Greg Abbott for approval. The bill authorizes the state comptroller to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion over the past 12 months. Bitcoin is the only asset that meets this criteria. The bill also directs the creation of a formal Bitcoin reserve and positions the state to diversify its financial strategy by investing in digital assets. If signed, Texas will join New Hampshire and potentially Arizona to become the only US state to establish a Bitcoin reserve. However, governors in Arizona and Montana voted to block similar proposals, citing extreme volatility in the crypto markets. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a new all-time high after finally crossing $110,000 and reaching $111,726. The move was driven by growing optimism around crypto regulation, institutional interest in BTC , and easing trade tensions. A broader rally in the US markets also buoyed investor sentiment. James Butterfill, head of research for crypto-focused asset manager CoinShares, stated, “The rally was also helped along by broader macro concerns, including Moody’s recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which added to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability.” There have also been positive developments for crypto on the regulatory front, with the GENIUS Act, a key bill for stablecoin regulation, clearing a key procedural vote in the Senate. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also registered steady inflows, according to analysts. BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping over 1% on Monday and settling at $102,728. The price recovered on Tuesday, registering an increase of 1.36% and settling at $104,123. BTC was back in the red on Wednesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $103,568. The price plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settling at $106,489. Source: TradingView The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a decline of nearly 1%. Market sentiment turned bullish on Tuesday as BTC rose 1.21% and settled at $106,854. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,604. BTC surged to an intraday high of $111,726 during the ongoing session. The price is currently up nearly 2% and trading at $111,540. Analysts believe BTC’s rally could continue as it enters a price discovery phase. The immediate target is $115,000, but a move past this level could see the price reach $120,000.

On May 19, the Senate voted to invoke cloture and move ahead with the GENIUS Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure passed 66-32, with 16 Democrats supporting the bill. Democratic concerns over corruption and politicians’ ties to cryptocurrency firms made the bipartisan move controversial. After the vote was finished, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet introduced the STABLE GENIUS Act. The bill would prevent members of Congress from issuing or investing in digital currency and require them to put their crypto in a blind trust while in office. Bills to prevent members of Congress from investing in companies they regulate have had little success. However, lawmakers are still required to disclose rough estimations of their, their spouse’s and their children’s investments. Here are 11 US senators who have invested in crypto firms. Montana Tim Sheehy, Republican Tim Sheehy is a newcomer to the Senate, first securing his election in the 2024 cycle. In his campaign, Sheehy contrasted himself against his opponent, former Senator Jon Tester, stating , “Crypto represents the future of finance and the internet, and thousands of jobs for America.” Source: US Senate Investments: According to a June 2024 filing , Sheehy has an investment between $1,001 and $15,000 in Intercontinental Exchange, which offers futures contracts on cryptocurrencies.

Nevada Jackey Rosen, Democrat Senator Jacky Rosen is currently serving her second term in office, first getting elected to the Senate in the 2018 midterm elections.

Alaska Dan Sullivan, Republican Senator Dan Sullivan is currently in his second term, first taking office in January 2015.

Source: US Senate Investments: According to an August 2024 filing , Sullivan owns shares in BlackRock, which offers crypto-centered ETFs. Oklahoma Markwayne Mullin, Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin took office in January 2023 after winning a special election against Democrat Kendra Horn in 2022.

He has also vocally supported the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve. Source: Tommy Tuberville Investments: According to a July 2024 filing , Tuberville has investments in PayPal. Katie Britt, Republican Senator Katie Britt was first elected to the Senate during the 2022 midterms. While campaigning, she accepted donations in cryptocurrency from donors.

Ohio Bernie Moreno, Republican Bernie Moreno is new to the Senate, securing his seat in the 2024 federal elections.

All investments are between $1,001 and $15,000. This list is not exhaustive; there are plenty of companies in which lawmakers invest that are affected by cryptocurrency price movements and market effects. It also does not include any members of the House of Representatives, where crypto regulation is similarly in the works.

Momentum flipped positive , with RSI > 60 and MACD showing a fresh bullish crossover. BBTrend surged to +5.22 , signaling strong volatility and breakout potential. Open interest hit $917M , marking its highest level in 2025 and confirming rising trader confidence. Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high of $111,861 on May 22, pushing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 73 (Greed) —its highest reading in weeks. This surge in sentiment has triggered renewed momentum across major altcoins, with Cardano (ADA) reclaiming the $0.80 mark and flashing signs of a bullish continuation. Will momentum hold into next week? ADA/USD Structure Recovery Backed by Momentum Shift Cardano’s price action has seen sharp turns in 2025. On March 2 , ADA surged from $0.64 to $1.19 — its biggest one-day spike this year, a gain of +85% . But profit-taking led to a deep correction, bottoming out at $0.5114 on April 2 , a -57% drop . Since then, ADA has been rebuilding, climbing to $0.84 on May 10 , then briefly correcting to $0.71 on May 19 , before bouncing back above $0.80 . This climb is supported by a bullish structure of higher lows. Price now trades above a rising trendline, with key support at $0.7526 (0.236 Fib) and resistance at $0.8533 (0.5 Fib). A break above this zone could open the door to $0.934 (0.618 Fib) in the short term. Cardano price indicator setup has also shifted bullishly . RSI recovered from 45–48 on May 19 to above 61.13 , reflecting improving buying strength. MACD completed a bullish crossover on May 21–22, with expanding green histogram bars signaling fresh momentum. Most notably, the BBTrend , which tracks directional strength using Bollinger Band volatility, flipped from negative to +8.9913 — its highest reading in months. This confirms rising volatility alongside bullish price action, helping validate the breakout attempt. Volume trends further support the move. After a quiet start to May, spot and derivatives activity has surged , with open interest now at $917M — the highest in 2025. This signals rising conviction among traders and real capital inflow behind the price push. Short-Term Forecast: Bullish, With Caution If ADA holds above the $0.75–$0.77 support band this week, a retest of the $0.85 level is likely. A clean breakout above $0.853 could accelerate gains toward $0.93–$0.94 in the next 7–10 days. However, failure to sustain above $0.75 would expose ADA to downside risk toward $0.72 or even $0.647 in a broader pullback. Verdict: Bullish Bias with Near-Term Upside The technical and on-chain picture supports a bullish bias for ADA in the short term, especially if momentum sustains above key Fib levels. While resistance at $0.85 may cause temporary friction, the overall structure favours upside continuation, potentially targeting $0.93 within the next 10 days.",Price Analysis|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 13:55:03

Priced at $0.03, the altcoin has soared 200% from its opening phase at $0.01, signaling robust investor demand. Cardano (ADA), meanwhile, clings to a $0.75 support level, with analysts eyeing a potential $1 breakout. Both cryptos spark intrigue in the crypto market, but can they truly reach that coveted dollar mark? Mutuum Finance’s structured tokenomics and Cardano’s technical signals offer clues. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is dominating its phase 5 presale, with tokens priced at $0.03. This stage, already underway, follows a 20% jump from phase 4’s $0.025, delivering a tidy profit for early buyers. Phase 6 looms, bringing a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, so current investors are poised for quick gains. The project’s tokenomics guarantee a 100% ROI at launch, with a listing price of $0.06. Some predict a post-launch surge to $2, promising a staggering 6,567% ROI. Mutuum Finance isn’t just a new crypto coin; its lending model drives real utility, fueling investor fervor. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi Edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) thrives on a decentralized lending platform, letting users lend or borrow assets securely. Lenders deposit into liquidity pools, earning interest via mtTokens like mtETH, which grow as interest accrues. Borrowers use overcollateralized assets, ensuring stability. The buy-and-distribute system funnels platform revenue into repurchasing MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates constant demand, bolstering prices. Recently, the team launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for holding strong. Mutuum Finance’s practical approach positions it as a top crypto to buy now, outshining speculative altcoins. Mutuum Finance’s Security Push The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is prioritizing trust, actively pursuing a Certik audit for its smart contracts. Once finalized, results will flash across their social channels, boosting confidence. This move underscores their commitment to transparency in a volatile crypto market. With phase 5 selling fast, urgency grips investors. A $100,000 giveaway further stokes excitement, offering 10 winners $10,000 in tokens. Mutuum Finance’s blend of utility, security, and rewards marks it as a best crypto to invest in. As phase 6 nears, the window to grab tokens at $0.03 shrinks, pushing buyers to act swiftly. Cardano’s Technical Tightrope Cardano (ADA) is battling to hold its $0.75 support, a critical pivot after a 5% weekly dip. Technical charts show a retest of an inverse head-and-shoulders neckline, hinting at bullish potential. The RSI at 55 suggests a possible bounce, while a forming golden crossover of EMAs fuels cautious optimism. Fibonacci levels peg $0.75 as a demand zone, with $1.01 as the next hurdle. Cardano’s measured growth lags behind Mutuum Finance’s presale sprint, making it a less immediate pick for those chasing the next crypto to hit $1 in 2025. Cardano’s Slow Burn Cardano (ADA) relies on its research-driven blockchain, but its $0.75 price struggles to ignite rapid gains. Analysts see a $1 target, a 33% climb, if support holds and market momentum aligns. Yet, Bitcoin’s range-bound dance near $103,000 caps altcoin rallies. Cardano’s ecosystem grows steadily, but its crypto prices trail Mutuum Finance’s explosive presale. Investors eyeing the best crypto to buy may find Cardano’s long-term promise solid but lacking the short-term spark of Mutuum Finance. The crypto market demands patience for ADA’s potential breakout. Racing Toward $1 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA) vie for the $1 milestone, but their paths diverge. Mutuum Finance’s phase 5 presale, with its 100% guaranteed ROI and $2 post-launch potential, screams urgency. Its DeFi utility and buy-pressure mechanics make it a top crypto for 2025. Cardano, tethered to technicals, offers a slower climb toward $1, hinging on market tailwinds. Investors pondering what crypto to buy now face a choice: Mutuum Finance’s fast track or Cardano’s steady grind.

Now, crypto analyst Tony Severino has predicted that this rally is likely to sustain, with BTC reaching $120,000 at some point. Bitcoin Price To Reach $120,000 Following This Range Breakout In an X post, Tony Severino predicted that the Bitcoin price could reach between $116,000 and $120,000 following the breakout from the $106,000 range. This prediction came just before BTC surged past its previous ATH of $109,100 on May 21. The analyst asserted that the flagship crypto could witness a “long, white candlestick” leading to the rally to this range. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $118,000 Before June? Trader Reveals When As Weekly MACD Turns Bullish He had also warned that failure to break above the $106,000 range could lead to a retracement as lower timeframe momentum begins to wane. In another post, Severino explained why the range breakout was significant, noting that these breakouts in the Bitcoin price tend to offer a sustainable short-term trend to ride higher. He added that a valid range breakout should be supported by the RSI above 70 on the 3-day timeframe. The Bitcoin price currently boasts an ultra-bullish outlook, having rallied above the $110,000 mark and reached a new ATH of $111,800. Commenting on the surge to a new ATH, Severino admitted he was wrong about the bear thesis, stating that the macro fundamentals led over the technicals on this rally. The crypto analyst is confident that the Bitcoin price can go way higher. In his latest analysis, he revealed that BTC’s quarterly just triggered a perfected TD9 Sell Setup. He added that the only other time this happened was in Q4 2017, which was the most bullish quarter in crypto history. Bitcoin eventually rose by over 350% above the candlestick open. If history were to repeat itself, Severino predicts that the move will be “fast, violent, and over” sooner than anyone can imagine. He noted that up appears to be the chosen direction, which is a positive for the Bitcoin price. A Golden Cross Is Incoming For BTC In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that a golden cross is incoming for the Bitcoin price. He remarked that BTC is repeating the same pattern, with a Death Cross happening before the Golden Cross. The analyst added that the last time this happened, it triggered a major rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top In another post, Titan of Crypto predicted that the Bitcoin price could rally to as high as $135,000. He affirmed that the target is still play, with BTC likely to reach this price level this year. Meanwhile, veteran analyst Peter Brandt suggested that Bitcoin could rally to between $125,000 and $150,000 by August. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $111,300, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/polymarket-investors-think-bitcoin-will-reach-these-levels-within-9-days-here-are-the-details/,"After reaching a new all-time high, expectations for Bitcoin have risen even higher. Polymarket Investors: Bitcoin Could Hit $115,000 in 9 Days Traders on predictive crypto marketplace Polymarket are assessing a 64% chance that the leading cryptocurrency will reach $115,000 in the next nine days, a striking increase from last week’s 14%. Bitcoin surged past its previous high of $108,000 on Wednesday, surpassing the $110,000 level, sparking renewed investor interest. BTC has rebounded by nearly 50% in the past two months and is on a strong rally since its low of $74,500 in early April. “Bitcoin reaching these levels is the result of a strategic accumulation against the expectation of market stress,” said crypto analyst Noelle Acheson. ETF Demand and Institutional Flows Take Precedence eToro Australia analyst Reece Hobson attributes this week’s rally to increased global liquidity and a surge in capital into spot Bitcoin ETFs, with nearly $3 billion in institutional inflows in May alone pushing Bitcoin’s price higher. Bitcoin is seen as both a risky investment vehicle similar to technology stocks and a safe haven like gold, creating a unique “dual narrative” for investors. It is stated that this approach creates a “floor” for the price to fall. Over the past two months, large Bitcoin investors have played a key role in the price increase, providing an inflow of approximately $122 billion worth of BTC to the market. This accumulation trend is interpreted as preparation for increasing economic uncertainties. “What is happening right now could be a wave of accumulation by both short-term risk-averse investors and long-term safe haven seekers,” Acheson said, summing up the dynamics in the market this way. Year-end Estimates Go Up to $150,000 Ari10 CEO Mateusz Kara said that Bitcoin could see $150,000 this year, and that factors such as the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and decreasing political uncertainties would be effective in this scenario. Geoff Kendrick, an analyst at Standard Chartered, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $120,000 by the end of the quarter. According to Hobson, if market volume remains strong, BTC could climb to $155,000. But There Are Warnings Too CEX.IO analyst Illia Otychenko drew attention to the 36% decrease in volume in the derivatives markets and the 29% decrease in the spot market in the last month, and emphasized that caution should be exercised regarding the permanence of this increase. “The market is stuck between upward momentum on the one hand and structural weaknesses on the other,” Otychenko said, noting that the coming weeks could be marked by sudden and sharp movements. *This is not investment advice.

Mantle , the largest sustainable hub for on-chain finance with over $3 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), today announced a strategic partnership with Republic Technologies , the Ethereum (“ETH”) treasury of publicly listed Canadian company Beyond Medical Technologies Inc. (CSE: DOCT) (IBKR: DOCT) (FSE: 7FM). This partnership marks a major milestone in institutional cryptocurrency adoption, positioning Mantle’s mETH as the first liquid staking token to be held on the balance sheet of a publicly listed company. Through the partnership, Republic Technologies plans to delegate a significant portion of its ETH holdings to Mantle’s mETH Protocol and will hold mETH as a yield-bearing, liquid staking token on its balance sheet. The collaboration underscores a structural shift in institutional digital asset strategy and growing investor conviction in Ethereum-native yield infrastructure, reflecting Republic Technologies’ deepening alignment with the Mantle ecosystem. Republic Technologies: The First Publicly Listed Ethereum Treasury Republic Technologies is establishing a new institutional paradigm by building a treasury strategy around Ethereum, seen as the foundational layer for smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized financial settlement. In contrast to Bitcoin-focused strategies employed by firms like Strategy and Metaplanet, whose reserves are largely Bitcoin-based, Republic Technologies’ approach is anchored in Ethereum’s role as the infrastructure layer powering both blockchain innovation and real-world enterprise integration. By accumulating ETH as a core balance sheet asset, Republic Technologies advances the growth of its underlying healthcare technology businesses while offering institutional-grade exposure to digital assets for all shareholders. This strategy attracts growing interest from traditional markets and accelerates institutional participation in the emerging technology sector. “We hold strong conviction that Ethereum is the institutional chain, with ETH serving as the digital fuel powering global financial systems,” said Daniel Liu , CEO of Republic Technologies . “Our initial entry through Mantle’s Scout Program helped us gain early exposure to the broader Mantle ecosystem, where our alignment with mETH Protocol came as a natural next step. More than 50 established incumbents —including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, PayPal, and Visa—have already built services on Ethereum. Wall Street has made its decision. Our role now is to extend the benefits of this macro tailwind to a broader base of institutional and retail participants worldwide.” Its leadership team brings decades of experience from top-tier financial institutions, including Apollo Global Management, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Canaccord Genuity. Republic Technologies operates under the publicly listed company Beyond Medical Technologies Inc. , a technology firm integrating blockchain infrastructure to drive operational efficiency and improve patient outcomes across the medical ecosystem. In March 2025, Republic Technologies entered into a licensing agreement and launched its medical attestation platform, leveraging Ethereum-based distributed systems to power healthcare data integrity and regulatory compliance. The Ethereum treasury was established to support and scale this vision, marking a first-of-its-kind integration. Institutional Alignment with Mantle’s Yield Infrastructure Mantle’s mETH Protocol has quickly emerged as one of the leading platforms in Ethereum liquid staking and restaking. Within just 66 days of launch, it surpassed $1 billion in TVL —the fastest growth in its category—and has since peaked at over $2.19 billion. Designed with institutional-grade capital efficiency and composability in mind, mETH enables institutions to access Ethereum-native yield through a fully composable and capital-efficient framework. To date, over 170,000 mETH (approximately $455 million) has been restaked into EigenDA, securing Mantle’s modular data availability layer. Validator operations are distributed across leading infrastructure providers, including Stakefish, P2P.org, Blockdaemon, A41, and Veda, ensuring high availability and robust institutional reliability. “Republic Technologies’ participation highlights mETH Protocol’s ability to support institutional strategies built natively on Ethereum,” said Jonathan Low, Growth Lead at mETH Protocol . “As demand accelerates for ETH-native yield and utility, we remain focused on building resilient infrastructure that long-term allocators can trust.” Looking Ahead: MI4 and Mantle Banking The partnership precedes mETH’s inclusion in MI4 , a tokenized, yield-focused index fund developed in collaboration with Securitize—the tokenization firm behind BlackRock’s BUIDL and Apollo’s ACRED. Backed by up to $400 million anchor investment from the Mantle Treasury, MI4 targets $1 billion in AUM and will offer regulated exposure to BTC, ETH, SOL, stablecoins, and select staking assets, with mETH playing a central role in its ETH allocation strategy. In parallel, Mantle is preparing to extend mETH’s utility across traditional finance through Mantle Banking , an initiative that will integrate mETH into fiat rails, credit products, and conventional payment systems. This integration will allow users to spend, borrow, and invest with mETH across traditional payment rails, unlocking real-world utility for digital assets.

Top spots now position Bitcoin just behind gold ($22T), Microsoft ($3.3T), Apple ($3.1T), and Nvidia ($2.5T). This rise highlights Bitcoin's shift from a specialist digital commodity to store-of-value standard, with supporters pointing to its decentralization and finite supply (only 21 million BTC will be produced). The journey here has been nothing short of phenomenal. Bitcoin, which was dismissed as a speculative experiment, is now keeping company with the likes of Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and gold. Its market cap, which is determined by multiplying its price at any time by the number of coins in circulation, recently crossed the two-trillion-dollar mark. Amazon, on the other hand, has had its own valuation drop slightly this year, which has enabled Bitcoin to move up the rankings. This rush is a demonstration of the continued development of Bitcoin both as a store of value and as an investable asset class. Bitcoin and Big Tech: A New Asset Class The most interesting aspect of this comparison, however, is how Bitcoin's market capitalization stacks up against traditional equities. Unlike Amazon or Microsoft shares, where a significant portion of the shares can be held by insiders or locked up, nearly all Bitcoin is tradable. That makes its market cap a more liquid and transparent valuation Conversely, tech behemoths have a lower ”free-float” market capitalization, as not all the shares are up for public grabs at any one time. The discrepancy is a testament to Bitcoin's odd status in the financial universe: it's a borderless, worldwide asset with no boardroom and no central authority, yet now it's competing with the most powerful companies on the planet. On everyone's lips is whether the valuation of Bitcoin is justified, and whether it can go higher still. To this end, Metcalfe's Law has some interesting insights. The law, originally applied to telecommunications networks, says that the value of a network grows exponentially as it adds more users. For Bitcoin, the active addresses and users have gone up steadily over the years, and its price has always followed suit. If the number of users is doubled, the theoretical value of the network would be four times higher according to this law. The last several years have seen Bitcoin's user count and market capitalization both increase together, giving some validity to the idea that its increase is not merely speculative but being driven by increasing utility and adoption. Naturally, Metcalfe's Law is not a crystal ball. Bitcoin's value is notoriously volatile, and short-term price moves tend to outstrip shifts in user base. Exogenous shocks — regulatory announcements, macroeconomic trends, or even breakthrough technical advances—can all move the price in ways network theory cannot anticipate. But the underlying trend is unmistakable: the more people and institutions that come into Bitcoin, the greater its network effect, which could well set the stage for future appreciation. Mining Profitability at All-Time Highs This fresh all-time high has also reshaped the environment for Bitcoin miners, the individuals and organizations that secure the network and confirm transactions. It has turned mining into enormously lucrative business at these price points for anyone with access to effective hardware and cheap electricity. The payoff for mining a new block has never been greater in dollar terms, even as competition has increased and the worldwide hash rate has hit record highs. Big mining ventures, particularly those based on renewable energy, are now experiencing reasonable margins, but smaller players might find it difficult to keep pace with escalating costs and technological requirements. Most interestingly, some mining companies are starting to diversify their business models, expanding into ancillary fields such as hosting artificial intelligence data. By taking advantage of existing infrastructure, such companies aim to acquire new sources of revenue and protect against potential future price volatility or mining difficulty for Bitcoin. This is reflective of a larger trend: as Bitcoin matures, the ecosystem that underpins it becomes more sophisticated and robust. Image suggestion: An infographic displaying the most significant factors in determining Bitcoin mining profitability, such as block rewards, hash rate, electricity cost, and equipment efficiency. Bitcoin as One of the World's Leading Assets The ramifications of Bitcoin's emergence are extensive. Bitcoin is no longer merely a speculative instrument or a cyber fad but has now captured the interest of institutional investors, governments, and ordinary savers. Its finite supply and decentralized ownership distinguish it from fiat currencies and corporate equities, with the conjunction of scarcity and accessibility. Whether it will eventually live up to its potential as ”digital gold” or mature into something else remains to be witnessed, but what it is currently doing is undeniable. As Bitcoin's market capitalization surpasses Amazon's, the world is watching economic influence get rewritten. The ascendance of the cryptocurrency isn't a tale of price graphs or headlines, but an indicator of more profound shifts in how humans consider tech, trust, and value. Though controversies and challenges undoubtedly remain, Bitcoin's status as one of the globe's leading assets is now firmly established. The only question now for watchers and investors is no longer if Bitcoin has earned its place at the table, but how far it may have to continue from here.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-22 14:05:35

Solana’s (SOL) new partnership will enable financial institutions to build on its scalable blockchain infrastructure. On Thursday, May 22, R3 has partnered with the Solana Foundation to use the Solana network for its private blockchains. R3 will deploy its permissioned consensus module directly on Solana. This module will act as a bridge between Corda, R3’s private ledger designed for institutions, and Solana’s public blockchain. In this model, Solana will validate transactions and serve as the consensus layer for R3’s private networks. The partnership aims to deliver “the first enterprise-grade, permissioned consensus service offered to the public directly on a Layer 1 network,” according to R3’s press release. The goal is to bring traditional finance and decentralized finance into closer alignment. Despite the collaboration, Corda’s networks will remain private and permissioned. Transactions will only be visible to the involved parties. The network will publish just enough information to validate transactions, without making them publicly accessible.

These include bonds, securities, and other assets issued by financial institutions on Corda. According to Lily Liu, president of the Solana Foundation, the integration marks a major step toward institutional adoption of public blockchain infrastructure.

They provide an immutable ledger for storing critical data, including transactions, accounts, and supply chain records. Unlike public blockchains, however, only approved participants can access or interact with the data.

If Bitcoin goes to 212k, I make 1k. Yea, ok… nobody will get rich.” Her comment, while seemingly cynical, sparked a broader conversation about Bitcoin’s evolving role in the financial landscape. Responding to this , market commentary outlet Sistine Research offered a piercing counterpoint: “BTC is transitioning from an asset for those who want to get rich to an asset for those who want to stay rich. If you’re still poor, BTC is not for you.” Sistine Research’s remark is more than a rebuke—it’s a reality check that underscores how Bitcoin has matured from a speculative bet into a globally recognized store of value. The golden era of life-changing gains for early adopters may be behind us, but in its place lies Bitcoin’s growing stature as a macro hedge, a preservation tool, and a monetary stronghold in an increasingly unstable economic world. BTC is transitioning from an asset for those who want to get rich to an asset for those who want to stay rich. If you're still poor BTC is not for you. — Sistine Research (@sistineresearch) May 21, 2025 From Speculation to Preservation Bitcoin’s early promise was astronomical returns, with modest investments potentially yielding life-changing wealth. However, as Bitcoin hits a new all-time high and the asset inches closer to institutional adoption at scale, its price behavior and investor profile are shifting. Today’s typical Bitcoin buyer has shifted from retail speculators to institutional investors like hedge funds, pension managers, and high-net-worth individuals. For these players, the goal isn’t to turn $1,000 into $100,000—it’s to shield large pools of capital from inflation, debasement, and systemic risk. Sistine Research’s insight reflects this paradigm shift. For those with limited capital hoping for exponential gains, Bitcoin may no longer be the right tool. The reality is stark: doubling $1,000, while mathematically a 100% gain, doesn’t meaningfully change most people’s lives. But for someone with $10 million, preserving that wealth from erosion with a 20% allocation to a non-sovereign, scarce asset like Bitcoin becomes a rational strategy. Bitcoin as Digital Gold for the Wealthy The analogy of Bitcoin as “digital gold” has never been more appropriate. Just as gold ceased to be a vehicle for rapid wealth creation after its initial rise, Bitcoin increasingly serves as a hedge against fiat instability. This transition is not theoretical—it’s being actively cemented through regulatory approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, custody solutions by major financial institutions, and sovereign-level interest in Bitcoin as an asset class. The result is a bifurcated market, where the wealthy use BTC to preserve capital across generations, and the rest are left grappling with the sobering realization that Bitcoin’s rocket-ship phase may have already departed. It’s a shift that mirrors the broader dynamics of wealth inequality, where assets that were once accessible and transformative for the masses eventually become tools of insulation for the elite. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What This Means for the Average Investor Sistine Research’s statement, while potentially exclusionary, provides a clear perspective. With Bitcoin’s volatility decreasing, institutions playing a bigger role, and upside potential diminishing, it might not be the best bet for those seeking life-changing returns overnight. That said, it doesn’t imply Bitcoin is useless for the average investor—it still represents a superior savings technology compared to inflationary fiat currencies. But expectations need to be tempered. The days of turning a few thousand dollars into a mansion and a Lambo are largely behind us. What remains is a digital fortress for capital, not a lottery ticket for the desperate. The Next Chapter of Bitcoin Bitcoin’s journey from internet curiosity to monetary pillar has been extraordinary. Its purpose and user base have shifted. As Sistine Research rightly notes, BTC is no longer the playground of the hopeful poor. It’s becoming the vault of the already rich, a sophisticated mechanism for wealth preservation in a world that increasingly demands it. For latecomers, Bitcoin’s value lies in its strategic, long-term potential as a safeguard, rather than a get-rich-quick opportunity.

Buy-and-distribute fuels demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction with its buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of platform revenue buys back MUTM tokens from the market, redistributing them to mtToken stakers. This creates steady demand, reducing sell pressure and supporting long-term price growth. The team recently launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. This incentivizes loyalty and fuels engagement. With phase 5 underway at $0.03, investors face a 16.7% price jump to $0.035 in phase 6, offering current buyers a 16.67% gain from the previous $0.03 price, making it a top crypto to invest in.

The team is finalizing a CertiK smart contract audit, with results soon to be shared on social channels, boosting trust. This positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a leading choice for those seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in today. Stablecoin and ecosystem growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expanding its ecosystem with an overcollateralized stablecoin. Minted when users deposit collateral, this stablecoin enhances liquidity and attracts institutional interest. Unlike centralized alternatives, it aligns with DeFi’s decentralized ethos, ensuring transparency. The platform’s 4 billion token supply allocates funds for liquidity mining, partnerships, and development, fostering sustainability. Dynamic interest rates adjust to market conditions, balancing returns for lenders and borrowers.

Nexchain’s $2.7M Raise Signals Explosive Upside,https://thecoinrise.com/best-presale-crypto-right-now-nexchains-2-7m-raise-signals-explosive-upside/,"As the 2025 bull cycle approaches, crypto presales appear to be among the most attractive options for early-stage investors. With institutional money looking for fresh blockchain breakthroughs and retail interest returning, presales with actual benefit and solid ecosystems are poised to skyrocket in value. Nexchain is leading the race as the best presale to purchase today, with AI-powered scalability, unrivaled transaction speed, and smart interoperability. Despite other competitors making noise, only a few ventures deliver on innovation and long-term ROI potential. Let’s look at the top three presale cryptos to watch in 2025. Nexchain Crypto Presale Is Redefining Speed, Utility, and Blockchain Innovation Nexchain’s cryptocurrency presale is generating buzz for all the right reasons. Currently at stage 14, the NEX token is valued at $0.054 and has raised more than $2.7 million from enthusiastic investors. What distinguishes Nexchain is its 400,000 TPS capabilities, which are achieved by AI optimization and simultaneous data processing. This guarantees that transactions occur instantly, even during peak network activity. At the heart of its performance is a novel hybrid consensus that combines Proof-of-Stake with AI-driven algorithms to deliver rock-solid security and lightning-fast speed. The platform also excels at interoperability. Nexchain’s cross-chain bridges enable a smooth connection between multiple blockchains, establishing itself as a real link in the fragmented crypto industry. Whether you’re a developer creating dApps or an investor staking coins, Nexchain provides tools, SDKs, and APIs for quick creation and real-world applications. From gas efficiency to developer assistance, Nexchain’s ecosystem is designed for size and sustainability, making it a strong candidate among the finest crypto presales for 2025. Experience Revolutionary Revenue Sharing for NEX Token Holders At Nexchain, every holder has a stake in the platform’s everyday success. Simply storing NEX tokens in a non-custodial wallet earns users a daily portion of 10% of all gas fees earned across the network. This automated distribution approach assures that devoted members receive regular returns without having to jump through hoops. It is a long-term value mechanism that perfectly complements Nexchain’s concept of a fair, decentralized, and community-powered blockchain. As usage develops, so does the reward pool, providing token holders with an additional reason to keep and engage in the ecosystem over time NEX Coin Utility: The Best Among the Crypto Presale List The NEX coin is more than simply a placeholder; it is the driving force behind the Nexchain ecosystem. It enables quick, low-cost transactions while removing network congestion. Users who purchase NEX currency benefit from cheaper gas prices for both financial transfers and smart contract engagements, owing to validator incentives. Token holders may also stake NEX in smart contracts to promote the hybrid consensus while receiving passive revenue. But Nexchain does not end there. The platform also provides a truly decentralized government. When you participate in the presale, you have a say in influencing future upgrades, protocol changes, and ecosystem choices, ensuring that your investment is both useful and influential. Why Nexchain Is the Ultimate Winner in 2025 Presales While many cryptocurrency initiatives give hype, Nexchain provides substance. Its AI-powered speed, revolutionary hybrid consensus, and daily revenue-sharing model provide a potent combination for long-term success. With $2.7 million raised and stage 14 pricing still available, now is the time to act. Nexchain is more than just a token; it’s a whole blockchain infrastructure built to reward users and expand with demand. As the market heats up, Nexchain emerges as the best cryptocurrency presale to purchase in 2025 for maximum ROI. The post Best Presale Crypto Right Now?

All this optimism happened in the crypto, due to a variety of factors like BTC’s recent all-time high , but tomorrow it has a big presale event . In particular, it is in a strong optimistic situation that can pump some serious gains this time. Even experts have begun predicting big moves to come soon and are predicting moves towards new all-time highs. Keep reading to know more. Floki Minibot M1: Will It Be A Catalyst For Floki Price Rise?

It is a companion robot, which Rice robotics claims would be useful for daily task assistance, like reminding, scheduling, and searching online, whatever the users desire. As for Rice Robotics, it’s a startup with high-profile partners like Nvidia, Softbank, and others. Moreover, this robot is a representation of Floki’s utility. On its successful launch tomorrow, Floki could see strong adoption from retail and institutions both. There is a pretty high chance that on May 23rd onwards, the FLOKI price could show a bullish momentum and head northwards.

Sometimes things are simple. $FLOKI pic.twitter.com/v7B3ijWpVb — Inmortal (@inmortalcrypto) May 21, 2025 Among them, an analyst named inmortalcrypto gave a strong Floki price projection towards an all-time high. In his chart, he showed that the Floki price would reach the Q4 2024 high of $0.0002995 very fast. Moreover, the Fibonacci tool shows on the daily chart that in the short term, $0.000171 would act as a magnet, once the Floki price clears the previous swing high of $0.000115. However, in the long term, the Floki price needs to break the fibo 0.5 level at $0.00017 and the fibo 0.62 level at $0.00020. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Dogecoin Price Eyes $0.31 as Whale Activity Sparks Rally , Addresses GIOM Data Speaks Optimism For Floki Price As per IntoTheBlock’s data, the Global In/Out of the money data shows that the profitable addresses that hold Floki balance in their wallets are 63.97%.

However, in the worst-case scenario, the $0.000025 to $0.000037 zone is a strong support zone, as the majority are positive in this zone. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has always had a little quirk that confuses even longtime users: the way it’s measured. Officially, one Bitcoin equals 100 million “base units” — also called “satoshis” or “sats” — but in the industry, it’s usually discussed in decimals, like 0.0001 BTC or 0.345 BTC. This setup, while familiar, can sometimes be a bit of a mess. And now, there’s a proposal on the table that might just shake things up. The idea behind BIP-0177 , submitted by Synonym.to CEO John Carvalho and Bitcoin developer Mark “Murch” Erhardt, is pretty simple: it wants to flip the whole system on its head by redefining one Bitcoin to actually mean one base unit. That means the smallest indivisible unit of Bitcoin would become the main reference point. No more decimals, no more fractions — just whole numbers. So what used to be “1 Bitcoin” (or 100 million base units) would become 100 million Bitcoins, and what the industry used to think of as a satoshi would simply be called a Bitcoin. The proposal may seem unconventional, but its backers argue it could help clarify much of the confusion surrounding Bitcoin’s underlying structure as the update “aims to simplify user comprehension, reduce confusion, and align on-chain values directly with their displayed representation,” the proposal says. Decimal mindset Currently, Bitcoin’s ledger records all transactions in discrete, indivisible units — whole numbers. The decimals commonly used are human-imposed abstractions, comparable to imagining that a dollar consists of a billion tiny cents. According to the proposal, this has fostered a “persistent decimal mindset” that misrepresents how Bitcoin actually works. In their own words, the current convention “requires dealing with eight simulated decimal places, which can be confusing and foster the misconception that bitcoin is inherently decimal-based.” Sats in 1 Bitcoin | Source: River So, by redefining the base unit as “one Bitcoin,” BIP-0177 aims to align the displayed values with the underlying structure of the network. This change would eliminate the need to interpret small decimal values, such as 0.000001 BTC, and instead present all amounts as whole numbers. To give an example, something that today displays as 0.00010000 BTC would become ₿10,000, or just 10,000 Bitcoins under the new system. Ten Bitcoins today? That would be ₿1,000,000,000 or one billion Bitcoins. The currency code BTC remains unchanged, so when someone says 1 BTC, they still mean the old standard of 100 million base units. But in user interfaces and apps, the new “Bitcoin” would be the base unit. ‘Will reduce clarity’ This switch isn’t mandatory, though. Applications would be able to offer toggles between the old decimal system and the new integral one, easing users into the change. The proposal even suggests using the ₿ symbol optionally to represent the base-unit bitcoin. MNEE CEO Ron Tarter agrees that removing the decimal place will be easier for everyday people to understand, but warns about naming confusion. “Removing the decimal place will be easier for everyday people to understand. However, the name of the base unit should either stay as ‘sats’ or be renamed to a word that is not already being used to describe a sum of BTC. That will reduce clarity rather than enhance it. Whether you call it a“sat” or something else, most new users still need someone to explain what it is and why owning a small piece of Bitcoin/BTC is valuable. That confusion doesn’t go away with a rename.” Ron Tarter You might also like: Kraken may know Satoshi’s identity: Coinbase director The motivation behind BIP-0177 isn’t just about aesthetics. The BIP team argues that the shift would: Simplify mental arithmetic by using integers only, which could reduce user errors. Align user perception with how Bitcoin actually works, counting whole units, not decimals. Make it easier to teach newcomers about Bitcoin, by removing a confusing decimal layer. Future-proof Bitcoin’s units for growth and adoption, avoiding the need for more denominations or decimals down the line. There’s also a bit about perception. Since the total supply of base units is about 2.1 quadrillion, the new counting method makes Bitcoin’s supply look huge. But the proposal points out this is just a representation change, not a supply increase. It’s similar to how currencies like the Japanese yen or Indonesian rupiah have high unit counts, but nobody thinks of those as inflated. Cleaner fix Not everyone agrees with BIP-0177’s approach. An alternative, BIP-176, suggested using “bits” — each bit being one-millionth of a Bitcoin (or 100 satoshis) — to reduce decimal places. But BIP-0177’s authors think that still keeps you stuck in the decimal mindset. Bits just shift the problem around, forcing users to juggle multiple denominations (BTC and bits). They say the “bits” proposal “does not realign the displayed value with the integral nature of Bitcoin’s ledger,” adding that “it continues to rely on fractional units, masking the fundamental integer-based accounting that Bitcoin employs.” In other words, BIP-0177 sees itself as a cleaner, more durable fix by cutting out fractions altogether. GoMining CEO Mark Zalan told crypto.news that Bitcoin’s biggest challenge in the coming crypto cycle is moving beyond its role as a store of value — often called “digital gold” — toward becoming a true medium of exchange. He believes that increased transaction activity on the Bitcoin network will drive mass adoption and multiply Bitcoin’s value many times over. “We believe this innovation may be a move in the right direction: it makes it easier for users to pay and manage balances in hundred-millionth units. Whether this fraction is called a satoshi or a bit is ultimately a matter of preference. Overall, the proposal is useful.” Mark Zalan Zalan stressed that mass adoption hinges on solving two key issues: instant transaction confirmation, which is necessary for supporting a broad network of point-of-sale terminals, and keeping transaction fees low. One tricky part is the term “satoshi” or “sat,” which many in the community love. It’s a nod to Bitcoin’s mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto , and “stacking sats” has become a meme. The proposal acknowledges that, saying that “while culturally valuable, the term introduces an implicit second denomination layer that contradicts the goal of this BIP.” The MNEE CEO says “sats” have become part of Bitcoin’s culture, adding that “it’s in the memes, the language of the community, and even the behavioural framing — people don’t just buy Bitcoin anymore, they ‘stack sats.'” He adds that while this debate may seem cosmetic, the cost is deeper than it appears. At best, it’s a lateral move in usability; at worst, it adds confusion and friction by forcing the community to relearn its own vocabulary. Tarter suggests that if renaming is necessary, the community might as well pick a name that actually signals meaning, like “fracks,” short for fractions, but really, “sats already work — and Bitcoin already earned that branding through adoption. Why change it away now?” Ideological shift The proposal doesn’t ban the word, but it does push for using “Bitcoin” as the sole unit in wallets, exchanges, and documentation to keep things simple and consistent. Tarter cautions that changing the name from “sat” to “Bitcoin” could make things more confusing for users. He noted that people are “already used to 100,000,000 satoshis being equal to 1 Bitcoin,” adding that “hundreds of millions of people are familiar with this framework.” “If you start referring to 1 satoshi as being 1 Bitcoin, that will obviously be confusing for a lot of people. Frankly, most users aren’t asking for a new name — they’re asking for clearer interfaces, simpler conversions, and fewer barriers to using Bitcoin in real life.” Ron Tarter This change wouldn’t alter Bitcoin’s blockchain or its consensus rules; it’s purely a shift in how values are displayed. The underlying ledger would continue to operate in base units as it always has. Implementing the new system would require developers to update user interfaces, APIs, and documentation, while adoption would involve a period of adjustment to viewing large whole numbers instead of decimals. That said, there are some concerns about confusion during the transition. People used to decimals might think their holdings suddenly jumped or shrank. To avoid that, the BIP recommends dual displays, tooltips, and clear education to help folks understand the equivalence. Interestingly, some wallets, like Bitkit, have already tried showing Bitcoin amounts as integers, and the experience has been smooth. The proposal lays out a phased approach to adoption: In the first 3-6 months, roll out dual displays and educational materials in pilot apps. Over 6-12 months, more services adopt integer-only displays by default, supported by community coordination. After a year or more, the integer format becomes the norm, and references to decimal Bitcoin fade away. Whether the Bitcoin community embraces this new way of thinking remains to be seen.

With the crypto market abuzz, it's crucial to identify which altcoins are poised for significant growth. This article reveals the top contenders set to soar, offering a timely glimpse into potential investment opportunities. Aptos Trends: Recent Gains Amid Long-Term Decline and Key Levels in View Aptos experienced a near 10% rise over the past month, despite a tough market environment. In contrast, the half-year review shows a significant decline of around 57%, highlighting volatility and changing market attitudes. Price fluctuations have been inconsistent, with some short-lived increases overshadowed by ongoing downward pressure. This history reveals moments of buying interest, although overall sentiment remains cautious. Currently, Aptos trades between approximately $4.26 and $6.08, with support identified around $3.17 and resistance at about $6.80. Bears appear to be in control with low momentum, and the lack of a clear trend reflects a mostly sideways market. Traders may want to buy near support levels while watching for opportunities if prices test resistance, being alert to potential breakouts or breakdowns. Stacks Analysis: 1-Month Surge Amidst 6-Month Decline and Key Levels Last month, STX advanced by 41.03%, while the past six months saw a 51.75% drop, indicating a notable short-term recovery against a backdrop of longer-term weakness. This price action has been volatile, with a significant monthly rebound contrasting with substantial half-year losses. Such behavior reveals mixed sentiment in recent market activity. Stacks currently trades between $0.55 and $1.00, with key resistance levels at $1.20 and $1.65, while support is found around $0.29. The RSI stands at 61.65, indicating a generally bullish tone, though momentum is near-neutral. Bulls have driven a modest 5.03% weekly gain, prompting traders to consider buying dips while keeping an eye on resistance levels for potential breakouts. SUI Price Surge Amidst Volatility and Defined Key Levels SUI experienced an 84.39% jump over the past month, demonstrating aggressive short-term momentum. Over the last six months, gains were more modest at 13.55%, reflecting a period of consolidation that contrasts with recent volatility. Price swings have been pronounced, showing rapid upward movement in the short term while maintaining steadier progress over the mid-term. Current trading sees SUI within a price range of $2.19 to $4.34. The nearest resistance is at $5.18, with support around $0.88 framing the market and a second resistance at $7.34. Bulls appear to dominate despite mixed signals from oscillators, suggesting trading near support levels for potential upward moves while remaining cautious near resistance zones. Conclusion Bitcoin's rise presents a unique chance to explore altcoins. APT , STX , and SUI are poised to benefit first. Each shows strong potential for growth. Keep an eye on their performance as they could provide good opportunities in the current market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Join Xpfinance Presale With XRP surging past $2.40 and Ripple’s recent landmark $50 million settlement injecting new momentum into the XRP community, there’s never been a better time to enter a project with real-world potential. XpFinance stands uniquely poised to become a dominant force within XRPL’s decentralized finance (XRPFI) space, setting a new standard for transparency, security, and user empowerment. XpFinance: Transforming XRPL’s DeFi Landscape For years, XRP holders have awaited a truly decentralized lending and borrowing solution, one that could leverage XRP Ledger’s remarkable speed, minimal transaction fees, and robust security. Centralized platforms have continually disappointed, plagued by custodial risks, hidden fees, and regulatory uncertainty. XpFinance directly addresses these long-standing issues by creating XRPL’s first fully decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing platform. It empowers XRP holders to effortlessly generate passive income and borrow against their holdings securely and transparently, all without ever relinquishing control over their assets. Why XRP Whales See XpFinance as the Future of DeFi The immediate presale success highlights why seasoned XRP whales are urgently shifting their attention and capital to XpFinance : Presale participants benefit from a fixed, presale rate of 1 XRP = 200 XPF. While listing on XP Market, a major XRPL decentralized exchange, is set at 1 XRP = 140 XPF, providing presale investors with an instant 30% profit upon listing. Holding XPF tokens unlocks consistent passive XRP income via staking rewards generated from protocol transaction fees. Moreover, token holders enjoy significantly reduced borrowing costs, enhancing platform profitability. XPF holders have voting power, actively shaping the future of the platform through governance, asset listings, and strategic decisions, ensuring ongoing community alignment.

44959778,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=756382,1747927809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/44959778.jpeg,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-1-absolutely-on-the-table-this-cycle/,"Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don’t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You’re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That’s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.241.

XRP’s gradual rise has been confirmed by several analysts, with some now expecting it to reach new highs. SHIB has managed to bounce back 12% from its recent dip, showing a solid reversal backed by chart indicators. Though both cryptos are regaining traction, Web3 ai is quickly being noticed as a promising alternative that could outperform both. Now in stage 5 of its presale and priced at only $0.000365, Web3 ai gives early participants a potential return of 1,747%, calculated from its confirmed listing price of $0.005242. The project has already raised nearly $5 million. As it develops a full range of AI-based trading features, Web3 ai is shaping up to be one of the top cryptos to buy now, not for short-term buzz, but for real long-term use. Web3 ai Offers AI Tools and a Massive 1,747% ROI Potential Web3 ai is currently in stage 5 of its presale, priced at just $0.000365, and has already raised nearly $5 million. The project presents a projected ROI of 1,747% for early buyers, based on its confirmed listing price of $0.005242. What makes it stand out is its focus on utility, as it develops powerful AI-based tools tailored for crypto traders. The Crypto Trading Assistant is designed to help users make data-based decisions. It uses machine learning and NLP to scan the market, detect patterns, and highlight buy/sell signals using RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands. Users can customize alerts based on their style and preferences. Also included is a DeFi Yield Farming Advisor. This tool compares farming opportunities across Polygon, Fantom, Ethereum, and BNB Chain. It assesses APRs, APYs, and token risks and supports features like auto-compounding and pool alerts, helping users farm more safely and efficiently. These tools are part of a single dashboard, allowing users to research and manage trades in one place. The native coin, $WAI, powers access to premium features, allows governance participation, and unlocks staking benefits, providing utility that goes beyond just holding. XRP’s Uptrend Driven by Technical Setups and Regulatory Clarity XRP has jumped over 9% this week and is holding key levels that suggest a bigger move may be coming. Kraken analysts suggest this upward momentum could carry it toward previous highs, citing steady buyer interest and a supportive legal environment. Its chart also paints a positive picture. A strong ascending triangle is forming, and RSI readings are still in the safe zone, suggesting further room to grow. MACD signals and rising volume add to the case for continued gains. Legal wins for Ripple Labs and ongoing ETF discussions are also building confidence around XRP. Together, these developments have reawakened trader interest. Still, while XRP could keep climbing, many are starting to turn their attention to Web3 ai for bigger early-stage upside. SHIB Gains 12% from Local Lows as Oversold Pressure Lifts SHIB’s recent trend reversal came after consistent selling had pushed it into oversold territory. A bounce of 12% from the bottom reflects renewed buying, with RSI crossing above 50 to confirm the rally’s strength. Support levels that SHIB has bounced from in the past are once again acting as strong zones. Despite its volatility, SHIB has shown an ability to attract short-term buyers when sentiment flips. Still, a few analysts warn that if SHIB continues its run too quickly, overbought indicators may soon appear. Without strong volume or ecosystem expansion, the current price rise may not last. In contrast, Web3 ai brings actual tools and usability that give it longer-term appeal. Final Thoughts! XRP’s strength is backed by bullish chart patterns and growing optimism around legal outcomes, while SHIB’s recent 12% move has revived some hope among traders. Both coins are in focus again, but their success depends on market sentiment and timing. Web3 ai is offering more than hype. With a current presale price of $0.000365 and a confirmed 1,747% ROI at listing, it brings tools that serve a purpose. From its Crypto Trading Assistant to its DeFi Yield Farming Advisor, the project focuses on giving users an edge. It’s being seen as one of the most promising cryptos right now , especially before it gets listed.

Mocking Message Embedded in Ethereum Transaction On May 21st, the hacker placed a message in Ethereum transaction input data that read “L bozo,” along with a meme video of NBA legend James Worthy smoking a cigar. The jab was clearly aimed at ZachXBT, a prominent onchain investigator who had previously pointed out the hacker’s wallet activity. ZachXBT highlighted the troll message on his Telegram channel, tracing it to the same address that is also linked to the Coinbase hack on over 69,000 users. Hacker Transfers Millions from Bitcoin to Ethereum and DAI Before posting the message, the hacker had swapped approximately $42.5 million in Bitcoin (BTC) for Ether (ETH) using the decentralized cross-chain protocol THORChain. On May 22, security firm PeckShield observed that the hacker also converted 8,697 ETH into 22 million DAI, while a second related address exchanged 9,081 ETH for 23 million DAI. Coinbase Breach Fallout: Ransom Demands and Lawsuits Coinbase first announced the breach in May 2025, with the attack itself traced to December 2024. The hacked data includes users’ names, addresses, and other identifying details. Once the breach had been confirmed, the attackers issued a ransom demand for $20 million in Bitcoin. Coinbase refused, instead issuing a bounty for the same value for information that would lead to their arrest. The financial damage has been estimated at between $180 million and $400 million, which has led to at least six lawsuits alleging negligence on the part of the exchange in its security measures. THORChain Under Fire For Criminal Utilization The hacker’s manipulation of THORChain has also provided fodder for the fears of the protocol being used in laundering illicit funds. The protocol, which facilitates anonymous crypto swaps, had previously been in the news following the $1.4 billion Bybit hack in March. Security firms blamed that exploit on the Lazarus Group of North Korea as the likely perpetrator, with THORChain being allegedly used to launder significant sums. The platform had processed $5.4 billion in swaps over a month, with $5 million in revenue. Controversy deepened when the resignation of one THORChain developer, “Pluto,” came after an unsuccessful governance vote to block addresses that were associated with Lazarus.",Blockchain|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|DAI,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-22 15:36:00

We're pleased to welcome @GSR_io , a globally recognized trading firm, as an official market maker for $S . Beyond liquidity, GSR is backing builders and fueling DeFi growth across the Sonic ecosystem. https://t.co/FFaGfZhNR2 pic.twitter.com/7blMd4P1c7 — Sonic Labs (@SonicLabs) May 22, 2025 In a blog post , Sonic Labs said its reason for working with GSR, a crypto capital markets firm, is due to the firm bringing over a decade of experience, regulatory credibility, and a strong reputation for transparency. This collaboration is not just about trading—it’s about building a sustainable digital asset environment that supports both liquidity and long-term project development, said the firm. GSR to Support Sonic Labs While market making is at the core of GSR’s role, its involvement with Sonic Labs will reach far beyond just token liquidity, according to the firm. GSR will deploy liquidity across Sonic’s entire DeFi stack, offering strategic support to early-stage teams and helping them bring their tokens to market with confidence. “We support innovative protocols with liquidity, helping founders get tokens market-ready, and encourage sustainable on-chain activity to drive long-term growth,” Head of U.S. Business Development at GSR, Alex Taaffe, said. This hands-on approach positions GSR not only as a service provider but as a long-term ecosystem partner. Active Engagement Through Events and Community GSR’s connection with Sonic goes deeper than platform integration. For example, the firm recently sponsored Sonic Summit 2025, held in Vienna from May 6–8, which brought together builders, investors, and infrastructure leaders from across Web3. GSR’s sponsorship and presence at the summit showed its commitment to the community side of the ecosystem as well. Sonic Labs CEO Michael Kong emphasized the importance of such holistic relationships, stating, “We seek partners who are embedded in the network, contribute to DeFi, engage with projects directly, and support global community events. GSR exemplifies this standard.” Sonic Labs Secures Court-Ordered Multichain Liquidation This month, the High Court of Singapore approved a winding-up order against Multichain Foundation Ltd following a 2023 security breach that caused over $210 million in user losses. The order, issued on May 9 , 2025, came in response to a petition filed by Sonic Labs, which was among the platforms affected by the hack. The court appointed Bob Yap Cheng Ghee, Toh Ai Ling, and Tan Yen Chiaw of KPMG Services Pte. Ltd. as joint and several liquidators of the Multichain Foundation. The liquidators will oversee the company’s dissolution and asset recovery, including compensation claims brought by Sonic Labs and other affected parties. This legal outcome follows a default judgment issued earlier this year in favor of Sonic Labs, which sought damages for losses incurred during the exploit.

Over 60 million XRP sold by whales in 72 hours, signaling major portfolio moves. CME recently introduced XRP and Micro XRP futures, boosting institutional access to XRP. Volatility Shares is preparing to launch the industry’s first XRP futures ETF on May 22. Trading under the ticker XRPI, the product will mainly invest in XRP futures contracts. This is a significant moment for XRP, since it allows investors to access XRP through regulated investments rather than holding the token directly. The launch occurred after XRP futures were introduced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The launch of XRP derivatives on CME reflected the rising need among institutions for regulated XRP products. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has pointed out that the Volatility Shares ETF is the first of its kind in the crypto market, unlike the current 2x leveraged XRP ETFs.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has gained momentum, supported by bullish trends in the broader crypto market and growth in several network indicators. On Thursday, May 22, Dogecoin traded at 0.2410 dollars, up 6 percent over the past 24 hours. The rally coincided with a spike in social media interest for Dogecoin, as traders once again express bullish sentiment. Among them is crypto trader and analyst Ali Martinez, who noted that Dogecoin may be on the verge of a potential breakout to 0.31 dollars. #Dogecoin $DOGE appears to be breaking out of a bull pennant, which suggests a target of $0.31! pic.twitter.com/Hbzuwd7Akk — Ali (@ali_charts) May 22, 2025 Additionally, Dogecoin’s price has formed a head and shoulders pattern , a classic technical formation that often signals an upcoming breakout. The pattern, which developed over several weeks, pushed Dogecoin as high as 0.25 dollars. The asset now appears to be retesting support, with a potential upside target of 0.30 dollars.

Dogecoin’s rise partially reflects momentum across the crypto market. On the same day, Bitcoin broke to a new all-time high of 111,861 dollars. Most of the top 100 crypto assets were trading in the green, with several posting double-digit gains. Beyond market-wide trends, Dogecoin is also benefiting from strong technicals and improving on-chain metrics. Notably, whales continue to accumulate the asset. Addresses holding between 1 and 10 million Dogecoin have added about 800 million tokens since the start of May. Network activity has also surged. Active Dogecoin addresses rose by 990 percent over the past week. This sharp uptick came as Coinbase issued a wrapped version of Dogecoin, known as cbDOGE, on the Base network. This new version enables users to stake, trade, and lend their Dogecoin tokens on Base-based decentralized finance platforms. Traders are also speculating on the potential approval of several Dogecoin exchange-traded funds, including proposed offerings from Grayscale and Bitwise.

In a recent post on X, Amonyx confidently asserted , “Nothing is stopping $XRP from reaching $20+ now. It’s inevitable.” This statement, though ambitious, is firmly rooted in a series of converging developments within the broader crypto market, Ripple’s ongoing strategic advancements, and the evolving regulatory landscape that continues to favor XRP’s long-term viability. There is nothing stopping $XRP reaching $20+ now. It’s inevitable pic.twitter.com/Jkarqx8of9 — Amonyx (@amonbuy) May 22, 2025 Ripple’s Strategic Positioning Strengthens XRP’s Fundamentals Ripple, the blockchain company behind XRP, has established itself as a leader in institutional payments, operating in over 50 countries and partnering with central banks. By continually developing the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , Ripple has solidified XRP’s value as a utility-driven asset with real-world applications. Unlike thousands of digital assets with speculative valuations, XRP’s integration into Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors across key regions like Africa , Asia-Pacific, and Latin America has significantly boosted its real-world utility. Ripple’s recent foray into stablecoin issuance further underscores its commitment to building global liquidity infrastructure. These developments support Amonyx’s assertion by creating sustained demand-side pressure that could drive a substantial price surge. Regulatory Clarity: A Major Catalyst for XRP’s Trajectory Amonyx’s projection also arrives when XRP is enjoying a unique level of regulatory clarity in the United States. The landmark ruling delivered by Judge Analisa Torres in July 2023 confirmed that XRP is not a security when sold on exchanges to retail investors. This legal milestone not only distinguished XRP from a host of other tokens currently in legal limbo but also opened the door for greater institutional adoption and exchange listings. While the broader cryptocurrency market remains plagued by doubt due to ongoing SEC litigation against major platforms, XRP has, in many respects, emerged from regulatory purgatory. This factor reduces XRP’s investment risk, making it more attractive to institutional investors like hedge funds and high-net-worth individuals. As such, market sentiment has turned decisively bullish, aligning with Amonyx’s forecast. XRP Ledger Advancements and EVM Compatibility Beyond Ripple’s enterprise partnerships, the XRP Ledger continues to evolve technologically . The upcoming launch of the XRPL EVM sidechain, developed in collaboration with Peersyst Technology, is poised to dramatically expand XRP’s utility within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Once live, this sidechain will allow developers to deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts directly on XRPL, bringing DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized applications (dApps) into the XRP ecosystem, without compromising speed, scalability, or low transaction fees. This development marks a significant breakthrough, addressing one of XRP’s long-standing limitations: limited programmability. With the EVM sidechain enabling compatibility with Solidity, the dominant programming language for DeFi applications, XRP is well-positioned to attract a new wave of developers and projects. This evolution enhances the token’s network value and supports the narrative of a sustainable climb toward the $20+ valuation proposed by Amonyx. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Macro Tailwinds and Historical Context On the macro front, Bitcoin’s post-halving cycle momentum, growing global inflation concerns, and the accelerating de-dollarization trend all contribute to increased interest in alternative assets, including XRP. As investors search for inflation-resistant assets and faster, cheaper remittance options, XRP’s appeal grows beyond speculative trading and moves toward global financial utility. Historically, XRP has demonstrated the capacity for explosive growth in relatively short time frames. During the 2017–2018 bull market, it surged to over $3.80 within a year, despite limited adoption and an undeveloped ecosystem at the time. Given the significantly more robust infrastructure surrounding XRP today, a similar or greater run is not outside the realm of possibility, especially if institutional inflows and global liquidity expand. Final Thoughts Amonyx’s assertion that nothing is stopping XRP from reaching $20+ reflects conviction and a synthesis of underlying trends. From Ripple’s expanding enterprise footprint and XRP Ledger’s technical upgrades to the favorable legal environment and macroeconomic catalysts, the conditions supporting a parabolic XRP breakout are arguably stronger than ever before. While price predictions in crypto are always speculative to some extent, the current alignment of fundamentals, regulatory clarity, and strategic momentum gives Amonyx’s forecast a degree of credibility that warrants serious attention. For XRP holders and potential investors, the path to $20 may no longer be a distant dream—it could very well be the next chapter in the asset’s evolving story.

According to DeLorean, its Build Slot NFT collection grants holders priority access to purchase DeLorean’s upcoming electric car, Alpha 5 EV. The model is the carmaker’s first vehicle in over 40 years, inspired by the iconic flux capacitor from the movie Back to the Future. The company created an exclusive marketplace for its NFT holders, in which users can buy or trade the NFTs using the USDC ( USDC ) stablecoin on the Sui network and will be able to earn rewards. DeLorean says that each vehicle’s history and performance data will be recorded onchain through the FLUX protocol, including key data such as battery health, maintenance records, accident history, and verified odometer readings. This detailed data makes it easier for auto enthusiasts to bid on or resell vehicles in the secondary market, the company said. DeLorean NFT platform.

Rising stablecoin supply and global M2 growth indicate untapped liquidity and the potential for further price increases. Long-term holders are not aggressively selling, reflecting their expectation for continued Bitcoin price appreciation. Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high on May 21, with prices rising to $111,860 on Binance on May 22, but the markets lack the state of frenzy associated with new highs. Economist and crypto commentator Alex Krüger noted that “this is the least euphoric new all-time highs” for Bitcoin, after highlighting subdued funding rates for Bitcoin across crypto exchanges. Bitcoin price and aggregated funding rate. Source: Coinalyze The chart illustrates that the current BTC funding rate is significantly below previous market highs observed during March and November 2024. The funding rate was six times higher in Q1 and three times higher in Q4 last year. These low rates indicate minimal speculative activity in the futures market, with the rally driven by spot buyers rather than leveraged traders, reducing the risk of over-leveraged corrections. Such a scenario also indicates that Bitcoin might not have reached a state of euphoria yet. The availability of untapped liquidity in the crypto ecosystem underscores the potential for further growth. Stablecoin market capitalization, often a leading indicator of incoming capital, has risen to 14% in 2025 . Tether’s (USDT) market cap jumped to $152 billion from $139 billion in January, while Circle’s USDC supply has increased by 35% to $58 billion. Total stablecoin supply. Source: Token Terminal Stablecoins often act as a bridge for new capital entering the crypto market, and their growth suggests a substantial pool of liquidity that has yet to be fully deployed into Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Additionally, global liquidity trends provide further tailwinds. The global M2 money supply, which measures the total money in circulation across major economies, grew by 5% in Q1 2025, driven by monetary policy adjustments in the US, EU, and Japan. Cointelegraph reported a strong correlation, exceeding 80%, between Bitcoin’s price and global liquidity, typically with a 60-day lag, pointing to further buying pressure in the coming months.

Despite the new highs, profit-taking among Bitcoin holders remains restrained. The data analytics platform noted, “When $BTC hit all-time high yesterday, total profit-taking volume was around $1.00B - less than half the amount realized when #BTC first crossed $100K last December, which hit $2.10B. Despite a higher price, profit realization was far more muted.” This muted activity suggests that long-term holders are not rushing to cash out, which typically reflects confidence in further price appreciation.

The warning, issued by the Netherlands’ central bank, finance ministry, and other organizations, also highlighted the heightened geopolitical tensions and current cybersecurity threats that could challenge payment systems around the world. Central bank urges Dutch citizens to prep for electronic payments crisis Dutch consumers and retailers alike should be ready for emergencies that bring down electronic payments for 72 hours or more, De Nederlandsche Bank ( DNB ) has warned, weeks after a breakdown in the Spanish power grid shut down payment systems across the Iberian Peninsula. “That could be the case if payment terminals are not working, ATMs are down, or online banking cannot be used,” the monetary authority said in a warning issued together with commercial banks, consumer organizations, retail associations, the Ministry of Finance, and other institutions participating in the country’s National Forum on the Payment System (NFPS). It further detailed: “Consumers are advised to keep around €70 per person (€30 per child) in cash on hand and to have multiple means of payment to prepare for such situations.” The central bank highlighted that having a mobile banking app may be helpful as well, as it could serve as a means to transfer money and pay online. “If payment terminals no longer work, this can be a good alternative,” the regulator said, adding that those who prefer to make payments using their smartphones should also have a debit card with them or at home. It advised retailers, including shops, restaurants, petrol stations, and pharmacies, to maintain payment options like apps using QR codes and to keep enough change in their registers for at least three days of system outages. The call for cash is included in a “resilience advice” for emergency situations published by the NFPS, part of the broader “Think Ahead” initiative of the Dutch government. The latter seeks to prepare the society for multi-day outages, the DNB noted in a press release. The serious breakdown of Spain’s power distribution network in April left millions of people in the country and in neighboring Portugal without electricity and access to basic services while disrupting card payments and ATM withdrawals across the region.

The plan to explore short-term measures meant to ensure resilient payments in the Netherlands was announced by the NFPS in November 2024. The suggested €70 – €30 (approx. $80 – $35) emergency cash is based on calculations made by the National Institute for Family Finance Information, the DNB noted, elaborating: “Consumers can, of course, decide for themselves whether the recommended amount meets their needs, or whether they want to adjust the amount according to their own expenses and budget.” Citing the NFPS, the financial authority went on to advise Dutch citizens to hold both banknotes and coins in their wallets. “Many consumers already keep some cash at home, including for emergency situations. If the cash amount at home is not yet sufficient, it can be gradually built up over a few months by setting aside change from time to time,” the bank proposed. The notice assured that De Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch ATM operator Geldmaat, and security transport companies have sufficient supplies of euro cash in store to meet any additional demand from the public. Last month’s massive blackout in Spain spurred demand for cash , the use of which the Spanish government has been trying to reduce in recent years. The few stores that remained open in the midst of the crisis were accepting mainly paper money and metal coins.

XRP, currently hovering around $2.32, is gaining momentum as regulatory clarity edges closer, positioning Ripple to reclaim its place among the top cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA), trading near $0.76, remains one of the most undervalued layer-1 networks, with its strong academic approach and upcoming upgrades setting the stage for a major price breakout. But beyond the familiar names, fresh coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is entering the spotlight, offering early investors a shot at outsized returns as the next crypto to explode in 2025. The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues as this high-growth altcoin sells at $0.03 and has collected $9.1 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.035 while attracting more than 11,000 investors. This phase’s investors will receive a 100% profit when the launch price reaches $0.06. XRP and Cardano: Veteran Altcoins Poised for a Major Comeback Both ADA and XRP have been top players in past crypto cycles, and 2025 could witness their biggest comeback yet. XRP, at around $2.32 today, is attracting bull interest as legal matters with the SEC continue to clear, promising worldwide utility for cross-border payments. Simultaneously, ADA, trading at approximately $0.76, is poised for a breakout as the technology of smart contracts and growing DeFi use on the Cardano chain develops. Both put the two assets on the top cryptocurrency list to invest in for the patient investor who is expecting a 10x gain. For the investor who is searching for even fresher and newer opportunities with the same potential for explosive growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also rolling strongly. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 11,000 investors have joined the presale funding to support the project which has received $9.1 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price has currently reached $0.03 in Phase 5 even though investors anticipate a 16.67% price increase in Phase 6 which will generate considerable profit potential. Analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as the top hidden gem in the altcoin market, having already attracted over 11,000 investors and raised $9.1 million in its presale. At just $0.03 in Phase 5, before the imminent 16.67% price increase, investors have a rare window to lock in a 100% ROI at the $0.06 launch price. Opportunities like this don’t wait, secure your tokens before Phase 5 ends and the next wave of profit seekers sends prices soaring.

In 2027, it will range between $81.02 and $96.21, with an average price of $88.62. In 2031, it will range between $182.30 and $197.49, with an average price of $189.90. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Cryptocurrency gains 15.51% of value in the day. HYPE coin prices seek a support level at $30.588. On May 22, 2025, Hyperliquid price analysis revealed an increasing trend for the cryptocurrency. Coin value has spiked up to $31.22 in the past 24 hours. From an overall observation, the currency has received up to 15.51 percent of value. The bulls have been ruling the market since yesterday, which has resulted in immense recovery. HYPE/USDT 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of Hyperliquid coin confirmed an upward trend in the market. The cryptocurrency value has recovered up to $31.22 in the day. The rising volatility is suggestive of an upcoming reversal in trends. HYPE /USD shows increasing volatility The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility.

The one-day and four-hour price analysis showcases a rising bullish support in the market. Why is Hyperliquid up? The cryptocurrency market is under a bullish spell, and HYPE is receiving the same sentiment. Moreover, it is encouraging that HYPE has been following a bullish price curve after April 7, 2025, over the larger picture. The HYPE price increased to $31.23 gaining 15.51% of its total value in the last few hours. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does not justify predicting a $50 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by 2026. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2028. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $121. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $197.49, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading a bit lower than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $197.49 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved significantly during this period, reaching above $8 billion, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. In May 2025, HYPE keeps improving, trading near the range of $19.97 to $25.4, with space for further improvement.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-22 16:03:57

DeLorean says it has introduced “the world’s first tokenized electric vehicle” using the DeLorean Protocol, an on-chain vehicle reservation, marketplace, and analytics system. The Protocol gives consumers a place to digitally buy, trade, authenticate, and track cars. The DeLorean team has built the new marketplace on the Sui network. The goal, per the press release, is to shape a new approach to vehicle reservation, management, and resale. In short, users will be able to buy and sell their build slots for DeLorean’s incoming Alpha 5 EV model. Furthermore, the holders of these DeLorean Tokenized Build Slots will gain access to the exclusive suite of features, the team claims. This includes listing the slots for sale or buying from other users, bidding for preferential slots, staking and earning rewards on the DMC tokens, and buying USDC on Sui through the marketplace. The DMC token is yet to be launched. The key on-chain elements of the marketplace include blockchain-powered transactions, which enable safe and transparent purchases, sales, and trades of vehicle reservation slots. It will also provide an immutable ledger of every vehicle’s history and performance data. Finally, active build-slot holders will be able to manage their reservations. The team plans to soon launch new reservations for upcoming production years.

DeLorean Says It Provides ‘Direct Access to the Future of Vehicle Ownership’ With a rich career spanning over seven decades on stage and screen, Stewart has starred in some of the most popular franchises, including Star Trek , X-Men , and Dune , among many others. The acclaimed thespian has partnered with DeLorean as the latter readies for the production of its first car in over 40 years, “bringing legitimacy to DeLorean’s Web3 vision.” The move also follows the brand’s collaboration with actor Christopher Lloyd, famous for the Back to the Future film series, among other popular projects. Moreover, DeLorean says that it works to take blockchain mainstream. It aims to raise awareness on how tokenized build slots can be used to reserve and own vehicles online. The Web3 division DeLorean Labs will lead these efforts. Looking ahead, DeLorean Labs will launch its marketplace model to other sectors looking for on-chain solutions, the team says. This will include areas of reservation, trading, and secondary resale markets. Chief Brand Officer Cameron Wynne says that since the brand’s arrival in the 1980s, it “has stood as a symbol of vision, rebellion, and futuristic innovation.” Now, the company will make another leap forward, he adds, and will dive into blockchain. “Our new on-chain reservation platform advances our commitment to transparency and security, giving our community direct access to the future of vehicle ownership. By using blockchain technology, we’re setting a new standard for the automotive industry,” Wynne notes. Source: DeLorean In the early 1980s, DeLorean produced its iconic DMC-12 , which was featured as the time machine in the Back to the Future films. More than 40 years later, it’s “creating a new and electrifying vehicle” with an “intelligent, intuitive human design and craftsmanship.” Per the team, “applying its rebellious DNA, DeLorean is writing its legacy in real-time while instinctively adapting to the future.” You may also like: How DePIN Models Are Transforming The Automotive Industry Infrastructure-intensive industries are undergoing massive transformations to meet the need for digital innovation.

What made this move particularly striking was the hacker’s open taunting of ZachXBT, a prominent blockchain investigator known for exposing crypto scams. Using Ethereum’s input data feature, the hacker embedded a mocking message “L bozo” alongside a viral NBA celebration video link, directly targeting ZachXBT. This public provocation came as the hacker executed a massive Bitcoin-to-Ether swap, followed by a further $22.6 million ETH transfer, showcasing both technical prowess and audacity. How THORChain Enables Swift, Unstoppable Swaps The hacker’s choice of THORChain was no accident. THORChain is a decentralized, cross-chain liquidity protocol that allows users to swap native assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum directly and quickly without intermediaries or wrapped tokens. Its design revolves around Continuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs), which autonomously facilitate trades in seconds. Crucially, THORChain does not impose Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, making it an attractive avenue for laundering stolen funds. Because transactions finalize rapidly and validators earn fees from volume, there is little incentive to halt suspicious swaps. This creates a challenging environment for investigators who rely on centralized platforms to freeze or track illicit funds. The hacker exploited this “bubble” of decentralization to move millions with minimal risk of interruption. ZachXBT’s Sleuthing: Tracking the Untraceable ZachXBT and his team have long been at the forefront of crypto investigations, using advanced techniques such as address clustering and transaction graph analysis to link wallets and trace fund flows. However, THORChain’s rapid cross-chain swaps and lack of user identification severely limit these methods. The hacker’s wallet, “Fake_Phishing1158790,” was tracked from the initial Coinbase breach, but once funds entered THORChain, following their trail became nearly impossible. Despite these obstacles, ZachXBT’s public warnings have helped alert users to ongoing phishing campaigns exploiting stolen data. His efforts highlight both the promise and the limits of blockchain transparency when faced with sophisticated decentralized protocols. Coinbase’s Response and Legal Challenges In the wake of the breach and subsequent laundering, Coinbase has taken several steps to mitigate the damage. The company committed to reimbursing victims, with estimates ranging from $180 million to $400 million in total costs. Security enhancements include the establishment of U.S.-based support hubs, stricter withdrawal verification, and real-time scam alerts for users. Coinbase also announced a $20 million bounty for information leading to the hacker’s capture, a direct counter to the attacker’s ransom demands. However, the breach has triggered multiple class-action lawsuits accusing Coinbase of negligence and delayed disclosure. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also launched an inquiry, particularly scrutinizing the timing of the breach, which occurred just before Coinbase’s entry into the S&P 500. Investor confidence has been shaken, underscoring the broader regulatory and reputational risks facing crypto exchanges. Lessons for Crypto Users: Vigilance Is Vital For cryptocurrency users, the Coinbase hack serves as a stark warning. The stolen data has fueled waves of phishing and credential-stuffing attacks, exploiting reused passwords and weak security setups. Experts emphasize the importance of enabling hardware-based two-factor authentication and being skeptical of unsolicited support requests. Coinbase has reiterated that it will never ask for seed phrases or demand transfers, a critical point to remember amid rising scams. This incident also highlights the need for users to understand the risks of decentralized platforms like THORChain, where the lack of centralized control can mean stolen funds vanish without recourse. The Ongoing Battle Between Innovation and Security The Coinbase hack and the subsequent laundering of funds through THORChain illustrate the complex tension between decentralization and security. While platforms like THORChain push the boundaries of what is possible in cross-chain finance, they also create new avenues for criminals to exploit. Investigators like ZachXBT are adapting, but the game is evolving rapidly. As regulators tighten scrutiny and exchanges bolster defenses, the crypto community faces a pivotal challenge: how to preserve the innovation and freedom of decentralized finance while ensuring accountability and protecting users from increasingly sophisticated threats. Until that balance is struck, stories like this will continue to unfold in the public eye. The Coinbase hack remains a cautionary tale of how quickly fortunes can move across chains, how vulnerabilities in human processes can lead to massive losses, and how decentralized protocols can both empower users and shield criminals. The chase is far from over, but one thing is clear: in the world of crypto, the next move is always just a block away.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-22 16:10:09

Meet xBTC A token 1:1 backed by Bitcoin and securely held by OKX. xBTC unlocks a new alternative for BTC holders across @Solana , @SuiNetwork , and @Aptos . More to come – watch this space — OKX (@okx) May 22, 2025 Backed 1:1 by BTC held in OKX custody, xBTC allows users to access Bitcoin liquidity within the Aptos ecosystem without paying minting or redemption fees. Starting May 22, users can mint xBTC directly on OKX and transfer it across the Aptos blockchain for use in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, including trading, lending, and Web3 strategies. According to Jason Lau, Chief Innovation Officer at OKX, this integration is part of the company’s broader vision to expand BTC’s utility across on-chain ecosystems. “By bringing xBTC to Aptos, we are keen to see Bitcoin holders put their BTC to work in fast, low-cost DeFi applications,” he said. The move positions Aptos as one of the first high-performance Layer 1 blockchains to natively support xBTC, paving the way for wider adoption of Bitcoin-backed DeFi products. Empowering DeFi Innovation on Aptos The launch of xBTC reflects Aptos’ commitment to unlocking new liquidity pathways and expanding real-world financial use cases for digital assets. “Bitcoin is the linchpin between traditional and decentralized finance markets,” said Ash Pampati, head of ecosystem at the Aptos Foundation, adding that Aptos’ support for xBTC showcases its scalability and developer-friendly architecture. A launch campaign in collaboration with Aries Markets, Hyperion, and Echo Protocol will further drive awareness and user engagement. These integrations are designed to build momentum for deeper use of xBTC across Aptos-native DeFi platforms, providing developers with the tools and confidence to innovate. Increasing Liquidity and Utility for BTC Holders While Bitcoin has long been the dominant crypto asset, its role in DeFi has been limited due to a lack of native smart contract support. With xBTC, Aptos users can now deploy BTC capital across a growing DeFi ecosystem that already boasts over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Echo Protocol’s aBTC has already attracted nearly $270 million in TVL, indicating strong demand for wrapped Bitcoin solutions. xBTC stands out for its transparency, leveraging OKX’s public proof-of-reserves platform to provide verifiable backing for each wrapped token. This launch strengthens cross-chain interoperability and positions both OKX and Aptos at the forefront of bringing Bitcoin utility to decentralized finance.

According to her post, XRP continues to demonstrate relative strength as it maintains support above the $2.25 level (Fib. 0.382). CasiTrades emphasized the importance of this level, describing the asset reclaiming it as a bullish sign in the ongoing attempt to transition out of a corrective market structure. The weekly chart shows that the asset held above the macro 0.5 retracement level at $1.90 during the correction, further supporting the belief that its broader structure remains intact unless a breakdown occurs below this level. XRP Holding $2.25 — But Another Test Looks Likely Zooming out to macro, #XRP continues to hold strong within bullish correction territory. The macro .5 retracement at $1.90 was cleanly respected, and it was able to reclaim the major .382 level at $2.25, this is a bullish… pic.twitter.com/74qL3cicg9 — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) May 21, 2025 Resistance Level and Short-Term Consolidation While the macro outlook shows optimism, the short-term view suggests that the asset is stuck in a consolidation phase. As illustrated in the 15-minute chart provided by CasiTrades, XRP is currently forming a symmetrical triangle , a common pattern that often precedes volatility. The upper trendline resistance converges around the $2.375 mark, a level that has capped price advances in recent sessions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 CasiTrades notes that XRP’s price is pressing against this resistance. The most recent bounce off $2.25 did not produce a breakout. However, she is closely watching the current price trajectory to determine whether the asset can generate enough momentum to invalidate the bearish macro C wave scenario. Until a new high is confirmed, the possibility of a retest of the $2.25 support remains valid. Expectations of the Macro Scenario XRP’s inability to break through the $2.69 resistance, which corresponds to the 0.236 Fib. The retracement has left the bearish C wave scenario on the table. According to CasiTrades, “a new high still hasn’t been made,” meaning that the potential corrective target of around $1.50 cannot be dismissed yet. The lower support area between the 0.618 and 0.65 retracements ($1.45–$1.54) continues to act as the final line of defense should current support levels fail. Despite the potential bearish downturn, analysts are confident that a major move is coming, with one analyst recently pointing to the potential for a 580% rally . From a momentum standpoint, the weekly RSI has begun to turn upward, with the RSI line nearing a cross above its moving average. While this suggests improving momentum, it is not yet definitive. Experts see XRP as an amazing opportunity , and a confirmed breakout above recent highs, ideally above the $2.69 region, would shift the structure firmly in a bullish direction and invalidate the C wave scenario.

With the token price frozen at $0.0020 until June 13, buyers have one last chance to secure access at a rate more than 13 times lower than the current presale batch price of $0.0262. This pricing gap is not a minor detail. It defines the difference between modest returns and life-changing upside. Timing, in this case, is not just strategic. It is essential. Analyst discussions and early community threads are pointing toward a potential $20 valuation for BDAG by 2027. That scenario would mean a 10,000x return for those entering now. While bold, this projection is backed by BlockDAG’s visible delivery milestones and growing network momentum, giving weight to long-term optimism. The Power of Early Entry: $500 Today, $5 Million Tomorrow If BDAG reaches $20 by 2027, today’s entry price could yield life-changing results. A $500 purchase at the locked presale rate of $0.0020 secures 250,000 BDAG. Should the token hit $20, that $500 would turn into $5 million. Even a smaller $100 buy-in could potentially return $2 million. These figures do not factor in additional rewards from BlockDAG’s daily Buyer Battles, where 150 million BDAG are distributed, and any unsold tokens go to the day’s top buyer. Bonus incentives from the referral program offer yet another way to increase holdings. Active participants who help expand the network can earn extra tokens beyond their original purchase. Between these ongoing mechanisms, BlockDAG is creating a presale model that rewards both early commitment and engagement. Why June 13 Is the Deadline That Matters BlockDAG is currently in Batch 28, where the official token price has climbed to $0.0262. However, the $0.0020 pricing remains available until June 13, creating a rare opportunity to access early-stage terms typically offered only in private rounds. This allows new buyers to maximise their allocation while the pricing window is still open. Once June 13 passes, the presale price will revert and continue to rise with each new batch. That means anyone waiting could end up receiving up to 93% fewer tokens per dollar. For those aiming to capture the full upside of a potential breakout, taking action within this limited timeframe is critical. Why the $20 BDAG Target Is Rooted in Real Progress In a market filled with speculation, BlockDAG stands out by delivering on its promises while still in presale. The project is preparing to deploy its physical infrastructure, including the X10, X30, and X100 mining rigs, which will go live post-mainnet. Video footage of these devices is expected soon, offering visible proof of progress. With over $260 million already raised and 20 centralized exchange listings set to be revealed on June 13, the groundwork is being laid for serious post-launch momentum. What sets BlockDAG apart is that its ecosystem is already active. The Buyer Battles program allocates 150 million BDAG daily, incentivizing strong participation. Referral rewards offer additional returns for those helping grow the network. This isn’t future potential; it is happening now, and it is driving steady engagement from retail and whale participants. A $20 target may seem bold, but it reflects what becomes possible when functioning infrastructure, mass token distribution, and growing demand align. Even if BDAG reaches just $2, buyers locking in at the current $0.0020 rate would see a 100x gain. That kind of asymmetry is rare, and it is backed here by execution, not speculation. Key Takeaways The days leading up to June 13 are shaping up to be a pivotal window for BlockDAG. At its current price, the token offers one of the most attractive risk-to-reward profiles in the market. Once the price lock ends, BDAG will transition from a strategic entry point to a more reactive post-launch asset, with reduced upside and greater volatility. In crypto, timing is not just important, it is everything. Those who act before June 13 are not just buying an altcoin, they are securing an advantage that may no longer exist once the project enters its next phase.

DOGE is now testing the upper boundary of a two-week consolidation range between $0.20 and $0.25. Clear of this hurdle, DOGE could have a claim to the “best crypto to buy” conversation.

Traders appear to be positioning for a continuation, with the Binance long-to-short ratio of 2.23—69% of traders have bet on price increases. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Is DOGE Ready to Hit $1? This renewed bullish sentiment could fuel a breakout from Dogecoin’s current consolidation zone—and potentially end the broader descending channel that’s shaped its multi-month downtrend. DOGE / USDT 1-week chart, pending descending channel breakout. Source: TradingView / Binance. Momentum indicators further support this outlook. The MACD has formed a golden cross, surpassing the signal line, typically a strong indicator of a longer-term trend reversal on higher time frames. More so, the RSI is holding firm above the neutral 50 mark at 53, suggesting sustained buying interest is outweighing any short-term profit-taking. If momentum persists, a breakout could drive the DOGE price toward $0.45—an 87% potential gain from current levels. From there, a more substantial catalyst will likely be needed to drive the next Dogecoin price wave, such as the June 15 decision deadline on a US spot DOGE ETF . Traders should watch for a confirmed breakout above $0.25 to avoid a false signal, while the 50-day SMA at $0.195 stands as the next major support level if a correction unfolds.

Accordingly, the UK court has dismissed the BSV lawsuit filed against Binance. Accordingly, the UK Court of Appeal dismissed the $13.3 billion class action lawsuit filed by BSV investors against Binance. According to Decrypt, a UK court has rejected BSV investors’ $11.9 billion claim, saying that investors can mitigate their losses after Binance and other companies delisted the BSV token. In the class action lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that the removal of BSV by platforms like Binance in 2019 crashed the price of BSV, leaving it unable to reach a price level close to Bitcoin. “By delisting BSV, platforms like Binance have destroyed the potential for BSV to become a world-class cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and the chance to profit from BSV. We are therefore seeking damages of £8.9 billion ($11.9 billion),” the plaintiffs said. However, the court ruled that the plaintiffs’ BSV claims were speculative, that investors could have mitigated their losses through the open market, and that the responsibility for mitigating losses was theirs. The court also added that BSV was not an irreplaceable asset and that the amount of damages sought was excessive and unsupported. With the general rise in the market, BSV price has also increased by 9% in the last 24 hours. *Not investment advice Continue Reading: New Development in Altcoin Case That Binance Delinquent Years Ago: Court Found Binance Right, Dismissed $13 Billion Case!",Altcoin|Analysis|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BNB|BSV,"{'name': 'BitcoinSistemi', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinsistemi,2025-05-22 17:04:07

Expert Explains How XRP’s Role Will Be Amplified,https://timestabloid.com/will-rlusd-sideline-xrp-expert-explains-how-xrps-role-will-be-amplified/,"The launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin has sparked a flurry of speculation about the future role of XRP on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Some observers have questioned whether the fiat-pegged asset could reduce XRP’s relevance within the ecosystem. However, according to a post by the respected All Things XRP community on X, these concerns overlook a critical reality: RLUSD isn’t a replacement for XRP—it’s a strategic extension of its utility. RLUSD may end up amplifying XRP’s significance across institutional and cross-border use cases rather than diminishing it. XRP’s Native Advantage on the XRPL To understand why XRP’s role is set to grow stronger, it’s essential to revisit its unique architecture within the XRPL. XRP is not just another asset on the ledger—it is the default bridge currency for transaction routing. The XRPL’s pathfinding algorithm is designed to identify the most efficient routes for payments, and XRP is almost always the optimal choice due to its liquidity, speed, and low transaction costs. This makes XRP indispensable in multi-hop payments, where it facilitates seamless asset conversion across borders or currencies. SOME FEAR RLUSD WILL SIDELINE XRP. Here’s the truth: XRP’s role is about to be amplified, not diminished. Why? Liquidity preference. On the XRPL, pathfinding algorithms default to XRP for transaction routing. It’s the native bridge asset—faster, cheaper, and more deeply… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 22, 2025 Unlike stablecoins or external tokens, XRP is deeply embedded into the ledger’s core infrastructure. Its low transaction fee—typically less than a fraction of a cent—not only makes it economically viable for micropayments and retail transactions but also ensures cost-efficiency in high-volume treasury operations. No other asset currently matches XRP in its combination of settlement speed, decentralization, and cost efficiency. RLUSD: Enhancing Stability, Not Replacing Function RLUSD enters the ecosystem with a clearly defined purpose: price stability. As a Ripple-issued stablecoin, RLUSD is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and is expected to play a critical role in institutional settlement, treasury operations, and possibly tokenized asset trading. However, RLUSD’s introduction doesn’t challenge XRP’s core function as a liquidity bridge—it complements it. According to All Things XRP, RLUSD should be seen as a layer that broadens XRPL’s institutional appeal. Institutions seeking price-stable assets for accounting and risk management will find RLUSD valuable, particularly in on-ledger use cases that require minimal volatility. However, when it comes to the actual movement of value, especially across borders, XRP still holds the key. The synergy between RLUSD and XRP is where the strength of Ripple’s strategy lies. As more institutions board to use RLUSD for settlements, they will inevitably interact with XRP, especially when liquidity routing or foreign exchange comes into play. This increased activity feeds directly into XRP demand, boosting its liquidity across corridors. Pathfinding Dominance and On-Demand Liquidity One of the most understated aspects of XRP’s utility is its dominance in pathfinding. The XRPL’s pathfinding algorithm scans all possible routes for converting one asset into another and defaults to XRP when it offers the most efficient path, which it often does. This positions XRP as a central hub in a vast network of global liquidity, making it indispensable to On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), Ripple’s flagship cross-border payments solution. As RLUSD is integrated into ODL workflows , it will often need to convert into or out of XRP for final settlement, especially across jurisdictions where RLUSD isn’t yet adopted. XRP’s speed and sub-cent fees mean that it remains the preferred conduit for converting stablecoins and fiat currencies in real-time. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Liquidity Feedback Loop Perhaps the most compelling reason XRP’s role will expand is due to what analysts term the “liquidity feedback loop.” As RLUSD adoption grows, so does transactional volume on the XRPL. This activity not only increases the number of conversions routed through XRP but also attracts more market makers, more liquidity providers, and more on-ramps and off-ramps. In turn, this tightens spreads, deepens order books, and makes XRP an even more efficient bridge asset. Every new stablecoin user is a potential contributor to XRP’s liquidity pool. And in decentralized systems, liquidity begets more liquidity. Rather than pushing XRP aside, RLUSD accelerates this virtuous cycle, reinforcing XRP’s foundational role. Betting Against the Ledger’s Design? The architecture of the XRPL was never built to promote one asset at the expense of another. Instead, it’s designed for synergy and optimization. Betting against XRP, as All Things XRP notes, is effectively betting against the pathfinding logic and liquidity design of the ledger itself. The ledger prefers XRP not because it’s Ripple’s native token, but because it works consistently, reliably, and economically. In a digital economy where speed, trust minimization, and cost-efficiency are paramount, XRP remains unmatched. RLUSD, while a valuable addition, is merely an expansion of the ledger’s capabilities, not a threat to its core. Far from sidelining XRP, RLUSD appears poised to reinforce its relevance in the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain-based finance. XRP’s native integration, pathfinding dominance, and ultra-low transaction costs make it indispensable for the ledger’s liquidity architecture. Meanwhile, RLUSD brings a new layer of price stability and institutional appeal. Together, they form a synergistic pair—one that strengthens the XRPL’s position as a premier decentralized finance infrastructure for global value transfer. As the ecosystem matures, the XRP-RLUSD dynamic could become a model for how native tokens and stablecoins can co-exist and complement each other, amplifying utility, not competing for dominance.

On May 22, 2025 , BTC blasted through its previous all-time high, reaching a staggering $111,861.22 —a record-breaking move fueled by institutional inflows, ETF demand, and a positive macro shift. While headlines rightly focus on Bitcoin’s climb, analysts are increasingly turning their attention to an emerging contender: MAGACOIN FINANCE . The question now circulating among seasoned investors is simple: Could MAGACOIN FINANCE outperform Bitcoin in 2025? Bitcoin’s Rally Sets the Stage for Altcoin Rotation BTC’s push past $111K came after a months-long period of sideways movement. Now, Bitcoin is trading above $111,300 with a 24-hour volume of nearly $91 billion , and a market cap soaring to $2.21 trillion . This rally isn’t just a flash in the pan—it’s been catalyzed by powerful forces: U.S. spot ETF inflows dramatically increased after the SEC’s earlier 2025 approvals, driving sustained institutional demand. On-chain data shows Bitcoin whales have added over 83,000 BTC in the last month alone. Geopolitical de-escalation and regulatory clarity—including movement on a U.S. stablecoin bill—have added confidence to crypto markets. But with Bitcoin now hitting major resistance between $112,000–$115,000 , traders are asking what comes next. Many believe a significant altcoin rotation is imminent—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is on the shortlist of tokens poised to benefit. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Drawing Analyst Attention While Bitcoin’s rise has been extraordinary, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early innings. Despite that, it’s already catching serious attention thanks to: High community momentum and early-stage traction Presale gains that have attracted both retail and speculative capital A unique political narrative that appeals to crypto-native investors and traditional audiences alike According to early market data and analyst projections, MAGACOIN FINANCE has the potential to deliver 25x to 35x gains if broader retail and institutional flows shift toward high-upside altcoins during this next leg of the bull run. One analyst noted, “Bitcoin’s move to $111K has confirmed the bull market is fully here. What we typically see now is capital flowing into undervalued, high-hype altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few that checks all the boxes—fresh, relevant, and still early.” Key Catalysts Supporting MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Breakout Potential Several technical and macroeconomic signals suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could be on the verge of a major price discovery moment: Altcoin rotation phase beginning: With BTC dominance potentially peaking, many investors are reallocating to altcoins for higher ROI potential. Retail interest expanding: Similar to past cycles, once BTC gains slow, attention shifts toward low-cost tokens with aggressive upside narratives. Psychological milestones: MAGACOIN FINANCE has already crossed early presale targets and is now entering a discovery zone—where exponential momentum typically kicks in. Bitcoin vs MAGACOIN FINANCE: ROI Potential in 2025 Bitcoin may continue its push toward $118K–$131K , but its ROI potential from here is likely more modest. A move from $111K to $150K would represent roughly 35% upside . Compare that to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could realistically move 25x to 35x from its current presale levels. That’s a 2,400% to 3,400% upside , according to current projections—a massive gap that many early investors are keen to exploit. Final Thoughts: A Crypto Rotation You Don’t Want to Miss Bitcoin’s $111K milestone has reignited confidence across the board—but it’s also triggered the start of the 2025 altcoin cycle . As analysts have seen in past cycles, coins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP surged after Bitcoin’s peak momentum periods. This time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in position to lead that charge . For savvy investors looking beyond BTC and hunting for explosive, early-stage opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a rare window. The smart money is already watching. The only question left is: Will you be early—or just too late?

The most recent addition to the portfolio is a relatively new meme token by the BUILDon team. Trump’s fund World Liberty Fi bought a relatively unknown token, BUILDon (B), making another surprising addition to its portfolio. The fund explained its decision as a sign of support for the team. We just bought some $B to support the BUILDon team. Love seeing projects choose $USD1 as their base pair — faster settlement, deeper liquidity, and growing every day. We hope to see more tokens make the switch. — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) May 21, 2025 Previously, World Liberty Fi acquired tokens like Movement (MOVE) and Ondo Finance (ONDO) to show support for the technology. Later, the tokens were liquidated, some at a loss. Recently, Trump’s fund also acquired EOS (Vaulta) tokens just before the asset swap. BUILDon is a relatively new project selected for its efforts to promote the usage of USD1 , the native stablecoin of World Liberty Fi. The B token uses the Binance Smart Chain and will work toward wider adoption for USD1. Did World Liberty Fi choose a cabal token? On-chain data shows that BUILDon has insider traders. BubbleMaps shows the token is split among small-scale addresses, but there is a cluster of connected wallets. World Liberty Fi bought a token that displays a cluster of connected wallets, holding up to 20% of the supply. | Source: Bubblemaps While each wallet holds around 0.37% of the supply, together, the cluster controls up to 20% of all B tokens. There is no data to show the team is a part of the connected wallet cluster. World Liberty Fi also did not specify its intentions to hold B for the long term. World Liberty Fi only holds around 696K B tokens, valued at around $142,000. Based on public wallet data, this is the second-biggest holding on BNB Smart Chain. This time, the token allocation was relatively small after the fund injected millions into other assets. The involvement of Trump’s fund also preceded one of the recent breakouts for the token, increasing the suspicions of insider arrangements. This time, meme holdings were relatively small but still raised memories of insider trading for MELANIA. Just days ago, World Liberty Fi denied launching its own meme token. The fund was also busy divesting older holdings from its portfolio. Whale extracts $1M from B The involvement of World Liberty Fi raised the trading volumes of BUILDon and allowed whale traders to lock in gains. The token was liquid enough so the top trader could engage in high-frequency buying and selling, realizing $1M in gains. What raised more red flags about B was also the fact that top traders had a very similar strategy of buying around $1.8M B tokens, then selling around $2.7M, achieving similar net gains. Whales trading B tokens showed a surprisingly similar trading strategy. | Source: DexScreener The odd coincidences among at least the top 20 traders did not look like organic token activity. The similar investments and selling suggested there may be a concerted extraction of value from the token’s liquidity pool. B launched on May 16 at $0.004, taking just a week to rally to a peak of $0.30. After the initial hype, volumes dropped off again. The sudden outflow of activity also suggested some of the B trading may not be organic. The meme token is one of the few to trade in a pair against USD1, with $2.5M in locked liquidity.

Worldcoin’s price has also profited from the market-wide rally following BTC’s climb to new record highs , with the altcoin now up by 27% in a fortnight and by 61% in a month. While the coin remains down by 89% since its own record high of $11.74 (set in March 2024), this gap gives the token plenty of room to climb in the coming weeks and months. And with Worldcoin raising $135 million in new funding yesterday, momentum may increasingly build around Worldcoin, which could soon return to former highs. Worldcoin Surges as Sam Altman Teams With Apple Icon Jony Ive — Is This the Start of the AI Coin Supercycle? Now may be the perfect time to buy Worldcoin, with its chart showing that the token has just begun rising from a long bottom. Most notably, its 30-day average (orange) hit a big bottom in relation to the 200-day (blue) in mid- to late-April, with the shorter term average now on course to climb over its longer term equivalent. Source: TradingView We see something very similar with the RSI (purple), which is rising again to 70 after a long period of low readings. The next psychological barrier for Worldcoin is $1.50, with the token likely to experience a quicker rise if it can break this resistance level soon. Helping it will be the momentum carried over from OpenAI’s $6.5 billion acquisition of io, an AI-focused device startup founded by Jony Ive, who was instrumental in designing such flagship Apple products as the iPhone, iPod and iPad. Sam & Jony introduce io pic.twitter.com/ej5K59kJq3 — OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 21, 2025 OpenAI hasn’t provided any further details of what exactly it might be working on with Jony Ive and io, but the deal could be a massive step forwards for the company in terms of offering a mass-market consumer product. And by extension, it could help raise the profile of Worldcoin, which Sam Altman co-founded via Tools for Humanity. Worldcoin officially launched in the US in early May, offering its iris-scanning orb devices in the States for the first time, while also listing on US-based exchanges. Hello @worldcoin ! Thanks for hosting me at your flagship store in West Hollywood, California and congratulations on your recent launch! pic.twitter.com/2fQPp5dOnt — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) May 19, 2025 And in addition to the positive OpenAI and Jony Ive news today, Worldcoin itself also announced $135 million in new funding from Bain Capital and Andreessen Horowitz yesterday. This puts it on a solid footing to continue growing, with its native token on course to hit $2.50 by Q4. Another High-Potential Altcoin with Strong Fundamentals You Shouldn’t Miss Worldcoin isn’t the only new token to watch in the coming months, with several other projects also showing potential for rapid growth. Some of these are presale tokens, which can often rally vigorously when they list for the first time, particularly if their sales had generated enough hype and momentum. And one of the most exciting presales happening right now belongs to MIND of Pepe (MIND) , an ERC-20 token that has raised almost $10 million in its presale, which ends in under nine days. Last chance to buy $MIND https://t.co/Co2K02Tpkb pic.twitter.com/DDNkhkf0B6 — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 16, 2025 This is a really impressive figure, and when combined with MIND of Pepe’s follower count on X , it points to just how popular the project could become once it launches. And the reason for its early popularity is that the project is launching an autonomous AI agent, one which will help investors make better trades and which will also generate its own meme tokens. As an AI agent, MIND of Pepe will process large amounts of data from social networks and cryptocurrency markets, using this data to produce highly informed market analysis and advice. Investors can gain access to this advice by holding MIND, while the native token will also provide them with early access to the coins the platform itself generates. MIND could therefore become very popular, and given that you can also stake the token, it’s likely to be a profitable coin to hold. As noted above, its sale will end in nine days, with latecomers able to buy it at the MIND of Pepe website , where it costs $0.0037515. This is its final presale price, although it could soon rise much higher than this when it lists in just over a week.

As traditional finance players increasingly embrace blockchain frameworks, the next wave of top-performing digital assets may not emerge from speculation, but from real-world use cases and clear progress milestones. This week, Robinhood submitted a Real-World Asset (RWA) proposal to the SEC, sparking renewed interest in MakerDAO’s model. Meanwhile, Aptos is approaching a scheduled token unlock worth over $11 million—raising both concerns and short-term trading opportunities. And then there’s Qubetics , whose $TICS presale just crossed $17.2 million, quietly gaining traction with structured tokenomics and a utility-focused ecosystem. While each project caters to distinct narratives—governance finance, Layer-1 scalability, and multi-chain development environments—they converge on a shared spotlight: they’re being actively tracked by analysts looking for the top cryptos to hold for short term value. Whether it’s regulatory momentum, upcoming supply events, or technical interoperability, the case for short-term upside is clearer than ever. Qubetics Empowers Devs and Businesses With a Unified Web3 IDE Suite As the only project in this cohort that delivers a fully integrated multi-chain development stack, Qubetics is helping redefine what short-term crypto gains actually look like. Built as a Web3 aggregator, Qubetics unites Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and Avalanche into a shared deployment environment powered by its flagship technologies: QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE. Imagine a blockchain game studio in Montreal working on Ethereum-based NFTs but looking to integrate a Solana-native payment mechanism. Today, that requires external bridges, redundant security checks, and multiple UI builds. Qubetics changes this by allowing developers to code, deploy, and debug multi-chain dApps within one cohesive workspace. It reduces development times, increases interoperability, and eliminates the need to rely on third-party bridges. This isn’t just a developer tool—it’s an infrastructure play that opens the door to startups, enterprises, and DAOs who need fast, cost-efficient access to a true multi-chain world. And because this functionality is already embedded in the core layer, not some modular extension, it’s driving confidence that Qubetics is among the most serious top cryptos to hold for short term utility-driven upside. Qubetics Presale Structure and ROI Signal Strong Short-Term Upside The Qubetics presale has reached Stage 35, with tokens priced at $0.2785. That price, however, is scheduled to increase by 10% every Sunday at 12 a.m., which has contributed to accelerated early-stage demand. With over $17.2 million raised, more than 26,800 holders onboarded, and over 513 million tokens sold, $TICS is proving it isn’t some slow-burn experiment. It’s delivering structured, stage-based progress that short-term participants often seek. Here’s where the presale becomes especially compelling. With a $100 allocation at the current price: $TICS at $1 = $358.95 $TICS at $5 = $1,794.74 $TICS at $6 = $2,053.68 $TICS at $10 = $3,489.47 $TICS at $15 = $5,284.21 This clear ROI potential—combined with the Q2 2025 mainnet launch—has analysts flagging Qubetics as one of the top cryptos to hold for short term plays. The Qubetics presale also benefits from its structure, giving early buyers transparent entry and exit horizons. Its reputation as one of the best crypto pre sale opportunities available right now is not rooted in hype but in actual deployment timelines and product delivery. Aptos Braces for $11.31M Token Unlock on June 12—What’s Next? Aptos is in the spotlight once again—not for a new product rollout, but because it is preparing for a scheduled unlock of 11.31 million APT tokens on June 12, 2025. According to data reported by TradingView News, this figure represents a significant influx to circulating supply and has short-term traders watching price action closely. Unlocks can be double-edged swords. On one hand, they increase liquidity and incentivize ecosystem participants. On the other, they often trigger short-term volatility, particularly when the tokens are distributed to early team members or strategic backers. The community now speculates whether APT’s current stability can withstand this supply pressure without a meaningful dip in price. Despite these challenges, Aptos remains one of the most closely watched Layer-1s in the ecosystem. Short-term interest is being driven not by fundamentals, but by anticipated trading opportunities around the unlock window, making it one of the top cryptos to hold for short term price movement—even if for slightly more speculative reasons than its competitors. Maker Extends Gains on RWA Optimism After Robinhood’s SEC Filing MakerDAO’s MKR token surged over 7% in the wake of Robinhood’s Real-World Asset (RWA) proposal submitted to the U.S. SEC, as reported by FXStreet. The application, filed to support institutional access to RWA-backed digital instruments, is seen as a major win for protocols like Maker that have long integrated RWA into their DeFi operations. MakerDAO has been one of the earliest and most successful champions of RWA adoption, allowing its ecosystem to maintain real-world value backing through tokenized treasuries, real estate, and yield-bearing TradFi assets. This fresh regulatory momentum validates its framework and has been interpreted by many as a greenlight for broader RWA market participation. The price action reflects this narrative. As MKR continues to attract institutional credibility, short-term analysts have labeled it one of the top cryptos to hold for short term exposure to the growing RWA category. With the U.S. regulatory environment finally warming to these instruments, Maker’s long-term fundamentals are aligning with short-term catalysts in a very strategic way. Qubetics, Aptos, and Maker—Three Distinct Paths to Short-Term Crypto Upside There’s no denying that short-term crypto market movements require a balance of momentum, structure, and narrative clarity. Qubetics offers all three. With its structured presale, real-time developer tooling, and a launch-ready timeline, it stands out as one of the most practical top cryptos to hold for short term. Maker’s RWA-driven resurgence makes it especially relevant for community members watching the TradFi-crypto intersection. Aptos, while more speculative in this window, presents pure-play volatility for traders bracing for its June 12 unlock.

The Bitcoin development company will issue up to $2.1 billion of preferred stock and use the proceeds to buy more of the flagship crypto. Strategy’s $2.1B Stock Raise To Buy Bitcoin Strategy, one of the world’s largest publicly listed corporate Bitcoin holders, has announced the pricing of its latest round of Preferred Strife Perpetual stock, which the firm does before announcing more Bitcoin buys. The company has entered into a sales agreement to issue and sell up to $2.1 billion worth of shares of STRF via an at-the-market (ATM) program. Each share has a liquidation preference of $100 and has the same terms as the 8.5 million already outstanding. STRF, which offers a 10% annual cash dividend, is only available to institutional investors. The STRF shares will be sold gradually and strategically over a period of time through a sales agreement with TD Securities, Barclays Capital, and The Benchmark Company, which will act as sales agents. Of course, the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm said it plans to use the proceeds for “general corporate purposes,” including purchasing more Bitcoin — padding its stash of 576,230 BTC currently valued at over $63 billion. For context, the Saylor-founded company now owns more than 2.7% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. The timing of the latest offering coincides with a fresh all-time high price for Bitcoin. Earlier today, the price briefly touched $111,544 before settling near $111,100 as of publication time, according to CoinGecko data. Strategy is now sitting on over $23.8 billion in paper profits thanks to the ongoing Bitcoin rally. Interestingly, Bitcoin set a new record just ahead of Bitcoin Pizza Day .

Waters said the Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs (TRUMP) in Crypto Act of 2025 bill would be aimed at blocking the US President, Vice President, members of Congress, and their families from engaging in “crypto crime.” The US lawmaker referred to Trump and his wife, Melania, issuing personal memecoins in January, his family launching a stablecoin, USD1, through the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, and the president attempting to establish a national Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve as his sons back a BTC mining venture. “Donald Trump is preparing to dine with the top donors of his memecoin who’ve made him, and his family, richer,” said Waters, adding: “Trump’s crypto con is not just a scam to target investors.

Solaxy claims Layer 2 status on Solana, but real buzz surrounds Pepeto — offering tools, cross-chain swaps, and serious utility. Already holding Solaxy? Here’s something worth thinking about. Solaxy is being called the first Layer 2 on Solana, and while that sounds exciting, it’s important to ask: does Solana really need a Layer 2? On Ethereum , Layer 2 tech helps with speed and high fees. But Solana is already fast and cheap to use, so adding another layer doesn’t bring much change. Sure, Solaxy could still do a 5x, but its role on Solana doesn’t seem game-changing, and might not make history. You might also like: Memecoins to lead the market? Investors eye Pepe, Pepeto, Dogwifhat, Bonk, Floki Pepeto is more than just hype, it has Real tools, a strong story, and big plans Solaxy may have caught people’s attention, but Pepeto might be the one to remember. It’s not just a memecoin, Pepeto is building a full platform. The team is launching an exchange where new memecoins launching in 2025 will be listed. That means more use for the Pepeto token. It also comes with PepetoSwap, a system that helps people trade across different blockchains using bridge tech. Moving tokens between chains like Solana and Ethereum will be fast and cheap. Here’s why many believe Pepeto has real value: A full exchange for listing new memecoins PepetoSwap for easy, low-cost cross-chain trading Bridge tech that connects different blockchains A staking system that rewards holders A growing and active community Tier-1 exchange listings coming soon A bold backstory linked to Pepe’s origin https://twitter.com/Pepetocoin/status/1915525989653754298 But the story is what really makes people talk. Many believe that Pepe the Frog’s early success came from stealing Pepeto’s first documents, P,E,P, and E, which stand for Precision, Energy, Power, and Efficiency. But Pepe rushed the launch , without the final two: T for Technology and O for Optimization. That’s the full name: P-E-P-E-T-O, and what makes Pepeto complete. Many now believe the original Pepe founder, who was left out and betrayed, is behind Pepeto. This time, it’s not just another memecoin, it’s a project with technology, vision, and a mission to lead the meme market in 2025. Joining the PEPETO project takes just a few simple steps: Set Up a Crypto Wallet – Use a wallet that supports Ethereum, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Deposit Funds – Add ETH, USDT, or BNB to your wallet. Participate in the Presale – Go to pepeto.io to purchase PEPETO tokens. Stake Holdings – Access the staking platform to start earning passive rewards. Why PEPETO stands out PEPETO brings together the viral appeal of memecoins with real blockchain utility. From a zero-fee trading platform and cross-chain bridge to high staking incentives, it’s positioned as a major contender in the evolving crypto landscape, especially heading into 2025.

First ones will be the large caps like LINK. A trend reversal is clearly visible on the chart with a short term resistance at $19 and golden pocket at $23.

But while many are chasing green candles, more seasoned investors are shifting their focus to undervalued cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and long-term potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of those standout opportunities. The project has just successfully completed its 4th presale phase, moving its token price from $0.025 to $0.03, and officially entering Phase 5. With nearly $9 million raised and nearly 11,000 holders, the presale has shown strong traction—signaling not just interest, but real commitment from early participants. As newer buyers scramble to identify what crypto to invest in now, smart capital is accumulating MUTM ahead of its exchange debut. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Despite its presale momentum, Mutuum Finance is still priced under $0.03, while offering a platform with multiple utilities already in development. Its structure is designed for real usage, not just token speculation. And as most eyes stay fixed on high-cap assets during this rally, MUTM’s below-the-radar positioning makes it one of the best cryptocurrency to invest in today for those thinking beyond next week’s trend. One of the project’s most appealing features is its mtToken system, which offers depositors tokenized receipts that gradually increase in value over time. But beyond passive income, the broader utility of mtTokens gives users access to platform features and rewards based on activity, creating a deeper layer of value interaction not found in most DeFi crypto protocols. Mutuum’s model isn’t just built around yield—it also incorporates protocol-driven token buybacks. A percentage of revenue generated from platform usage is used to purchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders, creating a built-in reward cycle that increases the appeal of long-term participation. In addition to this, the protocol will soon introduce staking mechanisms where users can lock their tokens in exchange for added benefits, including potential access to governance, exclusive pools, or higher reward tiers. This layered structure enhances holder incentives and encourages continued platform engagement well beyond the presale phase. Presale Success Adds to Investor Confidence Closing out Phase 4 and entering the 5th phase at $0.03, Mutuum’s presale is proving to be one of the most active in the current market cycle. With a total of 11 phases and a confirmed launch price of $0.06, early buyers are still ahead of the curve—and that opportunity won’t last forever. The growing number of contributors shows that interest isn’t just coming from small buyers. Data indicates that larger wallets have begun accumulating, especially as the project is expected to be listed on major centralized exchanges following the presale—driven by its strong community backing and the practical utilities being developed within the ecosystem. In a market driven by narratives, it’s easy to overlook projects that aren’t chasing attention. But history has shown that long-term winners are often found in strong fundamentals backed by real product development—and that’s what Mutuum is delivering. The protocol is currently undergoing a CertiK audit, which adds another layer of trust for those who prefer transparency and reliability in early-stage crypto investments. Between that and a well-paced, milestone-driven rollout plan, MUTM is gaining reputation as a top crypto to buy while it’s still undervalued. With the Greed Index rising, market conditions are ripe for FOMO-driven decisions. But smart investors are looking beneath the surface—choosing long-term plays with utility, community backing, and clear development progress. Mutuum Finance, now firmly in its 5th presale phase, offers all of that while remaining under $0.03. As the market tilts toward euphoria, MUTM stands out not because it’s trending—but because it’s building. And that’s what makes it one of the most undervalued cryptocurrencies right now.

Despite a decline in public attention as indicated by Google Trends data, XRP continues to signal strength on its price chart, setting the stage for a potentially historic move. A Technical Breakout on the Horizon According to STEPH IS CRYPTO, XRP is approaching its highest monthly close in recent years, with closing above the critical $2 threshold acting as a psychological and technical milestone. This level, he explains, is saturated with liquidity from long positions, making it a “hot zone” for both institutional and retail interest. If XRP can hold and advance beyond this range, the chart reveals the possibility of a breakout toward the $20 to $25 range within the next few months. #XRP : BIGGEST CHANCE OF YOUR LIFE!!! pic.twitter.com/B0i7vAC0cu — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 21, 2025 This projection is rooted in technical momentum and trendline analysis. XRP’s price has been forming a structure that suggests an explosive breakout is brewing. While some market participants may be cautious due to XRP’s subdued visibility—Google Trends data indicates an 85% drop in search interest—the underlying chart paints a different picture. STEPH IS CRYPTO emphasized that market sentiment and price action can diverge, especially when institutional interest quietly accumulates in high-liquidity zones. Fear and Greed Index: XRP Flashes Greed Supporting this bullish scenario is the Fear and Greed Index, where XRP currently scores a “greed” reading of 70. This suggests that despite recent volatility, the broader sentiment among investors is increasingly risk-on. Historically, elevated greed levels can either precede short-term corrections or act as a launchpad for sustained rallies—context determines the outcome. While some investors may interpret the greed score as a potential warning sign, in this case, it complements the overall thesis of strengthening momentum. It reflects rising confidence in XRP’s trajectory, further reinforced by a confluence of technical and on-chain indicators. On-Chain Activity and Exchange Inflows XRP’s recent market dynamics have also been influenced by notable on-chain activity. In the last 24 hours alone, approximately $178.6 million in XRP was transferred into Crypto.com, while Bitstamp received another 20 million tokens valued at $47.2 million. These substantial inflows have generated temporary selling pressure, contributing to some short-term volatility. However, such movements are not necessarily bearish in the broader context. High exchange inflows can indicate profit-taking, but they also reflect increased token circulation and accessibility, essential components for fostering liquidity, especially when preparing for larger-scale trading activity. STEPH IS CRYPTO noted that this recent selling pressure should be met with patience, as market digestion of large token transfers often precedes renewed upward movement.

As institutional and retail participants evaluate blockchain assets for real-world utility and long-term adoption, cost efficiency becomes a central consideration. XRP excels here, with transaction fees that are often a fraction of a cent, far lower than many competing assets. This makes XRP not only ideal for cross-border settlements and rapid transactions but also for high-frequency trading and institutional positioning. As market participants increasingly prioritize scalable, cost-effective solutions, XRP’s architecture provides a durable competitive advantage. A Market Poised for a Shift XRP may be operating in the shadows of lower Google search traffic, but beneath the surface, the fundamentals are aligning for a major breakout. With strong technical signals, rising institutional flows, and unwavering efficiency through low fees, XRP is gaining momentum where it counts most—on the chart and in the ledger. For those watching the market closely, STEPH IS CRYPTO’s insights offer a timely reminder: investor focus may waver, but assets with robust design and utility are often the ones that lead the next phase of growth. If current patterns hold, XRP may not only reclaim higher levels—it may chart an entirely new course. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Abbott is expected to support the bill. He has backed crypto for years, even accepting crypto campaign donations since 2014, in a bid to make Texas “the crypto capital.” Observers doubt he’ll say no. How SB 21 Reshapes Texas’s Financial Future with Bitcoin SB 21 gives the state comptroller the power to buy and hold Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency whose market capitalization tops $500 billion for 12 consecutive months, but right now, only Bitcoin meets the bar. The comptroller would manage the reserve, invest surplus funds, and cover administrative expenses with proceeds generated by the holdings. However, the Legislative Budget Board admits it’s still unclear how big the reserve could be or what financial impact it might have. Representative Giovanni Capriglione, who pushed the bill in the House, called the vote “a pivotal moment in securing Texas’s leadership with a modern store of value for future promise.” Supporters argue that adding Bitcoin to the treasury diversifies state assets and shows Texas’s openness to blockchain innovation. With a $2.7 trillion economy and a fast-growing Bitcoin mining industry, Texas would become the largest government in the world to hold Bitcoin. The Crypto Divide: Which States Are Leading and Why Others Are Hesitant America’s states are divided on Bitcoin as some have rushed to embrace it, while others continue to push back hard. On May 6, New Hampshire blazed the trail, becoming the first state to let its treasury hold Bitcoin. Now, Texas stands ready to follow. North Carolina is following suit with nearly identical House and Senate proposals currently awaiting floor votes, while crypto-friendly Wyoming is considering legislation that would grant its treasurer direct Bitcoin purchasing authority. However, resistance persists in other states. New Hampshire just became the first U.S. state to legally adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. HB 302 lets the treasurer park up to 5 % in Bitcoin. Game on. pic.twitter.com/ACabIV3zxe — Swan (@Swan) May 6, 2025 In Arizona, the governor rejected a BTC reserve proposal, while Florida’s legislature withdrew two similar measures. Montana said no, fearing the wild price swings of the crypto market. Across the country, 47 Bitcoin bills sit on lawmakers’ desks in 26 states. About half are still under active consideration. Meanwhile, in Washington, 13 proposals float the idea of a national Bitcoin vault filled with seized coins. Treasurers and officials now weigh custody, compliance, and price swings. Yet more states (and countries) indicate that holding Bitcoin as a strategic asset has moved from a fringe idea to a serious fiscal debate. Bitcoin Reserve — Mayer Mizrachi (@Mayer) May 16, 2025 Internationally, Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi teased plans for a municipal Bitcoin reserve after meeting El Salvador advisers Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, posting “Bitcoin Reserve” on X. Bitcoin’s Biggest Buyers: Corporations vs. Governments—Who’s Winning? Kyiv is prepping its Bitcoin reserve plans.

JUST IN: Michael Saylor said Strategy is doubling their fundraising to raise $84 billion to buy more #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/NPg0E5GLF2 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 1, 2025 Earlier, Japanese firm Metaplanet spent ¥18.4 billion ($126 million) on 1,241 BTC (within the same period) and lifted its stockpile to 6,796 Bitcoin. These moves reflect a broader pattern. Publicly listed firms boosted their combined reserves by 16.1% in Q1 2025, taking corporate holdings to roughly 688,000 BTC, or about 3.3% of the asset’s total supply. Governments are catching up. The U.S. leads stakeholders, with global nations estimated to control between 463,741 and 527,737 BTC (2.2%–2.5% of supply). Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs) Could Texas’s Bitcoin reserve face federal regulatory hurdles? Federal agencies might challenge it. The SEC could argue that Bitcoin qualifies as a security, while the Treasury may raise monetary policy concerns. However, states traditionally control their reserves, setting up a potential showdown over financial sovereignty. Does Texas’s move pressure other states to accelerate crypto adoption? Absolutely. Texas just upped the ante. Crypto-friendly states will scramble to keep pace, while skeptics dig in, and this domino effect could reshape state-level crypto policy nationwide within months.

This explains why Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson is optimistic that ADA can power decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems for cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, and Bitcoin. Hoskinson’s point of view might be based on the fact that Cardano combines security architecture, scalability, smart contract functionality, and interoperability features. Fueling the DeFi networks of various cryptos is a welcome move since it will enhance Cardano’s adoption rate. Is Cardano Eyeing a Surprise Move to $1? Thanks to the general bullish momentum in the crypto market, which has seen Bitcoin soar to a new all-time high of $111,544, Cardano has reclaimed the psychological price of $0.75 with its eyes set on breaching the $0.80 zone. According to CoinGecko data, ADA was up by 25.2% in the past month to hit $0.8 at the time of writing. The ninth-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization might as well be contemplating a major leg up to $1. Market analyst Lingrid acknowledged, “ADA is rebounding from support after an extended correction within a broad channel. Multiple range breakouts show growing bullish intent beneath resistance. Price is now coiling near a key trendline intersection. If momentum builds, ADA may finally test the major downtrend ceiling. A surprise thrust toward $0.95 could shake the market.” Source: Lingrid Therefore, breaching the major downtrend ceiling will see Cardano soar to the psychological price of $1. Meanwhile, Cardano whales have been on a buying spree after recently amassing more than 80 million ADA, worth a whopping $57 million.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Bitcoin News|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Dogecoin|Litecoin|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|DOGE|LTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-22 17:39:37

XRP Begins Its Charge to $5,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/solana-price-prediction-is-a-1-trillion-market-cap-en-route-for-solana-xrp-begins-its-charge-to-5,"A new Solana economic theory has outlined SOL’s path to a $1 trillion market cap, as one analyst says he will be in utter disbelief if XRP doesn’t smash $5 this year! Let’s examine how high SOL and XRP could soar in 2025 amid increasing competition from fresh crypto presales. Solana's price has been on the fly During its recent upshot, Solana printed a new ATH in the $294 region. That was a parabolic 3575% upsurge from its bear market low of $8! Sadly, SOL faced crippling selling pressure, crashing down to earth to revisit the $96 region during its recent swing low. However, SOL appears to have regained its market footing, rising to consolidate in the $160-$180 zone. Source: CoinMarketCap Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL's market cap reach $1 trillion? Solana is currently the 6th largest crypto asset with a solid $88 billion market cap. A new Solana economic model now projects that the SOL market cap could hit $1 trillion! To smash that threshold, the Solana price needs to hit $2,000, representing a nearly 12x growth from current rates. That’s not small potatoes! Data-driven Solana price predictions reveal that SOL might print a new ATH in the $330 territory, but it may not sniff anywhere remotely close to $2,000 until 2050. Ripple's XRP continues its consolidation phase After reaching an ATH of $3.8 in 2018, XRP has been unable to surpass this level for nearly eight years. The closest XRP came to this zone was in January 2025, when the altcoin rocketed over 600%, rising to a high of $3.4. Lately, the XRP price has been consolidating in the $2 zone, with the recent launch of CME Group's XRP futures and the potential for a spot XRP ETF approval this year sparking bullish price forecasts for the cross-border payments token. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP's price prediction: Can XRP hit $5? Crypto researcher and analyst Rob Cunningham argues that the XRP price could register a massive breakout to $5 or even $15 in the short term. Cunningham cites Ripple's Hidden Road acquisition, CME Group futures, and the rising XRP ETF approval odds as the top bullish catalysts that could drive the token price to this new threshold. To hit $5 from current rates, XRP needs to register a 117%, pushing its market cap close to $300 billion. That's likely to take serious growth and adoption of the Ripple Network, and nobody expects it to happen overnight. Near-term XRP price predictions show that XRP might continue its accumulation in the $2 zone for the rest of the year, prompting investors to seek better yields in other low-cap crypto gems. SOL and XRP whales turn to presales It turns out that it may take years before XRP’s price hits $5, let alone Solana’s market cap hitting $1 trillion. While Solana and XRP remain top crypto assets, investors seeking more exciting ROIs are diversifying into new presale gems like Remittix (RTX) . This Ethereum-based crypto-to-fiat payment network is tipped to cause a seismic shift in the $190 trillion cross-border payments market, thanks to its innovative DeFi payment solution that powers real-time international money transfers at a fraction of traditional costs. The RTX token is already up over 400%, but top crypto analysts argue that this PayFi token might register another 10,000% upshot in 2025, turning holders into millionaires.

The “private in-person dinner will be attended by a 220 wallet-based guest list, with the top 25 holders getting a VIP reception with the president. The top 25 wallets will have a one-on-one with President Trump at the White House, an honor only reserved for heads of state, an hour before the main three-and-a-half-hour dinner kicks off at 6 PM. Thursday’s “ultra-exclusive private VIP reception” for Trump memecoin holders is reportedly the latest instance of the president ignoring ethical boundaries between the office and his profit-seeking. His obvious contempt for such boundaries has angered commentators across the political spectrum. At the top of the list of concerns raised by the President’s critics is worry about the potential for foreigners to buy access to the sitting president, something the US Constitution explicitly prohibits. The concerns are based on the fact that most of the top TRUMP memecoin holders, including the top investors, are based in foreign countries. Additionally, due to the anonymous nature of crypto, the real identities of the top TRUMP holders, who only provide self-selected three- to four-letter usernames and long cryptographic digital wallet addresses, are not easy to pinpoint. Murphy says the gala dinner ‘represents a real problem’ The top buyers of Trump's meme coin – mostly foreign oligarchs likely – get their secret meeting with him tomorrow night. It's fundamentally corrupt – a way to buy access to the the President. The White House needs to release the list of attendees. pic.twitter.com/NtH1fvcceQ — Chris Murphy 🟧 (@ChrisMurphyCT) May 21, 2025 Connecticut Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy said in a hearing this week that the gala “represents a real problem.” Republican crypto advocate Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming also said the event gave her “pause.” The progressive advocacy group Public Citizen is organizing a protest outside the Potomac Falls, Virginia, golf course on Thursday and is calling on the Department of Justice and other officials to hold Trump accountable. The U.S. President reportedly likes to blur the lines between personal business and public office, but his critics suggested that he would be helping himself by calling off his Thursday gala. They added that if he failed to do that, he could at least disclose 220 wallet holders so Americans know who may be trying to buy access to the President. “There is clearly a way around the State Department for foreign individuals of significant influence and wealth to be able to directly lobby the president.” – Chris Murphy , junior U.S. Senator for Connecticut Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun is the only publicly known guest, and he has invested nearly $100 million in Trump-related crypto projects, including $75 million in WLFI and roughly $22 million in TRUMP. According to Forbes, Sun’s actions, including the buying he influenced from other crypto enthusiasts, have generated about $400 million for the Trump family. Democrats warn Trump is seeking to enrich himself Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said the first 114 days of Trump’s administration were “one bad deal after another for American families.” He, however, pointed out that the same 114 days were the greatest deal of all time for the Trumps. Democrats and ethics groups argued that the potential corruption of the second Trump administration had far surpassed the first term. However, Tiffany Muller, president of the Democratic-aligned group End Citizens United, said that how Democrats message their anti-corruption arguments will be critical. She added that Democrats should talk about tangible actions they can take to fight corruption, including a congressional stock trading ban. Faiz Shakir, an adviser to independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, argued that Democrats should combine pushback on corruption with a “proactive, positive agenda,” similar to tactics used by Democrats in the 2006 midterms when they took control of both chambers of Congress. However, while some Republicans like Lummis have expressed concerns about Trump’s potential conflicts of interest, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the president’s actions.

On-chain evidence shows that the attacker recently converted 8,697 ETH into 22 million DAI, a dollar-pegged stablecoin. Around the same time, a separate address – believed to be part of the same operation and which had received 9,081 ETH via THORChain – was used to convert those funds into another $23 million in DAI. The transactions, flagged by PeckShield, indicate an effort to move the illicit funds into stable assets, as part of a broader money laundering strategy. On-Chain Troll What makes this case especially brazen is the attacker’s decision to taunt ZachXBT, a well-known crypto sleuth, using Ethereum’s transaction message field to deliver an insult and a meme video link. The message, simply stating “L bozo,” was followed by a clip of NBA legend James Worthy smoking a cigar. ZachXBT, who posted about the taunt on his Telegram channel, confirmed that blockchain evidence links the sender of this message to the same entity responsible for the breach that compromised tens of thousands of Coinbase users. These latest transactions and taunts arrive in the wake of Coinbase’s admission that the breach affected at least 69,400 users and stemmed from a campaign that began in December 2024 but was only discovered in May 2025. According to disclosures filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, the attacker bribed Coinbase customer support personnel to gain internal access to user data. The scope of the breach is severe and includes compromised information such as users’ full identities, contact information, account balances, and transaction histories. Coinbase has said it rejected a $20 million ransom demand from the hacker in exchange for deleting the stolen data. Unauthorized Biometric Data Collection Coinbase is also facing a class-action lawsuit from Illinois residents who claim the crypto exchange unlawfully collected and shared their biometric data during identity verification. Filed on May 13, the suit accuses the crypto exchange of violating Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by capturing facial geometry from selfies and ID photos without obtaining user consent or providing proper disclosure. The biometric data was allegedly analyzed by third-party vendors such as Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix, and Solaris. Plaintiffs also claim Coinbase refused to pay arbitration fees for over 10,000 individual cases, which led to their dismissal. The lawsuit includes three counts of BIPA violations and one count of consumer fraud under Illinois law.

Here's What to Expect,https://bitzo.com/2025/05/bitcoin-reaches-fresh-ath-could-this-trigger-another-rally-for-sol-and-eth-like-januarys-surge-heres-what-to-expect,"Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high , hinting at potential ripple effects in the crypto market. This surge raises questions about whether Solana and Ethereum could see significant gains, similar to the explosive growth witnessed in January. Key factors and expert opinions will reveal which coins are poised to follow Bitcoin's impressive climb. ETH Price Dynamics: Surge in Month, Correction Over Six Months Last month ETH saw a 67.11% price boost and a six-month decline of 20.69%. This reflects a rapid recovery in the short term, contrasted by longer-term weakness. The recent price surge has shown impressive momentum, highlighting volatility in the market. Strong monthly gains stand out against a backdrop of extended bearish pressure, showcasing the coin's fluctuating behavior. Current price ranges from $1468.66 to $2037.85, with key resistance at $2280.82 and support at $1142.44. Bulls are trying to take charge near the upper range, but the absence of a strong trend suggests a cautious approach. Trading within these levels could mean targeting gains as resistance is approached while looking to enter on dips at support. SOL’s Rebound Amid Mixed Long-Term Trends SOL experienced nearly a 30% rise over the past month despite a 31% decline over the last six months. The one-week change remains minimal at 0.12%, indicating short-term steadiness against broader volatility. Recent price movements highlight a short-term bounce off negative trends long term, suggesting anticipation for an upcoming altcoin season amid overall market uncertainty. Current trading sees SOL moving within a range of about $110 to $171 , with key resistance levels at $194.93 and $256.57 and support at $71.65, with a secondary support near $10.01. RSI stands at 62.62, with oscillators signaling limited momentum. Bulls may push higher if resistance is broken, while bears maintain pressure. Trading within these levels offers short-term opportunities. Conclusion Bitcoin's new all-time high presents a promising scenario for other cryptocurrencies. If history repeats itself, a surge similar to January’s could drive SOL and ETH upwards. Investors may see this as an opportunity to diversify or increase their holdings in these coins. Past trends suggest that significant movements in Bitcoin often impact other major cryptocurrencies. Both SOL and ETH have shown potential to benefit from Bitcoin's momentum. Hence, market participants might expect a positive ripple effect, leading to possible price increases in SOL and ETH following Bitcoin's performance.

Meanwhile, Unilabs (UNIL), an emerging AI project, outshone ADA’s demand and went viral after revealing up to 122% APYs on staking, surpassing Cardano’s usual up to 7% APY by a significant margin. The AI-powered asset management platform has raised over $30 million in assets under management, highlighting its growing user base. The Unilabs presale has sold over 163 million worth of tokens within two weeks of public launch, setting new standards for ICOs. Experts suggest Unilabs’ staking utility and diverse practical use cases put it in a better position than the Cardano price in the upcoming utility-driven bull leg. Let’s understand how the rising UNIL token can surpass ADA’s growth by the end of the year. Cardano Price Prediction: Is ADA Entering A Bearish Phase? The Cardano price swiftly bounced from the $0.5 support level as the crypto market bulls finally woke up last month after a long silence in the first quarter of 2025. With the introduction of fresh capital, ADA established an upward trend and gained nearly 50% within one and a half months. Last week, the Cardano price lost upward momentum, due to which it reversed from the $0.84 resistance. After a 3.8% intraday surge, it currently trades at $0.756. ADA has been consolidating at the $0.72 support level for the previous few days, where bullish pressure has kept it from falling. Image source: CoinMarketCap If demand declines and bears take control, the Cardano price may slip below the immediate $0.72 support and drop out of the short-term ascending channel. However, if the broader market continues to recover, it can help ADA resume the rally and reach the longer-term resistance at $1.15. Unilabs (UNIL): Earn Passive Income With AI-Backed Portfolios While the Cardano price struggles to maintain bullish momentum, Unilabs is rising steadily, breaking key milestones in its live presale. The UNIL presale has surpassed the $750,000 mark in the first ten days, highlighting the tremendous demand for the undervalued token. With its advanced AI-backed asset management platform, Unilabs is at the forefront of DeFi’s next era. It allows users to invest in growing projects without actively monitoring the market. The platform offers four fund baskets: BTC, AI, RWA, and Mining, which are entirely managed by Unilabs’ AI. The AI scans early-stage opportunities as they arrive in the market and continuously rebalances the $30 million locked capital in these baskets to generate the sector’s highest returns. Users who invest in these funds receive periodic dividends directly in their linked wallets. UNIL Staking Rewards Apart from the consistent fund profits, users can also earn impressive staking rewards by locking in their UNIL tokens. Staking helps keep the ecosystem running by maintaining proper liquidity. Unilabs provides up to 122% APY on staking and offers occasional bonus rewards using a share of the platform’s revenue. UNIL is currently priced at the low price of $0.0051 in stage two of the presale. The token’s value has surged 27.5% over the past week, as the stage one price was $0.004. New investors can make similar gains when UNIL reaches a valuation of $0.0062 in the third stage. Conclusion As the Cardano price action becomes uncertain, ADA investors are moving towards rising projects such as Unilabs, which can offer better growth in the 2025 bull market. The UNIL presale offers an excellent option for investors who are looking for stable and predictable returns in the next stage of the new bull cycle.

The digital gold rush is now headed toward Remittix (RTX), an emerging XRP rival tipped to cause a cosmic storm in the cross-border payments economy. Let’s examine why top crypto analysts believe RTX might register a 10,000% rally this year, leaving ETH and XRP choking in the dust. Can Remittix return 100x to investors? This PayFi token is already up over 400% in presale, sparking insane investor interest as whales stockpile over 537 million RTX tokens. Remittix’s innovative DeFi payment solution is the top reason why crypto whales can’t get enough of this new altcoin. The Ethereum-based dApp features a revolutionary crypto-to-fiat payment network that links crypto assets to local financial systems globally, seamlessly combining the speed of crypto with the convenience of fiat. This clever approach enables the average consumer and small business owners to conduct real-time cross-border money transfers at low fees, slashing the delays and high costs synonymous with traditional bank wires. Top market pundits now posit that Remittix is positioned to cut a huge chunk of the $190 trillion cross-border settlements and remittances market as the use of crypto gains traction in this sector. Capturing even 1% of this market would push the platform's market cap into the billions, turning investor holdings into life-altering balances as the RTX price soars over 100x! Ethereum price prediction: Can ETH hit $5,000? During its bullish upswings last year, ETH tried to push past the $4.1k zone two times but faced crippling selloffs anytime it approached. At the start of April, ETH crumbled to the $1.3k zone but has been pushing up lately, rising to retest the $2.7k psychological barrier in its recent mini rally. Source: CoinMarketCap It remains to be seen whether Vitalik Buterin's roadmap to improve Ethereum's scalability will trigger enough buying pressure to help ETH overcome barriers in the $2.5k region and blow past $2.7k. CoinCodex Ethereum price predictions reveal that ETH could jump back to $4.5k this year. But despite a 54% upshot in the past month, ETH still languishes with over 30% yearly losses and might not be able to smash $5k before winter. XRP likely to stagnate in the $2 zone Ripple's XRP almost smashed its 2018 ATH of $3.8 when it hit a new seven-year high of $3.4 in January. Sadly, XRP tumbled back to the $2 zone, where it has been accumulating for months. Source: CoinMarketCap While market participants expected the optimism surrounding the launch of CME Group's XRP futures to propel the asset price back to above $3, XRP failed to exceed the $2.6 resistance level. Traders are now pegging their hope on the upcoming spot XRP ETFs, whose approval odds have jumped significantly to 83% on Polymarket . Market experts believe a US spot XRP ETF could attract up to $8 billion in inflows in the first year, pushing the XRP price to new heights.

In the last month, DOGE’s price saw its MACD flip positively, holding critical support above $0.22. With the price of DOGE now consolidating above key support levels, onlookers are setting bullish Dogecoin price predictions that could see the leading meme coin surpass the fabled $1 price target. Dogecoin price predictions forecast an upcoming upward momentum After a devastating drop of over 70% from peak prices late last year, DOGE is finally making a comeback as its price rebounds from the 0.786 Fibonacci Retracement zone. Image Source: Trading View Dogecoin has managed to break through its previous downturn, with its price currently consolidating above the $0.20 support. Even so, DOGE still faces major selling pressure at the $0.26 mark. Dogecoin’s RSI signals also show that DOGE’s price is retesting overbought levels now that RSI is below 55.49. However, analysts are setting up bullish Dogecoin price predictions based on a combination of DOGE’s RSI with the meme coin’s higher highs on the price chart. According to some chart watchers, this combination sets up a hidden bullish divergence that often appears right before an upward streak continues. Image Source: CoinMarketCap Can DOGE help you retire? Dogecoin price predictions aside, the price of DOGE has surged by over 260,000% in the last decade. That surge would be enough to turn a paltry $100 investment in DOGE into millions. However, at today’s prices, a meteoric Dogecoin price uptick is unlikely given the level of legitimacy DOGE is receiving from institutional buyers. Dogecoin’s market is maturing with the advent of institutional investors seeking more stable derivatives of the popular meme coin. Dogecoin has gained popularity against the backdrop of its upcoming ETF approval by the SEC. There has been an increase in on-chain investor activity in anticipation of DOGE’s institutional adoption. Increased institutional interest towards DOGE will render Dogecoin’s price less volatile, even while DOGE’ s network activity surges 990%. Therefore, for investors seeking meteoric gains, the best opportunity to retire is in upcoming presale tokens with bullish potential. Remittix's RTX presale gains traction, raising over $15 million Talking of presale tokens that will help you retire, Remittix’s RTX token is the latest sensation, capturing investor attention. This emerging cross-border payment platform, built with a revolutionary PayFi protocol, is set to disrupt a potential $250 trillion remittance market. With Remittix, a crypto holder can send funds across a local payment network and have the recipient receive a simple bank transfer in over 30 fiat currencies. The recipient is completely obscured from the complexities of crypto wallets, making Remittix ideal for mass adoption. Remittix also offers a Pay API for businesses looking to accept crypto payments from customers. Their platform supports over 40 cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, enabling flexibility while bridging the gap between crypto and traditional banking networks. Remittix's ongoing presale has raised over $15.2 million since it started, and RTX is now priced at $0.0781. The next stage of the presale will see the price increase to $0.0811, which is still a discount considering analysts are predicting a 3,000% potential for RTX. PayFi is quickly becoming the next bullish wave in the crypto space. Dogecoin price predictionsmight be bullish, but the meme coin frenzy is getting saturated. If you are seeking bullish gains, Remittix offers real-world utility that could see its platform achieve mass adoption in the near future.

Here’s How Investors Can Benefit,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-futures-etf-is-now-live-on-nasdaq-heres-how-investors-can-benefit/,"In a landmark development for both the digital asset sector and traditional finance, the first-ever XRP Futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has officially gone live on the Nasdaq. According to an announcement from the X-based community Ripplexity, the ETF, launched by Volatility Shares, marks a historic step forward for the mainstream adoption of XRP by providing regulated exposure to its price through futures contracts. This milestone places XRP alongside the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which have seen their futures-based ETFs open doors for traditional investors to participate in crypto markets without direct custody of the digital asset. For XRP, this debut on one of the world’s leading stock exchanges signals not only increased legitimacy but also a broader opportunity for diversification within institutional and retail investment portfolios. BREAKING: XRP Futures ETF is now LIVE on Nasdaq! Volatility Shares launches the first-ever XRP futures ETF, giving investors regulated exposure to XRP via derivatives. A historic moment for mainstream adoption. #XRP #ETF #Ripple #Nasdaq #XRPL pic.twitter.com/eJfI3WmjqG — Ripplexity (@RippleXity) May 22, 2025 Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto Futures ETFs have become an essential bridge between legacy financial systems and the evolving digital asset space. By tracking XRP’s futures contracts rather than its spot market price, the newly listed ETF allows investors to gain exposure to XRP without needing to manage private wallets, engage with crypto exchanges, or confront regulatory uncertainty directly. This structure is particularly attractive to risk-conscious institutions and traditional asset managers who must adhere to strict compliance and custody protocols. With the ETF listed on Nasdaq and regulated by U.S. financial authorities, it adds a new layer of credibility and risk mitigation to XRP-based investment products. Moreover, as demand for crypto-linked financial instruments grows, the XRP Futures ETF represents a signal to the broader market that institutional appetite is expanding beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP’s inclusion reflects its growing relevance in global finance, particularly in the cross-border payments sector , where it continues to demonstrate real-world utility. What This Means for XRP’s Market Dynamics The launch of an XRP Futures ETF could serve as a powerful catalyst for increased market liquidity and price discovery. Futures products often bring new volumes and investor behavior into play, which can deepen market participation and enhance overall trading efficiency. Because futures contracts are leveraged instruments, they often draw in more active traders, including hedge funds and algorithmic strategies. This can contribute to tighter spreads, greater volatility, and higher trading volume—key ingredients for a dynamic and responsive market environment. While it’s important to note that futures-based ETFs don’t require the direct purchase of XRP tokens, their existence still influences demand indirectly. As more institutional investors take interest in XRP through regulated channels, the ecosystem surrounding the asset—including spot trading, custody solutions, and liquidity provisioning—will naturally expand. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Boost for XRP’s Broader Adoption Narrative This ETF launch arrives at a time when Ripple, the company closely associated with XRP, is advancing its global ambitions in blockchain-powered finance. From central bank digital currency (CBDC) partnerships to regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions, the XRP ecosystem is steadily aligning with the needs of the modern financial system. By offering exposure to XRP in a traditional investment wrapper, the Volatility Shares ETF can act as an entry point for investors who were previously hesitant due to the complexities of the crypto space. It reduces friction, simplifies access, and opens the door to the trillions of dollars managed in pension funds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other institutional vehicles. This development also reinforces XRP’s role as one of the most actively used and recognized digital assets for real-time payments and settlement. As investor awareness and adoption grow through regulated instruments like ETFs, XRP’s long-term value proposition becomes more visible to a mainstream audience. A Defining Moment for XRP The launch of the XRP Futures ETF on Nasdaq marks a watershed moment in the evolution of crypto-financial products. Volatility Shares’ move to bring XRP into the ETF arena is more than a technical achievement—it’s a statement about the asset’s maturity, resilience, and future potential. With regulatory scrutiny still high across the broader crypto market, a Nasdaq-listed product offering exposure to XRP sends a clear message: the demand for secure, transparent, and regulated access to digital assets is only accelerating. For investors, this presents a timely opportunity to engage with XRP in a framework that meets the standards of traditional finance while offering exposure to the innovation of the blockchain era. As Ripplexity aptly noted, this is a historic moment—not just for XRP, but for the broader convergence of crypto and conventional finance.

Having successfully sustained momentum over the $2,000 price level, the second-largest crypto by market cap has become more attractive to traders and investors alike. Sharing his bullish outlook for ETH, pseudonymous analyst Ali_Chart, most known for summarizing emerging price trends, took to X, formerly Twitter, to disclose his most recent observation. “If Ethereum ETH breaks above the $2,588 resistance, it could trigger a bullish move toward $3,000.” The analyst wrote, as a caption atop a candlestick technical chart pattern displaying a steady increase in buying pressure over the past day. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1925150143919120635?s=46&t=qzsvHvtDB3yjTaoaylh-2g Ether bulls are still gunning for $3,000 On a fundamental level, Ethereum has hit a notable milestone due to continued accumulation over a long period. According to data from Santiment, Ethereum’s ratio of coins on exchanges has dropped to an all-time low, suggesting a growing demand for Ether. Per Santiment’s report ; “Ethereum has under 4.9% of its supply on exchanges for the first time in its 10+ year history, since November 2018.” Remarkably, over the last 5 years, ETH accumulation has increased rapidly, resulting in a 15.3 million reduction in the total number of Ether on exchanges. At press time, ETH is trading at $2,655 per coin. Although ETH sustained mild losses over the last 7 days, 30-day gains remain above 59%. $2,750 and $2,850 are still key crucial resistance levels to watch out for, and a break above these prices could position ETH for a rally to the $3,000 price mark.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-22 18:02:09

The firm announced earlier today that it plans to sell up to $2.1 billion worth of preferred stock. The money raised will mainly go toward buying more Bitcoin, reinforcing the company’s long-standing bet on the digital asset. Strategy To Sell Preferred Stock With Major Partnerships Strategy announced that it will sell its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock shares under the ticker “STRF” on Nasdaq. The Nasdaq-listed company has made a deal with TD Securities, Barclays Capital, and the Benchmark Company to handle the sales. Depending on market conditions, these firms will act as agents and can sell the shares over time. Notably, no set number of shares must be sold, and the agents are not required to hit any sales target. They will receive a fee of up to 2% of what they sell. The returns from this stock sale will not be kept in escrow, and the company can use the funds as needed. The stock is trading at $100.65 as of May 21. The new shares will carry the same terms as the 8.5 million already in circulation. Strategy New STRF Offering Brings Flexibility Amid Legal Heat The new share offering allows Strategy to sell shares when market conditions are right. This allows the company to raise money without rushing or locking into strict terms. Each share is worth $100 and pays a 10% yearly dividend. However, this 10% dividend is not guaranteed. It depends on whether the company has enough money and whether the board agrees to pay it. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin-focused firm is currently facing serious legal trouble . A group of investors recently filed a class action lawsuit against Strategy. The complaints accused the firm of making false and misleading statements about its profits and the risks associated with its large Bitcoin holdings . Bitcoin at the Center of Strategy’s Future This offering comes as Bitcoin just hit a new all-time high . Earlier today, the asset price briefly touched $111,861 before easing back to around $111,000. For Strategy, this is a strong signal to keep investing in Bitcoin. As of May 21, Strategy owns 576,230 BTC. Starting in August 2020, these were bought at an average price of $69,726 per Bitcoin. At today’s value, those holdings are worth just under $64 billion, nearly 59% more than the company initially paid. Bitcoin now accounts for more than half of Strategy’s total market value, which is $111.4 billion. This latest stock offering will help the company buy more Bitcoin and support its general business needs.

Lastly, the analyst says that the top memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ) may be printing a bull pennant pattern on the hourly chart, a continuation pattern where a period of consolidation is often followed by a breakout. “DOGE appears to be breaking out of a bull pennant, which suggests a target of $0.31!” Source: Ali Martinez/X DOGE is trading for $0.24 at time of writing, up 4.2% in the last 24 hours.

The holdup follows earlier delays on would-be ETFs tied to Ethereum staking, XRP, and Dogecoin. Crypto enthusiasts still hope to see more exchange-traded products make it to market, but the SEC is proceeding with caution. The agency says it needs added time to sort through technical details, legal questions, and investor-protection issues. With the extension, regulators now have until July 6, 2025, to rule on Bitwise’s plan for an Ethereum staking ETF. The extra window, the SEC notes, will help it weigh the risks and mechanics of bringing staking into a publicly traded fund. SEC DELAYS 21SHARES XRP ETF APPROVAL pic.twitter.com/zVFjbBt3gc — Criptovaluta.it (@CriptovalutaI) May 20, 2025 A similar timeline is expected for Solana-based ETFs, including those proposed by Bitwise and 21Shares, both of which seek to provide institutional investors with regulated exposure to SOL. Institutional Adoption Slows Amid Ongoing Uncertainty Institutional investors looking to gain direct exposure to alternative assets like Solana continue to face hurdles as U.S. regulators weigh market risks, volatility, and consumer protection frameworks. The SEC’s recent extensions not only affect the timelines for these products but also indicate broader skepticism about rapidly integrating cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. While firms like Bitwise and 21Shares have emphasized their adherence to compliance standards and transparency, the inclusion of features like staking, where users earn rewards for helping secure the blockchain, adds another layer of complexity that the SEC appears hesitant to approve without extensive review. Surprise Approval Remains Despite the delays, speculation persists within the industry that one crypto ETF could be greenlit ahead of schedule. Though no specific product has been named, the possibility of a surprise approval is keeping industry watchers on alert. In the meantime, the SEC’s extensions indicate that no major breakthroughs in crypto ETF policy are expected before mid-2025, leaving market participants in a holding pattern. The SEC’s latest actions reflect a careful, methodical approach to crypto ETF approval, prioritizing due diligence over market momentum. SEC Slammed With 70+ Crypto ETF Filings In April, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that more than 70 cryptocurrency ETFs are currently awaiting review by the SEC.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at around $111,500 Thursday afternoon, up 4.2% over the past 24 hours. Despite Bitcoin’s strength, the rally is not lifting Strategy stock. MSTR was trading flat for the day at around $403. This performance suggests that the previously strong correlation between Bitcoin and MSTR has broken. There are two main reasons for this divergence. First, Strategy investors are increasingly concerned about ongoing dilution, as the company continues to borrow heavily to finance its Bitcoin purchases. The chart below shows that common shares outstanding have risen from 75.5 million in 2020 to 246 million today. MSTR stock dilution | Source: TradingView This dilution will continue as Strategy revealed that it was selling $2.1 billion in preferred stock sales to fuel Bitcoin purchases.

While most of this capital will go toward Bitcoin purchases, some will support broader corporate initiatives. MSTR stock has underperformed Bitcoin as investors question its valuation and mounting losses. The company currently holds 576,230 coins valued at over 64 billion dollars, while its market cap stands at 110 billion dollars. Some analysts believe the valuation gap will eventually narrow, with MSTR’s stock price aligning more closely to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Meanwhile, Strategy’s soaring losses have added pressure. In its most recent quarterly report, operating expenses jumped to 6 billion dollars, while the net loss widened to 4.1 billion dollars. Revenue fell 3.6 percent year-over-year to 111 million dollars, missing analyst expectations. Investor skepticism has also been fueled by short-sellers. Jim Chanos, a well-known short-seller, revealed a short position in MSTR, alleging that the company is artificially inflating its stock price. Andrew Left of Citron Research issued a similar warning last year, claiming the company operates like a pyramid scheme. MSTR stock price analysis Strategy stock chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that Strategy stock has been trading sideways in recent days, although it remains above the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages, which is typically viewed as a bullish signal. The price has formed a bullish pennant pattern, made up of a flagpole and a converging triangle. Before this, it developed a double-bottom formation with support at 237 dollars and a neckline at 343 dollars. Given the improving sentiment in the crypto sector, a breakout to the all-time high of 542 dollars remains a possibility. That move would represent a potential upside of 33 percent from current levels.

The products will be offered through Backed, a new Kraken partner, according to a statement shared with Cointelegraph. Tokens representing the stocks will be stored on the Solana blockchain due to its “unmatched performance, low latency and thriving global ecosystem,” the statement said. “The whole point of crypto is that we're able to see things very transparently,” Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said during Solana's Accelerate event on May 22. ”It's decentralized. It is open-source. You can innovate as quickly as possible, and there's no reason why companies like us can't morph to do that."" The decision to incorporate more traditional investment options may indicate a shift by Kraken to compete less with crypto-native exchanges like Coinbase and more with larger brokerages like Robinhood, which provide a wide range of investment options.

Source: Cointelegraph On April 14, Kraken opened access to exchange-traded funds and stock trading to US clients based in New Jersey, Connecticut, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Idaho, Iowa, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Alabama and the District of Columbia. In 2021, cryptocurrency exchange Binance launched a similar initiative but ultimately canceled it due to issues with regulatory agencies in various countries worldwide. According to Sethi, Kraken is building “a set of microservices"" to scale out its products to customers.

Tokenized private credit and US Treasurys are dominant assets in the market, while stocks account only for $373.4 million. Robinhood is also moving to offer tokenized stocks. According to a recent announcement, the brokerage is working on a blockchain for tokenized securities that will offer European investors exposure to US-listed companies. RWA tokenization is gaining traction among brokerages, exchanges, and firms due to several key advantages. It reduces upfront costs by minimizing reliance on traditional financial infrastructure. Additionally, tokenization helps democratize access to investment opportunities, enabling retail investors to participate in markets that were previously limited to accredited investors.

When the world’s reserve currency faces challenges, investors across all asset classes pay attention. Bank of America (BofA) recently issued a notable warning, highlighting significant US dollar headwinds stemming from two key areas: US fiscal policy and evolving international currency accords. Understanding US Dollar Headwinds What exactly does it mean for a currency to face ‘headwinds’? In simple terms, it refers to factors or forces that are likely to impede its strength or cause it to depreciate against other currencies. BofA’s analysis suggests that structural issues within the US economy and shifts in the global financial landscape are creating persistent pressures against the dollar. These headwinds aren’t just short-term fluctuations. According to BofA, they represent more fundamental shifts that could influence the dollar’s trajectory over the medium to long term. This perspective is crucial for anyone involved in the forex market analysis or making international investment decisions. Fiscal Policy Impact on the US Dollar One of the primary drivers of the projected US dollar headwinds , according to BofA, is the current state and trajectory of US fiscal policy. Fiscal policy involves the government’s decisions about spending and taxation. When a government spends more than it takes in through taxes, it runs a budget deficit, which adds to the national debt. BofA points to several aspects of US fiscal policy contributing to dollar weakness: Large and Growing Deficits: Persistent large budget deficits can raise concerns about the government’s ability to manage its finances. This can erode confidence in the currency. Rising National Debt: As deficits accumulate, the national debt grows. A high and increasing debt level can be seen as a long-term liability, potentially leading to inflationary pressures if the central bank were ever pressured to monetize the debt. Inflationary Risks: While the link is complex, significant government spending, especially when not matched by production increases, can contribute to inflationary pressures. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of a currency, making it less attractive. The market’s perception of fiscal responsibility (or lack thereof) directly influences investor confidence in the dollar. If investors believe that deficits are unsustainable or will lead to inflation, they may seek safer or higher-yielding assets elsewhere, putting downward pressure on the dollar. The Role of Currency Accords and Global Shifts Beyond domestic fiscal issues, BofA also highlights the impact of evolving international dynamics, specifically mentioning currency agreements or accords. This refers to various ways countries are interacting regarding currency use and trade settlements. Several trends fall under this umbrella: Bilateral Currency Swaps: More countries are entering into agreements to trade directly in their own currencies, bypassing the need to use the US dollar as an intermediary. Dedollarization Efforts: Some nations and blocs are actively seeking to reduce their reliance on the US dollar for trade, reserves, and investments, often motivated by geopolitical factors or a desire for greater financial autonomy. Rise of Alternative Payment Systems: The development of non-dollar-based international payment systems offers alternatives to traditional dollar-centric mechanisms. Increased Use of Other Currencies: While the dollar remains dominant, there’s a gradual, albeit slow, increase in the use of other major currencies (like the Euro or Chinese Yuan) in international transactions and reserves. These shifts, collectively, represent a gradual erosion of the dollar’s unchallenged dominance in global finance. While it’s unlikely to be dethroned overnight, the increasing willingness and ability of countries to operate outside the dollar system create structural US dollar headwinds over time. BofA Forecast and Forex Market Analysis Putting these factors together, BofA’s outlook, or BofA forecast , suggests a less favorable environment for the US dollar compared to recent years. Their analysis likely incorporates how these fiscal and international dynamics interact with other factors like interest rate differentials, economic growth prospects, and geopolitical risks. For participants in the forex market analysis , BofA’s view implies that simply relying on traditional drivers like interest rate hikes might not be sufficient to guarantee dollar strength. The structural issues highlighted by BofA could act as persistent drags. A detailed BofA forecast would likely include specific price targets or ranges for major currency pairs (like EUR/USD, USD/JPY, etc.) based on their assessment of these headwinds. While specific numbers can change, the underlying message is a cautionary one for dollar bulls. Navigating Potential Challenges If BofA’s assessment of US dollar headwinds proves accurate, what are the potential implications and challenges? Inflation Concerns: Persistent deficits and potential debt issues could fuel long-term inflation expectations. Higher Borrowing Costs: If confidence in US debt wanes, the government might have to pay higher interest rates to borrow money. Shift in Global Power Dynamics: A weaker dollar could reflect and contribute to shifts in global economic and political influence. Impact on Asset Prices: A weaker dollar can make US exports cheaper but imports more expensive. It can also influence the flow of international capital and the relative attractiveness of different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, which sometimes react inversely to dollar strength. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the potential US dollar headwinds flagged by BofA, what steps might investors consider? It’s important to remember that this is one bank’s view, and market outcomes are never certain. However, incorporating this perspective into your investment thinking can be valuable. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio isn’t overly exposed to US dollar-denominated assets if you are concerned about its potential depreciation. Monitor Fiscal Policy: Keep an eye on US government spending, taxation, and debt levels. Changes in policy or market reaction to policy can be significant drivers. Watch Global Currency Trends: Pay attention to developments in international currency accords, the rise of alternative payment systems, and the use of other currencies in trade and reserves. Consider Forex Exposure: If you have international investments or expenses, understand your exposure to currency fluctuations and consider hedging strategies if appropriate. Assess Crypto’s Role: While crypto’s relationship with the dollar is complex, some view assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional currency weakness or inflation, though this is a debated topic with significant risks. Conducting thorough forex market analysis and understanding the factors influencing major currencies like the dollar is vital for informed decision-making in the current global economic climate. Conclusion: BofA’s Cautionary Note Bank of America’s warning about US dollar headwinds from fiscal policy and currency accords serves as a crucial reminder that the dollar’s status is not immutable. While it remains the world’s dominant currency, structural domestic issues and evolving international dynamics are creating challenges. The BofA forecast suggests these factors warrant careful consideration by anyone with exposure to the dollar or the global financial markets. Staying informed about these macro trends is essential for navigating the complexities of the forex market analysis and making sound investment choices in an increasingly interconnected world.

The tokenized stocks will allow non-U.S. customers to trade American stocks on the Solana blockchain. Kraken is now joining the league of major industry players exploring ways to digitize traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. BlackRock and Robinhood have shown interest in tokenizing securities. Others like JPMorgan and Franklin Templeton are also already testing tokenized assets in pilot programs. Kraken plans to launch xStocks Kraken, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, has announced plans to launch tokenized versions of over 50 popular U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for its non-U.S. customers. The offer will not be available to U.S.-based users due to regulatory restrictions. The offer allows investors outside of the U.S. to buy and trade tokenized shares of companies like Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia. It also gives them access to ETFs such as the SPDR S&P 500 and SPDR Gold Shares. The tokens called “xStocks” will enable customers in regions such as Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia to trade these tokenized assets 24/7, even when traditional markets are closed. This development is set to roll out in the coming weeks. Kraken’s xStocks tokens will be issued on the Solana blockchain and each xStock will represent a tokenized version of a real-world stock or ETF. The tokens will be backed by shares of the underlying security with Kraken’s partner company, Backed Finance. Customers will be able to redeem the tokens for the cash value of the underlying stock or ETF. Kraken suggests this model could significantly lower the cost and complexity for international investors seeking exposure to U.S. equities. “There’s a lot of friction,” Kraken’s co-CEO, Arjun Sethi said, stating that tokenization could ease the process of investing across borders. The company hopes that xStocks will eventually be traded on other crypto exchanges, transferred to personal digital wallets, and even used as collateral for crypto-based lending or trading strategies. Tokenized securities are the new wave In 2021, before Kraken attempted to bring sticks to the blockchain, Binance launched a similar initiative with tokenized versions of U.S. stocks like Tesla. However, the offering was quickly made unavailable after the company experienced significant regulatory pressure. Kraken appears to be taking a more cautious and compliant approach. A spokesperson for the company said that the company is “actively working with various regulators” to ensure the xStocks are offered legally in each region. Firms like BlackRock and Robinhood Markets have also expressed interest in exploring tokenization, and have cited benefits such as improved settlement speeds, reduced costs, and enhanced transparency as reasons for their interest. The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) recently hosted a roundtable to explore the implications of tokenizing traditional securities. Advocates of tokenization argue that it could transform how assets are traded, settled, and stored by eliminating intermediaries and enabling real-time, round-the-clock trading. For investors in regions with limited access to U.S. financial markets, Kraken’s xStocks could offer an opportunity for them to participate in high-profile American companies.

Around-the-clock trading may challenge legacy exchanges to revisit fixed-hour models and operational dependencies. Institutional engagement with tokenized assets is likely to grow as platforms demonstrate viability through real-time integration of trading, custody, and redemption. Kraken will launch tokenized versions of over 50 U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for non-U.S. users, according to a Wall Street Journal report published on May 22. The rollout will start with offerings including Apple , Tesla, and Nvidia, and will target investors in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia in the coming weeks. https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1925578761212150007 Tokenized Equities Set to Trade 24/7 Backed by Real Shares The digital assets, branded as “xStocks,” will be issued on the Solana blockchain and backed by underlying shares held by Backed Finance. Each token will be redeemable for the cash value of the corresponding security, a structure intended to maintain price alignment with traditional markets. The service includes shares of major companies like Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, and ETFs such as SPY and GLD. Kraken said the tokens will trade around the clock, including outside U.S. market hours. “There’s a lot of friction,” Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said. “It typically involves very high fees and slow settlement times.” Kraken customers will be able to hold and transfer xStocks like other digital assets. The company said future functionality may include wallet transfers or use as collateral. The product will not be available to U.S.-based users. Kraken stated that it is engaging with regulators in jurisdictions where the tokens will be offered. The announcement comes amid broader interest in tokenized securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently held a roundtable on the topic, while firms such as BlackRock and Robinhood have introduced related proposals. Kraken Reports $472 Million Q1 Revenue Kraken reported $472 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2025, according to its latest financial update. Adjusted EBITDA reached $187 million, a 1% increase from the same period last year despite a 7% dip in revenue compared to Q4 2024. The company cited a 29% year-over-year increase in trading volume and a 26% rise in funded accounts. While trading activity slowed following a strong Q4, the exchange said its user retention remained stable, supported by new tools and onboarding processes introduced in recent months. The introduction of tokenized equities shows a broader trend to bypass traditional brokerage systems and extend market access through blockchain infrastructure. Around-the-clock trading and instant settlement challenge long-established norms in how stocks are bought and held. This shift also tests regulatory assumptions. While platforms begin merging digital assets with traditional instruments, questions around custody, settlement, and oversight will become harder to separate from broader market structure debates already underway. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might tokenized equities reshape collateral practices in crypto lending? If widely adopted, tokenized stocks could serve as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, allowing borrowers to access liquidity without selling core equity positions. Could tokenized stocks influence cross-border tax reporting or compliance standards? The portability of tokenized assets across wallets and jurisdictions may challenge existing tax frameworks, pushing regulators to reassess reporting obligations for synthetic exposure to foreign equities. How do settlement rights differ between token holders and traditional shareholders? Token holders typically lack voting rights or direct legal claims on corporate actions, raising questions about their standing in cases of shareholder litigation or dividend distribution.

Following a significant exploit affecting a key platform, the spotlight turned to how the ecosystem would respond. Amidst this uncertainty, a notable voice from the crypto space offered a message of solidarity: Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance , expressed his support for Sui . Understanding the Situation: The Cetus Protocol Incident The core of the recent turmoil on the Sui network stems from a major security breach. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are vital components of any blockchain ecosystem, allowing users to trade assets directly without intermediaries. Cetus Protocol was one such prominent DEX operating on Sui . Unfortunately, Cetus Protocol became the target of a sophisticated crypto hack . While details surrounding the exploit mechanism are still being fully analyzed by security experts, the outcome was clear and damaging: significant user funds were compromised. Reports indicate that the losses exceeded $150 million, a substantial figure that sent ripples through the Sui ecosystem and the broader DeFi community. The immediate aftermath saw a predictable reaction in the market. The native token of the protocol, CETUS, experienced a sharp decline. According to market data, the CETUS token price dropped significantly, reflecting investor concern and panic selling following the exploit. CZ’s Message: A Beacon of Support for Sui In times of crisis, words of encouragement from influential figures can carry weight. Changpeng Zhao, or CZ as he is widely known, remains a highly respected and followed personality in the cryptocurrency world, largely due to his role in building Binance into the world’s largest crypto exchange. Taking to social media platform X (formerly Twitter), CZ publicly addressed the situation surrounding Sui and the Cetus Protocol hack. His message was concise but impactful: “We are doing what we can to help SUI . Not a pleasant situation. Hope everyone stay SAFU!” The term “SAFU” is a popular acronym within the crypto community, popularized by Binance , standing for “Secure Asset Fund for Users.” It refers to an emergency insurance fund used by exchanges to cover user losses in the event of security breaches. CZ ‘s use of this term, coupled with his direct statement about helping Sui , suggests potential involvement or assistance from Binance or individuals associated with Binance in dealing with the aftermath of the hack. Why CZ’s Support for Sui Matters CZ ‘s public backing holds significance for several reasons: Credibility and Influence: As the former head of the world’s largest crypto exchange, CZ ‘s words carry immense weight and reach. His support can help bolster confidence in Sui during a difficult period. Potential Assistance: The phrase “doing what we can to help” hints at possible technical, security, or even financial assistance being offered, perhaps through connections within the Binance ecosystem or security experts known to CZ . Market Sentiment: A positive statement from a figure like CZ can help counter negative market sentiment that often follows a major crypto hack , potentially mitigating further panic sell-offs of Sui -related assets. Community Morale: For the developers, users, and investors within the Sui ecosystem, a message of support from outside can provide much-needed morale and a sense that the community is not alone in facing this challenge. Challenges Facing Sui and the Road Ahead While CZ ‘s support is a positive development, the Sui network and its ecosystem partners like Cetus Protocol still face considerable challenges: Restoring User Trust: The primary challenge is regaining the trust of users who lost funds or were affected by the hack. This requires transparent communication, clear plans for restitution (if possible), and enhanced security measures. Ecosystem Reputation: A major crypto hack on a prominent protocol can cast a shadow over the entire network. Sui needs to demonstrate the overall resilience and security of its underlying technology and encourage best practices among its dApp developers. Technical Remediation: Identifying the vulnerability exploited in the Cetus Protocol hack and ensuring similar flaws don’t exist elsewhere on the network or in other protocols is critical. Market Recovery: The price of the CETUS token and potentially other Sui ecosystem tokens may take time to recover as confidence returns. Addressing these challenges will require a concerted effort from the Sui Foundation, project teams like Cetus Protocol , security auditors, and the community. The support from figures like CZ and potentially entities like Binance could play a role in providing resources or expertise to navigate this complex situation. Actionable Insights for Sui Users and Investors For those involved with the Sui ecosystem or considering becoming involved, the Cetus Protocol hack and CZ ‘s response offer several takeaways: Stay Informed: Follow official communication channels from Sui , Cetus Protocol , and reliable crypto news sources to get accurate updates on the hack investigation and recovery efforts. Evaluate Risk: Understand that DeFi carries inherent risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities and potential hacks. Diversify your holdings and only invest what you can afford to lose. Security First: Practice strong personal security habits, such as using hardware wallets and being cautious of phishing attempts. Assess Project Response: Observe how Cetus Protocol and the Sui ecosystem handle this crisis. Their transparency and efforts to mitigate the damage are indicators of their long-term viability. The incident serves as a stark reminder that even promising networks and protocols are not immune to security threats. The response from the community and key figures like CZ will be crucial in determining how Sui navigates this difficult period and continues its development. Conclusion: Navigating Turbulence with Support The Cetus Protocol hack represents a significant setback for the Sui network, highlighting the persistent security challenges within the DeFi space. The loss of over $150 million and the resulting impact on market sentiment underscore the severity of the situation. However, the public expression of support from a figure as influential as CZ offers a glimmer of hope and suggests that the ecosystem is not facing this challenge alone. While the road to full recovery and rebuilding trust will be long, the collective efforts of the Sui community, developers, and potentially external supporters like CZ will be key to overcoming this obstacle and strengthening the network’s resilience against future threats. The focus now shifts to transparent investigation, enhanced security, and demonstrating the long-term potential of Sui despite this turbulent event.

Psy (formerly QED Protocol) has developed a trustless bridge connecting Dogecoin to the Solana blockchain. This innovation brings proof-of-work security to Solana while making Dogecoin, the world's largest memecoin, available to Solana's ecosystem of dapps. This innovation allows Solana and Dogecoin to directly 'speak' to each other, with each blockchain able to independently verify the other's transactions and consensus without requiring trust in third parties. The bridge not only enhances security but also creates substantial ecosystem opportunities. Bringing Dogecoin's $36B+ market cap and massive community to Solana opens new possibilities for both networks. Dogecoin users gain access to Solana's DeFi, NFT, and gaming applications, while Solana developers can tap into Dogecoin's extensive user base. Unlike traditional bridges, which often rely on multisig signers or custodians, Psy's next-generation proof-of-work technology validates Dogecoin Proof of Work consensus directly on Solana. This trust-minimized approach helps address a major weakness in crypto infrastructure: bridge hacks, which have caused more than $2.8 billion in losses to date. This positions Psy as the leading proof-of-work innovator for Solana, bridging the security benefits of proof-of-work with Solana’s speed and programmability. This integration demonstrates that new proof-of-work chains, like Psy’s, can interact with high-performance blockchains without sacrificing security or requiring centralized intermediaries. This bridge continues Psy Protocol’s mission to empower developers to build hyper-scalable web3 applications to host the next generation of the decentralized internet. The bridge supports standard Dogecoin wallets and exchange deposits. Quotes “We have been working hard to find ways to better serve the Doge community, and now we get the chance to offer them even greater utility for their Dogecoin,” Carter Feldman, CEO of Psy Protocol, said. “This demonstrates the promise of combining best-in-class security with user demand and an established developer base.” “We’re thrilled to announce the DOGE bridge to Solana, a big step in welcoming one of crypto’s most iconic communities to the Solana ecosystem,” said Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation. “DOGE, Bitcoin’s beloved pet, embodies the fun, irreverent spirit that drives on-chain culture. By bridging DOGE into Solana’s network, we’re inviting the Dogecoin community—and all OG crypto enthusiasts—to join us in marrying on-chain culture and decentralized finance.” ""Trustless verification has always been the holy grail of interoperability, but achieving it at scale has remained elusive,” said Robinson Burkey, co-founder of Wormhole. “Seeing Psy and Wormhole come together to build this around an asset like DOGE captures the true cyberpunk spirit of crypto. We’re excited to help bring a $36B asset to Solana—soon to be powered by Wormhole."" How the Bridge Works The bridge captures and verifies each Dogecoin block header on Solana. Block headers contain essential blockchain data, including the previous block hash, timestamp, difficulty target, the Merkle root of all transactions in the block, and the Proof of Work consensus algorithm. By verifying these headers directly on Solana, the system cryptographically confirms the validity of Dogecoin transactions without intermediaries. When users send DOGE to the bridge, the system verifies the deposit on the Dogecoin blockchain and mints an equivalent amount of QDOGE tokens on Solana. To convert back, QDOGE tokens are burned on Solana, with withdrawal messages securely transmitted through Wormhole’s cross-chain messaging protocol, triggering the release of the original DOGE to the user's Dogecoin address. To enable this bridge, Psy has created a suite of infrastructure for developers: txindex: a fully-featured indexer for Dogecoin with effortless handling of forking behavior electrs-doge: the first open-source block explorer for Dogecoin doge-sdk: the first JavaScript SDK for Dogecoin forkr: an easy-to-use tool for simulating forks/re-orgs on Bitcoin and Dogecoin. About Psy Protocol Psy is the leading innovator in next-generation proof-of-work technology, on a mission to restore the security and decentralization principles of blockchain while enabling modern scalability. Psy is bridging the utility gap between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake chains, empowering developers to build hyper-scalable web3 applications, to provide a credible alternative to a centralized internet controlled by a handful of tech monopolies.

IRAs offer tax advantages and a range of investment options, including stocks, real estate, commodities and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies. But when it comes to crypto, there’s usually only one investment strategy available: to buy and hold. It’s a strategy that might work well for assets like the S&P 500, which have long track records of steadily appreciating over longer time frames, but bitcoin is still an extremely volatile asset and other coins even more so. The idea behind BlockTrust IRA, then, is simple: to manage the crypto positions of its customers in order to take advantage of that volatility and maximize their returns. “We're the only company that has an AI tool meshed with traders that put people automatically in cash [when need be]. Then we wait for the right signals, and we buy back in,” Jonathan Rose, the firm’s CEO, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Where people are scared of volatility and scared of risk, we actually want the volatility and the risk associated with that, because that's how we actually make our clients money,” Rose said. “We are right a lot more than we are wrong, and that's how we're able to beat the benchmark.” BlockTrust’s secret sauce? Animus Technologies, a fund that provides intelligent asset management solutions for crypto. Animus has servers around the world and quantifies humongous amounts of data — to the point that a European government body has reached out to inquire what exactly they’re quantifying data for, according to Rose. Animus typically only shares its signals with high net-worth individuals and fund clients, Rose said. In other words, crypto retail participants may now benefit, through their BlockTrust accounts, from the kind of trading mechanisms that previously were only available to quant funds. The sophisticated strategies are currently only available for bitcoin BTC and ether ETH, but BlockTrust offers exposure to 60 different cryptocurrencies, Rose said. Users of the platform can invest as little as $1,000 for non-managed accounts, or $25,000 if they want a managed account — and trading fees can go as low as 0.4% for the former and 0.14% for the latter. BlockTrust IRA went live officially in February. In March, the firm had accrued $10 million in assets, and Rose expects it to bring in roughly $100 million before the end of the year. The company’s early success may also be due to the fact that it’s not just open to U.S. residents, but to people all around the world, as long as they can pass its Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks. Americans do have the added advantage of being able to use their tax-deferred retirement savings to gain exposure. Crypto markets are ever changing, and trading strategies that function perfectly for a long time may suddenly become outdated due to shifts in the economic environment or crypto-intrinsic changes — potentially threatening to render Animus’ approach obsolete someday. But Rose isn’t concerned. “When [the people at] Animus Technologies go to these hedge fund conferences and speak, they always come back with a big grin on their faces, because they're like, ‘We are so light-years ahead of anyone remotely doing what we're doing,’” Rose said. “It's going to take like four to six years for people to even kind of catch up to us.”",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Bitcoin IRA|Exclusive|News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-22 19:16:33

Congressmen Fight for Crypto Clarity According to a May 22 press release from the U.S. lawmakers, the proposed legislation would clarify that non-custody digital asset providers are not classified as money transmitters. The bill would purportedly empower wallet providers, miners, and validators while preventing key players in the crypto sector from going offshore. Emmer, who originally introduced the BRCA back in 2018 , claims the legislation would provide regulatory clarity without compromising necessary government oversight. “If you don’t custody consumer funds, you aren’t a money transmitter. Plain and simple,” Congressman Emmer said. “The longer we delay this commonsense clarification, the greater the risk that this transformative technology is pushed overseas, harming American investors and innovators.” “The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act reflects a thoughtful, bipartisan effort to get digital asset policy right,” said Representative Torres. “The United States should be the global home for responsible innovation, not a place where developers are punished for building open-source software or experimenting with new technologies,” he added. Crypto Policy Leaders Push for Progress Several prominent leaders in the crypto policy space have also lent their support to the BRCA, including Blockchain Association Interim CEO Sarah Milby, The Digital Chamber CEO Cody Carbone, and Ji Hun Kim, president and CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation. “Blockchain developers, miners, and validators aren’t financial institutions—they’re builders,” said Carbone. “The bipartisan Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act will finally give them the freedom to build in the United States by clarifying that those who never hold customer assets don’t need bank-style licenses.” “We urge swift passage and commend Majority Whip Emmer and Representative Ritchie Torres for championing this effort,” he added. “Congress should act now on the BRCA.” The post Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Returns to Exempt Wallets, Miners From Money-Transmitter Rules appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Crypto Regulation News|News|Regulation|Transmitter License|U.S. Congress,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-22 19:17:27

The bridge supports standard Dogecoin wallets and exchange deposits. Quotes “We have been working hard to find ways to better serve the Doge community, and now we get the chance to offer them even greater utility for their Dogecoin,” Carter Feldman, CEO of Psy Protocol, said. “This demonstrates the promise of combining best-in-class security with user demand and an established developer base.” “We’re thrilled to announce the DOGE bridge to Solana, a big step in welcoming one of crypto’s most iconic communities to the Solana ecosystem,” said Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation. “DOGE, Bitcoin’s beloved pet, embodies the fun, irreverent spirit that drives on-chain culture. By bridging DOGE into Solana’s network, we’re inviting the Dogecoin community—and all OG crypto enthusiasts—to join us in marrying on-chain culture and decentralized finance.” “Trustless verification has always been the holy grail of interoperability, but achieving it at scale has remained elusive,” said Robinson Burkey, co-founder of Wormhole. “Seeing Psy and Wormhole come together to build this around an asset like DOGE captures the true cyberpunk spirit of crypto. We’re excited to help bring a $36B asset to Solana—soon to be powered by Wormhole.” How the Bridge Works The bridge captures and verifies each Dogecoin block header on Solana. Block headers contain essential blockchain data, including the previous block hash, timestamp, difficulty target, the Merkle root of all transactions in the block, and the Proof of Work consensus algorithm. By verifying these headers directly on Solana, the system cryptographically confirms the validity of Dogecoin transactions without intermediaries. When users send DOGE to the bridge, the system verifies the deposit on the Dogecoin blockchain and mints an equivalent amount of QDOGE tokens on Solana. To convert back, QDOGE tokens are burned on Solana, with withdrawal messages securely transmitted through Wormhole’s cross-chain messaging protocol, triggering the release of the original DOGE to the user’s Dogecoin address. To enable this bridge, Psy has created a suite of infrastructure for developers: txindex: a fully-featured indexer for Dogecoin with effortless handling of forking behavior electrs-doge: the first open-source block explorer for Dogecoin doge-sdk: the first JavaScript SDK for Dogecoin forkr: an easy-to-use tool for simulating forks/re-orgs on Bitcoin and Dogecoin. About Psy Protocol Psy is the leading innovator in next-generation proof-of-work technology, on a mission to restore the security and decentralization principles of blockchain while enabling modern scalability. Psy is bridging the utility gap between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake chains, empowering developers to build hyper-scalable web3 applications, to provide a credible alternative to a centralized internet controlled by a handful of tech monopolies.

Wall Street experts, led by Standard Chartered analysts, expect Bitcoin price to rally beyond $200k by EOY.

Earlier this week, Strategy announced that it had acquired an additional 7,390 BTC to currently hold about 576,230 Bitcoins, which is about 2.74 percent of the assets maximum supply. The company’s Bitcoin strategy has significantly influenced other global companies, led by MetaPlanet , to adopt a similar strategy.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) rally to its all-time high of $111,970 was likely fueled by leverage. On Thursday, May 22, open interest on Bitcoin futures across crypto exchanges reached $80.91 billion , the highest level ever recorded. Exchange BTC futures open interest | Source: CoinGlass On Binance, the largest exchange by volume of derivative contracts, open interest climbed to $13.60 billion. This is the highest level the metric has reached since December 2024. At the same time, the rally contributed to a spike in liquidations , wiping out a total of $246 million in long and short positions across major crypto assets. You might also like: Strategy stock continues to stall despite Bitcoin’s surge to record high The increase in open interest closely tracked Bitcoin’s price, which rose 8.46% since the start of the week. During that same period, open interest increased by 23%, a significantly higher rate than Bitcoin’s price. This suggests that the rally is being driven by leverage rather than retail interest. Institutions and retail are driving Bitcoin’s growth Adding to this narrative is the fact has not seen a significant spike in search interest for Bitcoin. Google Trends reveals a significant decline in search interest for the keyword Bitcoin since November. Specifically, Bitcoin search volume score was at 22, compared to 100 in May 2021, when BTC lost 50% of its value in a matter of weeks. Even during the November rally, Bitcoin’s search volume score peaked at just 64. This suggests that despite Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. elections, retail investors are not as engaged as they were during the 2021 crash. The most likely explanation is that institutional investors are increasingly betting on Bitcoin. Notably, Trump’s election win and subsequent pro-crypto stance have helped legitimize Bitcoin among institutional players—credibility it previously lacked. Read more: Missed the $10k to $100k ride?

SMQKE’s claims are informed by a recent academic paper titled “SHAQ, Ripple, and the Future of Crypto Regulation”, authored by James C. Spindler, a well-known U.S. legal scholar, and published under the William & Mary Law School. Legal Ruling Could Guide Financial Institutions According to SMQKE , a complete legal win for Ripple could establish a regulatory framework that enables financial entities, such as banks and investment managers, to integrate core operations into blockchain environments. This Is What the Conclusion of the Ripple v. SEC Case Will Bring Soon A full Ripple win will unlock the next phase of financial infrastructure. It will give banks, funds, and companies a working model for moving core financial functions onto blockchain networks. The… https://t.co/jRbP5wlV5G pic.twitter.com/w4maytPcgq — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 19, 2025 The researcher pointed to U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres’s prior ruling , which held that some of Ripple’s transactions, particularly programmatic sales and distributions of XRP, did not breach federal securities laws. However, Spindler and other legal analysts have maintained that the company’s earlier token allocations resembled transactions tied to future corporate value. SMQKE contends that a court-approved outcome in Ripple’s favor would reinforce this interpretation and could serve as a strategic model for companies looking to raise capital or facilitate transactions via blockchain without navigating excessive regulatory burdens. Laying the Foundation for Blockchain-Based Finance The implications of such a legal outcome extend beyond Ripple. SMQKE emphasized that a clear judicial endorsement could pave the way for widespread adoption of blockchain technology across key financial activities, including settlements, custody, payments, and asset trading. By following a court-sanctioned structure, financial organizations would have the legal clarity to tokenize assets, automate services through smart contracts, and interface blockchain networks with conventional financial platforms. The potential to streamline these processes could make blockchain integration far more accessible for traditional institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If the ruling validates Ripple’s strategy, SMQKE believes it could encourage a broader wave of innovation in the financial sector. Companies may be more inclined to develop digital asset offerings, implement blockchain-based payment systems, and adopt custody solutions, all within an established legal framework. Ongoing Legal Developments Although Ripple and the SEC have agreed to settle the longstanding lawsuit , progress has been delayed. Their recent request for an indicative ruling on the proposed settlement was denied by Judge Torres, citing procedural issues. The proposed agreement involves Ripple paying a reduced penalty of $50 million for past institutional XRP sales, replacing a prior $125 million directive. Additionally, the parties have mutually agreed to drop the previously imposed permanent injunction on Ripple’s future institutional sales. Despite the court’s rejection of the current motion, both Ripple and the SEC are expected to resubmit a revised request. A timeline for when the court will consider the amended motion has not yet been confirmed. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This decision was made after the initiative received strong criticism from both communities involved. Public Backlash The proposed acquisition, first announced in a May 14 blog post , involved a token exchange at a rate of 1 SNX to 27 DRV. The plan was designed to combine Synthetix’s established market presence and on-chain expertise with Derive’s off-chain matching engine to build a leading decentralized derivatives platform. However, the deal was subject to approval from both platforms’ communities, support that failed to materialize. “Synthetix has withdrawn SIP-415, the proposal to acquire Derive after reviewing community and stakeholder feedback,” said the protocol in an update. According to the team, the feedback revealed dissatisfaction with the token exchange terms and Derive’s valuation. On the crypto options platform’s public forum, one user named “Ramjo” said the token exchange rate “poorly reflects the value of Derive,” calling it the “equivalent of selling the bottom.” Another community member, “AlvaroHK,” described the deal as a “terrible proposal” that wouldn’t benefit it at all. They pointed out that Derive earns more revenue than Synthetix and warned about possible risks linked to the latter. This includes the recent depegging of its stablecoin sUSD, which fell to $0.68 in April, and its potential impact on the protocol’s treasury and token supply. In a follow-up, the user questioned why there was no mention of what would stop Synthetix from continuing to print more tokens, revealing that they found guidance showing plans to raise the SNX supply from 330 million to 500 million. They argued that this undisclosed detail would dilute the Derive offer by another 60%. Battle for Dominance Derive started as part of Synthetix in 2021 under the name Lyra, but later rebranded and moved to operate independently. This included shifting away from using the sUSD stablecoin and liquidity. If the re-acquisition had gone through, the company would have been issued with up to 29.3 million SNX tokens, with a lock-up period of three months followed by nine months of gradual release. However, with the token trading nearly 97% below its all-time high of $28.53 recorded in February 2021, the dilution risk and reduced value likely contributed to community hesitation. Despite ending the proposal, Synthetix said it will continue to look for strategic opportunities to achieve its goal of building a top decentralized derivatives platform on the Ethereum mainnet. This comes at a time of growing competition in the crypto derivatives space, with platforms like Binance, dYdX, and Hyperliquid all competing for dominance. Coinbase also recently announced a $2.9 billion deal to acquire Deribit, the largest digital asset options exchange.

33767162,[object Object],1747942252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"SEC Pushes Back Decision On XRP ETFs Again, What’s Going On?",https://bitcoinist.com/sec-decision-on-xrp-etfs/,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again delayed its decision on the XRP ETFs , raising discussions on when the Commission could approve these funds. Market expert and Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has provided insights into when exactly an approval could come for these crypto ETFs. SEC Pushes Back Decision On XRP ETFs A SEC release shows that the agency has delayed its decision on CBOE’s filing to list and trade shares of 21Shares XRP ETF. Likewise, the Commission pushed back on its decision to approve the request to list and trade shares of Grayscale’s XRP ETF . This decision came as the second deadline for a decision approached. The third deadline for the SEC to decide on Grayscale and 21Shares XRP ETFs is August 19 and 20, respectively. Meanwhile, the fourth and final deadline is October 18 and 19. In the meantime, the Commission has called for comments and rebuttals from the general public on why they should either approve or reject these filings. It is also worth mentioning that the second deadlines for the Bitwise and WisdomTree XRP ETFs are May 25 and 27, respectively, and the SEC is expected to delay its decision on those filings. Meanwhile, the second deadline for the Canary and CoinShares ETFs is May 26. A decision on all these filings could be announced together, similar to what the Commission has done for other filings with close dates. The second deadline for Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF is the 17th of next month. In the meantime, a positive is that the CME XRP and Micro XRP futures launched earlier this week. Following their launch, Nate Geraci , the president of the ETF store, declared that the XRP ETFs are just a matter of time, meaning that approval is inevitable. A regulated futures market guarantees that the SEC cannot deny these filings on the grounds of manipulation since the court has ruled that the futures and spot markets are similar. When An Approval Is Likely To Happen In an X post, James Seyffart stated that the SEC will likely not approve the XRP ETFs early until late June or early July. He added that approval seems more likely in the early part of the fourth quarter of this year. This came as he noted that delays on these spot crypto ETFs are to be expected. The Bloomberg analyst further explained that the SEC typically takes the full time to respond to these filings. As such, an early decision would be out of the norm, no matter how crypto-friendly the current SEC administration is. Seyffart and his colleague Eric Balchunas predict that there is an 85% chance that the SEC approves the XRP ETFs this year. Meanwhile, Polymarket data shows an 83% chance of approval in 2025.",XRP|Bitwise|Bloomberg|Canary|CBOE|CME|CoinShares|Eric Balchunas|Franklin Templeton|Grayscale|James Seyffart|Nate Geraci|Spot XRP ETFs|US SEC|Wisdom Tree|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-22 19:30:52

According to the Cetus team, the DEX is working with the Sui Foundation and other entities within the ecosystem to recover the remainder of the funds. The Sui Foundation also confirmed : ""A large number of validators identified the addresses with the stolen funds and are ignoring transactions on those addresses until further notice. The Cetus team is exploring paths to recover those funds and return them to the community."" The Cetus hack is the latest in a string of such incidents impacting crypto and Web3 in the first half of 2025. Cybersecurity continues to be a major issue in crypto, with many industry executives calling for the sector to police itself and establish more robust defenses or risk increased regulatory scrutiny. Source: Cetus Related: Germany seizes $38M in crypto from Bybit hack-linked eXch exchange The Cetus hack: the story so far On May 22, the Cetus DEX was hacked in what is believed to be a smart contract code exploit that saw the DEX drained of approximately $223 million in user funds. According to the team behind the Extractor Web3 security notification tool, $63 million of the stolen funds were bridged to the Ethereum network. The Extractor team also identified a wallet address ending in ""AF16"" used by the threat actors to launder 20,000 Ether ( ETH ), valued at roughly $53 million. The Cetus hackers transfer 20,000 Ether to a new wallet address. Source: Etherscan The recovery efforts and the asset freeze coordinated by different projects, platforms, and validators in the Sui ecosystem drew mixed reactions from the crypto community.

Summer Mersinger, who leaves the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at the end of the month, shared the remarks during an interview with Bloomberg TV on Thursday, May 22. The outgoing CFTC commissioner was responding to a question about perpetual crypto futures and whether they could gain regulatory approval in the U.S. any time soon. “Yeah, absolutely. I think those can come to market now, and we’re seeing some applications. I believe we’ll have some of those products trading live very soon,” she noted. “It would be great to get that trading back onshore in the United States. I think it’s unfortunate that it has been driven offshore for so long.” She added that bringing these products to the U.S. under the country’s regulatory framework would be a “really good thing for the industry.” Mersinger also believes that the approval and launch of crypto perpetual futures for the U.S. market will benefit the broader economy.

While the crypto futures trading market has grown tremendously, accounting for about $3.7 trillion in volume in April, its trading is not yet approved in the U.S. Mersinger expressed confidence that the CFTC will continue to operate as the independent agency it is meant to be, regardless of the political administration in Washington. She emphasized that the key for the commodities watchdog is to provide the oversight needed for derivatives markets to deliver on their legal mandates of price discovery and hedging. She also commented on the stablecoin bill in the Senate, noting that the latest developments around the bill show that “crypto is here to stay.” As noted, Mersinger will step down as a CFTC Commissioner on May 30, having recently agreed to join crypto advocacy group the Blockchain Association as its new chief executive officer.

The number increased from 8,200 to 16,000, indicating increased awareness and compliance with tax rules for digital assets. Finland Reports Shows Rising Engagement in Crypto Tax Market However, this increase still represents only a small part of Finland’s estimated 300,000 crypto holders, suggesting that many crypto-related activities are not reported. Notably, the report also revealed that taxpayers reported about 230 million euros in capital gains from cryptocurrency trading last year, and 30 million euros in losses. This is a significant increase from two years ago, when total reported crypto income was below 50 million euros. Despite the progress, the low number of cryptocurrency tax filings indicates a huge gap in compliance. Experts believe this might be because individuals are unsure about crypto tax rules and the decentralized nature of digital assets. Meanwhile, the Finnish tax administration has improved its efforts to reduce tax underreporting in recent years. They have introduced better digital tools , run targeted information campaigns, and worked with other countries to monitor cross-border crypto transactions. Finance Ministry Sets Clearer Rules on Crypto Asset Gains Slovenia’s Ministry of Finance recently proposed imposing a 25% tax on crypto profits and derivatives. As detailed, the proposal focuses on taxing profits from the sale or use of digital assets. This includes cases where crypto is converted into fiat currency, used ot buy goods or services, or transferred to another person. Under the new rule, these are all treated as disposals. The proposed law intends to align Slovenia with international tax practices while keeping the paperwork manageable for taxpayers. Importantly, taxpayers must maintain accurate records of their acquisitions and sales. Authorities may ask to see these records at any time. Furthermore, this simplified approach allows taxpayers to calculate their tax based on 40% of the total value of their crypto assets as of December 31, 2025. South Korea Will Commence Crypto Taxation in 2027 Meanwhile, South Korea is still determining whether introducing crypto taxation at this time is the right step. Although it was initially scheduled to commence in January 2025, the South Korea Democratic Party (KDP) has agreed to postpone introducing a crypto gains tax by another two years. This is the third time South Korea has delayed implementing its digital asset capital gains tax. Ultimately, this reflects the ongoing debates and controversy over the timing and impact of taxing cryptocurrency transactions.

Meanwhile, Cardano 's stability hints at a possible rise. The following analysis will uncover if these cryptocurrencies are about to break previous highs and what factors might be driving their progress. This could be a pivotal moment for both digital assets. Cardano: Monthly Surge, Long-Term Dip, and Key Price Levels Cardano recorded a 26.60% gain over the past month set against a 22.40% drop during the last six months. This performance shows sharp short-term strength countered by longer-term challenges. A recent climb contrasts with broader downward pressure, making its history a blend of rapid gains and significant setbacks. Prices now move between $0.55 and $0.78 with immediate resistance at $0.88 and support at $0.41, and secondary levels at $1.11 and $0.18. A small positive reading on the Awesome Oscillator and near-neutral RSI of 59 hint at balanced forces. Traders might consider watching for breakouts above $0.88 or bounces near $0.41 to explore upward moves. XRP Market Analysis: Steady Gains and New Bullish Signals XRP recorded a 15.85% increase over the past month and an impressive gain of 63.97% over the last six months. Despite a weekly drop of 5.37%, the overall trend remains upward with strong investor interest boosting momentum. This mixed price behavior highlights some short-term volatility, but the longer-term performance reflects positive market sentiment. Prices are currently moving between $1.75 and $2.50, facing resistance at $2.80 and a secondary level at $3.55. Support is established at $1.31 and $0.56. The market shows a near balance between bulls and bears, with a slight bullish tendency indicated by the Awesome Oscillator at 0.0995 and the RSI at 55.74. Traders should consider monitoring these levels for potential breakouts above $2.80. Conclusion XRP and ADA both show promising potential for growth. XRP is gearing up for a significant boost, with strong indications pointing towards a possible increase in value. At the same time, ADA's support levels remain firm, suggesting stability and a favorable environment for future gains. These positive signs indicate that both XRP and ADA could reach new heights in the near future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Led by Rep. Maxine Waters, 15 House Democrats introduced the “Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs in Crypto Act of 2025.” The bill would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, and their immediate families from owning, promoting, or profiting from digital assets while in office. Lawmakers would also be barred from holding crypto assets in ways that allow them to exert unilateral control over the tokens. “Trump’s crypto con is not just a scam to target investors,” Waters said in a statement. “It’s also a dangerous backdoor for selling influence over American policies to the highest foreign bidder.” The legislation arrives amid a wave of criticism surrounding Trump’s deepening ties to crypto. The president and his wife, Melania, recently launched personal memecoins. Trump’s family has also backed a stablecoin through the crypto firm World Liberty Financial, and his sons are linked to a Bitcoin mining venture. Blockchain records indicate that Justin Sun, founder of Tron and a Chinese national, is one of the largest holders of TRUMP ( TRUMP ) — the memecoin that serves as a ticket to Thursday night’s dinner.

Critics, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, accuse Trump of “auctioning” access to the White House and potentially violating the Constitution’s ban on foreign gifts. Protests are happening outside the event. Senators Chris Murphy, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkley, along with Rep. Sam Liccardo and advocacy groups, are calling out Donald Trump’s upcoming “meme coin” fundraising dinner as a threat to national security and a potential corruption risk, according to a note shared with crypto.news. At a press conference today, the group demanded the release of attendee names and any promised favors. Murphy also promoted his recently introduced MEME Act, aimed at curbing digital asset profiteering by public officials.

The same whale also purchased 600 Bitcoin (BTC), paying $56.94 million for the transaction. Just three hours ago, the same whale sold 30,000 ETH at $2,621, making $78.63 million and a net profit of $23.73 million. The remaining 600 BTC are still unsold, currently worth $66.5 million and currently showing a profit of $9.6 million.

The surge spotlights how rock-bottom costs and fresh DeFi buzz are funneling liquidity toward BNB Chain just as the broader market keeps its eyes on Bitcoin. This growth may be due to increased DeFi activity, stablecoin developments, and market speculation, though no single driver has been confirmed. BNB Price Action/ Source: CoinMarketCap BNB Chain Activity Rises as CZ’s Posts Draw Market Attention Since Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stepped down from his role at Binance in late 2024 as part of a legal settlement, his social media activity has occasionally coincided with increased attention on the BNB Chain. While CZ no longer holds an official position at Binance , some market participants have interpreted his posts as influencing trading activity. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1889739142491251152 One instance occurred in February when CZ shared a post mentioning his dog’s name, “Broccoli.” Shortly after, multiple memecoins referencing the name were launched on the BNB Chain, including one called “ CZ’s Dog (BROCCOLI), ” which briefly reached a market capitalization of $300 million. https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1924797381851128014 Since then, liquidity on the BNB Chain has risen, with daily transactions reaching a six-month high of $11.03 million. The chain’s market cap has also crossed the $10 billion mark, just a billion shy of Solana’s and bigger than those of Base, Arbitrum, Sui, and Aptos combined. Source: DeFiLlama Data from DeFiLlama also shows that the BNB Chain is currently the most dominant chain in DEX activities, with its DEX volume averaging $7 billion on a daily basis. Trump-Linked USD1 Stablecoin Adds Fuel to BNB Chain Growth One of the protocols leading the growth of the BNB chain is $USD1, a token deployed by the Trump-affiliated company, World Liberty Financial (WLFI) , which chose the BNB chain as its launchpad. Also, the massive reduction in gas fees has supported increased transactions and active wallet addresses on the BNB chain. On May 8, the BNB chain transaction fee dropped to 0.11 Gwei, less than $0.11 to carry out any transaction on the blockchain. https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1925118515477946717 This is 100 times cheaper than Ethereum gas fees . Now, on most centralized crypto exchanges, the BNB chain has been the preferred network for stablecoin transfers, as most exchanges charge zero fees for transfers on the network. These factors have prompted one crypto chart expert to assert that although $BNB hardly gets the attention it deserves, it should see a price breakout above $800. https://twitter.com/birdseye88/status/1925423111630901251 According to him, $BNB has been in a four-year consolidation and won’t be rewarded with a three-month bull market. He believes the current price rally should extend for a bit longer. Binance Coin Price Prediction: Can $BNB Break $740 or Pull Back? Looking at the $BNB/$USD daily chart, the price is at $673.4, up 1.81%, and has broken above key resistance at $686. The chart shows $BNB completing a corrective pattern from $720 down to $520 lows and now appears to be in recovery mode. The orange Elliott Wave labels suggest this upward move could target the $740 area. Key levels to watch are the major resistance zone at $720-$740 (red box) above and support at $686 (now broken resistance) and $561 (blue box) below. https://twitter.com/ZeusInCrypto/status/1925214287003267172 The breakout above $686 with decent volume suggests genuine buying momentum, but the real test will be whether BNB can push through the $720-$740 resistance zone. A failure there could lead to consolidation, while a break above would likely accelerate the uptrend.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-schwartz-questions-567-million-xrp-purchase-heres-what-happened/,"A recent transaction of 237 million XRP worth approximately $567 million has triggered widespread discussion within the cryptocurrency community. The transfer was first flagged by blockchain tracker Whale Alert and quickly went viral across social media platforms. Initial assumptions suggested that the transfer represented a massive purchase by a high-net-worth individual or entity, often referred to as a “whale.” Given the transaction’s size, market participants anticipated that it would influence XRP’s price. However, the token’s value remained largely unchanged. Community Questions Market Integrity Following the transaction, several users on X questioned why such a large movement failed to affect the asset’s price. One user, DigitalG , described the lack of market reaction as troubling, suggesting that the incident reflected broader concerns about transparency and potential inefficiencies within the XRP market. In response, other community members raised suspicions of manipulation, arguing that the token’s price behavior did not align with the scale of the reported activity. Ripple CTO Clarifies Nature of Transaction David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, addressed the circulating speculation. He clarified that the transaction was almost certainly not a recent purchase but a withdrawal from an exchange. Such transactions typically involve the relocation of already-owned tokens rather than the acquisition of new ones, and therefore, they do not impact current market demand or pricing. Schwartz’s input aimed to distinguish between blockchain transactions and actual trading activity, emphasizing that not every large movement on-chain signifies a change in market sentiment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This event is not unique. Whale Alert has identified multiple high-value XRP transactions throughout the month, many of which have had minimal effect on price action. These instances support the notion that large XRP transfers often represent internal fund movements rather than market-moving trades. The repetition of such events underscores the need for careful interpretation of blockchain data. Without proper context, large transactions can easily be misunderstood as trading activity, potentially leading to unwarranted speculation. Market Reaction Remains Muted At the time of writing, the token is trading at approximately $2.42, based on data from CoinMarketCap. The token has declined by 1.96% in the last week, with no clear correlation to the $237 million transfer. This further reinforces the argument that the transaction did not reflect a recent buy order. The episode serves as a reminder of the importance of distinguishing between token transfers and active trades. While blockchain data is transparent, interpreting it accurately requires an understanding of market mechanisms and transaction types.

That level hasn’t been touched in nearly two decades, and traders on Wall Street are already sweating. This spike followed a combination of two major events: President Donald Trump’s tax bill clearing the House late Thursday and Moody’s downgrade of US credit over rising deficits. That was enough to wipe out over 800 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a 1.9% drop, while the S&P 500 fell more than 1%. The move also disrupted a six-week bounce that had been building since early April. Trump’s tax bill sends Treasury yields soaring Trump’s newly passed tax bill is being blamed for fanning the flames. The 30-year Treasury yield also crossed the 5% line for the second day in a row, with Thursday’s close holding around 5.088%. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield jumped over 15 basis points since Monday. JPMorgan analysts highlighted 11 cases in the past year where the 10-year moved more than 10 basis points in a day. In seven of those, the S&P 500 closed lower, with losses averaging 0.8%. Retail wasn’t spared either. Bank of America cut Target’s stock rating to neutral, following weak Q1 earnings. Analyst Robert Ohmes wrote that even though Target’s valuation is near 10-year lows, the top-line performance is still struggling. “With softer sales driving higher markdowns and thus incremental margin pressure for TGT,” Robert wrote, “the company is now well underperforming peers,” like Walmart. Selloff spreads as global bond markets recoil What started in the US has now spread across the world. A global selloff is ripping through long-term government bonds. Trump’s tax plan and Moody’s downgrade have investors reevaluating fiscal risks—not just in America, but everywhere. Rong Ren Goh, a fixed income portfolio manager at Eastspring Investments, said these kinds of events “tend to bring fiscal concerns front and center of investors’ minds,” causing them to adjust what kind of risk premium they demand to hold longer-dated bonds. In Japan, things are unraveling fast. The 40-year bond yield spiked to a record 3.689% on Thursday. The 30-year is hovering near its own all-time high at 3.187%, and the 10-year yield rose 9 basis points this week to hit 1.57%. Japanese life insurers—who used to be consistent buyers—aren’t purchasing these bonds anymore since they’ve already met their capital requirements. Add to that the Bank of Japan’s push toward tightening policy, and it’s a recipe for more selling. Vishnu Varathan, a managing director at Mizuho Securities, didn’t mince words. He said, “Markets do not find Trump’s ‘big, beautiful tax bill’ beautiful at all… USTs were beaten up in an ugly sell-off.” George Saravelos, the global head of FX strategy at Deutsche Bank, warned that rising Japanese yields make local bonds more attractive, pushing investors to sell off US government debt even faster. That kind of divestment from Treasurys just puts more pressure on the American market. Germany’s bunds are also seeing major damage. 30-year yields jumped more than 12 basis points, and the 10-year climbed over 6 points. Varathan noted that Germany’s own deficit problems are likely structural and adding to the pressure. Across Europe, the selloff is spreading. 30-year bond yields rose more than 12 basis points this week, and the 10-year yields are up around 7 points. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, summed up investor mood: “Investors don’t really have much love for long duration bonds right now.” He said concerns about global inflation are “a killer” for longer bonds, which are more influenced by long-term expectations than short-term central bank decisions. Not all countries are seeing this trend. India and China are showing small declines in yields. India’s 10-year government bond yield dropped about 2 basis points since Monday, while China’s slipped slightly as well. That’s partly because these countries are more inward-focused and have tighter capital controls. But in most major markets, the picture’s clear: investors are losing trust in long-term government debt. And Trump’s tax bill just threw gasoline on the fire.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Kevin Svenson tells his 83,200 YouTube subscribers that the top crypto asset by market cap’s latest upward shift confirms that it’s going to continue climbing until the end of this week, bringing BTC’s price to at least $115,000. “This run could be finishing around the end of May 23rd or May 24th, that may be when we actually get to $115,000, so really just a three-day run just like [previously]. I mean I don’t see a reason why this can’t happen. Usually, when you break the all-time high, there’s a lot of momentum, there’s a lot of excitement, and prices move very quickly. So seeing Bitcoin at 115,000 around May 23rd or May 24th would be no surprise at all now.” However, Svenson cautions traders not to take his prediction as meaning that the flagship digital asset is guaranteed to lose steam at $115,000, as he says it could shoot up to $124,000 by July. “Even though I’m saying that we might stall at $115,000, that does not mean that the run would be over at $115,000. We might just get some chop consolidation and then ultimately run up towards my parabolic trend target of $124,000 – that’s where I think we might actually be by the time that July rolls around.” Bitcoin is trading for $111,322 at time of writing, a 2.1% increase during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin’s breakout failed to usher euphoria among traders and the reaction on derivatives traders was muted, relative to previous BTC price rallies. Ethereum ( ETH ) struggles to attract institutional inflows even as ETH rallies alongside Bitcoin ( BTC ) in its price discovery. Altcoins in the top 50 cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization are in the green, rallying in the last 24 hours. Table of Contents Bitcoin derivatives analysis Ethereum technical and derivatives analysis Crypto trader sentiment and why euphoria is missing How high can Bitcoin go? Expert commentary Bitcoin derivatives analysis Analysts at 10xResearch and Amberdata are in agreement on the fact that spot market strength and not speculation, is driving gains in BTC. Bitcoin’s rally beyond $111,000 failed to kick in a euphoria among traders and the long/short ratio across top derivatives exchanges is above 1. While this indicates that traders are bullish on BTC and expect further gains, on previous instances like the 2017 and 2020 cycles, the ratio exceeded 2. The 24-hour liquidation data shows $175 million in shorts liquidations and over $47 million in long positions were liquidated. Bearish traders are being punished for betting against Bitcoin price rally, but the key question is, how high will Bitcoin go?

Crypto trader sentiment and why euphoria is missing The Fear and Greed Index Chart on CoinMarketCap shows that even as Bitcoin enters price discovery, the levels of “Greed” observed in November 2024 were the highest. Trader sentiment is not as euphoric as one might expect, at the time of writing it reads 73. Extreme greed is typically correlated with cycle peaks or yearly tops. Above $110,000 Bitcoin is still lagging in terms of bullish sentiment among traders. This may be a positive sign as it supports the thesis that the cycle top is still away and traders are likely waiting and watching for the next pullback and rally in BTC. Fear and Greed Index chart | Source: CMC How high can Bitcoin go? Bitcoin’s target is the $122,000 level that coincides with the 127.2% Fibonacci retracement of its 50% rally from April 7 low to May 22 peak. BTC is currently less than 10% away from its target and technical indicators on the daily price chart support likelihood of further gains. RSI is sloping upwards and crossed into the “overvalued” zone and MACD flashes consecutive green histogram bars. If Bitcoin tests resistance at $122,000 and breaks past this level, the next target at $127,352 comes into play. The $127,352 target is the 141.4% Fibonacci retracement level for Bitcoin in its ongoing upward trend. While analysts at Bernstein pushed their target for Bitcoin to $200,000 in 2025, it is likely that BTC crosses the $127,000 level before June 2025, based on its gains since April 2025. BTC/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Expert commentary Shubh Varma, the CEO of Hyblock Capital told Crypto.news that from a technical perspective, he sees the most reliable support zone between $101,000 and $102,500. Exchanges like Binance and Bybit have seen “heavy open interest entries that trap shorts and attract fresh longs,” in this zone. Bitcoin pushed above resistance between the $105,000 and $106,000 level early on Thursday. It remains to be seen how long Bitcoin holds above the FVGs on the daily timeframe. Bitfinex analysts told Crypto.news in a written note that the team is watching minor liquidity walls between $114,000 and $118,000 and the $123,000 to $125,000 zone is where large options open interest is building.

As many early-stage projects remain stagnant ahead of exchange listings, Mutuum is already seeing rapid expansion — not just in funds raised, but in community participation. With over 11,000 holders now on board and nearly $9 million raised, this DeFi project is gaining ground at a pace rarely seen in presale environments. And with its token price climbing from $0.025 to $0.03 as it entered Phase 5, the protocol has already doubled its value by the time of launch, with a confirmed listing price of $0.06. This 100% growth trajectory is already fixed — and it’s happening before public trading has even begun. A DeFi Crypto Platform Gaining Real-World Backing A key factor behind the growing interest in Mutuum is its practical and user-focused approach to decentralized finance. It’s designed to serve both seasoned crypto users and DeFi newcomers by offering straightforward ways to earn passive yield and unlock capital without needing to sell core holdings. The platform’s utility goes beyond lending. mtTokens — interest-bearing tokens issued to depositors — provide a way for users to stay liquid while still earning. The upcoming launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin, paired with future staking, governance functions, and layer-2 compatibility, positions Mutuum as a well-rounded, adaptable system. This practical structure is what’s drawing long-term crypto asset holders into the ecosystem. ETH holders and others with strong hands are beginning to see MUTM as more than a short-term position — but as part of a broader strategy for yield and capital efficiency. While many token launches rely heavily on marketing noise, MUTM is building from the ground up. The momentum is evident not just in the raised capital but in how many individual participants are engaging with the project. The presale includes 11 phases, and Mutuum has already moved into the fifth. At $0.03, the current entry point is still well below the upcoming launch price — offering a window of access that early investors are quickly acting on. But it’s the expanding base of holders that may be the most important sign: participation is growing without the usual hype-heavy push, and that’s the kind of signal experienced traders look for. A Foundation That’s Attracting Smart Capital The project’s growing traction is also tied to its built-in reward system. A portion of the revenue generated by the platform is used to acquire MUTM tokens directly from the market, which are then shared with mtToken holders as a form of ongoing participation incentive. This reward loop not only strengthens the token economy — it reinforces user loyalty over time. In addition, major crypto investors who have previously backed projects like XRP and SOL are also beginning to allocate to MUTM, signaling confidence in both the utility and growth potential of the platform. This early support helps reinforce the credibility of the project ahead of listings. In an environment flooded with speculation, Mutuum Finance stands out for its structure, adoption speed, and transparent rollout. It’s still under $0.05, yet already has one of the most active holder bases among presale projects this year. With essential features launching at the time of listing and a clear value cycle in place, it’s gaining attention from investors who prioritize fundamentals over flash. For those seeking a project with measurable traction, proven token demand, and real product development — MUTM is becoming a serious consideration among the top cryptocurrencies to watch right now.

With Bitcoin officially entering price discovery and surging past its all-time highs, attention is turning toward ETH, which is now testing critical resistance levels. Ethereum has gained over 55% since early May, riding the wave of broader market strength and renewed investor confidence. However, despite the impressive recovery, ETH still lags behind Bitcoin’s pace and has yet to reclaim its 2021 highs. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst Top analyst Daan shared a technical view highlighting that Ethereum has been chopping around the $2,400–$2,600 zone since its explosive move earlier this month. This range-bound price action signals indecision, as buyers remain active but haven’t yet triggered a breakout. Daan notes that although Bitcoin is showing strong leadership with its push into new highs, Ethereum’s performance in this phase has been more muted. Still, the setup remains constructive for bulls. The $2,400 level has acted as solid support, while resistance above $2,800 remains the next target to clear for continuation. As Bitcoin continues to lead, ETH could be next in line to surge—if it can escape this range and follow BTC’s lead into a new leg higher. All eyes are now on Ethereum’s next move. Ethereum Prepares For A Breakout As Altcoins Enter The Spotlight As Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $111K, the broader crypto market appears to be entering a fresh phase of momentum, one that could drive massive gains across altcoins. Among them, Ethereum remains in a critical position. While ETH hasn’t followed BTC’s breakout just yet, it’s holding firmly above support and showing signs of building strength. To confirm a bullish continuation, ETH needs to break decisively above resistance and lead the altcoin rally. Daan shared a technical view highlighting that ETH has been consolidating between the $2,400 and $2,600 levels since its last squeeze higher. Despite Bitcoin’s explosive move, Ethereum is once again lagging, a dynamic that’s been reflected in a cooling ETH/BTC ratio. This underperformance has sparked debate among traders, with many waiting for ETH to catch up and drive the next altseason. Daan emphasized that the $2,500 zone has been well-defended by bulls, but ETH has yet to produce a convincing breakout. The key resistance level to watch is $2,850—clearing it would mark a technical shift toward higher highs. On the flip side, if ETH falls below $2,100, it could trigger a broader pullback. For now, ETH remains range-bound but poised, with market sentiment growing more optimistic by the day.

After weeks of consolidation in the $2,400–$2,600 range, ETH has pushed toward the upper boundary of this zone, hinting at a possible breakout. The recent bounce from support around $2,450 has been strong, with consecutive green candles and rising volume signaling increasing bullish momentum. The 200-period SMA and EMA, currently at $2,077 and $2,1,99 respectively, are well below the current price, confirming a bullish market structure. ETH has held above both moving averages since early May, and the current price action appears to be building up pressure for a decisive move.

This level has been tested multiple times, but sellers continue to defend it. A breakout could trigger a rapid move to $3,000, while failure to hold current levels could drag ETH back toward its previous support.

Glassnode says that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap, which records the price at which each coin was last moved and aims to gauge how many holders are in profit or at a loss, is hitting a new all-time high. “Strength in the digital asset market remains robust with Bitcoin continuing to consolidate just beneath its all-time high of $109,000. The elevation in price has raised the profitability of the vast majority of market investors, with many seizing the opportunity to lock in profits. As a result, capital inflows have increased markedly, pushing the Realized Cap above $900 billion for the first time, a historic milestone that underscores the depth of liquidity in the market.” Glassnode also says that Short-Term Holders (STHs), those entities that have held their coins for less than 155 days, have sold at massive profits in the last month, while Bitcoin is absorbing the selling pressure. “For the Short-Term Holders, the improvement in their portfolio values has directly translated into a notable increase in spending activity, with the cohort realizing over $11.4 billion of profit across the last month.” Glassnode reports on the social media platform X that ever since Bitcoin plummeted to a local low of around $74,000 in early April, the market value to realized value (MVRV) metric – which gauges the market’s sentiment and valuation of a crypto asset – has soared for both STHs and Long-Term Holders (LTHs). A rising MVRV means “holders are sitting on more unrealized profit – boosting confidence and reducing sell pressure,” according to the analytics firm. “Since the $74,000 low: MVRV: 1.74 to 2.33 (+74% to +133%). STH MVRV: 0.82 to 1.13 (from -18% loss to +13% gain). LTH MVRV: 2.91 to 3.30 (+191% to +230%). Profitability is up across the board, boosting confidence and supporting the rally.” Bitcoin printed a new all-time high Wednesday, briefly breaking past $110,000 for the first time in its history. The top crypto asset has since retraced, trading for $109,686 at time of writing, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours.

Mersinger announced that he will be moving to a new role at the Blockchain Association in order to continue to play an active role in regulating the crypto industry. Speaking about the stablecoin regulation expected to pass the Senate, Mersinger said, “The passage of this bill shows that this asset class is now permanent and that the US aims to lead in this area.” He argued that the US could further consolidate its economic power with these new technologies. Mersinger stated that it was a challenging process to make the decision to leave before completing his term, which will last until 2028. However, he expressed that he believes that he can make a more effective contribution to priority issues such as stablecoin law and market structure regulations through his new role at the Blockchain Association. Related News: Altcoin Developers Make a Statement Regarding Today's $224 Million Hack Incident Mersinger argued that the CFTC is in a unique position as a regulator of the crypto spot market. “We already have oversight authority in the futures markets. As the CFTC, we are a market regulator, and that makes us competent,” he said. He also said that the CFTC is a global regulator, so it can effectively oversee international crypto markets as well. CFTC Member Mersinger: “Cryptocurrency Futures Products to Begin Trading Soon” Mersinger, who said that cryptocurrency perpetual futures products may soon start trading in the US, stated that some applications are in the evaluation phase and that these products will soon start trading within the framework of US regulations. “It would be a great gain for the sector if these products return to the US market,” he said. Mersinger, who noted that the CFTC has historically relied on bipartisan cooperation, argued that the agency operates independently of political pressures and that the agency can effectively monitor markets even with a small number of members. While US President Donald Trump’s wealth growth from crypto investments during his re-election campaign has been a source of public debate, Mersinger said these discussions are distracting from the real issues. “What we really need to focus on is having markets operate in a regulated manner in the US. These discussions are distracting us from those goals,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

According to Hougan, Bitcoin's rise is driven by two key factors: the increasing interest of institutional investors in the market and indirect support from the US government. “More than $8 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs in the last 30 days. This means new demand against fixed supply and pushes prices up,” Hougan said, adding that the government’s increasing budget deficits and money printing policies have also pushed investors away from fiat currencies, which has increased their focus on Bitcoin. Related News: Following Record Highs in Bitcoin, US Crypto Chief David Sacks Makes Critical Statements Hougan said the rise in long-term government bonds and developments in markets such as Japan suggested investors were losing appetite for borrowing. “The U.S. government is no longer serious about budget cuts. That calls into question the long-term value of the dollar,” he said. Hougan also touched on why this strong performance of Bitcoin was not seen in altcoins, saying that Bitcoin is in a different position as “digital gold.” He said, “Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana should be evaluated more like technology investments,” and stated that it is natural for these assets to perform differently than Bitcoin. Hougan predicts that Bitcoin will reach new records in the coming period. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Why Did Bitcoin (BTC) Hit a New Record High? Why Are Altcoins Quiet?

However, details about this special dinner are being wondered about. In the US, especially Democrats are criticizing the fact that it is possible to reach the US President in this way. It is said that a significant portion of the names that will attend the Memecoin meeting will consist of non-US citizens. The dinner will take place at the Trump National Gold Club in Washington. The top 220 TRUMP memecoin holders will meet for dinner. The planned schedule is as follows: 00:00 (05:00 PM ET): The top 25 TRUMP token holders will meet with US President Donald Trump at a VIP reception. 1:00 AM-4:30 AM (6:00 AM-9:30 PM ET): The main dinner will begin, which all 220 guests invited to the meeting will attend.

This threat came on Thursday, according to Bloomberg, as GOP lawmakers made it clear they’re ready to go around the Trump White House if they have to. Over 80 senators already back the bill. It includes new financial penalties that hit countries still doing business with Russia, and it bans Americans from buying Russian government bonds. But the White House is still worried that fresh sanctions could scare Putin away from the table. So now, Capitol Hill is waiting to see what Moscow does next. Lindsey Graham demands action as Trump backs off Lindsey Graham, the Republican from South Carolina who wrote the bill, told reporters he plans to act fast. “We are waiting to see what Russia does this coming week,” he said. “If we can get a ceasefire and negotiations, great. We’ll wait. But if Putin keeps playing games, we are going to move.” John Thune, the Senate GOP leader, said the chamber is ready to work with the Trump administration to add pressure. He warned that if Russia refuses to negotiate in good faith, the Senate will move ahead with more sanctions “to force Putin to start negotiating.” The bill would slap a 500% tariff on imports from any nation that buys Russian oil, gas, or uranium. Meanwhile, a recent phone call between Donald Trump and Putin didn’t go well. The two leaders talked for over two hours on Monday, but nothing concrete came from it. Instead of progress, the call ended with the US pulling back from more direct involvement. That hesitation is now being tested by Republicans in Congress, who believe pressure is the only way to get Moscow to talk. Marco Rubio, who now serves as Secretary of State, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that pushing Russia too hard might ruin chances of diplomacy. “If you start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking,” Rubio said. “And there’s value in us being able to talk to them and drive them to get to the table.” While Rubio was warning against moving too fast, the European Union was doing the opposite. On the same day, the EU passed its newest package of penalties aimed at nearly 200 ships that have helped Russia dodge energy trade restrictions. House Republicans could stall sanctions unless forced The bill still needs to clear the House, where Trump’s grip is tighter. Republican leadership there usually aligns with the White House, and if Trump doesn’t support the sanctions , the bill might be blocked. Graham admitted that backers may need to override leadership by forcing a floor vote, something that’s time-consuming but possible. Matthew Whitaker, the US ambassador to NATO, said he expects cooperation between the White House and Congress. “I fully expect that that will be hand in glove and hopefully advance the peace process ultimately,” Whitaker said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Despite Trump’s personal efforts, Russia has made no serious move toward peace. Officials in Washington and Kyiv say Putin has staged what they call “performative ceasefires,” without ever committing to real talks. Trump has tried multiple times to push Putin into negotiations, but none of those attempts have worked. Instead, intelligence suggests that Russia is planning a new military campaign this summer. The goal is to strengthen its hold on parts of southern and eastern Ukraine. If it succeeds, that could give Putin more control in any future negotiations. But back in Russia, the pressure is building. The country’s weapons stockpiles are shrinking. Old tanks, artillery, and other gear from the Soviet era are expected to run out by fall, leaving the Kremlin dependent on what it can build now, which is not enough to keep up with battlefield losses. Jack Watling, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, warned that Russia will try to step up its attacks this year to gain ground before negotiations. But he said the country can’t keep that up forever. “Russia will seek to intensify offensive operations to build pressure during negotiations, but the pressure cannot be sustained indefinitely,” Watling said. He added that Russia might manage to fight two more campaign seasons with its current recruitment system. But continuing deeper into 2026 would require forced mobilisation. That, Watling said, comes with both political and economic risks that Putin may not be ready to handle. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Here’s What the $260M in Presale Tells Us,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-on-track-for-1-is-june-13-the-deadline-for-its-lowest-price-ever-heres-what-the-260m-in-presale-tells-us/,"In crypto, timing and price entry can make a huge difference. BlockDAG’s presale, now over $260 million, has caught attention for more than just momentum; it’s the current price freeze that stands out. Even though the live batch 28 price is $0.0262, buyers can still grab BlockDAG (BDAG) at a slashed rate of just $0.0020 until June 13. This temporary freeze offers a unique window. At $0.0020, buyers are entering far below the market rate. Once the price jumps back to batch levels, the same money will buy 13x fewer BDAG. With projections pointing toward a $1, this moment could define future gains. The difference is clear. A few weeks from now, this rate disappears. And for those paying attention, this isn’t a minor discount, it’s a chance to join early while others wait. When value and timing align like this, it often marks the start of something big. This is one of those rare setups where the upside far outweighs the cost. What Changes After June 13? June 13 will be a major milestone for BlockDAG. That day marks the GO LIVE reveal, when the project will share the full list of 20 exchanges where it will be listed. So far, five platforms are confirmed: MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. This isn’t the end of the presale, though. The $600 million goal still stands. But what does end on June 13 is the special $0.0020 price. After that, the presale price will go back to the $0.0262 batch 28 level and increase again in later stages. Breaking Down the Numbers: What Early Buyers Could Earn The math behind BlockDAG’s presale shows just how powerful early entry can be. With a future value target of $1, here’s how that breaks down. At the current $0.0020 rate, $100 gets you 50,000 BDAG. Once the coin reaches $1, that becomes $50,000, or a 49,900% return. For $1,000, that’s 500,000 BDAG, worth half a million. A $5,000 purchase could be worth $2.5 million when that $1 target hits. And this isn’t just wishful thinking. These numbers are built on solid logic: the current rate is frozen, while the live batch 28 price is $0.0262. Once the price resumes rising, returns like this won’t be possible. Also, the Buyer Battles feature boosts potential further. Each day, 150 million BDAG are allocated, and if not fully sold, the biggest buyer gets the rest. That’s an added reward for those who act now. Right now, buyers are paying less than 8% of the actual value per BDAG. It’s like stepping into a private sale price while the rest of the market pays 13 times more. BlockDAG has already sold over 21 billion coins, with miner sales crossing $7.12 million and over 17,640 mining units sold. These aren’t just numbers, they show serious traction. The price of $0.0020 is fixed only until June 13, making this a true window of opportunity. Why the $1 Price Makes Sense The $1 projection for BlockDAG isn’t just hype. It’s based on real progress. The presale has raised over $260 million and aims for a total of $600 million. More than 21 billion BDAG have already been sold, showing clear market demand. Plus, BlockDAG will launch on 20 exchanges, with five already confirmed. That kind of presence brings high visibility. But it doesn’t stop there. After the mainnet goes live, BlockDAG’s physical miners will also be ready to generate BDAG. These tools connect the network to real-world infrastructure, not just digital use. Daily rewards through Buyer Battles and live referral systems keep things active during the presale. These features make it more than just a wait-and-see coin; they keep users engaged and rewards flowing. Once it launches around the expected $0.05, a jump to $1 isn’t far-fetched. That would mean a 50x from launch and a 500x from today’s $0.0020 price. Compared to meme coins that ride trends, BlockDAG builds with purpose. It’s backed by systems that add lasting value beyond just price charts. Last Call: Why You Shouldn’t Wait The time between now and June 13 could be the most important phase in BlockDAG’s rise. After that date, the special $0.0020 price ends, and BDAG returns to its batch rate of $0.0262. That’s a big shift. With over $260 million already raised, 20 exchange listings lined up, and physical miners ready after launch, the momentum is real. When BlockDAG reaches its $1 projection, buyers today could see 500x returns from this frozen price. This isn’t just another presale phase, it’s a key moment. The setup is perfect: clear pricing, product updates, exchange deals, and daily buying incentives. And most of all, it’s limited. Once June 13 passes, access to BDAG at this level is gone. That’s why this short window could decide who gets in with maximum upside, and who simply watches from the sidelines.

The company announced that it purchased 4.39 BTC for 5 million Norwegian kroner (approximately $475,000) as part of its long-term Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. The Stockholm-based company offers AI-powered automation and digital solutions for healthcare providers. H100 Group has joined the ranks of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets in 2025. The purchase was made at an average price of 1,138,737 Norwegian kroner (about $108,200) per BTC.

He also said that the values of individual sovereignty that are strongly felt in the Bitcoin community align with the customers and communities for whom the H100 platform is being developed. *This is not investment advice.

The current $2.2 billion in XRP futures hints at growing institutional investor demand. The two most bullish events ever imagined by XRP ( XRP ) advocates happened in 2025, but XRP continues to underperform the cryptocurrency market. On March 6, XRP was listed as a candidate for the United States' “Digital Asset Reserve,” and Ripple Labs settled a multi-year-long complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8. XRP/USD (blue) vs. crypto market capitalization. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph XRP fell 6% in the three months leading up to May 22, while overall crypto market capitalization rose 10%. Traders remain hopeful for a 45% rally to $3.50, with derivatives metrics signaling rising confidence. Leverage use ramps up ahead of potential spot XRP ETF listing The aggregate open interest on XRP futures on major exchanges jumped to 923 million XRP on May 22, up 31% from two weeks prior. The $2.2 billion position in futures markets signals growing interest from traders, but it is not necessarily bullish, as those instruments can also be used to speculate on the XRP price downside. XRP futures open interest on major exchanges, XRP. Source: CoinGlass Some traders argue that the increased demand for leveraged XRP positions indicates growing institutional interest, especially as multiple issuers filed for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing in the US. However, the final decision by the US SEC should be made in October. Excessive demand for bullish leveraged XRP causes a positive funding rate, meaning longs (buyers) are the ones paying the carry cost. As cryptocurrency traders are generally optimistic, a 7% to 14% annualized funding rate is expected in neutral markets, while periods of FOMO can push the indicator above 50%. XRP futures annualized funding rate. Source: Laevitas.ch The annualized funding rate jumped to 19% on May 22, nearing the highest levels in six months. Still, the current optimism level is nowhere near the 100% annualized funding rate from Dec. 4, 2024, which followed an impressive 7-day rally to $2.90 from $1.33. Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets. Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investments Favorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitions Part of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.” There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions . Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.

Roxom Global, a project with a clear focus on Bitcoin, has successfully closed a significant funding round. This development signals strong investor confidence not just in Roxom Global’s vision, but also in the continued potential of the Bitcoin ecosystem and broader crypto investment landscape. Understanding the Roxom Global Funding Breakdown The recent capital raise by Roxom Global is quite substantial, totaling an impressive $17.9 million. What’s particularly interesting is how this funding is allocated, highlighting the company’s dual-pronged strategy: $7.9 million: Earmarked specifically for the development and launch of their BTC-denominated securities exchange. This is a key piece of their infrastructure, focusing on transactions settled directly in Bitcoin. $10 million: Dedicated to building out RoxomTV, their ambitious 24/7 crypto media network . This indicates a strong belief in the need for dedicated, round-the-clock coverage of the crypto space. This strategic split in the Roxom Global funding underscores the project’s aim to be both a transactional hub and a central information source within the Bitcoin and crypto communities. Why a BTC-Denominated Bitcoin Exchange? The decision to build a Bitcoin exchange where securities are denominated in BTC is a notable one. Most traditional exchanges and even many crypto platforms primarily use fiat currencies (like USD) or stablecoins (like USDT) as the primary trading pair. A BTC-denominated exchange means that the value of assets listed and traded on the platform would be measured directly in Bitcoin. This approach could appeal strongly to Bitcoin maximalists and those who view BTC itself as the primary unit of account and store of value. Potential Benefits: Aligns with Bitcoin Philosophy: Caters directly to users who prefer to operate purely within the Bitcoin standard. Simplifies BTC-Native Strategies: Makes it easier for users to manage and grow their wealth directly in Bitcoin terms. Potential for Innovation: Could pave the way for new types of financial products and services built natively on Bitcoin. Potential Challenges: Niche Market: May initially appeal to a smaller subset of the overall crypto market compared to fiat or stablecoin pairs. Volatility: Trading against a volatile asset like BTC introduces different risk dynamics compared to stable assets. Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the regulatory landscape for a securities exchange, especially one dealing directly in crypto, can be complex. The Vision for a 24/7 Crypto Media Network With $10 million allocated, RoxomTV aims to be a significant player in the crypto media network space. In a market that never sleeps, having a constant stream of news, analysis, and market data is crucial for investors and enthusiasts alike. A dedicated 24/7 network could offer: Real-time market updates and price analysis. Breaking news coverage from around the globe. In-depth interviews with industry leaders and experts. Educational content for newcomers and advanced traders. Live event coverage and commentary. Building a reputable and widely watched crypto media network requires significant investment in infrastructure, talent, and content creation. Roxom Global’s substantial funding for this arm suggests they are serious about becoming a go-to source for crypto information, aiming to compete with established players and fill potential gaps in round-the-clock coverage. Strategic BTC Treasury Accumulation Beyond building infrastructure, Roxom Global is also focused on strengthening its own balance sheet by accumulating Bitcoin. The report indicates their current BTC treasury holds over $12.5 million worth of Bitcoin at current market prices. Furthermore, they plan to purchase an additional 30 BTC. This strategy of holding Bitcoin on the corporate balance sheet has become increasingly popular among companies, large and small, looking to hedge against inflation or signal their conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Holding a significant BTC treasury serves multiple purposes: Store of Value: Positioning Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset. Alignment with Mission: For a Bitcoin-focused company, holding BTC aligns their financial health directly with the asset they promote. Potential Appreciation: Benefiting from potential future increases in Bitcoin’s price. Adding 30 more BTC to a treasury already exceeding $12.5 million demonstrates a strong commitment to this strategy and further ties the company’s future to Bitcoin’s performance. This move is a tangible form of crypto investment by the company itself, distinct from the funding received from external investors. What Does This Funding Round Signal for Crypto Investment? The successful $17.9 million Roxom Global funding round is more than just news about one company; it’s a positive indicator for the broader crypto investment climate. It shows that despite market volatility, investors are still willing to back ambitious projects within the crypto space, particularly those focusing on core infrastructure like exchanges and essential services like media. Key takeaways for those interested in crypto investment : Continued Confidence: Significant capital is still flowing into promising crypto ventures. Focus on Infrastructure: Projects building fundamental layers (exchanges, data/media) are attracting serious investment. Bitcoin Remains Central: Funding for Bitcoin-centric projects like Roxom Global highlights BTC’s enduring importance in the ecosystem. Dual Approach: Combining financial services (exchange) with information services (media) is seen as a potentially powerful model. This funding round suggests that the market is maturing, with investment flowing towards projects that aim to build sustainable, multi-faceted businesses rather than just speculative tokens. Conclusion: Roxom Global’s Ambitious Path Ahead Roxom Global’s successful $17.9 million funding round marks a significant milestone. With substantial capital allocated to both a unique BTC-denominated Bitcoin exchange and an ambitious 24/7 crypto media network , the company is positioning itself to be a key player in the evolving digital asset landscape. Their strategy of accumulating Bitcoin for their BTC treasury further reinforces their commitment to the ecosystem’s foundational asset. As they move forward, the execution of these plans will be crucial, but the initial Roxom Global funding provides a powerful launchpad for their ambitious vision in the world of crypto investment and beyond.

This Altcoin Is Very Hot in Its Presale,https://nulltx.com/dogecoin-and-solana-slipping-this-altcoin-is-very-hot-in-its-presale/,"Recently, the Dogecoin price and the price of Solana saw some dips as volatility grew for the crypto market. Although market experts like ProfessorAstrones and Javon Marks remain optimistic for these top altcoins, traders are looking at other projects with more stability. One such project could be Unilabs (UNIL) – a rising presale star now in its second round. As it recently crushed the $700K raised milestone while providing early buyers a 30% return, UNIL is seeing the fastest presale growth. Because Unilabs changed the DeFi market with its AI-powered DeFi asset manager, traders are looking at the UNIL altcoin as the token with the most upside potential this year. Unilabs (UNIL) Picks Up Steam With Over $700K Raised Unilabs (UNIL) has been making headlines for a good reason, while the Dogecoin price and the price of Solana experience bleeding charts. Early investors in this project are now enjoying a 30% return and many traders have noticed. In fact, over 180M UNIL tokens have been bought in the second presale round alone. Demand is so high that Unilabs has already crushed the $700K raised milestone, just a few weeks after its launch. Interest in Unilabs was already high as it introduced the first AI-fueled DeFi asset manager with over $30M AUM. To clarify, it uses AI-driven insights to maximize the profit potential of users. For instance, Unilabs Launchpad locates the most promising crypto projects while its one-of-a-kind meme coin identification tool helps users buy before the boom. This makes Unilabs stand out and bring something exciting to the DeFi market. By holding the UNIL altcoin, users will get priority access to new project launches and airdrops on the Unilabs Launchpad. Plus, 30% of the fees made on the platform will be given to UNIL holders based on how many tokens they own. Thus, traders rush to buy UNIL, which costs just $0.0051. But, this altcoin price will hit $0.0062 when phase three begins and will be higher after a Tier-1 CEX listing. This 21% growth makes UNIL one of the altcoins to watch this cycle. ProfessorAstrones: The Price of Solana (SOL) Could Hit $200 Solana (SOL) is one of the best altcoins but has recently seen some turbulence. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Solana fell by over 5% in the past seven days. Its value fluctuated between $180 and below $170 during that time. This fall came as the SEC delayed its decision on Solana ETF filings. Market expert ProfessorAstrones thinks that a potential uptrend may come for the price of Solana (SOL). According to his X post, this altcoin could see a reversal to the $200 level soon. This bullish statement has turned some heads. Nevertheless, many traders are still skeptical of this Solana price prediction. Given that it has a high market cap of around $90B, a lot of new money needs to come for the price of Solana to skyrocket. Meanwhile, UNIL will not face this problem. Expert Forecasts the Dogecoin Price Soaring to $0.73 Dogecoin (DOGE) has also been showing some red price charts. On the one-week chart, its value dipped from around $0.25 to $0.20 per CoinMarketCap. In other words, a nearly 5% fall in the Dogecoin price in just a few days. The community is still watching this token because of analyst Javon Marks’s bullish Dogecoin price prediction. In a recent post, Javon told his X followers that this meme coin has a similar setup to its previous bull cycle. He predicts the Dogecoin price potentially soaring to $0.73. However, some investors choose to sidestep Dogecoin (DOGE) for UNIL. This could be because the Dogecoin price has already surged nearly 40% on the YTD chart and its highest upswings may be behind it. Can Unilabs (UNIL) Bring Faster Gains Than Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE)? Although the price of Solana and the Dogecoin price may rebound soon, Unilabs (UNIL) has some advantages over them. For instance, it has more utility than the hype-based meme coin DOGE and a smaller market cap than SOL. Therefore, adopting it could come quicker, while less new money needs to come for the UNIL price to skyrocket. Due to all these factors, traders rush to get this altcoin before its presale ends and value skyrockets. Many also use the referral layer to get more eyes on Unilabs and earn extra rewards. Anyone interested should join its ICO right now and be part of a project with great upside potential.

Analysts are naming it the “#1 coin to buy,” not just for hype, but for what’s shaping up to be a calculated path toward significant upside. The token has steadily climbed the radar of investors looking for early-stage opportunities with asymmetric returns. With its fixed supply model, rising investor demand, and growing technical credibility, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t being compared to meme tokens—it’s being measured against top-performing altcoins with long-term potential. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Has Analysts and Traders Taking Notice MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently trading well below the price range where many breakout rallies have historically begun. Its mechanics are designed to reward early buyers, reduce inflation risk, and create a price floor through token scarcity. A completed third-party audit from Hashex adds further credibility to the project, helping reinforce investor confidence during a cycle where caution and legitimacy matter more than ever. But beyond structure, what’s fueling the attention is momentum—fast-moving community growth, viral exposure, and an evolving support base of serious altcoin watchers. The #1 Altcoin of 2025? MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly transitioned from a quiet market entrant to a leading contender among emerging cryptocurrencies. It’s now being labeled by multiple analysts as the #1 altcoin to watch in 2025 , thanks to its blend of controlled tokenomics, consistent traction, and sharp positioning. Unlike previous cycles where meme coins succeeded based solely on virality, this project is gaining traction for the right reasons —discipline, structure, and clear token value. Analyst models now forecast 3,500%+ gains post-listing, with some bullish cases stretching far beyond that based on upcoming milestones and market behavior. Why It’s Dominating 2025 Watchlists MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing up everywhere: on influencer breakdowns, technical trading feeds, and institutional analyst watchlists. It’s not about luck—it’s the result of consistent delivery, community engagement, and market timing. Its fixed 100 billion supply, lack of dilution, and smart strategic pacing are aligning at a time when early-stage altcoins are in high demand. The result? MAGACOIN FINANCE is being stacked against names like XRP and Solana—not for comparison’s sake, but because it’s showing the traits of a coin built for long-haul performance. Final Thoughts: Real Potential in a Crowded Market As meme and altcoins continue to rotate in and out of trend cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing still—on purpose. It’s building carefully, focusing on sustainable traction rather than viral explosions, and analysts are starting to call it out as one of the few coins that could deliver real growth in 2025 and beyond. The headlines are catching up, but smart investors already have it on their radar. Whether you call it a meme coin, an altcoin, or just a high-upside opportunity— MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be one of the biggest crypto stories of the year.

With its current trading price of $16.17 and a 3.1% gain in the last 24 hours, the market appears to be reassessing LINK’s potential, especially as technical indicators point to a consistent trend. The broader sentiment is “very bullish,” with 51.95% of participants agreeing that LINK’s current positioning could lay the groundwork for a breakout. Chainlink price prediction 2026 data shows a projected increase to $16.98—suggesting LINK is gradually building strength rather than chasing short-term spikes. This positioning aligns closely with how Qubetics is being approached by early adopters. It’s not about chasing the most noise—it’s about catching structured growth at the right time. Qubetics, with its developer-focused ecosystem and clear real-world integration, is starting to mirror the kind of long-term strategy that communities are appreciating more and more. But first, let’s take a closer look at where Chainlink currently stands. A Technical Case for Steady Growth: Chainlink in Focus The technical indicators for Chainlink are offering a clearer signal than most altcoins currently in the same range. Despite a bearish movement on the 50-day moving average, the 200-day moving average tells a different story. Since May 17, 2025, this longer-term trend line has been sloping upward, signaling strength that typically outlasts short-term reversals. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in a neutral zone, giving the market more room for healthy price action without entering overbought territory. What makes this technical picture more compelling is the absence of any strong divergence patterns. LINK is not being influenced by hype-driven volatility; instead, its stability is drawing attention. As price continues to maintain composure within this band, analysts are finding more reasons to support long-term holding strategies. It’s not aggressive—but it is reliable, and that’s exactly what the Chainlink price prediction 2026 trend reflects. Consensus Points to $20.64 by 2030—Is 2026 the Real Turning Point? Chainlink’s forecasted movement suggests a consistent pattern of annual appreciation. The current year projects a price of $16.17, followed by $16.98 in 2026, $17.83 in 2027, and continuing toward $20.64 by 2030. These figures represent only a 5% increase year-on-year, but that slow climb also mirrors the sentiment surrounding Chainlink as a dependable utility coin in an ecosystem dominated by flashy narratives. This projected growth is rooted in usage rather than speculation. As decentralized data feeds become essential infrastructure for DeFi and Web3 protocols, Chainlink’s role as a reliable oracle network becomes increasingly non-negotiable. The consensus rating solidifies this sentiment: over 51% of community members marked their sentiment as “very bullish,” and nearly 30% remain “bullish.” While LINK might not deliver the type of exponential rise seen in some coins, it is building value on fundamentals—something that adds weight to the Chainlink price prediction 2026 thesis. Short-Term Price Action: LINK to $16.24 Within 30 Days? Looking closer at the immediate outlook, Chainlink is projected to increase by another 5% over the next 30 days, reaching a potential short-term high of $16.24 by June 21, 2025. Daily trend reports show consistency in short movements, with predictions maintaining steady figures around $16.17–$16.19 leading into late May. These numbers support the idea that LINK is stabilizing before making its next real move upward. This kind of structured growth is what differentiates Chainlink in today’s market. It’s not just about current price action but also the absence of negative divergence and the confirmation of long-term support levels. While many coins appear lost in directional indecision, LINK’s gradual rise could be setting the tone for its $16.98 projection by 2026. And for those evaluating serious altcoin contenders, the data around Chainlink price prediction 2026 continues to reinforce a quietly bullish outlook. Why Qubetics Might Offer a Sharper Upside Than Most Utility Coins Qubetics brings a different proposition to the table—more aggressive, more accessible, and far more community-centered. At its core is the QubeQode IDE, a developer platform that offers drag-and-drop blockchain components, form-based smart contract logic, and a ready-to-use snippet library. It’s designed for efficiency, and that’s what gives it such strong real-world utility for freelancers, growing startups, and even enterprise-level users. Whether it’s deploying decentralized applications or automating token management, QubeQode lowers the technical barrier in a way few platforms have achieved. The potential for Qubetics becomes even more exciting when you explore the mechanics of the Qubetics presale. Currently in Stage 35, $TICS is priced at $0.2785 and the presale has already crossed $17.2 million raised, with over 513 million tokens sold to a growing base of 26,800+ holders. Each presale stage only lasts 7 days, with an automatic 10% price jump every Sunday at 12 AM, ensuring time-sensitive value appreciation. With the mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, Qubetics is set to go live at a time when market optimism is returning. Let’s consider a direct investment scenario. At the current price of $0.2785, a $5,000 investment yields 17,950 tokens. Should $TICS hit just $1, that alone delivers $17,950, a +258.95% ROI. If it reaches $5, the return climbs to $89,750—a 1,694.74% ROI. But it doesn’t stop there. A $10 price post-mainnet launch pushes ROI to 3,489.47%, equating to $179,500. And at $15, this same $5,000 turns into $269,250, a staggering 5,284.21% ROI. These are not speculative projections—they’re calculated, visible, and already attracting early buyers looking for the best crypto presale currently live. This kind of return potential, backed by actual product readiness and real utility, makes Qubetics one of the most attractive projects for those seeking more than just another short-term token flip. If you’re looking to make a meaningful entry before the mainnet flips the switch, this is your signal to join this best crypto presale. Final Thoughts: Is It Time to Bet on Utility Again? Chainlink’s story is no longer about recovery—it’s about consistency, maturity, and scalability. The Chainlink price prediction 2026 model outlines a realistic path to $16.98 backed by credible user sentiment and stable technical signals. While it may not deliver meteoric growth, it provides a strong case for solid, utility-driven exposure in a market that still leans heavily into speculation. Meanwhile, Qubetics offers a sharp contrast—bringing explosive potential built around usability and timing. With its crypto presale model rewarding early participants and the QubeQode IDE reducing development complexity, it isn’t surprising that more community members are turning their attention to Qubetics as their next big opportunity. Those who missed early entries in similar ecosystems may not want to repeat that mistake again. Both coins present value—but one offers patience and the other offers speed. If you’re planning strategic entries this season, the timing might be perfect to back reliability with Chainlink and pair it with the upside from Qubetics. It’s a rare moment where the market supports both.

44971275,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=733029,1747948540,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44971275.jpeg,"White House denies secret deal to weaken dollar, defends strong greenback",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/white-house-denies-secret-deal-weaken-dollar/,"The White House is pushing back hard on speculation that it’s working behind closed doors to drive down the dollar. Stephen Miran, who chairs the Council of Economic Advisers, made that clear during an interview on Bloomberg’s Big Take DC podcast. “We’re not secretly at work on any of this stuff. There’s nothing there,” Miran said when asked if the Trump administration was trying to organize an international agreement to weaken the US currency. He also stressed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is the one who officially speaks on the government’s currency stance. According to Bloomberg, the recent chaos in foreign exchange markets, especially after President Donald Trump put his planned tariffs on hold, had traders thinking something else might be happening. Currency chatter shakes up markets across Asia Trump paused his so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on April 9 to leave room for negotiations, and almost immediately, currencies in Asia began surging. Taiwan’s dollar jumped close to 10%, the highest move since 1988. South Korea’s won climbed by 6.4%. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has fallen more than 6% since Trump returned to the White House. Stephen said nothing has changed in the administration’s currency approach, even if traders are reading into the market moves. He confirmed that he hasn’t been part of the trade talks directly, but still dismissed the idea of any coordinated effort to drag the dollar lower. “The United States continues to have the strong dollar policy,” Stephen said. Scott, who took over the Treasury not long ago, had previously floated the idea of a similar agreement before stepping into his current role. But now, he’s sticking to a consistent message. He supports the long-standing view that the dollar should stay strong and that exchange rates should be set by the market, not by policy games. On the sidelines of a G-7 meeting in Banff, Canada, Scott met with Japan’s Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato. Afterward, the US Treasury said both men “reaffirmed their shared belief that exchange rates should be market determined and that, at present, the dollar-yen exchange rate reflects fundamentals.” That was an effort to calm markets, but it didn’t stop the South Korean won from hitting a seven-month high later that day. Local news had reported that currency direction was mentioned during trade talks between the US and South Korea. Miran distances White House from market rumors Stephen used the podcast to remind people that his paper was just a thought experiment—not a plan. “Markets are taking it more seriously than the administration is,” he said. But traders are still connecting the dots. That’s partly because of how the old currency deals came together—quietly, without announcements—making it hard for investors to trust public denials. Still, Stephen said that’s not how things work under Trump. “This is the most transparent administration in history,” he claimed. “Almost every single day the president hosts a press conference. He tells you exactly what he’s thinking, exactly what he wants to accomplish, exactly what he’s going to do, and one by one he does what he says he’s going to do.” Even so, things haven’t always been perfectly consistent. Just last month, Stephen gave a speech where he called the dollar’s dominant role in global finance a “burden.” He said that status hurts American workers and businesses by making labor and exports too expensive internationally. But now he’s backtracking a bit. On the podcast, he insisted that the dollar’s global position brings major upsides. “A strong dollar is good for America. That’s not just merely a statement about levels—it’s a statement about the strength of the dollar system and dollar dominance. That gives us many other benefits.” What’s not clear is how long those “benefits” will last. Markets have already started reacting. After Trump announced his April 2 tariff strategy, US assets tanked. Stocks, Treasuries, and the dollar all got hit in what analysts called a “sell America” moment. Stephen said he wasn’t shocked. “I wasn’t surprised by the volatility,” he said. In his view, the swings in the market were simply a reaction to the bigger changes Trump is trying to make. But he also added one final note: that turbulence won’t last forever. “That volatility doesn’t last forever,” he said.

44971043,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=162485,1747948801,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/44971043.jpeg,SecureTech Unveils Ambitious Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Web3 M&A Push,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/securetech-bitcoin-treasury-strategy/,"BitcoinWorld SecureTech Unveils Ambitious Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Web3 M&A Push In the rapidly evolving intersection of cybersecurity, Web3, and corporate finance, SecureTech is making significant waves. The company has laid out an ambitious roadmap for 2025, signaling a clear intent to strengthen its market position and embrace innovative financial strategies. At the heart of these plans are a strategic share reduction, targeted mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to bolster technology offerings, preparations for a potential stock uplisting to a national exchange, and critically, the development of a pioneering Bitcoin treasury strategy . Understanding SecureTech’s Bold 2025 Vision SecureTech, known for its work in cybersecurity and the burgeoning Web3 space, isn’t just planning incremental changes; they’re outlining a transformative year. The 2025 strategy appears designed to enhance shareholder value, expand technological capabilities, increase market visibility, and integrate digital assets into core corporate finance. Key pillars of their announced plans include: A substantial 55% reduction in outstanding shares. Active pursuit of Web3 M&A opportunities. Steps towards potentially uplisting to a national stock exchange. Implementing a dedicated Bitcoin treasury strategy via subsidiaries and partnerships. Ongoing evaluation of opportunities within the broader blockchain fintech landscape. This multi-faceted approach suggests a company positioning itself for significant growth and adaptation in a dynamic digital economy. Why a 55% Share Reduction? A significant share reduction, like the 55% planned by SecureTech, is a powerful corporate finance move. It typically involves buying back shares from the open market or through tender offers. The primary goal is often to increase the value of the remaining outstanding shares. Here’s how it generally works and potential benefits: Increased Earnings Per Share (EPS): With fewer shares outstanding, the company’s net income is divided among a smaller number of shares, potentially boosting EPS. This can make the stock look more attractive to investors. Improved Valuation Metrics: Other per-share metrics, like book value per share, can also improve. Signaling Confidence: A share buyback can signal that the company believes its stock is undervalued and that investing in its own shares is a good use of capital. Returning Value to Shareholders: It’s a way to return capital to shareholders, similar to dividends, but potentially more tax-efficient in some jurisdictions. Consolidation of Ownership: In some cases, it can consolidate ownership, giving existing shareholders a larger percentage of the company. For SecureTech, this move could be aimed at enhancing its financial profile ahead of potential M&A activities or a stock uplisting, making the company appear financially stronger and more efficient. How Does Web3 M&A Fit In? SecureTech’s focus on Web3 M&A highlights the company’s commitment to expanding its technological footprint in next-generation internet technologies. Web3 encompasses decentralized technologies like blockchain, NFTs, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the metaverse. Mergers and acquisitions in this space can allow SecureTech to: Acquire Talent and Expertise: Bring in skilled teams with specialized knowledge in specific Web3 niches. Gain Access to New Technology: Integrate innovative blockchain protocols, smart contract capabilities, or decentralized application (dApp) platforms. Expand Product Offerings: Add new services or products related to digital asset security, decentralized identity, or Web3 infrastructure. Enter New Markets: Establish a presence in specific Web3 verticals or geographic regions. Accelerate Growth: Achieve faster expansion than would be possible through internal development alone. The strategic nature of this M&A drive suggests SecureTech is looking for synergistic opportunities that complement its existing cybersecurity and Web3 foundations, creating a more robust and diversified technology portfolio. Preparing for a Stock Uplisting: What Does it Mean? Moving from an over-the-counter (OTC) market to a national exchange, such as the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is known as a stock uplisting . This is a significant step for any company and comes with increased scrutiny and requirements. The process typically involves: Meeting stringent financial standards (revenue, net income, market capitalization). Adhering to higher corporate governance requirements. Ensuring a minimum share price and public float. Increased reporting and compliance obligations. The benefits of a successful stock uplisting are substantial: Increased Visibility and Prestige: Listing on a major exchange brings more attention from institutional investors and analysts. Improved Liquidity: Trading volume often increases, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. Enhanced Access to Capital: Being on a national exchange can make it easier and cheaper to raise funds through future stock offerings. Broader Investor Base: Attracts a wider range of investors, including large institutions that may have restrictions on investing in OTC stocks. SecureTech’s preparation for this move indicates confidence in its growth trajectory and a desire to access larger capital markets and gain greater legitimacy in the eyes of mainstream finance. Deep Dive: SecureTech’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of SecureTech’s 2025 plan is the development of a dedicated Bitcoin treasury strategy . This involves holding Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset, a practice popularized by companies like MicroStrategy. SecureTech is pursuing this through its subsidiary, Piranha Blockchain, and a partnership with LockerFunder. This structure suggests a multi-pronged approach: Piranha Blockchain’s Role: Likely focuses on the technical and operational aspects of acquiring, securing, and managing the Bitcoin holdings. This could involve developing or utilizing secure custody solutions. LockerFunder Partnership: Could be related to financing mechanisms for acquiring Bitcoin, leveraging existing capital, or potentially providing services related to the strategy’s execution. Strategic Rationale: Companies adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy for various reasons, including a hedge against inflation, a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation potential, and diversification away from traditional fiat holdings. For a Web3 and fintech-focused company like SecureTech, it also aligns with their core business and expertise in digital assets. Implementing such a strategy involves careful consideration of security, regulatory compliance, accounting treatment, and market volatility. It signals a forward-thinking approach to corporate finance, embracing digital assets as part of a modern treasury management system. Evaluating Further Blockchain Fintech Opportunities Beyond the specific focus on a Bitcoin treasury and Web3 M&A, SecureTech is also broadly evaluating further opportunities in the blockchain fintech space. This indicates a commitment to staying at the forefront of financial technology innovation. What might this evaluation entail? Exploring DeFi Applications: Investigating decentralized finance protocols for potential integration or services. Looking into Tokenization: Examining the potential for tokenizing real-world assets or creating new digital assets. Assessing Payment Solutions: Evaluating blockchain-based payment systems and infrastructure. Identifying Strategic Partnerships: Seeking collaborations with other players in the blockchain and fintech ecosystems. Developing New Products: Creating innovative solutions that leverage blockchain technology for financial use cases, potentially related to security, identity, or asset management. This broad evaluation shows SecureTech’s intent to not only participate in the current digital asset landscape but also to actively shape its future through exploring and potentially integrating emerging blockchain fintech advancements. Benefits and Challenges of SecureTech’s Strategy SecureTech’s comprehensive 2025 plan presents a mix of potential benefits and inherent challenges. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Shareholder Value: Share reduction and potential uplisting can boost stock attractiveness. Technological Leadership: Web3 M&A can integrate cutting-edge tech and talent. Increased Capital Access: Uplisting opens doors to larger funding opportunities. Innovative Finance: Bitcoin treasury strategy aligns with digital asset trends and potential long-term gains. Market Position: Aggressive strategy can solidify SecureTech’s place in the cybersecurity and Web3 sectors. Potential Challenges: Execution Risk: Successfully implementing a share reduction, complex M&A, and an uplisting simultaneously is challenging. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility introduces risk to the treasury strategy. Regulatory Uncertainty: The Web3 and crypto space faces evolving regulations. Integration Hurdles: Merging acquired companies and technologies can be difficult. Cost and Resources: These initiatives require significant financial and human resources. Navigating these challenges effectively will be key to realizing the full potential of SecureTech’s ambitious plans. What Actionable Insights Can We Take? For investors and market watchers, SecureTech’s strategy offers several points of interest: Monitor Execution: Keep a close eye on how SecureTech progresses with its share reduction, M&A deals, and uplisting efforts. Milestones achieved or missed will be telling. Evaluate Bitcoin Treasury Performance: Track the performance and management of their Bitcoin treasury strategy . This will be a key differentiator and potential value driver, but also a source of risk. Assess M&A Targets: If specific acquisition targets are announced, evaluate how they complement SecureTech’s existing business and contribute to their Web3 M&A goals. Observe Uplisting Progress: Follow their steps towards a national exchange listing, including meeting necessary requirements. Watch for Blockchain Fintech Innovation: Pay attention to any new products or partnerships emerging from their evaluation of blockchain fintech opportunities. SecureTech’s strategy provides a case study in how established tech companies are seeking to integrate digital assets and decentralized technologies into their core operations and financial planning. Conclusion: A Future Built on Digital Assets and Strategic Growth SecureTech’s 2025 strategy paints a picture of a company aggressively pursuing growth and innovation at the frontier of technology and finance. From reducing its share count to preparing for a significant stock uplisting , the company is taking concrete steps to enhance its corporate structure and market standing. Their proactive pursuit of Web3 M&A opportunities signals a clear intent to expand technological capabilities in decentralized domains. However, the most noteworthy element is arguably the formal adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy , positioning SecureTech among a growing list of companies integrating digital assets into their balance sheets. Coupled with an ongoing evaluation of broader blockchain fintech possibilities, SecureTech is clearly charting a course deeply intertwined with the future of digital finance and decentralized technology. Success will depend on skillful execution and navigating the inherent volatilities and regulatory complexities of the digital asset space.

This news has caught the crypto community’s attention because of the stablecoin’s ties to the Trump family. Binance revealed that trading for USD1 will begin on May 22, 2025, with the USD1/USDT pair. USD1 Trading Opens on Binance with Zero Listing Fee The spot trading of USD1/USDT will start on May 22, 2025, at 12:00 UTC, giving users a new stablecoin option on the world’s largest exchange. Binance has decided not to charge its usual listing fee for USD1, making its entry smoother and more accessible to all traders. USD1 withdrawals will begin a day later, on May 23, 2025, at 12:00 UTC. However, Binance notes that the withdrawal time is an estimate and may slightly change depending on network conditions. USD1 Market Performance USD1 is a stablecoin created by BitGo Trust Company under full U.S. regulatory compliance. What makes USD1 stand out is its strong financial backing. It is managed by World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized crypto project backed by the Trump family. Since its launch in March, USD1 has quickly become popular. It has a market value of $2.3 billion and is ranked fifth among all USD-backed stablecoins. WLFI recently partnered with Chainlink to make USD1 work across many blockchains. This upgrade will help more people use the stablecoin on various platforms and attract more users. WLFI Holds Diverse Crypto Portfolio World Liberty Financial, supported by DWF Labs, holds a large and diverse crypto portfolio. Some of the main ones are Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), staked ETH (STETH), and few altcoins. Data from Arkham Intelligence shows that WLFI’s crypto portfolio is now worth over $108 million. These assets are spread across multiple blockchain networks, giving the company flexibility and strength in the market. Before the Binance listing was announced, Lookonchain reported that WLFI used 25,011 USD1 tokens to buy 636,961 BUILDon (B) tokens. This shows that the crypto project is actively involved in the crypto market and makes regular investments. In a related event, President Donald Trump is hosting a special dinner for major holders of the TRUMP meme coin.

Here’s where the target could lie, based on the pattern. Dogecoin Has Just Seen A Surge Beyond Bull Pennant Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that has been forming in the hourly price of Dogecoin recently. The pattern in question is a “Bull Pennant,” which is a type of Pennant from technical analysis (TA). A Pennant forms whenever the price of an asset witnesses consolidation between two converging trendlines following a sharp move. The initial rapid move is known as the ‘pole,’ and the consolidation channel as the ‘pennant.’ Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets New ATH, But This Metric Says No Overheating Yet This arrangement is similar to that seen in Flag patterns, with the main difference between the two being the fact that Flags involve parallel consolidation channels, not triangular ones. Just like other consolidation patterns in TA, when the price is stuck inside the pennant portion, it is likely to face resistance at the upper level and support at the lower one. Pennants are usually considered continuation patterns, so a breakout is more probable to occur in the same direction as the preceding move (that is, the same orientation as the pole). When the pole is pointing in the up direction, the resulting Pennant is called a Bull Pennant. Similarly, it being in the opposite direction forms what’s known as a Bear Pennant. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Bull Pennant that the 1-hour Dogecoin price has potentially been trading inside recently: As is visible in the above graph, Dogecoin was witnessing net consolidation toward the downside inside this Bull Pennant earlier, but now, with the latest rally in the asset, its price has managed to find a break above the resistance line. So far, the memecoin hasn’t gained too much distance over the line, so it’s unconfirmed whether this is a real breakout. In the scenario that it is indeed the case and the governing pattern here is a Bull Pennant, then it’s possible that DOGE could end up seeing a rally of a similar scale as the pole of the pattern. The length of the pole involved in this Bull Pennant puts the breakout target at around $0.31. If the memecoin can manage a run to this mark, then its price would have gone up by almost 30% from the current level.

DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.239, up around 6% in the past week.

According to a May 22 Axios report, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley will file an amendment to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, to block a US president from profiting from stablecoins. The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8. “Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post. Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March. Critics have pointed out that the president could continue to personally benefit from legislation that helps recognize stablecoins like USD1 as financial instruments in the US. Related: US lawmaker introduces anti-corruption bill ahead of Trump’s dinner An Abu Dhabi-based investment firm said that it would use USD1 to settle a $2-billion investment in Binance, effectively allowing the president’s family to profit from the transaction fees. Democratic lawmakers have already called for an investigation into Trump’s connections to the platform, which was largely dismissed as “flawed” by WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff. Stablecoins are just one of many potential conflicts, say Democrats Merkley and Warren are also planning responses to Trump hosting a dinner at his golf club for up to 220 people who purchased the most significant amounts of his personal memecoin. Merkley is expected to attend a protest organized by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, outside the Trump venue on May 22. Warren held a press conference with Merkley, Senator Chris Murphy and Public Citizen representatives, calling on Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner event. Though a few of the potential attendees have publicly announced they were the owners of the wallets who purchased the memecoin and intended to go, the majority were still anonymous at the time of publication. “What is happening tonight — this private, secret dinner — in which individuals who have put money in Donald Trump’s pocket, get access to him, is maybe the most corrupt of all the corruption,” said Murphy, adding: “They were able to pay their way in to get an audience with the President of the United States to ask for favorable national security concessions.” Cointelegraph reached out to the White House for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.

The daily close above the highs is a big deal for the crypto markets. BTC is now in a rising channel since April, with higher highs and higher lows. Technically the breakout is strong. MACD has just given a bullish crossover and the 50 day EMA ($96,956) is rising, the long term trend is strong. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC holds above $113,369, we may see the next resistance levels at $117,141 and $120,913. But price is at the top of the channel so a pullback to $108,000 could be a healthy reset and a second chance long. Regulation Boosts Investor Confidence Beyond the charts, Bitcoin’s breakout is being driven by big regulatory tailwinds. In Texas, the state lawmakers approved Senate Bill 21 , allowing the state to create a Bitcoin reserve. Once signed into law, Texas will be the second US state after New Hampshire to hold crypto on its balance sheet, a big step in legitimizing Bitcoin as a treasury asset. JUST IN: The Texas House has officially passed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill (SB21). Using rainy day funds, Texas could purchase 217,654 BTC assuming a BTC price of $109,219. BULLISH! pic.twitter.com/04WBx4gr8d — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) May 21, 2025 Hong Kong also passed landmark legislation to regulate fiat-referenced stablecoins (FRS), including licensing, AML compliance and reserve management. This tighter framework will attract institutional capital and solidify Bitcoin as a regulated and strategic hedge in global finance. These policy changes reduce uncertainty and mean crypto is becoming part of the mainstream financial infrastructure – key for long term adoption and capital inflow. Macro Tailwinds Fuel Bullish Outlook for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s rally comes as traditional markets are getting nervous. A disappointing US Treasury auction pushed 20 year bond yields above 5.1%, 10 year and 30 year yields are also spiking. This bond market chaos is driving investors to Bitcoin as a macro hedge. Geopolitical tensions – tariffs and currency concerns – are also eroding faith in fiat systems. $110K BITCOIN HAS ENTERED THE CHAT Bitcoin just cracked six figures guess it finally remembered the password.

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home. Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident. Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness. Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts. The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings , extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families. Related: Chainalysis CEO offers a clue into recent spate of Paris crypto attacks Crypto community members become the targets of violent crime Several kidnapping incidents involving crypto investors, industry executives, and their families have occurred in May. On May 3, the father of an unnamed crypto exchange owner was freed by French police after law enforcement officials raided the property where the individual was being held captive by organized criminals demanding a ransom for his release. Shortly after that incident, the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of the Paymium crypto exchange, were the targets of an attempted kidnapping in Paris. The incident occurred in broad daylight when the assailants attacked the family and attempted to force them into a parked vehicle. However, Noizat's daughter and another individual were able to fight off the masked attackers. The rise in violent attacks against crypto investors and professionals has prompted an increase in personal security , including requests for bodyguards and private security measures for those likely to be victimized.

For those tracking the digital frontier, including the cryptocurrency space, understanding the foundational infrastructure supporting this growth is crucial. A major development is underway as OpenAI sets its sights on expanding its ambitious data center plans globally, starting with a significant move into the Middle East. What is the OpenAI UAE Data Center Initiative? Confirming prior rumors, OpenAI has officially announced its expansion of the high-profile Stargate data center initiative into the United Arab Emirates. This new undertaking, dubbed Stargate UAE, involves constructing a massive 1GW (gigawatt) data center cluster situated in Abu Dhabi. The company anticipates that the initial phase, approximately 200MW, will become operational by 2026. This project represents a substantial investment in future AI capabilities. The sheer scale of a gigawatt facility highlights the immense computational power OpenAI believes is necessary to fuel the next generation of AI models and services. Building out this kind of AI infrastructure requires significant capital, planning, and strategic partnerships. Exploring the Stargate Project and its Ambitions The Stargate project is OpenAI’s reported plan to build a network of extremely large data centers designed specifically for AI training and inference at scale. The UAE development is the first publicly confirmed international step for this initiative. OpenAI stated in a blog post that Stargate UAE is intended to provide critical AI infrastructure and compute capacity across a vast region, potentially reaching within a 2,000-mile radius. This geographical reach suggests that the Abu Dhabi center will serve not just the UAE but potentially parts of the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, positioning the UAE as a central hub for AI development and deployment in the region. The ambition behind the Stargate project underscores the escalating global competition to build the necessary physical infrastructure for advanced AI. Why is Gigawatt AI Capacity Significant? When we talk about Gigawatt AI capacity, we are talking about power consumption equivalent to a small city. Training the most advanced AI models requires immense computational resources, primarily powerful GPUs, which consume vast amounts of electricity and generate significant heat requiring sophisticated cooling systems. A Gigawatt AI training cluster can house hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of AI accelerators. This scale is necessary to handle the exponentially growing complexity and size of cutting-edge AI models. Achieving this level of compute capacity is seen as a key differentiator in the race for AI supremacy. Interestingly, this announcement came the same week that Elon Musk revealed his AI venture, xAI, also planned to build the world’s first ‘gigawatt’ AI training cluster, highlighting the industry-wide push towards this scale of AI infrastructure . Strategic Partnerships Driving AI Infrastructure Growth The development of Stargate UAE is a collaborative effort involving several major players in the technology and investment sectors. OpenAI is partnering with a consortium that includes: G42 (a leading UAE-based AI and cloud computing company) Oracle (for cloud infrastructure) Nvidia (presumably for GPUs and AI hardware) Cisco (likely for networking technology) SoftBank (as an investment partner) This combination of local expertise (G42), cloud providers (Oracle), hardware specialists (Nvidia, Cisco), and global investors (SoftBank) is essential for undertaking a project of this magnitude. These partnerships are critical for navigating the complexities of building and operating such a massive piece of AI infrastructure in a new region. What Does This Mean for “OpenAI for Countries”? OpenAI characterized the Stargate UAE partnership as the inaugural project under its new global initiative called “OpenAI for Countries.” This program aims to assist interested governments in developing sovereign AI capabilities, often in coordination with the U.S. government. A key component of this partnership is that the UAE will become the first country globally to enable nationwide access to ChatGPT. This provides citizens across the country the ability to utilize OpenAI’s technology directly. This strategic move suggests OpenAI is looking to embed its technology and infrastructure deeply within nations, potentially setting a precedent for future international collaborations under the “OpenAI for Countries” framework. The construction of the OpenAI UAE data center is more than just a building project; it’s a strategic play in the global race for AI dominance. By establishing a gigawatt-scale facility with major partners, OpenAI is securing the physical resources needed for future AI development and expanding its influence internationally. This development underscores the increasing convergence of geopolitical strategy, technological advancement, and the critical need for robust AI infrastructure .

The bill’s core principle stipulates that if crypto developers and service providers do not hold custody of consumer funds, they shouldn’t be classified as money transmitters under current regulations. The clarification aims to provide legal certainty for blockchain developers, miners, validators, and crypto wallet providers who build non-custodial services. Clarity for Developers, Miners, and Validators The legislation addresses concerns that unclear regulations are pushing American crypto innovation overseas. Both congressmen emphasize that the bill protects innovation while maintaining appropriate oversight, and they have refined the framework based on previous feedback when similar language was rejected in committee. “The longer we delay this commonsense clarification, the greater the risk that this transformative technology is pushed overseas, harming American investors and innovators,” said Emmer . “If we want to keep the next generation of builders in the United States, this kind of legal clarity is essential,” said Torres, who added, “We cannot afford to let outdated or misapplied regulations drive American talent and technology overseas.” Several industry organizations have endorsed the reintroduction, including Coin Center, DeFi Education Fund, Blockchain Association, Solana Policy Institute, and Crypto Council for Innovation. Emmer originally introduced this bill in 2018, and the current version represents continued efforts to establish regulatory clarity. Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill Passes In related news, the Texas strategic Bitcoin reserve bill ( SB 21 ) has passed the third reading by a vote of 101 to 42 and now heads to the Governor’s desk for signature. The bill establishes the reserve as an investment vehicle, allowing the state to actively buy, sell, and manage high market cap crypto assets for financial security and economic resilience.

WLD price is over 86 percent down from its all-time high but rising institutional adoption signals a momentum shift. Worldcoin (WLD) price dominated the top altcoin gainers in the past 24 hours after Bitcoin (BTC) price confirmed the onset of a crypto summer 2025. The mid-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.9 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of around $1 billion, surged over 30 percent on Thursday to trade about $1.59 during the late North American trading session. Following the WLD price rally today, the total Worldcoin futures open interest surged over 67 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $411 million at the time of this writing. Worldcoin Gets Boost from Institutional Investors The Worldcoin project has grown significantly in the past year catalyzed by the significant adoption of the World App. According to the latest data , the World App has more than 26 million users, with over 12.5 million users having already verified their unique humaneness through the Orb device. Following the notable Worldcoin adoption, the World Foundation announced a $135 million raised funds from a16z and Bain Capital Crypto. Most importantly, the investors purchased WLD tokens directly from the secondary market. Short-Term Targets for WLD Price As with the wider altcoin market, the WLD price has recorded bullish momentum since the first week of April 2025, following the easing of the trade war. In the four-hour time frame, the WLD price has been forming higher highs and higher lows, a characteristic of a rising trend. Following the recent rebound from the established rising logarithmic trend, WLD price is now aiming for the next target range between $2.32 and $4.124. Furthermore, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) surged above the 70 percent level again, signaling bullish sentiment. Additionally, the daily MACD line has already crossed the zero line amid growing histograms. The short term bullish sentiment for WLD price will be invalidated if the altcoin consistently closes below the support level around $1.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|WLD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 21:51:44

Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just made a significant announcement that could change how many approach the market. They are set to launch a brand new Binance perpetual contract , specifically for the B/USDT trading pair, and they’re offering an eye-watering 50x leverage . This move, announced on their official website, is scheduled to go live on May 22 at 16:30 UTC. For those deeply involved in crypto leverage trading or looking to explore advanced trading strategies, this presents both exciting opportunities and substantial risks. What Exactly is a B/USDT Perpetual Contract? Before diving into the leverage, let’s break down the core concept. A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivatives contract that, unlike traditional futures, has no expiration date. This allows traders to hold positions indefinitely, as long as they maintain sufficient margin. The B/USDT pair means you are trading the value of token ‘B’ against the value of Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Key features of perpetual contracts include: No Expiry: You can keep your position open as long as you meet the margin requirements. Funding Rates: To keep the contract price close to the underlying asset’s spot price, a funding mechanism exists. Traders holding long or short positions pay or receive small fees periodically. Leverage: This is where things get interesting, allowing you to trade a larger position size than your initial capital. Understanding the Power (and Peril) of 50x Leverage Leverage is essentially borrowed capital used to increase the potential return of an investment. With high leverage trading like 50x offered by Binance, a small amount of your own capital (known as margin) can control a much larger position value. For instance, with 50x leverage, a $100 margin could control a position worth $5,000 (100 * 50). The Upside: Magnified Gains If the price of the B/USDT pair moves favorably, even a small percentage change can result in significant profits relative to your initial margin. This is the primary allure of high leverage – the potential for rapid and substantial returns on limited capital. The Downside: Amplified Losses and Liquidation Risk Conversely, if the market moves against your position, losses are also magnified. A small unfavorable price movement can quickly erode your margin. With 50x leverage, a relatively tiny percentage drop in the asset price can lead to your position being automatically closed by the exchange (liquidated) to prevent your balance from going below zero. This means you could lose your entire margin investment very quickly. Why is Binance Launching the B/USDT Perpetual Contract? Binance continually expands its offerings to meet the diverse demands of its global user base. Adding the B/USDT perpetual contract provides traders with more options for speculating on the price movements of this specific token against USDT. The inclusion of 50x leverage caters to experienced traders seeking to maximize capital efficiency and potential profits, albeit with significantly higher risk. How Does This Impact Crypto Futures Trading? The addition of new contracts like the B/USDT perpetual enhances the overall landscape of futures trading crypto on Binance. It increases liquidity and provides more avenues for hedging or speculating. For traders already active in this space, it means another instrument is available for their strategies. For newcomers, it highlights the wide range of derivatives products available on the platform. Benefits of Trading the B/USDT Perpetual with Leverage For those who understand and manage the risks, trading this new contract with leverage offers several potential benefits: Capital Efficiency: Use a smaller amount of capital to control a larger position. Potential for Higher Returns: Magnify profits from favorable price movements. Shorting Opportunities: Profit from potential price declines by opening a short position. 24/7 Trading: The crypto market operates around the clock, allowing continuous trading. Liquidity: As a major exchange, Binance typically offers good liquidity for its listed contracts. Navigating the Challenges and Risks It is crucial to approach high leverage trading with extreme caution. The primary challenge is managing the significant risk of liquidation. Volatility in the crypto market is inherent, and 50x leverage leaves very little room for error. A sudden price swing can wipe out your position before you have time to react. Other challenges include: Funding Rate Costs: Depending on market sentiment, funding rates can become expensive, eating into profits or increasing losses. Complexity: Understanding margin requirements, liquidation prices, and funding rates adds complexity compared to simple spot trading. Emotional Toll: The potential for rapid gains or losses can be emotionally taxing and lead to impulsive decisions. Example: How 50x Leverage Works (Simplified) Let’s illustrate with a simple example. Suppose the price of B is 100 USDT. Scenario Your Capital (Margin) Leverage Position Size Price Increase (+1%) Profit (on Margin) Price Decrease (-1%) Loss (on Margin) Outcome at -2% Spot Trading $100 1x $100 (1 B) Price to $101 $1 Price to $99 -$1 Still holding Leverage Trading $100 50x $5,000 (50 B) Price to $101 $50 Price to $99 -$50 Potential Liquidation* *Note: Liquidation price depends on entry price, leverage, maintenance margin, and fees. This is a simplified example to show the amplified effect of leverage. A 2% drop at 50x leverage could potentially wipe out your initial margin. Actionable Insights for Trading the B/USDT Perpetual If you plan to trade the new B/USDT perpetual contract, especially with high leverage, consider these points: Start Small: Do not commit a large portion of your capital, especially when you are new to futures or high leverage. Understand Liquidation: Know how your liquidation price is calculated and monitor it closely. Use Risk Management Tools: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Take-profit orders can help secure gains. Educate Yourself: Fully understand how perpetual contracts, funding rates, and margin work on Binance before trading. Manage Emotions: Stick to your trading plan and avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. Consider Lower Leverage: Binance offers a range of leverage options. Starting with lower leverage (e.g., 5x or 10x) is significantly less risky than jumping straight to 50x. Concluding Thoughts: Opportunity Meets Responsibility Binance’s launch of the B/USDT perpetual contract with 50x leverage opens up powerful new possibilities for traders. For those experienced in crypto leverage trading , it provides another instrument to potentially generate significant returns. However, the allure of high leverage trading must be tempered with a deep understanding of the associated risks. Futures trading crypto , particularly with high multipliers, is not suitable for everyone and can lead to rapid and substantial losses. Approach this new contract with caution, prioritize risk management, and trade responsibly.

Stephen Lynch, Brad Sherman, Al Green, and Rashida Tlaib. “This bill will stop Trump’s brazen crypto corruption and prevent any President, Vice President, Members of Congress, or their immediate families from exploiting crypto in this way,” Maxine Waters said in a statement. “Congress can no longer ignore the biggest scam and abuse of power in American history,” she added. “I know my Republican colleagues fear Trump, but I urge them to stand with me and my Democratic colleagues to pass this bill and send a clear message that the White House is not a platform for personal profit.” Trump Meme Coin Gala Dinner Raises Eyebrows Waters’ legislation comes as scrutiny grows over Trump’s ties to the digital asset industry ahead of his exclusive gala dinner for the 220 top investors of his namesake cryptocurrency at Trump National Golf Club on May 22. The top 25 investors will also be eligible to attend an “exclusive reception” alongside the sitting U.S. president shortly before the event, which includes a “special VIP tour” for attendees. Critics argue that the gala dinner is, at best, ethically ambiguous, given that foreign interests may have purchased $TRUMP to buy favor with Trump.

The legislation, which aims to extend expiring tax cuts and pour billions into border security, passed after weeks of infighting among Republicans. Trump, from the White House, made it clear that delays weren’t an option. “We don’t need GRANDSTANDERS in the Republican party,” he said last week, as pressure mounted on holdouts. According to the White House FACT SHEET, the bill is officially called the “One, Big Beautiful Bill Act” and stretches over 1,000 pages. It’s designed to lock in much of the 2017 tax law, a core part of Trump’s first presidency, and pairs that with sweeping cuts to welfare programs. The president’s second-term agenda is now wrapped tightly around this legislation, and it’s heading straight for the Senate — where Trump’s allies hold only a narrow edge. Trump’s bill extends tax cuts and slashes health funding The bill would extend individual income tax reductions, increase the child tax credit, and remove federal taxes on tips and overtime pay. Trump had promised those changes during his re-election run, and he’s now trying to deliver. Wealthier Americans stand to gain more from the estate and gift tax exemption hikes, while corporations will see fresh business tax breaks handed down across multiple sectors. At the same time, Trump is also demanding more cash for the southern border. Over $50 billion is allocated to border security, including further wall construction with Mexico . This is the same wall Trump swore to complete, and the money’s now written into the bill. But to pay for it, his party has gone after social programs. Republicans cut almost $800 billion from Medicaid, the government’s healthcare program for low-income Americans. Food stamps and clean energy tax credits were also gutted. Universities and foundations would face new taxes on investment income, which the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates will raise over $22 billion. This is where the internal GOP fight got nasty. House Republicans split hard on whether to touch health and welfare budgets. But Trump made it clear there would be no room for public defections, and he leaned in hard to get the final votes needed. Now that it’s out of the House, the bill moves to the Senate, where 53 Republicans hold the majority. Trump needs at least 50 of them to vote yes. If just a few defects, the bill dies or has to be rewritten. Any changes would force it back to the House for another vote. Debt surge triggers warnings, but Trump predicts growth The financial hit from the bill is enormous. Experts at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and the Committee for a Responsible Budget estimate that it will add $3.3 trillion to national debt over the next decade. That would push the debt-to-GDP ratio to 125% by 2035, way past the 98% level seen in 2024, and higher than any point since World War II. Maury Obstfeld, the former IMF chief economist now at the Peterson Institute, warned that the debt surge could damage the country’s financial standing. “The bill could put the US Treasury on the road to triple-B status,” he said , referencing the US credit rating, which had already dropped days earlier. Trump’s team says the bill will do the opposite. His Council of Economic Advisers predicts the plan will cut the fiscal deficit in half by the end of his term, from 6.4% to 3% of GDP. They also claim it will grow the economy by up to 5.2% over four years, create or save 7.4 million jobs, and raise investment by 14.5%. But most outside analysts don’t think the math adds up. They admit the bill might give a short-term boost, but not enough to counter the debt spike. Still, for Trump, the fight is about politics. His approval rating is currently 47.3%, and he’s betting this bill will help him climb higher. But the move is risky. In 2018, Democrats hammered Republicans over Trump’s original tax law and took back the House. That could happen again. If the public sees this as another tax break for the wealthy, while gutting basic services, it could blow up in Trump’s face. But if he wins the Senate vote, he locks in years of lower taxes, and a signature second-term victory with his name all over it.

In a major ruling issued Thursday, the court told the White House that the Fed is off-limits, even though Trump is currently allowed to fire officials from two other federal boards. This legal distinction came down in a 6–3 decision, clearly dividing which institutions the president can interfere with, and which ones he can’t. According to a full opinion published by the court, the ruling gave Trump the go-ahead to fire Gwynne Wilcox, a former board member at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), and Cathy Harris, who served on the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). But the court made sure to underline that this case had nothing to do with the Federal Reserve, whose board members — unlike Wilcox and Harris — are protected by law from being fired without cause. The justices flat out rejected the idea that removing these two women would threaten the Fed’s legal independence. Court lets Trump remove board members but isolates the Fed Trump had previously dismissed Wilcox and Harris from their appointed roles. Both women challenged the decision in court, saying the president didn’t have the legal authority to remove them. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., agreed with them and blocked the removals. That decision was upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. But in April, the Supreme Court stepped in and temporarily lifted those rulings, saying the case needed more time. On Thursday, the justices turned that temporary order into an official one. In the majority opinion, the court said, “Because the Constitution vests the executive power in the President … he may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents.” That was their legal basis for allowing Trump to fire Wilcox and Harris. But the court was careful to say this did not mean Trump could do the same thing to people running the Federal Reserve. When Wilcox and Harris tried to argue that their case might impact the Fed, the court responded bluntly: “We disagree.” The ruling stressed that the Fed is not like other federal boards. It’s a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.” Federal Reserve given special legal protection Although the court didn’t directly rule on whether Trump — or any president — could fire someone at the Fed, they clearly drew a legal line in the sand. If a future case tried to challenge the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors, the opinion signaled that the court would not be supportive. This is important because Trump has had public tensions with the Fed and especially with Chairman Jerome Powell, who was appointed under his previous administration but later drew Trump’s criticism. The legal language from the court suggested that the Federal Reserve is more insulated than other agencies. The justices said the government faced “greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.” But once again, they pointed out that this logic does not apply to the Federal Reserve. That agency is not viewed as part of the president’s executive power structure in the same way. The three liberal justices — Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson — dissented from the ruling. They believed that removing Wilcox and Harris before the case was settled was unfair. But the majority didn’t budge. They said that even though this case might need more arguments later, Trump has the right — at least for now — to fire them. Meanwhile, Jerome Powell has already addressed the legal question directly. When Trump was out of office and still publicly bashing the Fed, Powell said during a press event in November that he would not resign if asked by Trump with a flat “ Not permitted under the law. ” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Economy|Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-22 21:59:18

Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is preparing for its next major technical upgrade, promising further improvements to scalability and efficiency. At the same time, a newer DeFi project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is gaining momentum after a 20% price surge during its presale, turning heads with a steady stream of new holders and rising investor demand. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is gradually advancing along its roadmap, with preparations underway for its next major upgrade known as Fusaka, expected to go live by late 2025 or in early 2026. This upgrade, which will introduce Verkle trees, is designed to improve network scalability and reduce the burden on nodes — marking another step in Ethereum’s broader roadmap following the recent Pectra upgrade. While ETH moves steadily toward technical refinement, the protocol’s roadmap remains focused on foundational upgrades aimed at boosting efficiency, user experience, and long-term decentralization. These steps, though less headline-grabbing than price action, are essential for maintaining Ethereum’s dominant position in the decentralized application space. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While Ethereum’s update is still on the horizon, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already making moves on the ground. The project has just completed Phase 4 of its presale, with the token price jumping from $0.025 to $0.03 — a 20% increase that reflects accelerating investor interest. Now in Phase 5, Mutuum Finance has already raised nearly $9 million, with its growing community nearing 11,000 holders. With a total of 11 presale phases and a launch price set at $0.06, the token has already doubled in value ahead of listing. This measured progression — backed by steady demand rather than flash marketing — is helping MUTM separate itself from typical low-cap cryptocurrencies still waiting for traction. For those researching the best crypto to buy now, the structure and momentum behind Mutuum make it a standout among new projects. One of the key features behind Mutuum’s traction is its mtToken system. When users deposit supported assets into the protocol (like ETH, USDC, or DAI), they receive mtTokens in return. These tokens are pegged 1:1 to the deposited asset and gradually increase in redeemable value over time, as borrowers pay interest back into the system. Unlike staking or yield farming models that lock assets for long periods, mtTokens remain liquid and transferable. Holders can move them, trade them, or use them in other DeFi environments — all while the underlying value continues to grow. This design offers a simple but powerful incentive to participate in the platform, rewarding users not just for holding, but for contributing to the protocol’s long-term stability. It’s another reason traders looking for top cryptocurrencies are now adding MUTM to their watchlists. A Stablecoin With Built-In Backing Investors are also paying close attention to Mutuum because of its forthcoming overcollateralized stablecoin, set to be minted using surplus collateral held within the protocol itself. This token is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar and will have its supply dynamically adjusted based on user activity. The stablecoin is expected to further increase capital efficiency within the platform, giving borrowers access to a stable medium of exchange while reinforcing the system’s liquidity — all without relying on external reserves or centralized custodians. Its development adds to MUTM’s broader appeal for those seeking crypto to invest in that’s built on strong fundamentals. The team has announced plans to launch a beta version of the platform alongside the token listing, ensuring that core functionality is live from day one. This early usability is a key differentiator in a space where many projects delay their product rollouts until months after token sales. Investor confidence is further supported by the ongoing audit conducted by CertiK, a highly regarded name in blockchain security. While the full results are pending, the process itself signals that the team is committed to transparency and security — two areas that serious backers prioritize when exploring the best cryptocurrency to invest in before it goes public. Ethereum’s roadmap continues to evolve, but the spotlight is already shifting toward newer projects showing immediate progress. Mutuum Finance’s 20% surge, expanding community, and clearly defined use cases have positioned it as one of the most promising crypto coins currently in presale — especially for those looking beyond big-cap headlines. With more presale phases ahead, utilities launching at listing, and growing attention from early backers, MUTM’s current price may not last long. While others wait for future upgrades, Mutuum is already delivering its first steps — and investors are noticing.

Sui-based decentralized exchange Cetus has been exploited, losing more than $200 million. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has broken past the $110,000 mark for the first time. Senators plan to amend GENIUS Act to address Trump family's stablecoin Though a majority of members of the US Senate voted to advance a bill to regulate payment stablecoins on May 20, high-ranking Democrats are planning to propose an amendment to the legislation to address President Donald Trump’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry. According to a May 22 Axios report, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley will file an amendment to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, to block a US president from profiting from stablecoins. The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8. “Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post. Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March. Critics have pointed out that the president could continue to personally benefit from legislation that helps recognize stablecoins like USD1 as financial instruments in the US. Sui DEX Cetus hit by suspected hack: Over $200 million in potential losses Cetus, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain, is suspected to have been hit by a massive exploit that may have drained more than $200 million worth of digital assets. Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” They also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener , showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours. The team behind Extractor, an onchain monitoring tool developed by crypto cybersecurity company Hacken, confirmed that “at least $63m was already bridged to Ethereum, 20k ETH was just transferred to a fresh wallet” in a single transaction . A Hacken representative told Cointelegraph that these findings were confirmed by the company’s Web3 researcher, Yehor Rudytsia. Cetus pool data shows that as of the time of writing, the DEX processed $2.9 billion worth of transactions on May 22, a significant increase over the $320 million reported on May 21. This heightened level of activity may have been caused by funds being siphoned out of the protocol. Cetus did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comments about the suspected exploit. A Sui team representative gave no comment to Cointelegraph regarding the Cetus situation. Some tokens, such as Lombard Staked BTC (LBTC) or AXOLcoin (AXOL) lost most of their value on Cetus. The top 15 losers all lost in excess of three-quarters of their price.

The cryptocurrency had well passed a a peak high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its long-held Jan. 20 peak. Bitcoin has gained around 20% this year and has nearly doubled since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets. Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows it has climbed out of a slump earlier this year. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s continued climb comes as US stock markets were rattled by a weak 20-year bond auction, which sent treasury yields soaring on May 21. The S&P 500 fell 80 points in half an hour while the Nasdaq and Dow Jones mirrored the move, with all US indexes trading down on the day. Caroline Bowler, CEO of the Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said in a note to Cointelegraph that Bitcoin’s continued highs were “driven by institutional-grade infrastructure and stronger regulatory clarity.”",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-22 22:00:26

They are independently organized but perfectly complement the energy and focus of Bitcoin World Sessions: AI, providing valuable chances for networking, learning, and discussion in more intimate settings.

Yet, beneath the surface of this milestone, a dynamic shift is underway. Investors are increasingly drawn to select altcoins that promise not just stability, but transformative returns. Meanwhile, Ethereum and Avalanche remain solid performers, but it’s the early-stage and narrative-driven assets that are commanding the spotlight. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout, drawing attention for its early-stage momentum and potential for outsized returns—making it a top contender for those seeking the next big crypto success story 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon Poised for Explosive Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as the premier presale opportunity of 2025. With over $8 million raised and a listing target of $0.007, the project is drawing both retail and institutional interest ahead of its exchange debut. Analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x from current entry points, with some models pointing to even greater upside if demand remains robust. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out: Scarcity-Driven Model: Capped supply and audited contracts ensure transparency and value preservation. Narrative Strength: A politically charged brand and loyal community are driving organic growth and media traction. Early-Stage Momentum: With Stage 8 nearing completion, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers one of the last ground-floor entry points before public price discovery. Strategic Positioning: The project’s roadmap and token utility are resonating with investors seeking asymmetric returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a strategic early-stage play that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU and DOGE, but with a more transparent and structured approach. Bitcoin: Institutional Surge and Record Highs Bitcoin’s latest ascent is powered by unprecedented institutional inflows, with U.S. spot ETFs attracting billions in fresh capital and major financial institutions expanding their crypto exposure. Analysts forecast that BTC could climb to $116,000–$137,000 in the near term, with long-term models suggesting even higher ceilings if current momentum persists. Yet, as Bitcoin’s rally stabilizes, a growing share of capital is rotating toward altcoins with higher-multiple potential—and MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its presale structure and community-driven growth, is perfectly positioned to capture this wave of interest XRP: Institutional Validation and Price Projections XRP has surged from $1.75 in April to its current range of $2.40–$2.65, buoyed by regulatory clarity and anticipation of new institutional products. Analysts now see a clear path toward $5–$10, with some bullish scenarios targeting $15 or higher if ETF approvals and global adoption accelerate. XRP’s combination of real-world utility and institutional backing makes it a top pick for those seeking both stability and significant upside. While XRP remains a core institutional asset, its upside is increasingly being matched by the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to attract early adopters looking for the next crypto breakout Ethereum: Steady Growth Amid Market Rotation Ethereum trades between $2,550–$2,600 and remains the backbone of decentralized finance and Web3, with ongoing upgrades and institutional adoption supporting its price. However, after a robust rally, ETH’s momentum has moderated, and some investors are shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper returns. With its transparent tokenomics and rapid presale progress, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a compelling alternative for those seeking the next wave of crypto innovation. Avalanche: Institutional Interest and Technical Strength Avalanche is seeing steady adoption and trades averagely at $22, with notable integrations from major institutions and a growing presence in DeFi and gaming. While AVAX is a dependable hold, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. The latter’s aggressive community-led growth and record-setting capital inflows make it the clear choice for investors targeting high-multiple opportunities before listings Solana: Layer-1 Leader, but Momentum Shifts Trading at $170–$175, solana continues to lead among Layer-1 platforms, with strong DeFi usage and developer activity. After a period of rapid appreciation, SOL’s price growth has moderated, prompting some investors to seek higher-multiple opportunities elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its structured presale and clear path to exchange listings, offers a unique chance to participate in a project poised for explosive expansion as the cycle progresses CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Final Thoughts Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally is a landmark event, but the most compelling opportunities may lie elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are capturing the market’s imagination with their unique value propositions and potential for outsized gains. With MAGACOIN’s presale nearing completion and XRP’s institutional momentum building, these assets are poised to lead the next wave of crypto market growth. For investors seeking transformative returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout opportunity of 2025.

According to a new press release , Syed Murtuza Kablazada, 34, of Arlington Heights, Illinois, and Syed Mehdi Hussain, 32, of Carol Stream, Illinois, owned and operated medical labs that submitted fake Medicare claims for COVID-19 test kit reimbursement that were allegedly never provided to beneficiaries. As alleged in court documents, the defendants hired foreign nationals as owners of the labs asking for fraudulent Medicare claims with the plan for them to flee the country once the labs started being investigated. Not only did the labs rarely provide COVID-19 test kits to beneficiaries, but the defendants allegedly went so far as to pay a marketing company to acquire the names of hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries to be used in the fraud. Said Matthew R. Galeotti, Head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, of the purported scheme: “As alleged, the defendants used straw owners at multiple laboratories to cause the submission of more than $200 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare for COVID-19 test kits. Healthcare fraud harms Americans by squandering taxpayer money and diverting limited resources from those who need them most. The Criminal Division will continue to aggressively prosecute these crimes to hold fraudsters accountable, protect victims, and recover financial losses.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Recently, one such crypto whale executed a remarkable maneuver, netting tens of millions in profit from Ethereum while maintaining a substantial position in Bitcoin. Who is This Mysterious Crypto Whale and What Did They Buy? Tracking the movements of a large crypto investor can offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential trends. According to on-chain data shared by Lookonchain on X, a specific whale made a significant move on April 27th. This investor acquired a massive portfolio via over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, ensuring minimal market disruption during the purchase. The acquisition included: 30,000 ETH: Purchased for $54.9 million, averaging out to a price of $1,830 per ETH. 600 BTC: Acquired for $56.94 million, at an average price of $94,900 per BTC. This initial outlay demonstrates the sheer scale of capital deployed by this crypto whale , signaling strong conviction in both Ethereum and Bitcoin at the time of purchase. Cashing In: The Impressive ETH Profit While holding both assets for a period, the whale recently decided to take profits on their Ethereum position. This isn’t just any profit; it’s a staggering gain that highlights the potential returns in volatile crypto markets when timed effectively. The investor sold their entire holding of 30,000 ETH for a total of $78.63 million. Let’s break down the impressive ETH profit : Transaction Amount Price per Unit Total Value Purchase (ETH) 30,000 ETH $1,830 $54.9 million Sale (ETH) 30,000 ETH $2,621 $78.63 million Realized Profit – – $23.73 million This realized gain of $23.73 million represents a return of approximately 43% on the initial ETH investment in a relatively short timeframe. It’s a prime example of a successful crypto trading execution by a large player. The Unsold Bitcoin Holdings: Awaiting Further Gains? Interestingly, despite realizing significant gains on Ethereum, the whale has opted to hold onto their Bitcoin position. The 600 BTC acquired alongside the ETH remain in the investor’s wallet. As of the latest report from Lookonchain, these Bitcoin holdings are currently valued at $66.5 million. Comparing this to the initial purchase price of $56.94 million, the whale is sitting on a substantial unrealized gain of $9.6 million from their BTC position alone. This decision to sell ETH but hold BTC suggests a potentially different outlook or strategy for the two leading cryptocurrencies. Analyzing the Crypto Trading Strategy What can we infer from this crypto trading pattern? Selling ETH while holding BTC could indicate several things: Profit Taking & Risk Management: The whale might have viewed the ETH rally as a good opportunity to lock in substantial profits, perhaps de-risking their overall portfolio while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin, which they might believe has further upside potential. Different Time Horizons: The investor might have had a shorter-term target for ETH and a longer-term view for BTC. Market Signal: While not definitive, such large-scale selling of one asset and holding of another by a significant player is often watched closely by the market for potential signals. This case study provides a fascinating glimpse into the high-stakes world of a large crypto investor navigating the market. What Can We Learn from This Large Crypto Investor? While most individual traders don’t operate on this scale, the actions of a large crypto investor like this whale offer valuable lessons: The Importance of Strategy: This wasn’t a random trade; it involved a large OTC purchase and a strategic sale. Having a plan is crucial. Profit Realization: Knowing when to take profits is just as important as knowing when to buy.
