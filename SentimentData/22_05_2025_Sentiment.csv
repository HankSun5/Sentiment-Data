Trump will host his dinner for more than 200 of his leading memecoin investors, whose money will fill the coffers of the president's own business entities. They've reportedly been invited to his capital-area golf course, the Trump National Golf Club Washington, D.C., outside of which the memecoin buyers may encounter protesters. Some of the counter-programming for his dinner will start earlier in the day in front of the Capitol Building. At 12:45 p.m., Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, will round up other lawmakers in front of the House steps to rail against Trump, accusing him of abusing his White House powers to ""shamelessly promote and profit from a series of crypto ventures tied to himself and his family,"" according to a notice about the event. Waters will also introduce a new messaging bill ""to block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all."" The legislation, which is unlikely to make headway in a Republican-majority Congress, would ban presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress and their families from ""engaging in similar crypto crime."" It's the same type of ban that Democrats had been seeking to insert into crypto legislation, but Republicans have declined to let Trump-targeting language into the current digital assets bills, including the Senate stablecoin effort getting close to the finish line. Later on Wednesday at 2:30 p.m., another press conference of Democratic lawmakers will feature Senators Chris Murphy and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom have been prominent in congressional criticism against Trump's crypto actions. Murphy had introduced his own bill with a similar aim to Waters', the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act to stop federal officials from using their positions to profit from digital assets. That event — also outside the Capitol — will additionally feature Senator Jeff Merkley, who also intends to join an evening protest right outside Trump's golf course, hosted by progressive groups under the banner of Our Revolution . The message of the ""America Is Not For Sale"" rally is to push back on ""a blatant example of political access being sold to the highest bidder,"" according to the group. The guest list for the memecoin dinner hasn't been made public, but analysis of the buying of those coins suggest that the biggest spenders devoted millions for the privilege of joining the president at the event. The attendees' anonymity is part of the problem, according to critics, who say that foreign buyers are gaining access to the president without the knowledge of the public. Debate over the president's crypto ties temporarily delayed progress on the U.S. stablecoin legislation meant to set up rules for domestic issuers, but the bill got back on track this week to clear an important procedural hurdle in the Senate on Monday. Trump's team has downplayed accusations of corruption. White House official Bo Hines said last week at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto that the Trump family's crypto ventures do not pose conflicts of interest, and they have ""the right to engage in capital markets.""

The bill aims to provide clarity and legal protection for blockchain developers and service providers, ensuring they are not misclassified as money transmitters if they don’t handle user funds. Emmer said that the longer Congress delays the clarification, the greater the risk that the digital asset technology is pushed overseas, which will harm American investors and innovators. He believes that the bill provides clarification that will help the U.S. remain a leader in the crypto space. Emmer reintroduces bill to bring regulatory clarity to digital assets Today, @RepRitchie and I introduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act to protect blockchain developers and service providers that never custody consumer funds from unjust government prosecution. pic.twitter.com/nCbpHcpf1Y — Tom Emmer (@GOPMajorityWhip) May 21, 2025 Tom Emmer acknowledged that the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act reflects a thoughtful, bipartisan effort to get crypto policy right. He also revealed that they took feedback seriously from the last Congress , after a similar language was voted down, and returned with a smarter, sharper framework that protects innovation without compromising oversight. The American politician argued that the U.S. should be the global home for responsible innovation, not a place where developers are punished for building open-source software or experimenting with new technologies. “If we want to keep the next generation of builders in the United States, this kind of legal clarity is essential. We cannot afford to let outdated or misapplied regulations drive American talent and technology overseas. With this bill, we protect innovation, uphold civil liberties, and strengthen our global competitiveness in the 21st-century economy.” – Tom Emmer , Majority Whip in the U.S. House of Representatives. Peter Van Valkenburgh, executive director of Coin Center, believes that the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act is the best way to protect American crypto developers and innovators from undue regulation by prosecution. He also noted that recent misapplication of licensing laws has chilled the development of privacy and freedom-enhancing tech in the U.S. Valkenburgh acknowledged that avoiding surprise prosecutions, creating legal clarity, and encouraging free speech and software development are not partisan issues but are core American values, which BRCA codifies. BRCA bill aims to protect digital asset developers Amanda Tuminelli, executive director and chief legal officer of the DeFi Education Fund, said that the bill would protect developers of non-custodial, peer-to-peer software protocols from being unreasonably defined as operators of an unlicensed money service business under the Bank Secrecy Act. She also believes BRCA is an important step in the right direction for the development of digital assets in the U.S. and would deliver much-needed clarity to the builders of the financial future. Blockchain Association Interim CEO and head of policy, Sarah Milby, said the company is proud to support the reintroduction of the bipartisan Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. She mentioned that the bill affirms that innovators building and maintaining decentralized, non-custodial blockchain protocols should not be unfairly treated as financial intermediaries. Cody Carbone, CEO of The Digital Chamber, argued that blockchain developers, miners, and validators aren’t financial institutions but they’re builders. He believes that the bill will finally give them the freedom to build in the U.S. by clarifying that those who never hold customer assets don’t need bank-style licenses. He also urged swift passage and commended Majority Whip Emmer and Representative Ritchie Torres for championing the BRCA bill. Kristin Smith and Miller Whitehouse-Levine of the Solana Policy Institute said they’re proud to support the reintroduction of the bill since it provides the legal certainty blockchain developers and entrepreneurs need to build decentralized networks and the next generation of financial infrastructure in the U.S. Ji Hun Kim, president, and CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, said that the reintroduction of the bill will help ensure that non-custodial blockchain participants are not subject to unnecessary and technologically infeasible compliance burdens that would impede American innovation. Kim believes that the development of digital assets in the U.S. is critical to the U.S.’s national and economic security.

At $22.70, Avalanche is making progress in real world use cases. Meanwhile, another rising project Ruvi AI is getting attention for combining AI with blockchain, and we’re along for the ride. What is Ruvi AI Ruvi AI stands out by combining the power of AI with the security and transparency of blockchain. It’s focused on delivering tools to optimize workflows and decision making across industries like healthcare, logistics and finance. By using blockchain, Ruvi AI ensures its solutions are decentralized, secure and effective for complex tasks. The project has already hit some milestones. Ruvi AI launched its Beta platform, giving users early access to test its features. And it has got its first exchange listing, with more listings coming soon to bring the token to mainstream. Presale Success Story Ruvi AI’s presale was a sign of its strong market demand and potential. In Phase 1, tokens were priced at $0.01 and sold out in 2 weeks. Early investors have already seen a 50% gain in their tokens as the price increased to $0.015 in Phase 2. Experts think Ruvi AI tokens could reach $1 shortly after listing on major exchanges, so this is a great opportunity to get tokens at a discount. Investor Rewards Ruvi AI has a unique VIP rewards system to incentivize long term commitment to the project. Depending on the amount of tokens purchased, investors get bonuses that significantly boost their returns. Here are 3 investment cases: VIP Tier 2 Investing $750 at Phase 2 price of $0.015 per token gets you 50,000 tokens. As a VIP Tier 2 you get an additional 40% bonus and get 20,000 more tokens, so you’ll have 70,000 tokens. At listing price of $0.07, your tokens would be worth $4,900, 553% ROI.* If tokens reach $1, your investment would be $70,000, 9,233% ROI. VIP Tier 3 $1,500 gets you 100,000 tokens and makes you VIP Tier 3 with a 60% bonus. That’s 60,000 more tokens, so you’ll have 160,000 tokens. At $0.07, that’s $11,200, 1,020% ROI. If Ruvi AI reaches $1, that’s $160,000, 10,567% ROI. VIP Tier 5 For higher tier investors, $7,500 gets you 500,000 tokens. With VIP Tier 5 you get a 100% bonus, so your holdings double to 1,000,000 tokens. At $0.07, that’s $70,000, 833% ROI. If the token reaches $1, that’s $1,000,000, 12,233% ROI. These are the juicy opportunities Ruvi AI is offering to committed investors and the project itself. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Contributors To encourage early participation, Ruvi AI has a leaderboard rewards system for its top contributors. Investors who stand out get extra token bonuses: Top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens, worth $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens, worth $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens, worth $7,000 at 0.07 or $100,000 at 1. This is a great way to reward active participants and create a sense of community. This is more than an investment, it’s a solution to real world problems through technology. The Beta launch and exchange listing is just the beginning of what looks to be a big journey.

Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this trend, with on-chain data and analyst commentary confirming high-conviction buying. HBAR and Ethereum remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is now concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. Institutional confidence is rising as retail investors take profits, and forecasts for May call for an average BTC price of $119,798, with potential highs of $136,239 by month’s end. As Bitcoin’s momentum steadies above $100,000, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors looking for the next major wave of upside. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen a surge in whale accumulation as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% allocated to presale, and Hashex-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside if current momentum continues. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading around $2.07, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next resistance levels. As institutional adoption grows and futures products launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. HBAR: Technical Uptrend and Accumulation Hedera (HBAR) is trading between $0.19 and $0.21, showing a bullish structure after completing a five-wave impulse from April lows. Analysts highlight a support zone between $0.139 and $0.170, with targets set at $0.213 to $0.229 in the short term. As HBAR maintains its uptrend, some holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking faster upside before listings. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Whale accumulation is setting the tone for May, with Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge. With a clear listing roadmap, robust demand, and Stage 8 nearly complete, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the month. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

Many new projects release tokens without structure, leaving traders guessing on price. BlockDAG is breaking that pattern with a clear and limited presale model that combines transparency with massive upside. With demand rising and access capped by design, it’s no wonder BlockDAG is being called the top presale crypto by early adopters. So far, the project has raised more than $260 million and sold 20.9 billion coins. With the presale price frozen at $0.0020 until June 13, early backers have a rare chance to secure BDAG at a fraction of its actual value of %0.0262. Batches That Create Urgency & Build Trust BlockDAG isn’t running a typical open-ended coin sale. Its batch-based strategy puts structure into the process and rewards those who act fast. Each presale round is set at a fixed price and increases gradually, unlike dynamic pricing models that create confusion and volatility. This system helps build buyer confidence while also encouraging quick decisions. Currently in batch 28, with that tier priced at $0.0262, BlockDAG still offers a special $0.0020 entry until June 13. This mix of price clarity and urgency is one reason BlockDAG continues gaining ground as the top presale crypto for smart buyers looking for strong upside ahead of exchange listings. Keeping It Fair: Access Without Flooding the Market Many presale cryptos open the gates too wide, causing token oversupply before anything launches. BlockDAG flips that idea. Its model is open to both small and large buyers, but the limited supply in each batch keeps prices under control and demand high. That’s why the sale of 20.9 billion coins hasn’t caused price fatigue. This method of balancing availability and scarcity makes sure everyone has a shot without allowing whales to dominate the supply. That structure is a major reason why BlockDAG has become one of 2025’s most talked-about top presale crypto picks. With real momentum and triple-digit gains before launch, buyers are taking notice of the system behind the growth. 2,520% ROI and a Temporary Price You Can Still Catch In crypto, talk is cheap. What matters most are returns. And BlockDAG is already delivering those, fast. Its batch 1 price has grown over 25x, and thanks to the special $0.0020 offer, new buyers can still lock in that same early advantage until June 13. This isn’t speculation, it’s a live ROI figure backed by real presale traction. The project has already brought in $260 million during its presale alone. Buyers are tracking gains, not guessing. And with the “Go Live reveal” scheduled for June 13, BlockDAG will be announcing listings on 20 major exchanges, including MEXC, LBank, and BitMart. For anyone still waiting, this setup defines what a top presale crypto looks like: real performance, clear targets, and a small window before prices surge again. Key Highlights BlockDAG isn’t just running a presale, it’s rewriting how crypto launches should be done. By sticking to fixed pricing, controlled releases, and time-limited access, the team is creating stability in a space known for chaos. And with the special $0.0020 offer available only until June 13, late-stage buyers still have a rare chance to catch up. So far, the numbers are staggering: $260 million raised, 20.9 billion coins distributed, and a 2,520% ROI already realized by batch 1 holders. But more than the numbers, it’s the method that’s winning buyers over. For those building a high-return portfolio in 2025, BlockDAG is proving to be far more than hype.

SFM price dropped over 5 percent today despite the wider altcoin market following Bitcoin in bullish sentiment. A New York jury convicted Braden John Karony, a former CEO of the SafeMoon (SFM) crypto project, on all crucial charges earlier on Wednesday, May 21. Karony was charged by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. The verdict was a result of a two-week trial that concluded that the ex-Safemoon executives defrauded SFM investors by draining purportedly locked liquidity for their personal gains. The case prosecutor alleged that Karony alongside Thomas Smith, a former Safemoon CTO, and Kyle Nagy, the project’s creator, misappropriated millions of investors’ funds between 2021 and 2022. While Smith has already pleaded guilty to all charges and testified against Karony, Nagy remains a fugitive, allegedly in Russia. Meanwhile, Karony will remain in police custody ahead of his sentencing, with his properties worth over $1.8 million seized. Market Impact on the Safemoon Project The Safemoon project has struggled to regain market share in the recent past following the indictment of the ex-officials. The project dropped in net valuation from nearly $1 billion to about $7.5 million at the time of this writing, according to our latest crypto oracle. Following the announcement on Wednesday, SFM price dropped over 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $0.00002 during the late North American trading session. The Safemoon project has recorded sustained bearish sentiment in the recent past despite the wider altcoin market attempting to follow Bitcoin price in bullish sentiment.

Critics argue the event commodifies political access, allowing wealthy donors, some based overseas, to buy proximity to a U.S. president. The rally, branded “America Is Not for Sale,” will feature speeches from key Democratic figures and visual protests targeting crypto-related political fundraising. A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and activists is set to rally on May 22 in protest of President Donald Trump’s controversial meme coin dinner, raising concerns over political influence and crypto-fueled favoritism. The event, organized under the banner “America Is Not for Sale,” is a direct response to what critics say is the monetization of political access through Trump’s latest crypto initiative. Trump Slammed for ‘Selling Access’ via meme coin The event, held at Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, follows Trump’s announcement that the top 220 holders of his meme coin, $TRUMP, could apply for an exclusive dinner with him. The top 25 are said to qualify for a “VIP White House tour.” Blockchain data shows the token has raised nearly $150 million, with some attendees reportedly spending millions for the chance to meet Trump. Source: Public Citizen Opponents of the event, including members of Congress, say it crosses ethical lines. They claim the president is turning influence into a transaction. “Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” said Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee. Public Citizen is organizing the rally with progressive group Our Revolution. Protesters are expected to display banners reading “STOP CRYPTO CORRUPTION” and enlarged graphics of the $TRUMP coin. Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is scheduled to speak at the rally, alongside several other Democratic figures. According to Our Revolution, some of the coin’s largest holders are based overseas, sparking additional concerns about foreign influence. Crypto industry figures, including Tron founder Justin Sun , Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, are among the known tokenholders expected to attend the dinner. According to the project , all attendees must pass background checks and cannot be from countries flagged by Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance lists. Public Citizen Co-President Robert Weissman echoed those concerns. “Trump’s solicitation schemes for money, gifts, and power are out of control,” he said. “Between his outrageous meme coin grift, his Tesla car show on the White House lawn, and his consideration to accept a gifted jumbo jet from Qatar, Trump’s priority goes to the highest bidder.” Trump Family’s Crypto Links Raise Ethics Concerns, Stall Stablecoin Legislation The dinner has also had political consequences in Washington. For example, some Democratic lawmakers have withdrawn support for crypto-related bills in protest , including the GENIUS Act, a measure focused on regulating payment stablecoins. Though the act passed a key Senate vote on May 19 , several senators voiced concern over Trump’s ties to World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform that launched its own stablecoin, USD1, in March. Critics worry the Trump family’s involvement with the company could present serious conflicts of interest. “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the vote. Senator Chris Murphy, who opposed advancing the GENIUS Act , called for bipartisan efforts to add provisions that would bar a U.S. president from issuing stablecoins. The Senate has a chance – right now – to shut down Trump's biggest crypto coin corruption. The pending bill in the Senate regulates a kind of crypto called ""stablecoin"", but exempts the President from the ethics rules. We shouldn't pass that bill unless that loophole is closed. pic.twitter.com/eHLeCdBV9m — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) May 21, 2025 He also urged the White House to release a full list of dinner attendees, warning that many may be expecting favors in return for their token purchases. Murphy will join Senator Elizabeth Warren and representatives of Public Citizen at a press event on the evening of the dinner. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, is planning a separate press conference on May 22. She is expected to introduce legislation to block Trump’s meme coin and curb what she calls “crypto corruption.” Meanwhile, additional protests are being organized by local Democratic groups, including the Arlington and Loudoun County Democratic Committees. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be,” said Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democrats.

The Brazilian media outlet Livecoins reported that the company will raise funds to buy more Bitcoin as part of its newly established treasury strategy. Earlier this month, Méliuz became Brazil’s first stock market-listed BTC treasury company, s pending almost $28.5 million to buy BTC 274.52 . Méliuz (CASH3) share prices on the Brazilian B3 exchange over the past six months. (Source: Google Finance) Méliuz: Bitcoin Plans in Pipeline The company will continue to buy BTC in the weeks ahead. In a statement, the company declared its intention to raise no less than 150 million real ($26.5 million) on “new BTC acquisitions.” The firm said it had told its shareholders about its intentions and was now “evaluating” its fundraising options. Méliuz CEO Israel Salmen said the company would look to an “issuance of shares or convertible debt” in its search for funding. The firm added that it was working with the São Paulo-based investment banking firm BTG Pactual on its plan. BTG Pactual will act as a coordinator when Méliuz has the funds in place to complete its next BTC purchase. Marcio Loures Penna, Méliuz’s Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Governance, confirmed that the company may issue financial assets “representing debt securities.” These may either be convertible into shares or offered in a non-convertible form, he added. The company may alternatively choose to carry out a primary public offering for common shares, with possible subscription bonuses. Méliuz said that while its goal remains raising 150 million real, it may spend even more “if opportunities arise.” However, the firm warned that its plans remain provisional. It said that it would need to complete an evaluation process before it finalized its next BTC buy. @MeliuzBitcoin #CASH3 announced yesterday that it is evaluating a potential capital raise to expand its Bitcoin strategy, through the issuance of shares or convertible debt. BTG has been engaged to coordinate a potential public offering. — Israel Salmen (@IsraelSalmen) May 20, 2025 When Could Méliuz Make Its Next BTC Purchase? Méliuz also refused to put a timeline on its fundraising efforts or its eventual Bitcoin buy. Earlier this month, the fintech player uveiled details of its first Bitcoin buy, as well as news that its shareholders have “approved, by a wide majority, the transformation of Méliuz into the first listed Bitcoin treasury company in Brazil.” The company currently holds BTC 320.2. Penna added that Méliuz “will keep its shareholders and the market informed of any news” on its next BTC buy. He vowed that the firm would act “in line with best corporate governance practices and in accordance with applicable legislation and regulations.” Méliuz was founded in 2011. Its services include cashback and voucher offerings for online and brick-and-mortar retailers, in addition to the Méliuz credit card. The firm launched a successful $103 million initial public offering on the Brazilian B3 exchange in November 2020.

Coins like XRP and Cardano have dazzled investors with massive rallies and impressive utility stories. It’s easy to get caught up chasing the echoes of these established titans. But history shows us that the truly life-changing gains, the elusive 1000x returns, rarely come from the well-known giants already in the spotlight. Instead, they hide in the shadows, in projects so new that only a few insiders have their eyes on them. If you want to build real wealth in crypto, the smart move is to look beyond yesterday’s winners. The real fortune often lies in pre-exchange tokens, those hidden gems in their infancy. This is where the savvy “smart money” is parking bets, scooping up tokens before the market catches on. And today, we’re pulling back the curtain on one such opportunity. XRP (XRP): Riding High on Waves of Adoption and Anticipation XRP remains one of the crypto market’s heavy hitters . As of May 17, 2025, XRP trades at $2.41 and holds a solid position as the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market cap . Its continued strength is backed by adoption in cross-border payments and a community eager for regulatory clarity. Market forecasts suggest XRP could nearly double, potentially reaching $5.00 within the next four weeks. This optimism stems from ongoing developments and a resurgence of interest in digital payment rails. While XRP’s rise is impressive, its story is well-known and widely priced in by now. Cardano (ADA): The Deliberate Ascent of a Research-Driven Powerhouse Cardano has carved a niche as a research-first blockchain platform focused on security, scalability, and sustainability. At $0.7719 and ranking 9th in market cap , Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem methodically. Analysts project a climb toward $0.9950 over the coming month, fueled by upcoming protocol upgrades and growing DeFi activity on its network. Cardano’s steady, science-backed approach makes it a dependable player, but this slow and steady pace means explosive gains are rarer. The “Off-Radar” Multiplier: Why Pre-Exchange Gems Hold Explosive Potential Here’s the crucial insight: once tokens hit major exchanges, the early explosive growth phases are usually behind them. The crowd has caught on, valuations rise, and the easy gains diminish. The real 1000x plays live in the shadows : projects still in presale or the earliest community stages, where risk is high but rewards are unmatched. These are the tokens still flying under the radar, awaiting discovery by sharp-eyed investors who know where to look. Unveiling the Enigma: Introducing OpenFundNet (OFNT)—The Community’s Best-Kept Secret Meet OpenFundNet (OFNT) , a pre-exchange token quietly building momentum as the next big player in decentralized crowdfunding. While few are talking about it yet, OFNT’s mission is clear: fix the trust, fee, and accessibility problems plaguing traditional crowdfunding by leveraging Web3 technology. Currently in presale or early stages, OFNT offers an unprecedented opportunity to get in before the public stampede. This stealth positioning means early supporters could reap outsized rewards as the platform and token gain visibility. The Anatomy of a Giant Slayer: What Gives OFNT its 1000x DNA? OFNT’s blueprint for massive growth rests on innovative features that solve real-world issues: Validator-Driven Trust: Unlike traditional platforms riddled with opaque vetting, OFNT uses a validator system to score and approve projects. This transparency builds genuine trust and quality control, attracting serious backers. Zero Platform Fees: OFNT’s zero-fe e model means creators receive more funding and backers’ contributions go further. This no-extraction approach is a game-changer in an industry notorious for high fees. Dual Rewards & Emission Engine: The tokenomics reward both backers and validators daily with token emissions. This creates an engaged, sustainable ecosystem fueling continuous growth and participation. The Ground-Floor Window: OFNT’s Presale—Your Entry Before the Public Stampede Here’s where it gets exciting. OFNT has allocated 10% of its total token supply specifically for the presale phase. This limited window is a rare ground-floor chance to secure tokens at favorable terms before they hit major exchanges. Participation is streamlined; early buyers can join using widely accepted cryptocurrencies like USDT. This accessibility ensures that the early community can grow quickly, setting the stage for explosive network effects. Beyond Price Pumps: OFNT’s Vision for a Self-Sustaining Crowdfunding Universe OFNT is more than just a speculative token. Its vision is to build a decentralized, community-governed crowdfunding platform that is self-sustaining and scalable. Governance tokens empower holders to vote on critical platform decisions, ensuring the project evolves with its community’s needs. Combined with deflationary mechanisms like scheduled emission halvings , OFNT’ s design supports long-term token scarcity and value appreciation. This isn’t a flash in the pan; it’s a foundation for lasting impact. The Final Whisper: Position Yourself in OFNT Before the Market Shouts Its Name XRP and Cardano have proven their value, but the real game-changers for exponential gains are hidden pre-exchange tokens like OFNT. This opportunity offers early adopters a shot at massive returns by backing a project built on trust, innovation, and community power. If you’re ready to move beyond the obvious and claim your spot in the future of decentralized crowdfunding , now is the time to research OpenFundNet . Join their growing community channels and get in before the market wakes up to this sleeping giant. The whispers are growing louder; don’t miss your chance before the crowd rushes in.

However, the latest on-chain data reveals that despite elevated unrealized profits, there are still no signs of increased selling pressure for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Unrealized Profits Remain High But No Panic Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by Bitcoin analyst Crazzyblockk, the cohort of new investors – those who have held BTC for less than one month – is currently sitting on unrealized profits of 6.9%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? In the same vein, short-term investors – holders who have held Bitcoin for less than six months – are sitting on unrealized profits of 10.7%. These figures highlight that the unrealized profit/loss ratio remains elevated, with unrealized profits far outweighing unrealized losses. Crazzyblockk noted that while historically, a high percentage of unrealized profits across the network tends to precede sharp price corrections, the current setup appears different. They added: Past cycles have shown that extreme profit concentration tends to precede volatility; however, current market structure shows no outsized concentration of risk in one participant group. The relatively narrow spread in unrealized profits between new and short-term holders indicates that profit distribution is balanced. Furthermore, although profit levels are high, loss levels remain compressed, suggesting limited pressure from distressed sellers. The contributor remarked: While macro conditions and volatility risk remain elevated, and a price correction cannot be ruled out, there is no strong behavioral signal suggesting a high willingness to trigger major distribution or selling. Further Upside For BTC? Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently predicted further upside for Bitcoin. In a post on X, Martinez noted that BTC has undergone another bullish breakout, with the potential to reach a new all-time high (ATH) around $111,500. The current momentum has also drawn in retail investors. According to CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Aleman, wallets holding less than $10,000 worth of BTC are steadily returning to the market – a sign of growing retail participation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cycle Indicator Hints At Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says That said, some warning signs may still dampen BTC’s current bullish trajectory. For instance, despite the recent encouraging price action, Bitcoin’s Demand Momentum remains subdued. Similarly, Bitcoin’s “supply scarcity” narrative still lacks meaningful strength, as Aleman recently stressed that despite depleting exchange reserves, BTC is not likely to face genuine supply scarcity in the near term. At press time, BTC trades at $106,528, up 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges that Ian Patrick Jackson, 37, conspired with another Atlanta man to recruit at least nine business owners to submit fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications using fake tax documents. Jackson allegedly told the business owners to falsely claim they each employed 16 individuals and paid monthly wages of $120,000. The DOJ says the owners then wrote falsified payroll checks to people who didn’t work for them and then either kept the money for themselves or paid Jackson via his co-conspirator. Jackson is allegedly connected to 15 fraudulent COVID-19 relief loan applications that inked $3.39 million in proceeds. He’s the 12th person to be charged in connection with an Atlanta-based PPP fraud ring, with the 11 previous defendants having already pled guilty or been convicted at trial. The DOJ says authorities have recovered nearly $1.2 million of the defrauded funds. Jackson also allegedly applied for a separate $237,500 PPP loan using fabricated tax forms and used a forged driver’s license and false revenue statements to fraudulently apply for approximately $100,000 in PPP and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program loans. The DOJ also says he fraudulently secured another $240,035 PPP loan and $125,000 in EIDL program loans and grants on behalf of another company. Jackson has been charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, two counts of bank fraud, two counts of wire fraud and two counts of money laundering. The charges could result in decades in prison.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano Are Still Considered Major Summer Setups",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/500-into-500k-magacoin-finance-xrp-and-cardano-are-still-considered-major-summer-setups/,"As Bitcoin’s latest rally fuels confidence across the market, investors are scanning for the next wave of altcoins with exponential upside. While BTC dominates the headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects with room to outperform as capital rotates outward. This summer, MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano are emerging as top setups for outsized gains as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity. Still trading under $0.07, the project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. MAGA’s $0.007 listing target and scarcity-driven tokenomics have analysts calling for 34x–40x returns—and some models point to even more extreme upside if current momentum continues. What sets MAGA apart is not just its viral political narrative, but its transparent tokenomics, Hashex audit, and a presale structure attracting both retail and whale capital. As Stage 8 nears completion, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure early exposure before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges. In a market searching for the next SHIBA or DOGE, MAGA’s combination of community energy, clear roadmap, and realistic price targets puts it at the top of many watchlists. XRP: Futures Launch and ETF Buzz XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as the CME Futures launch and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Legal clarity in the U.S. and growing payment adoption have analysts forecasting a move beyond $5 in the short term, with $15–$30 possible if key catalysts align. While a $100 price remains a stretch, the infrastructure being built by Ethereum, Cardano, and new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the real drivers of the next major run. Cardano (ADA): Quiet Accumulation and Summer Breakout Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.85 as of May 2025, with forecasts calling for a steady climb to $1.05 by July and $1.50 by October. Developers have returned, and on-chain metrics are starting to improve. If ADA delivers on upcoming milestones, it could surprise investors with a strong recovery this summer. Many Cardano stakers are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher near-term upside, as ADA’s slow pace gives way to more aggressive early-stage plays. Litecoin and Bitcoin: Steady Anchors, But Seeking Momentum Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $103.77, showing steady accumulation but facing resistance near $105. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $103,000, with May price predictions between $110,000–$115,000 as institutional interest remains strong. While both remain core holdings, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward more nimble early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion As summer kicks off, the 2025 cycle is creating new lanes for growth. XRP and Cardano bring proven value, but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s introducing the kind of high-reward opportunity this market thrives on. With narrative strength, market traction, and investor interest all converging, MAGACOIN FINANCE could still be the next great crypto success story. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

The rising optimism of an altseason amid the re-emergence of FOMO traders will help $B sustain bullish sentiment. A recently launched memecoin on the BSC chain dubbed BUILDon (B) rallied over 150 percent in the last 24 hours to trade above $0.1 on Wednesday, during the late North American trading session. The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $102 million and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $60 million, recorded staggering gains after an endorsement from Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI). According to an X post, the WLFI project purchased an undisclosed amount of $B tokens following its recent move to use the USD1 stablecoin as its base pair. “We just bought some $B to support the BUILDon team. Love seeing projects choose $USD1 as their base pair — faster settlement, deeper liquidity, and growth every day. We hope to see more tokens make the switch,” the announcement noted . What Next for BUILDon Following the WLFI Support The BUILDon memecoin has attracted more than 13k on-chain holders after a net pooled USD1 of over 842k to provide liquidity. The BSC mascot is well positioned to rally further in the coming days amid the rising demand for memecoins following the Bitcoin price pump towards a new all-time high. https://twitter.com/buildonbsc_ai/status/1925314302292238396?s=46 Furthermore, the memecoin culture on the BNB chain has gained significant traction in the recent past following the deliberate decision by Binance to support project developers.

Prosecutors argued that Karony’s actions resulted in the misappropriation of millions of dollars from investors. Following a 12-day trial before US District Judge Eric R. Komitee, Korony was convicted of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. He faces up to 45 years in prison when sentenced. The jury took only a few hours to reach their decision after a trial that lasted about two weeks, during which Karony insisted he was innocent. A jury also ordered the forfeiture of one residential property and the proceeds from the sale of another, amounting to roughly $2 million. According to prosecutors, the scheme undermined investor confidence in digital assets and contributed to broader concerns about fraud in the crypto market. “The SafeMoon digital asset was anything but safe and turned out to be pie in the sky for investors who were deliberately misled by Karony, a man who sought to get rich quick by stealing and diverting millions of dollars,” US Attorney Joseph Nocella, Jr. said in a statement . Jury finds Karony guilty of conspiracy, money laundering, and wire fraud In the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the jury determined that Karony was involved in a conspiracy to defraud the United States, as well as money laundering and wire fraud. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys presented their arguments during the trial that began with jury selection on May 5. The criminal trials against the executive of a cryptocurrency company were widely viewed as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the acting US Attorney for the district, would approach cases of digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump nominee, began serving duty this month. The case began in 2023 with the arrests of Karony, former Chief Technology Officer Thomas Smith, and SafeMoon founder Kyle Nagy. Prosecutors alleged Karony and his “co-conspirators” misled investors about the structure and safety of SafeMoon, a token issued in 2021 that applied a 10% transaction tax on transfers. Half of that fee was purportedly redistributed to token holders, while the remainder was said to be locked in a liquidity pool to support trading. The Justice Department said Karony and others retained access to the liquidity pool and diverted substantial funds for personal use. During the trial, Smith testified against Karony, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and remained at large as of May 21. It was, however, unclear when Karony will be back in court for a sentencing hearing. He could spend over 40 years in prison for his role in defrauding and money laundering activities. On the other hand, Smith, who is said to have agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors, stands to get a lighter sentence. Karony’s trial came after a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York; a judge sentenced him to a 12-year prison term following a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison after going to trial, having previously maintained his innocence. Karony takes to social media to proclaim innocence as trial unfolds Karony turned to social media to defend himself, claiming he was innocent as his trial for fraud and money laundering charges started in New York. This came after he shared an X post on May 6, likely after the court proceedings had concluded for the day. He declared that he was innocent and did not commit fraud in response to news coverage about his trial. The trial, which is expected to last until May 26, has received less media coverage than other crypto cases, like the sentencing of former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Following Karony’s pleading not guilty to charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering, he had been out on a $3 million bond since February 2024. As the public eagerly waits for Karony’s sentencing hearing in court, fear has struck them as this is yet another crypto executive’s involvement in a fraud case. Investors may, therefore, decide to hold back, their investment dragging crypto space development behind.

CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch Before Stage 9 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing serious attention as Stage 8 approaches its final phase, with over $8 million raised and a hard listing target of $0.007. Unlike legacy coins where much of the upside is already priced in, MAGA offers structured scarcity, surging demand, and transparent price discovery. Analysts are projecting a 35x–40x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum continues. Whale allocations, rapid presale sellouts, and a capped 100 billion token supply audited by HashEx are positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity for Q2 and Q3 2025. Bitcoin: Macro Momentum and Whale Accumulation Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, having gained over 14% in the past 30 days and holding well above $100,000 7 . On-chain data shows major wallets accumulating, with ETF inflows stabilizing and analysts forecasting a plausible rally toward $150,000 if current trends hold. As Bitcoin’s macro narrative strengthens, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefitting from increased capital rotation. XRP: Derivatives, ETFs, and Global Settlement XRP is trading at $2.35, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. The launch of CME futures and growing ETF speculation are fueling institutional interest, while legal clarity and Ripple’s expanding partnerships are setting the stage for XRP to serve as a global settlement infrastructure asset. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end, with $15 as a stretch target if ETF adoption accelerates. As institutional flows grow, many investors are also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside. Solana: Whale Accumulation and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $169.25, up 1.84% in the last 24 hours, and has rebounded over 50% from recent lows. Whale accumulation is accelerating, with large wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges and analysts now eyeing the $200 level as a short-term target. While $1,000 remains a bold call, Solana’s bullish momentum is undeniable, but the most aggressive capital is also moving into MAGACOIN FINANCE for earlier, higher-multiple potential. NEAR Protocol: Quiet Growth and Breakout Potential NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is trading at $2.76, up 1% in the past 24 hours. Its developer ecosystem and integrations are expanding, but NEAR still lags the market leaders in momentum. As capital seeks undervalued networks, many NEAR holders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Smart capital is converging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin as the top altcoin picks for the 2025 bull run. With Stage 8 nearly full, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

The Australian Securities and Investment Commission said on May 21 that it wants to ask the High Court of Australia to clarify what the definition of a financial product is and clarify the circumstances when an interest-earning product and the conversion of assets from one form to another are regulated. “The definition of financial product was drafted in a broad and technology-neutral way, and ASIC believes it is in the public interest to clarify this,” the watchdog said. “This clarification is important as it applies to all financial products and services whether they involve crypto-assets or not.” On April 22, Federal Court Justices David O’Callaghan, Wendy Abraham and Catherine Button found that Block Earner’s crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product is not a financial product , a managed investment scheme or a derivative under the Corporations Act. ASIC said the court will consider its application. Special leave is required in an appeal to the High Court, and it’s only granted in cases where it would answer significant legal questions or matters of public interest. A Block Earner spokesperson told Cointelegraph the matter has now escalated to a “broader legal question” around the definition of a financial product, which extends “well beyond Block Earner, and the crypto sector.” “We believe the Full Federal Court’s April ruling was a strong and well-reasoned decision that upheld the integrity of our operations,” the spokesperson said. “We remain confident in the soundness of that judgment and will respond to ASIC’s application through the appropriate legal channels.” Legal saga ongoing since 2022 ASIC first launched legal proceedings against Block Earner in November 2022, arguing the company needed a financial services license to offer its yield product, which was available from March 17, 2022, until the company shut it down on Nov. 16, 2022. Related: Australia outlines crypto regulation plan, promises action on debanking ASIC was arguing Block Earner needed a financial services license to offer its crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product. Source: ASIC In February 2024, an Australian court initially ruled the fintech firm would need a financial services license to operate its crypto yield-bearing products . Another June 2024 ruling in Australia’s Federal Court released Block Earner from any financial penalties because it had “acted honestly” and pursued its legal opinions before launching the products, which ASIC appealed. Block Earner appealed the Federal Court’s decision that it needed a financial services license on July 9, 2024.

As one of the top cryptocurrencies in the market, SOL’s momentum is hard to ignore, but its already-high price point has some investors searching elsewhere for more explosive upside. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a cheap crypto with analysts projecting a possible surge to $5, and potentially even faster than Solana can get to $500. Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale offers tokens at a price of $0.03 per unit. Acquisition by more than 11,000 presale buyers has produced a robust investor backing that has raised $9 million. Buyers of Mutuum Finance Phase tokens during this phase get 100% profit at the projected $0.06 launch price. For those asking what crypto to buy now with high ROI potential, this low-price altcoin might just be the unexpected frontrunner of 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: Path to $500 Still Intact Solana (SOL) is also cementing its position as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, as analysts forecast a push higher to $500 during this bull run. SOL is currently trading at approximately $170 and is riding a high of new developers’ activity, DeFi integration, and meme coin resurgence, all of which are restoring investors’ confidence. The anticipation of a Solana ETF also fuels the speculation that SOL will hit this ambitious price level sooner or later. As institutional interest grows and on-chain metrics persist in strengthening, Solana remains a core holding for those seeking exposure to blue-chip altcoins. Some traders are turning to lower-priced alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for even greater upside, though. Mutuum Finance Presale The project has surpassed a significant milestone as its presale accumulates more than $9 million from participants who have exceeded 11,000 in number. Since Phase 5 initiation the MUTM token value has increased to $0.03 and will steadily grow up to launch at $0.06. Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish direct loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P model because this system represents a superior way of managing assets. Users benefit from automated security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. Strategic Growth & Community Rewards The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing (staking rewards) mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings of new exchanges will improve inter-user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its first users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the most aggressively backed presale tokens of 2025, with over $9 million raised and more than 11,000 investors already onboard. Currently priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, MUTM is on track to hit $0.06 at launch, offering early buyers a projected 100% return before public trading even begins. Secure your position before the next price jump, or risk watching one of 2025’s biggest gainers take off without you.

In contrast, Pi Network (PI) is struggling with a sharp 35% price drop, raising concerns over liquidity and market confidence. While these events unfold, Web3 ai ($WAI) remains focused on growth, positioning itself for future success. Web3 ai is progressing through Stage 5 of its presale for $0.000365. The confirmed listing price of $0.005242 suggests a potential 1747% return. The project features an AI-powered DeFi Yield Farming Advisor, which offers real-time risk assessment and return optimisation. This tool aims to simplify complex farming decisions, making it a reliable choice for those seeking to secure value in the volatile crypto space. XRP’s Whale-Fueled Rally Raises Market Expectations XRP has reached a two-month high, driven by large-scale wallet transactions involving millions of coins. Analysts believe these movements suggest whales may be positioning themselves for a larger market shift. XRP’s price surged beyond previous resistance levels, signalling strong upward momentum. Despite ongoing regulatory concerns, the recent price spike has attracted short-term traders, as whale transactions often signal upcoming market shifts. As large holders consolidate their positions, the rising interest in XRP might indicate a potential buying opportunity, particularly if this momentum persists, making it an asset to monitor closely. Pi Network Faces Volatility After 35% Drop Pi Network’s coin recently saw a sharp 35% drop, adding to the price volatility. The coin had previously experienced a rally, but the quick sell-off following that increase has raised doubts about its long-term stability. Speculation suggests that early holders might be cashing out, contributing to the price decline. This has led to concerns about the network’s liquidity and overall stability. Despite these issues, Pi Network’s large user base and active development efforts still keep it in the spotlight. While the risk remains high, there may still be opportunities for a price rebound if it stabilises. Web3 ai’s DeFi Yield Farming Advisor Sets It Apart from Market Volatility DeFi farming can deliver high rewards, but it also carries significant risks. Without effective risk management, buyers may face quick losses. Web3 ai addresses this issue with its AI-powered DeFi Yield Farming Advisor, designed to help buyers navigate the complexities of yield farming. The tool that would be functional at launch monitors farming pools, smart contracts, and market shifts in real time, reducing the likelihood of costly mistakes. Unlike platforms that only show annual percentage yields (APYs), Web3 ai provides a detailed overview of farming opportunities. It analyses risks and rewards, enabling more informed and strategic decisions. The tool would work seamlessly in the background, so buyers can benefit without needing to constantly track their assets. Currently, the WAI coin is available in Stage 5 of the presale at $0.000365. The expected listing price of $0.005242 offers a potential return of 1747%. With over $4.5 million raised, Web3 ai is gaining traction and positioning itself as an essential tool for those looking to navigate DeFi farming with confidence. This AI-driven platform is designed to help buyers take advantage of the opportunities within DeFi farming while avoiding the risks that often come with it. The combination of real-time monitoring and comprehensive insights makes Web3 ai a valuable addition to any DeFi strategy. Conclusion XRP whale activity and Pi Network’s volatility may generate short-term excitement, but they fail to offer lasting user value. XRP’s price rise, fueled by whale transactions and Pi Network’s erratic behaviour, highlights how sentiment can shift quickly in the crypto market. In contrast, Web3 ai brings real long-term value through its AI-powered DeFi Yield Farming Advisor. This tool, set to launch with the platform, will help users manage risk and maximise returns, offering practical, ongoing utility. Currently priced at just $0.000365 in Stage 5 and aiming for a $0.005242 listing, Web3 ai presents a strong 1,747% ROI opportunity. With over $4.5 million already raised, market confidence is clearly growing, positioning Web3 ai as a reliable asset with long-term potential.

44930324,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=755951,1747875610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/44930324.jpeg,Solana’s BONK Targets 77% Corrective Move After Retrace To 200 EMA,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bonk/bonk-target-77-corrective-move/,"BONK’s price action has been back and forth in May, and the cryptocurrency is now essentially back where it started the month. Recent price action reveals that the token is attempting to stabilize at around the 200 EMA after being rejected by the local high near the 0.00002581 level. This rejection led to a measured pullback towards $0.00001820. However, according to a technical analysis on the TradingView platform, the retrace appears to be forming a bullish continuation setup with a 77% corrective move in view rather than indicating a bearish reversal. Bullish Market Structure Holds Firm For BONK BONK’s price retracement has brought it directly into a zone of heavy technical interest. At the heart of this confluence lies the 200 EMA on the 4-hour timeframe, which could technically serve as the next support zone for the meme coin moving forward. In addition, the retracement aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is commonly associated with bullish corrections. It also aligns with a daily support zone around $0.00001832 to $0.00001841 and a resistance zone around $0.00002034. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin, Analyst Says Solana Meme Coin “BONK” Is About To Explode Interestingly, this movement has led to a consolidation between these levels since May 15, and according to the TradingView analyst, the price structure suggests buyers are stepping in to defend the trend. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a higher low. From a volume standpoint, each upward impulse has shown rising volume since the first week of April. However, the recent decline occurred on diminishing volume, hinting at exhaustion from sellers. 77% Upside Move If BONK Breaks Above Resistance Even with the current range, BONK is still within a bullish setup that could send it towards a new 2025 high and possibly towards its current all-time high levels. The important level to watch now is the point of control (POC) resistance at approximately $0.00001955. This level previously acted as the pivot point before the pullback and now serves as the threshold for bullish continuation. Related Reading: This Dogecoin Rival Is Set For An Over 100% Pump – It’s Not Shiba Inu A confirmed close above this region would likely trigger a rapid expansion move toward the next resistance cluster around $0.00002581, before eventually reaching the predicted price target of $0.00003243, which would bring it close to its January 2025 open of $0.000035. As such, the projected target if this plays out will translate to a 77% rally. The price target also aligns with a previous swing high on January 15 and January 18. At the time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.00001995, up by 1,6% in the past 24 hours. Its reaction here, just above the POC resistance, will be an important deciding factor. If buyers manage to maintain pressure and secure a decisive breakout, the stage could be set for a strong rally into the upper resistance band and a retest of BONK’s 2025 swing high.

Ethereum Trading Outlook Softens & Pepe Meme Trend Grows",https://thecoinrise.com/unstaked-presale-to-bring-2700-roi-for-buyers-ethereum-trading-outlook-softens-pepe-meme-trend-grows/,"In today’s changing crypto environment, Ethereum (ETH), Pepe (PEPE), and Unstaked are each drawing attention for different reasons. While the Ethereum trading outlook hints at a short-term drop, despite a 60% rally in the past month, the Pepe (PEPE) meme trend is gaining momentum, almost doubling in value in 30 days, thanks to its viral appeal. But beyond price spikes and volatility, Unstaked is positioning itself differently. Backed by a real utility model and AI-powered tools, Unstaked has already raised over $6.5 million and is advancing quickly through its Stage 13 AI presale, currently priced at just $0.009267. This may be the beginning of something built to last. Pepe’s Price Push Continues Pepe Coin has soared nearly 98% in 30 days, pushing its market cap above $5.7 billion and making it one of the biggest meme coins right now. Trading at $0.0000136, it enjoys strong liquidity and a loyal community. While some technical indicators suggest it might be overbought, analysts still see potential for PEPE to reach $0.000033 by June. Ethereum Trading Outlook Hints at Pullback Ethereum is currently trading at $2,564, showing a 3% gain over the past day and a 60% jump in the last month. Despite that strength, analysts believe a pullback could be on the horizon. Some are forecasting a dip to $2,258 by May 17, a potential 11.6% decline. Still, the Ethereum trading outlook remains mostly positive overall. ETH’s RSI is at 78.92, which indicates it might be overbought in the short term, but many indicators show strength. ETH continues to trade above its 200-day average, and the Fear & Greed Index is reading “Greed,” a sign that optimism is still widespread. For long-term holders, a price correction could be an ideal entry point before Ethereum’s next potential leg up. Unstaked’s AI Ecosystem Offers Real Value and 2,700% ROI Potential Unstaked is not riding trends, it’s building tech. At the heart of its platform is an AI-powered system that allows users to launch autonomous agents across social platforms like X, Telegram, and Discord. These agents engage, post, manage communities, and help execute tasks in real time. What makes Unstaked different is its Proof of Intelligence system. Every action by an agent is tracked on-chain, turning real engagement into real earnings. Instead of just holding tokens, users power AI agents that deliver measurable results. With a current price of $0.009267 in Stage 13 and an estimated launch price of $0.1819, this AI presale offers a possible 2,700% return. Unstaked has already raised over $6.5 million across 13 presale batches. Its $1 million giveaway adds to the momentum, with 20 winners set to receive $50,000 each.

While Solana, Bitcoin, and XRP continue to dominate the top tier, one new contender is rapidly capturing trader attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 now live, over $8 million raised, and whale inflows accelerating, traders from across the ecosystem—including major Solana and Bitcoin holders—are pivoting toward what’s now ranked as one of the most explosive breakout candidates of Q2 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Driver Fueling Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin is holding strong at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC since mid-April. Institutional inflows and ETF demand remain robust, with May price forecasts calling for an average of $121,351 and potential highs of $137,264. As BTC consolidates above $100K, capital is flowing into high-upside altcoins—MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the top of that list for traders seeking the next 10,000% run. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The #1 Breakout Entry of the Moment MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen a surge in whale accumulation as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% in presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025. Analysts forecast 35x–185x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside if current momentum continues. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3. With Stage 8 nearly full and listings approaching, this is the entry window to watch. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading at $2.07, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next resistance levels. As institutional adoption grows and futures products launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. Solana: Whale Buying and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $166.71, consolidating after a sharp rally and drawing attention from large investors. Whale accumulation is on the rise, with major wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges in recent days. Analysts are targeting $200 as the next major resistance, but many are also rotating into presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater potential returns. Ethereum and Aptos: Quiet Accumulation, Early-Stage Rotation Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, rebounding from recent lows and showing renewed technical strength. With DeFi growth and ETF speculation, ETH is poised for a potential breakout toward $2,750–$2,900 in the coming months. Aptos (APT) is also seeing quiet accumulation, but as capital seeks sharper upside, more traders are rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts Bitcoin and Solana whales are moving first, but XRP traders are quickly following as MAGACOIN FINANCE cements itself as 2025’s most-watched presale. With robust demand, a clear listing roadmap, and analysts projecting 35x–185x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

33767162,[object Object],1747877435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Makes Meaningful Correction: Key Pullback Pattern Points To Looming Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-meaningful-correction/,"Popular dog-themed meme coin, Dogecoin , may have witnessed a bearish performance in the last few days, but this waning price action could benefit its price dynamics. Technical developments show that the current pullback is a signal of an impending major rally in DOGE’s price. Bullish Structure Forming On Dogecoin Chart After a period of bullish performance, Dogecoin’s price experienced a retracement , which led to a correction or consolidation phase. However, recent analysis from Trader Tardigrade, a seasoned crypto analyst and investor, reveals that the correction phase is about to come to an end, and a rally is just around the corner. In the analysis shared on the X platform, Trader Tardigrade stated that DOGE is gearing up for a major rise as a key technical pattern emerges on the daily chart, a typical sign of a possible uptrend. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is currently consolidating within this key structure, often associated with trend continuation after cooling off from recent highs. Specifically, the meme coin has formed a Channel Pullback. Combined with stable support levels and rising market sentiment, this channel formation raises the possibility that DOGE is preparing for a significant rise in the upcoming days. Looking at the chart, this channel pullback previously appeared between late April and early May. Following a breakout from the pattern, Dogecoin saw a notable rise from $0.17 to $0.25 in less than a week. With the structure reappearing, the expert contends that a breakout , which he believes is inevitable, is likely to trigger a similar upward trend. Should the breakout mirror the previous scenario, Trader Tardigrade has predicted a surge from current price levels to the $0.265 mark. DOGE’s reclaiming this level in tandem with significant buying pressure might act as a launchpad to a continued rally toward higher targets . Dogecoin’s bullish signal extends beyond the 1-day chart. In another post , Trader Tardigrade highlighted a growing momentum in the 3-day time frame, which increases the potential for a rebound. Following his examination of the 3-day chart, the expert found an Expanding Triangle formation, a key reversal pattern after a widening consolidation phase . Given that the market is slowly turning positive, a breakout from the pattern is expected to cause a rally to $0.275 and beyond. A Remarkable Price Growth For DOGE Incoming A view of a much larger time frame shows that DOGE’s price is headed for a new all-time high before the ongoing cycle concludes. Trader Tardigrade has underlined the recurrence of a bullish structure that triggered a massive bullish move for the meme coin on the 6-month time frame. During the 2017 and 2021 cycles, this macro pattern kick-started DOGE’s final rally all the way to its peak in each cycle. While the structure has reemerged, Trader Tardigrade foresees a similar spike that could lead to a cycle top for Dogecoin. The expert chart reveals that the meme coin might reach a top from the $6 level and above.",Dogecoin|Consolidation Phase|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Expanding Triangle Formation|Macro Pattern|meme coin|Pullback Channel Pattern|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-22 01:30:35

The VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund is expected to launch in June 2025. It will direct strategic capital to companies with real-world use cases issuing tokens on the Avalanche network. Unlike many crypto funds that pursue hype or short-term momentum, this is a fund that looks over the horizon. It aims to support mission-driven entrepreneurs building lasting value through blockchain-enabled technology. It goes after companies launching tokens with actual utility — not just speculation. The fund will make liquid token investments and early-stage venture-backed blockchain projects, focusing on areas like gaming, financial services, payments , and AI. Most investments will be made at or soon after the project’s Token Generation Event (TGE), when their tokens are first offered to the public. It’s VanEck’s play to back founders who are building for the future, not a quick pump. VanEck’s experienced team drives focused investment The team that runs the VanEck Digital Assets Alpha Fund (DAAF) will co-manage the fund . Since 2022, DAAF has garnered a reputation for investing in scalable liquid tokens associated with real-world products. And with more than $100 million in AUM, DAAF is one of the most steady performers in digital assets. This new fund builds on that success but focuses exclusively on the Avalanche network. Avalanche is now one of the most active and valuable blockchain ecosystems , with a market worth nearly $50 billion. It is recognized for its high speed, low costs, and a growing list of enterprise and decentralized applications. VanEck sees Avalanche as a hub for serious developers creating projects beyond crypto speculation. These builders are focusing on real-world sectors like fintech, real-world assets (RWAs), and artificial intelligence (AI). Capital in the bank will get put to work on-chain via Avalanche-native RWA products such as tokenized money market funds. This maintains the fund’s liquidity and supports economic activity on the Avalanche blockchain. Fund backs builders adding tangible value The PurposeBuilt Fund is about more than just capital — it’s about conviction. “The next wave of value in crypto will come from real businesses, not more infrastructure,” says Pranav Kanade, portfolio manager at VanEck Digital Assets. He thinks Avalanche has already become a beacon for intelligent founders, and the PurposeBuilt Fund hopes to offer them the financial underpinning and subsequent ongoing refuge they require. The crypto market frequently rewards short-term trends and meme coins. Yet, the founders of valuable blockchain applications often draw less attention. These earnest builders run uphill, contending for attention and capital in a noisy market. The PurposeBuilt Fund aims to change that. It provides an alternative source of patient capital that matches long-term aims. It gives developers & startup teams a framework to build for utility, adoption & longevity rather than pump-n-dump token price action. According to John Nahas, Chief Business Officer at Ava Labs, the launch of the VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund marks a turning point for the blockchain industry. He said the industry is shifting from “reality distortion to reality,” emphasizing that the focus is moving away from theoretical discussions about the technology’s potential and toward what is being built and used—and by whom. Nahas noted that the sector is evolving from one dominated by day traders to one that recognizes the true value of distributed trust. He added that the VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund provides the long-term capital and strategic support builders need to lead this transformation. Avalanche already hosts projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, AI, tokenized securities, and institutional finance. These apps are not only being adopted by the crypto native but also by traditional businesses and web2 platforms.

ProCap had boosted its IPO from $200 million to $220 million on May 20, a day before its public launch, pricing its 22 million shares on offer at $10 each. ProCap shares closed the May 21 trading day up 7% at $10.70, which continued with a 1.6% bump after-hours to $10.87, Yahoo Finance data shows. PCAPU’s share price closed up 7% on its debut trading day. Source: Yahoo Finance The company has offered underwriters a 45-day option to buy up to 3.3 million additional shares at the IPO price to cover extra demand. ProCap said in an April 30 regulatory filing that the firm will be a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) that will look to invest in, and potentially take public, companies in the financial services, digital asset, asset management or healthcare sectors. Pompliano is one of the crypto industry’s biggest cheerleaders , hosting a Bitcoin and finance-focused podcast and leading investment firm Professional Capital Management. Pompliano told CNBC on May 21 that he had been itching to take a company public over the last five years but hadn’t seen enough demand in the private market until six months ago, citing recent changes to the US regulatory landscape affecting financial markets. Related: Texas House passes strategic Bitcoin reserve bill He hinted that his blank-check firm would invest in crypto-native and traditional finance businesses as he expects the sectors to converge in the coming years. “The reason why I use the term financial services is basically the new digital world and the old incumbent world are all merging.” SPACs haven’t been done right in the past, Pomp says On CNBC, Pompliano was pressed on why he chose to make ProCap a SPAC, which have historically seen high failure rates due to sponsor conflicts, dilution, speculative valuations and regulatory scrutiny. Pompliano said SPACs have gotten a bad reputation because companies often treat them like public venture capital, targeting high-growth companies that are losing a lot of money at high valuations. Pompliano noted he has put “millions of dollars” of his own money on the line. “We’ve got real skin in the game,” Pompliano said, adding: “I’m taking a huge reputation risk.” Brent Saunders, CEO of health products firm Bausch + Lomb, also joined as a strategic adviser . Saunders completed over $300 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions over the last 17 years.

Thirty-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields catapulted to 3.15% this week, eclipsing every prior high since the tenor’s 1999 debut. That print triggered an instant warning from the markets newsletter The Kobeissi Letter: “Japan’s bond market is imploding… Japan’s 30Y Government Bond Yield has officially surged to its highest level in history, at 3.15%. For decades, Japan was known for low long-term interest rates. Now they are dealing with high inflation, shifting policy outlook, and a whopping 260% Debt-to-GDP ratio.” Liquidity, always fragile at the long end of Tokyo’s curve, vanished just hours later. From New York, Zerohedge relayed traders’ disbelief: “This is unbelievable: for the second day in a row, Japan’s bond market is bidless, with both 30Y and 40Y JGB yields at record highs. Meanwhile, as the world’s 2nd biggest bond market is imploding, the BOJ is pretending nothing is happening.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top Inside the Diet, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba delivered a stark political gloss: Japan’s fiscal plight, he conceded, is now “worse than Greece,” a phrase that would have been unthinkable during the deflationary 2010s. That assessment lands just as gross public debt pushes toward 260% of GDP and as Japanese investors—who still hold roughly $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries—contemplate selling overseas paper to shore up domestic books. Why This Is Ultra-Bullish For Bitcoin For Bitcoin analysts, the chain of causality is brutally clear. Pseudonymous macro voice Stack Hodler wrote to his followers: “Everyone expects Yield Curve Control. But Japan already tried YCC and look at what it got them—a spectacular bond-market implosion happening right in front of us. Now every Japanese bank, pension fund, and insurance company that trusted the Bank of Japan is holding a massive bag of flaming excrement… If this is the end result of YCC, why would any rational investor hold sovereign debt from severely indebted nations? Central-bank credibility is shattering in real time. Scarce neutral reserve assets—Bitcoin and gold—need to be repriced dramatically higher.” Dan Tapiero, founder of the $3.9 billion digital-asset vehicle 10T Holdings, reached much the same conclusion in fewer words: “Quietly…and off the radar…the Japanese long-bond yields are going parabolic. Time to watch Japan…Unsustainable deficits have been the norm for 30 yrs…Now a problem. Very bullish gold and Bitcoin.” The systemic-risk argument tightens further when one zooms out to the global balance sheet. Author Bruce Florian frames the macro math as musical chairs with a finite number of safe havens: “There are three times more debts than GDP, and interest rates are twice as high as economic growth… It’s like a game of musical chairs. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Fate May Be Sealed On June 9, Analyst Warns Everyone knows there are fewer chairs than players.” Florian highlights the feedback loop linking Tokyo and Washington: “The biggest buyer of US debt has been Japan… But this customer is now in financial trouble… There’s a high chance Japan will sell some of these bonds to stabilize its own situation… In a year when the USA needs to refinance $8 trillion, what happens if no buyers show up? The Fed will monetize the debt.” The punch line, he insists, is Bitcoin: “Bitcoin is shifting from a ‘nice-to-have’ asset to a must-have asset… In a world of unlimited debt, scarcity is the most radical form of reason.” Wall Street heavyweights are edging toward the same territory. JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon told investors on Monday, “I’m not a buyer of bonds. The risks are too high.” Ray Dalio wrote that the greater default risk now lies in “currency debasement,” not in missed coupons. And Larry Fink, whose firm’s spot-Bitcoin ETF has absorbed more than $31 billion since January, said on Fox Business that Bitcoin is “an international asset” fit for times when “countries devalue their currencies.” BTC Price Responds Bitcoin’s price action is responding in real time. BTC rose to $107,322 at press time, less than 4% shy of its halving-cycle high. None of this proves that Bitcoin is destined to replace sovereign debt, but the directional shift in marginal flows is no longer hypothetical. When the second-largest bond market on earth shows two consecutive bidless sessions and its prime minister compares the country to Greece, capital chases the assets whose supply cannot be printed. Bitcoin, engineered for hard-cap scarcity, slots neatly into that vacuum. Whether this is the moment sovereign debt loses the mantle of “risk-free” remains to be seen. What is indisputable is that the implosion of Japan’s ultra-long JGBs has handed Bitcoin its clearest macro tail-wind since 2020’s pandemic-era liquidity flood—except this time the narrative is not emergency stimulus but the dawning realization that even advanced nations are running out of balance-sheet room. For a growing cohort of investors, the word bond is beginning to rhyme less with safety and more with risk, while Bitcoin is rhyming—loudly—with insurance.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum Are Leading Trader Buy Lists",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/new-breakout-favorite-magacoin-finance-xrp-and-ethereum-are-leading-trader-buy-lists/,"As May 2025 unfolds, conviction-driven capital is flowing into a new set of crypto leaders. From institutional buyers to early-stage speculators, the spotlight is now on four tokens: Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA), and TRON (TRX). Each brings a distinct edge—macro leadership, payment utility, early-stage asymmetric potential, and high-throughput infrastructure. But for those seeking the biggest ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the most aggressively positioned altcoin in the space. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Backed for Major Returns MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly emerged as one of the top early-stage altcoins of 2025, with analysts calling it a rare opportunity for 20x–35x returns before listings begin. With Stage 8 live, over $8 million raised, and a fixed listing target of $0.007, MAGA’s blend of political branding, scarcity-driven 100 billion token supply, and Hashex-audited contracts is fueling massive momentum. As Stage 8 accelerates, those entering now are acting on a clear risk-reward model, not just hype. With listings approaching, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly ranked as the #1 altcoin presale for 2025, and analysts say 35x–50x returns are possible as demand surges. XRP: Utility, Legal Clarity, and Institutional Momentum XRP is staging one of the strongest comebacks in crypto history, trading at $2.38 as of May 21, 2025. With full legal clarity in the U.S. and a CME futures launch on the horizon, XRP is being positioned as the primary settlement and liquidity token for global financial institutions. Technical indicators suggest a bullish continuation, with analysts forecasting a move to $3 and beyond as volume and institutional interest grow. Ethereum: Technical Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,593.53, up 1.66% in the past 24 hours and showing strong performance after a 50% rally in the past month. As the cornerstone of DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 innovation, Ethereum’s rising institutional interest and rapid Layer-2 adoption continue to bolster its outlook. Analysts expect ETH to push toward $3,000–$4,000 if support holds, with long-term targets even higher. Bitcoin: Macro Anchor as Capital Rotates Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $107,438, up 1.33% in the last 24 hours and maintaining its position above $106,000 after a strong May rally. While BTC remains the macro anchor and foundation for the market, capital is rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ethereum as traders seek sharper returns. TRON: High-Throughput Utility and Steady Growth TRON (TRX) is trading at $0.27, with analysts forecasting a stable range for May and June 2025. TRON’s consistent throughput and low fees make it a favorite for payment corridors and DeFi applications. As speculative capital rotates, many TRX holders are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper early-stage upside. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion The smart money in May 2025 is moving with conviction—rotating into tokens with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the foundation, XRP and TRON offer scale and utility, but MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the strategic early entry for those seeking life-changing returns. With Stage 8 heating up and listings on the horizon, this could be the defining moment to secure a position before the next wave begins.

The previous peak for Bitcoin ( BTC ), reached during President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, was surpassed in late morning trading, according to crypto.news data. The buying momentum sustained after U.S. equity markets closed with the largest cryptocurrency by market cap pushing above $110,000. Bitcoin has gained more than 4.5% in the past 24 hours and over 23% in the last month, reflecting a sharp reversal from April’s downturn.

Since late April, the S&P 500 has climbed 15%, while the Nasdaq is up more than 21%. Analysts attribute the bounce to growing optimism that President Trump’s trade policies may be less aggressive than initially feared. After introducing steep tariffs in early April—including a blanket 10% import tax and additional penalties for Chinese goods—the White House signaled a partial retreat . A 90-day pause on the most severe measures was announced last week by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent following negotiations with Chinese officials. Bitcoin initially fell to a two-month low of $76,000 shortly after Trump unveiled the tariffs, reflecting market fears over a broader global slowdown. Despite Bitcoin’s reputation as a hedge against traditional financial assets, it often trades in tandem with risk-on equities, especially tech stocks.

Enclave Markets CEO Phil Wirtjes said the rally was “likely aided by policy advancements,” particularly bipartisan progress on stablecoin legislation . A draft bill that would establish clearer rules for USD-backed digital tokens has gained traction in the Senate. Institutional demand has also picked up. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $329 million in inflows over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s latest rally raises questions about how much of its performance is driven by macro versus crypto-native factors. While regulatory clarity and ETF inflows are key tailwinds, the correlation with stocks suggests that investor appetite for risk remains a dominant force in both arenas.

During an interview on Wednesday , David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s top crypto and artificial intelligence advisor, made the bold prediction. “If we provide the legal clarity and legal framework for this, I think we could create trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight, very quickly.” Sacks said in an interview . The targeted legislation is the GENIUS Act, which is short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins. It would seek to establish federal standards for how stablecoins are originated and governed. This week, the bill passed a key test in the US Senate on a 66-32 cloture vote. This means it has cleared the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster. Fifteen Democrats sided with Republicans in endorsing the measure — a testament to unusual bipartisan support. Under the bill, stablecoin issuers must hold reserves to cover every token they put into circulation. Those reserves must be easily accessible and safe assets, such as cash or US Treasury bonds. The idea is to make sure stablecoins remain exactly that: stable. David Sacks described the bill as “a national economic strategy” that would strengthen the US dollar in the internet industry. He said stablecoins provide a new, more efficient, cheaper, and real-time settlement payment system. Trump family’s crypto involvement raises financial and ethical concerns The bill has gained support but has also courted controversy , mostly because of the deep ties between the Trump family and the crypto industry. World Liberty Financial launched its stablecoin, USD1, backed by President Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. US Treasuries and dollar deposits collateralize this coin — the precise type of asset that the GENIUS Act would sanction and regulate. Earlier this month, Abu Dhabi-based investment fund MGX pledged a significant investment in USD1, routing the funds through Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. This marks the largest investment in the Trump-linked stablecoin to date. The development has alarmed many Democrats, who warn that the bill could funnel money directly into the President’s and his family’s financial pockets, creating an unprecedented conflict of interest. Senator Elizabeth Warren and other critics demand that stronger ethical safeguards be incorporated into the legislation to prevent elected officials from profiting personally. Despite those fears, Sacks expressed confidence that the bill would pass. However, he declined to address questions regarding Trump’s financial ties to crypto. Investors flock to stablecoins as Bitcoin surges past $110,000 Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the United States dollar. Unlike Bitcoin or many other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are intended to remain steady and easy to use as payment. Their popularity is skyrocketing. A recent report by Deutsche Bank revealed that transactions of $28 trillion worth of stablecoins were conducted last year — more than even Visa and Mastercard combined. The stablecoin space is currently led by Tether, representing over 60% of the market, and is banked in the US by Cantor Fitzgerald. For now, bitcoin keeps soaring. It reached a fresh high on Wednesday at nearly $110,000 a coin. Sacks believes that stablecoins can be a tool to help the US keep the dollar strong in a world that’s going online and fast. “It also gives the dollar continued dominance online,” he said.

As major digital assets fluctuate, attention has turned toward altcoins promising substantial growth amid shifting market dynamics. Qubetics has emerged as a strong contender in this space, offering a compelling mix of real-world utility, advanced scalability, and AI-driven innovation. Identifying the top altcoin for massive return potential has become a critical focus for market participants—and Qubetics is increasingly being recognized as a project poised to deliver outsized gains in a volatile environment. One such project rising above the noise is Qubetics ($TICS), positioned to solve real-world challenges that older cryptocurrencies have struggled to address. With its unique ecosystem and ongoing crypto presale, Qubetics is attracting considerable attention as the next top altcoin for massive return potential. This article explores why Bitcoin, despite its dominance, may have been a missed opportunity for many, while Qubetics provides a fresh avenue with promising upside. Bitcoin: The Missed Giant in the Race for Massive Returns Bitcoin undeniably revolutionized finance by introducing decentralized digital currency to the masses. It sparked a global movement and built the foundation for the entire crypto industry. However, many who overlooked Bitcoin in its early days now reflect on missed chances to secure extraordinary returns. The cryptocurrency’s historical price surges from mere cents to tens of thousands of dollars per token remain legendary. Despite Bitcoin’s pioneering status, its scalability issues, transaction fees, and environmental concerns have led to growing interest in alternative projects that can deliver faster, more versatile solutions. Bitcoin’s relatively high price per token today presents barriers to new entrants seeking exposure to crypto growth without risking excessive capital. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s established presence often overshadows innovative projects that might offer higher growth trajectories. In a market where timing is critical, missing Bitcoin’s early rise serves as a cautionary tale. Meanwhile, altcoins with advanced technology stacks, targeted use cases, and accessible entry points are becoming increasingly attractive. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential Qubetics is redefining the possibilities of blockchain utility with its multi-application ecosystem designed to serve businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Unlike many projects that focus solely on speculation, Qubetics delivers practical tools and decentralized services that address real-life problems — from secure cross-border transactions to developer-friendly integrated development environments. Currently in its 35th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 513 million tokens to more than 26,800 holders, raising upwards of $17.2 million. The token is priced at an accessible $0.2785 during this phase, making it an enticing entry point for those aiming to capitalize on future growth. Analysts project that $TICS could reach $1 post-presale, representing a 258% return on investment, with even more optimistic forecasts placing it at $5 or higher after the mainnet launch. Application and Ecosystem Impact Qubetics introduces several core applications including QubeQode and Qubetics IDE, which empower users with decentralized tools for privacy, coding, and asset tokenization. QubeQode facilitates secure, private communication and transactions across borders. Businesses dealing with international clients benefit from lower fees and increased security, making it an attractive alternative to traditional financial networks. Qubetics IDE targets developers by providing an intuitive, decentralized development environment that supports multi-chain projects and seamless integration with blockchain protocols. Scenarios illustrate the ecosystem’s potential: A freelance developer in Central Asia leverages Qubetics IDE to build and deploy smart contracts without intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing transparency. An export-import firm uses QubeQode to conduct cross-border payments securely and quickly, bypassing slow legacy banking systems and avoiding hefty transaction fees. Individual users concerned with data privacy rely on Qubetics’ decentralized VPN features to safeguard their online activities without sacrificing speed or reliability. These real-world applications position Qubetics as a versatile platform beyond mere speculation, increasing its appeal and utility within the growing digital economy. Presale Details and Price Projections The ongoing presale offers a rare opportunity to acquire $TICS tokens at an early stage price of $0.2785. This presale phase, now at stage 35, reflects strong community support and growing confidence in the project’s roadmap. With over 513 million tokens sold and a holder base exceeding 26,800, momentum is accelerating. Price predictions from market analysts suggest: At $1 post-presale: approximately 258% ROI At $5 post-mainnet launch: approximately 1694% ROI At $10 to $15 post-mainnet launch: estimated returns soaring above 5000%, reflecting the disruptive potential of Qubetics technology and adoption trends. Such projections underscore why Qubetics is rapidly becoming the top altcoin for massive return potential within the crypto space. Conclusion: Seizing the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential The cryptocurrency market’s dynamic market rewards timely decisions and strategic insights. Bitcoin’s rise was a historic opportunity, yet many missed the chance to capitalize on its early gains. Presently, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as the top altcoin for massive return potential , backed by innovative applications, a strong presale performance, and bullish analyst forecasts. Securing $TICS tokens at the current crypto presale price represents a compelling proposition for those seeking exposure to next-generation blockchain technology. Acting swiftly to acquire Qubetics during its crypto presale phase could unlock remarkable gains. The top altcoin for massive return potential today offers a unique blend of practicality and growth, making it a worthy contender for portfolio inclusion. Awareness and informed choices will remain crucial in navigating this growing crypto market.

Bullish momentum is reinforced by weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index and limited upside in the S&P 500, favoring capital rotation into cryptocurrencies. Potential risks include a bearish Deep Crab pattern and political uncertainty around the U.S. strategic cryptocurrency reserve, but these are not my base case. I will reconsider my outlook if Bitcoin falls below $106,140, but current sentiment and technicals support further upside in the near term. When I last covered Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) on March 2nd, 2025, with my article “Bitcoin: I Was Wrong”, cryptocurrency prices were beginning to lose some of the luster that was present following President Donald Trump’s public comments suggesting that he intended to become the world’s first cryptocurrency President . Of course, these were not just words, there were real actions supporting the bullish long-term cryptocurrency outlook in the United States . Of course, these are deeply positive scenarios for anyone holding large-cap cryptocurrencies, and BTC-USD prices have responded in kind. Since my last analysis was developed, BTC-USD has actually gained by more than +13% even while the S&P 500 has encountered losses of -1.81%. But the story is a bit more complicated than that because bitcoin prices have actually been on a bit more of a roller coaster ride than those somewhat subtle gains might imply. Given bitcoin’s ability to recover losses and form a base at elevated levels, I am raising my rating outlook to a “strong buy” while this newest rally is still in its earliest stages. Bitcoin: Substantial Two-Way Reversals (Income Generator via TradingView ) First, let’s quickly define the most recent “rally” because there are definitely elements of the bitcoin trend that seem to contradict this outwardly bullish assertion. As we can see in the chart above, BTC-USD actually continued to drop (by about -22%) after my prior pessimistic article was published. As a result, I suppose that you could say I was “right” about being “wrong” but market prices quickly reversed into the positive direction after falling below $75,000. This reversal is essentially the main reason I will have to eat some crow with my analysis update today because the bullish trend wave was forceful enough to generate gains of nearly 48% and break above an all-time high resistance level in the process. Bitcoin: Significance of Recent Breakout (Income Generator via TradingView ) When discussing these events with my own trading group, I described the price action of the last few days as being a textbook example of a consolidation zone. Whenever you are dealing with the test of an all-time high (especially when dealing with a high-volume and highly volatile trading asset), the general expectation is that selling pressure is likely to start building as prices continue moving upward. Unfortunately, this can occur either as short-sellers begin to emerge near a critical resistance zone or as bullish cryptocurrency investors start to take profits on prior successful trades. Bitcoin prices, however, really did not experience very much of this type of price action. Almost like a snake hiding in the grass and waiting to strike its prey, BTC-USD prices hovered just below the triple-top resistance region near $107,355 (as well as the +2 standard deviation on the shorter-term time frames). When we did not see any significant pullback from the $107,355 level, I immediately flipped bullish because there were two different negative technical signals (bearish triple-top resistance pattern and the movement of prices into the +2 standard deviation) and neither of them were having much of an effect. Bullish volumes were also rising quite sharply right into this resistance level, and all of this essentially provided a perfect storm of bullish elements that allowed buyers to overcome sellers and print a new record high. Bitcoin: Comparative Trends in U.S. Dollar Index (Income Generator via TradingView ) In order to get a better sense of where cryptocurrency trends are actually headed next, I think it might be important to assess relative performances in peripheral asset classes. As the world’s reserve currency , trends in the U.S. Dollar are often best assessed using the U.S. Dollar Index, and we can see some interesting developments for the greenback when looking at the daily timeframe. Specifically, we can see that the U.S. Dollar Index recently invalidated prior trend momentum readings in the Relative Strength Index ((RSI)) near the beginning of this month. However, upside follow-through has been lacking, with the RSI breaking back below the daily exponential moving average (EMA). In the chart above, this activity is shown with the purple line in the indicator panel falling under the yellow exponential moving average. Importantly, share prices themselves are also trading back below all four major exponential moving averages (20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day periods) and this gives us a bearish confluence of events that seems to contradict the negative momentum break that was experienced earlier this month. As a result, our next downside price target for the U.S. Dollar Index is not seen until 97.921 (April 21st, 2025 lows). Overall, I expect this to have a positive BTC-USD impact in terms of price action - at least until major support in the U.S. Dollar Index is retested (and confirmed to hold). Bitcoin: Comparative Trends in S&P 500 (Income Generator via TradingView ) Another major peripheral asset that cryptocurrency trades should be watching would be the S&P 500 itself. At this stage, it is probably becoming irritating for many investors to listen to stock pundits talk about the potential for cryptocurrencies to become safe-haven assets . But if this characterization is actually an accurate characterization of the market majority, it might be reasonable to suggest that declining momentum in the S&P 500 could actually become beneficial for bitcoin investors. Based on the chart above, bullish BTC-USD arguments can be made right now, due to the fact that the S&P 500 has already failed at resistance following the sizable rallies that emerged after the crash into $4,835.04 in early April. Of course, the May 19th price highs at $5,968.61 rests less than 3% below the S&P 500’s all-time high of $6,147.43. For all of these reasons, I think it is very difficult to make the argument that the S&P 500 has a great deal of upside potential when the benchmark has already recovered most of the losses that have been experienced since January 31st, 2025. Bitcoin: Potential Bearish Signals (Income Generator via TradingView ) If we do believe that the potential for upside is limited in both the U.S. Dollar Index and S&P 500, where would we then expect investors to start flocking next? Small-cap stocks might be one possibility, perhaps treasuries might be another (especially given the long-term complexities of the current market environment). However, if broader selling pressure in DXY and the major U.S. stock benchmarks is not far away, bullish cryptocurrency investors really needed to see a break of important resistance levels in BTC-USD. This week, this did occur as the time-tested flagship cryptocurrency broke through prior all-time highs, but I will also mention potential risks to the positive outlook. In the chart above, we can see that even though historical resistance zones have been invalidated, cryptocurrency prices are still trading outside the +2 standard deviation and a bearish harmonic pattern has developed after the rally from just above $102,105 on May 19th. Specifically, this is a bearish Deep Crab pattern, and it is large enough to suggest that BTC-USD prices could fall back below $100,500 if the pattern reaches a full point of completion (which does not occur in a large majority of instances). We must also be aware of the fact that there has been a great deal of criticism with respect to the viability of President Donald Trump’s strategic cryptocurrency reserve, so much so that a BBC News article actually used the term “ pig in lipstick ” to describe Trump’s plans for a cryptocurrency future. Of course, if these criticisms turn out to be accurate, I think we might see the U.S. government reconsider efforts to operate the strategic cryptocurrency reserve under the next administration. Unfortunately, any financial news headlines centered in this direction would likely be accepted unfavorably by the cryptocurrency market, and I think that this is the type of event that could lead to the next crypto winter (if these types of events actually materialize). Of course, there are a lot of unknowns here and that negative scenario is not my base case right now. Ultimately, I think that the recent breaks of important resistance levels suggests that market sentiment is actually quite healthy and that the influence of short-sellers is diminishing in size. For all of these reasons, I am upgrading my BTC-USD outlook to a “strong buy” rating and I will reconsider my outlook if we see bitcoin fall below $106,140 (near-term pivot lows recorded during the May 21st trading session).",BTC-USD|SP500|DXY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-22 02:30:00

Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a new all-time high of $110,788.98 on Coinbase late on May 21, just before 11:30 pm UTC, according to TradingView. Bitcoin has gained around 3% over the last 24 hours, surpassing its all-time high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its previously long-held Jan. 20 peak. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now gained 17.5% so far this year and is up 47% since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets. Bitcoin’s new peak comes as US stock markets were rattled by a weak 20-year bond auction, which sent treasury yields soaring on May 21. The S&P 500 fell 80 points in half an hour while the Nasdaq and Dow Jones mirrored the move, with all US indexes trading down on the day. Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows it has climbed out of a slump earlier this year. Source: TradingView Caroline Bowler, CEO of the Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said in a note to Cointelegraph that Bitcoin’s new high “reflects a mature interest in digital assets worldwide, not the speculative surge seen in past cycles.” “Today’s demand is driven by institutional-grade infrastructure and stronger regulatory clarity. Investor sentiment has shifted decisively, reflecting institutional-style allocations,” she added. According to Google Trends, searches for Bitcoin have been trending down since November and are at lows typical of crypto bear markets, indicating a low retail interest in the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks market sentiment, was at a score of 72 out of 100 on May 22, indicating “greed.” The index is down from its 2025 high of 84 on Jan. 22, which came two days after Trump’s inauguration. Related: How high can Bitcoin price go? Edward Carroll, head of global markets and corporate finance at MHC Digital Group, told Cointelegraph in a note that growing demand driving the price higher in the medium-term could push Bitcoin to at least $160,000 by the fourth quarter of this year and $1 million by 2030. Trader’s leveraged Bitcoin bet tops $1.1B Meanwhile, leverage trader James Wynn’s Bitcoin long position on the crypto platform Hyperliquidity has become the largest onchain margin trade when it exceeded $1.1 billion amid Bitcoin’s price peak. The entry point for the 40x leveraged position was $108,065 and it has an unrealized profit of $20 million. It will be liquidated if Bitcoin’s price falls to $103,800.

The fund has a large allocation to Bitcoin, which could hurt returns if a true 'altseason' were to manifest. At 2.5%, the fund has a high expense ratio and doesn't stake any of the PoS assets under management, producing an opportunity cost relative to holding the assets directly. The top 4 assets make up over 97% of the fund's capital; none of those 4 assets are 'cheap' in my view. At a 14% discount to NAV, BITW could serve as a potential arbitrage trade if/when more spot ETFs cover the crypto market in the US. I've covered the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF (BITW) for Seeking Alpha four times going back to 2023. My general thinking on the fund can be summed up in this way; I like it slightly better than its closest peer, the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ETF (GDLC) because of a broader offering of assets, but I don't think it's the best way to play a rally in the altcoin market at this juncture. While the fund can occasionally serve as an interesting arbitrage opportunity when it trades a steep discount to net asset value, there are disadvantages with both the fund and its construction. In this update, we'll briefly review some of the pros and cons to holding BITW shares, as well as assess how I view the current valuation setup for the fund's top 4 holdings. Pros and Cons of BITW For speculators who want simple exposure to the digital assets in a single ticker, BITW works fine. As I see it, these are the top advantages of BITW over something like GDLC: BITW GDLC AUM $1.44b $775m NAV Per Share $70.90 $48.81 Market Price $60.83 $42.40 Discount to NAV 14.2% 13.1% BTC Weighting 78.0% 79.5% Fund Holdings 10 5 Sources: Grayscale and Bitwise as of May 20th Closing Prices Not only does BITW have a slightly bigger discount to NAV at 14.2% currently, but the fund also offers exposure to more assets than GDLC and has slightly less reliance on BTC for fund performance. With roughly double the AUM than that of GDLC, BITW has strong liquidity and gets a 'B+' liquidity grade from Seeking Alpha. As I see it, there are three important disadvantages to holding a fund like BITW over alternatives; expense ratio, asset weighting, and opportunity cost. At a 2.5% expense ratio, BITW is way too expensive for what is essentially a passively managed fund that is nearly 80% Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Bitcoin Dominance 5/21/25 (CoinGlass) Bitcoin's dominance of the $2.06 trillion digital asset market is 61.5% per CoinGlass data. While this is obviously a large share of the crypto market, BITW and GDLC are both closer to 80% BTC. To be sure, the overwhelming majority of the assets in the cryptocurrency market are entirely uninvestable. Thus, over-weight BTC makes sense. But there are assets held within BITW that I do think could be long-term successes and even potentially outperform BTC over the next 10 to 20 years. In that regard, choosing BITW over something like a self-directed crypto-IRA might not make sense for long-term investors who have a willingness to open such an account - and there are several providers. Another potential issue with BITW is the opportunity cost of holding stake-able assets dormant in a fund that isn't generating yield. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ) collectively make up nearly 15% of BITW positioning. Each of those assets are stake-able for yield and provide investors a positive real yield after token emissions inflation. It is anticipated that staking could soon be permitted in US-based crypto ETFs under the current administration. If such products enter the market, BITW could theoretically trade at a deeper discount to NAV. Top Holdings Valuation Assessment The fund always has 10 assets under management, though those assets with smaller allocations do often change. As of May 20th, BITW asset weightings are as follows: BITW Holdings 5/20/25 (Bitwise) I've already mentioned the large weighting to BTC. From there, ETH commands 11%, XRP ( XRP-USD ) claims 5%, and SOL comes in at 3.2%. With less than 2% combined allocation to the bottom five assets in the fund, I'm not going to spend much time on those networks. However, the top 4 coins in the fund do have a meaningful allocation and represent more than 97% of BITW. We'll take a look at network valuation metrics for those funds and examine what, if any, alternatives there may be for investors who want larger exposure to those assets than what is currently provided by Bitwise. We already know BITW trades at a discount to the fund's liquidation value. But what about the assets themselves? Can we justify such coin prices based on fundamental usage? I've covered Bitcoin's valuation in prior SA pieces. My personal view is that the NVT ratio is a decent way to assess BTC valuation because it utilizes the coin's market cap as well as the dollar-denominated value transferred over the network. BTC Price vs 30 Day Average NVT ( Coin Metrics ) The multi-year trend in BTC's 30-Day average NVT ratio is admittedly not a great one. What this shows is that over the longer term, as BTC's price moves higher, the NVT ratio generally does as well. That said, at 186 currently, the NVT ratio is well-off highs from last summer. I would personally like to see this ratio come down even further. But what I find to be a positive sign currently is the price rise in BTC near the end of last year was accompanied by a deep drop in NVT ratio. This would indicate that the coin price wasn't outgrowing the transferred value. In my view, NVT is good for networks that intend to be 'payment chains.' Because of this, we could choose to view XRP through this lens as well: BTC vs XRP NVT Ratio ( Coin Metrics ) Believe it or not, XRP was actually cheaper than BTC based purely on NVT ratio for most of the last two and half years. While the 220 ratio reading for XRP currently is back ahead of BTC, the long-term trend for XRP's NVT valuation has been quite opposite that of BTC. I'm not arguing either of these coins are 'cheap' based on this metric - quite the opposite, actually. But I think these can be helpful in showing long-term price vs usage trends. For the smart contract chains, fees are a meaningful part of the underlying economics of the networks. There, I like to look at price to fees ratios of the chains: Weekly Circulating P/F Ratios (Token Terminal) Token Terminal's data shows Ethereum is trading at over 760x fees. Based on this metric, Ethereum is now valued more richly than NEAR Protocol ( NEAR-USD ). Solana, which has been cheaper than Ethereum on a circulating P/F multiple since October, is also seeing the ratio generally moving in the wrong direction. At 136x fees currently, Solana has seen significant multiple expansion since February. What Alternatives to BITW Are There? I've already mentioned that investors who have a willingness to open self-direct crypto IRAs can certainly do that. In those types of accounts, there are typically no storage fees, but transaction fees can be high for those who are active traders. There are usually dozens of trade-able digital assets, and it would be quite easy to overweight most of the top 'altcoins' in the market if one were so inclined. However, not everyone wants to open an additional account due to either the inconvenience or the potential personal data security concern - each of which are justifiable in my view. Can BITW's current digital asset exposure be mimicked by purchases of single-asset products that are already available in the market? Possibly. Asset Spot ETF? Closed-End Fund? Leveraged Fund? Bitcoin Yes Yes Yes Ethereum Yes No Yes XRP No No Yes Solana No Yes No Cardano ( ADA-USD ) No No No Sui ( SUI-USD ) No No No ChainLink ( LINK-USD ) No Yes No Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) No No No Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) No Yes No Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) No Yes No Source: Author's compiled data, funds must be secondary market trade-able not only available through private placement As far as I can tell, only three of the assets in BITW are lacking direct exposure through some combination of spot ETFs, closed-end funds, or leveraged funds. Collectively, those three assets make up less than 2% of BITW. So it is theoretically possible to self-direct exposure to the majority of the assets in BITU through a standard brokerage account utilizing the single-asset products that are already available in the market. Closing Thoughts For those who want a simple way to get exposure to some of the top assets in the cryptocurrency market, BITW will work perfectly fine. Potential investors should keep in mind that there are downsides to getting exposure in this way. In my view, the expense ratio is too high, 78% exposure to BTC defeats the purpose of a 'diversified' fund, and there is an opportunity cost to holding stake-able assets in a fund that doesn't stake them for yield. That said, at a 14% discount to NAV, BITW is somewhat interesting as a potential arbitrage trade should be more of these assets get spot ETFs in the US. While I don't personally hold this fund at this time, it's one of which I've held in the past and would consider holding again if the discount gets to parity with the non-BTC asset allocation of the fund. That said, the discount arbitrage can close simultaneously to a drop in share price. That's a major risk to consider. I would argue that none of the assets in BITW could realistically be considered 'cheap' based on network usage levels.",BTC-USD|ETH-USD|SOL-USD|XRP-USD|BITW,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-22 02:45:00

According to experts, if this momentum continues, Bitcoin could soon target $115,000 to $116,000. However, like always, some ups and downs are expected along the way. Market data confirms that the trend is still bullish. Many who predicted a market crash have gone silent, as current charts and on-chain data show a different picture. While Bitcoin leads the way, several altcoins have also posted gains. Dogecoin rose by 7%, while other major altcoins gained between 2-4%. Pi Coin Eyes $1 One standout is Pi Network’s coin, which jumped 10%, reaching a high of $0.86 before settling around $0.84. The next target for Pi is to cross the $1 mark, a level many supporters are eagerly watching. However, for Pi Coin to hit $1, it should first cross the important resistance level at $0.94. Even though more Pi coins are being unlocked, the price is still rising. This could be because of various factors: First, a $100 million fund was launched to support Pi projects. Second, many people are choosing to hold their Pi instead of selling. What’s Next For Crypto Market? Experts believe that once Pi Network secures listings on major exchanges, it could see a big rise in price and popularity. On the other hand, Bitcoin is still looking strong on the charts, with indicators like RSI and MACD showing positive momentum. Although Bitcoin has entered the overbought zone, it hasn’t reached extreme levels yet, meaning there’s still room for growth. If Bitcoin slows down after a while, altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP might see stronger price movements next.

Analyst Forecasts: 25x–35x returns are considered conservative, with some models projecting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues Pre-Listing Momentum: Stage 8 is nearly full, and listings are imminent, making this a rare ground-floor opportunity before public price discovery. Summary: MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only major altcoin still in accumulation mode before listings, offering the highest risk-adjusted upside window heading into Q3 2025. 3. XRP — Regulatory Clarity, but Price Action Cools Recent Performance: XRP trades between $2.36–$2.65 and has surged over 300% since late 2024, driven by regulatory clarity and institutional partnerships. However, the price has cooled since its recent peak, and short-term momentum is slowing as the market consolidates. Outlook: Analysts project a breakout above $3.40 could push XRP toward $5–$7.50, but for now, the asset is in a holding pattern. 4. Ethereum (ETH) — Technical Breakout Pauses Recent Performance: Ethereum has rebounded from $1,800 to over $2,500 in May, but the rally is now cooling off. Technical indicators suggest a potential retest of $2,700–$2,900 if support holds, but short-term momentum is slowing. Outlook: ETH remains a core holding for DeFi and institutional investors, but the most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. 5. TRUMP (MAGA) — Narrative-Driven, but Not the Focus TRUMP trades at $0.195–$0.20, but it is distinct from MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale token, which is still under $0.001 and targeting a $0.007 listing price.For clarity, this article focuses on presale MAGACOIN FINANCE as the breakout play, offering structured ROI and political narrative appeal EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion As summer 2025 unfolds, MAGACOIN FINANCE is accelerating while Ethereum, Solana, and XRP slow down. With Stage 8 nearly full and listings approaching, MAGA is being positioned as the breakout coin of the season—offering a rare combination of structured ROI, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and early-stage momentum. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns as conservative, with some models projecting even greater upside if current trends continue. For investors seeking the next crypto supercycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only major altcoin still in accumulation mode before listings—making it the highest-conviction play heading into Q3.

While Solana (SOL) and Stellar (XLM) continue to build their networks through technical upgrades and institutional support, BlockDAG (BDAG) is focusing on something different: accessibility. Instead of relying on a small group of experts, it offers a system that invites more people to build. BlockDAG has introduced tools that lower the barrier to entry, like a no-code dApp builder and a developer grant program. These changes are meant to bring in a broader community. With over $260 million raised and more than 20.9 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is creating a space where building on Web3 is more about creativity and less about coding skills. Compared to Solana and Stellar’s price-driven attention, BlockDAG is centered on use cases, ease of entry, and a long-term goal to reshape how crypto apps are made. Solana (SOL) Eyes $180 Breakout Solana’s (SOL) price has stayed strong above $160, and it’s now testing the $180 resistance level, a spot that has previously sparked sharp moves. This higher low pattern suggests growing market support. Along with stronger trading volume, it shows buyers are preparing for a breakout. If SOL closes above $180 with solid volume, it could trigger a larger upward move. However, traders remain cautious and are watching the price closely. A clear push past this level may confirm renewed strength and attract more market attention. SOL continues to be on watchlists due to this critical range. Stellar (XLM): Smart Money Builds Confidence Stellar (XLM) is seeing more activity from large holders. Recent data shows institutional accumulation is rising, often seen as a signal of confidence in its future use. This matches XLM’s focus on real-world payment networks and integrations. Currently, Stellar is moving through a consolidation phase. Some analysts believe this isn’t a pause, but a buildup toward the next move. The platform’s steady transaction volume and wallet growth add weight to that view. Resistance levels are still in play, but the uptick in smart money activity is worth noting. While price swings continue, long-term watchers are tracking these buying signals. BlockDAG Presale Hits $260M With Simple dApp Creation Tools BlockDAG is making Web3 easier for everyone to access. Its upcoming no-code dApp builder is designed so anyone, whether a solo creator or a small business, can build and launch applications without coding knowledge. This shift removes a key hurdle that has kept many from entering the space. What makes this more powerful is BlockDAG’s structure. The platform encourages fast app building, niche use cases, and fresh ideas, thanks to tools that simplify the process. Unlike other platforms that expect builders to know blockchain code, BlockDAG gives them an entry point without that requirement. This change matters right now. BlockDAG has already raised over $260 million in its presale and sold more than 20.9 billion coins. It is now in Batch 28, priced at $0.0262. From Batch 1 to 28, early buyers have seen a 2,520% ROI. On top of that, over $7 million worth of X Series miners have been sold till now. One more highlight is the limited-time price freeze, BlockDAG is offering BDAG at $0.0020 until June 13. That makes this a key window for anyone looking at utility-backed projects. With its CertiK audit completed and builder tools rolling out, BlockDAG isn’t just riding hype, it’s creating real access to building in crypto. BlockDAG’s Utility Sets It Apart in 2025 Solana’s price is near a breakout, and Stellar is gaining institutional attention. But BlockDAG is standing out for its builder-first approach. With no-code tools, developer grants, and real funding already raised, it brings a different kind of value. The numbers are solid: $260 million raised, 20.9 billion coins sold, and BDAG priced at $0.0020 until June 13. This model isn’t just about supply, it’s about function. For those watching top crypto coins with real-world use, BlockDAG offers something unique. It’s focused on making development simple, even for those without technical backgrounds. This could help expand the reach of Web3 and push crypto toward more practical, daily use.

It combines CeFi security with DeFi accessibility, and it is one of only three chains selected for the debut. The major move comes when Bitcoin is hovering just short of 3% from its all-time high (ATH) of $109K. BTC’s price has surged by more than 21% over the last 30 days, reflecting that more investors are jumping in. However, the Fear and Greed Index flashes “Greed” sentiment among traders. OKX unveils xBTC on Sui Bitcoin holders now have more ways than ever to go onchain, and Sui is quickly becoming a BTCfi powerhouse. With the total Bitcoin Total Value Locked (TVL) climbing, xBTC is expected to lead the adoption and liquidity. Data provided by DefiLlama shows that TVL in DeFi has stood at $2.11 billion. Sui was chosen for its fast, scalable, and already building serious BTCfi infrastructure. With this move, OKX is signaling that it isn’t just another Layer 1 and is a rising hub for Bitcoin-backed DeFi. Two major protocols, Cetus and Navi, are exclusive launch partners for xBTC on day one. xBTC is minted directly on OKX and is withdrawable as a native asset. This makes it easier for users to bridge Bitcoin into DeFi without clunky wrappers or third-party trust models. It opens up new liquidity rails and reward strategies for BTC holders. Jason Lau, Chief Innovation Officer at OKX, stated that “Our unique advantage as one of the most trustworthy and transparent institutions imbues xBTC with a powerful security model.” Over 10% of Sui TVL is now BTC-backed Since February, nearly 600 Bitcoin have flowed into Sui, suggesting that Bitcoin holders are flocking to this fast-growing Layer 1 to tap into DeFi opportunities securely and efficiently. BTC-backed assets now make up over 10% of Sui’s total value locked (TVL), and that number keeps climbing. xBTC joins a strong lineup of BTC-based tokens, such as WBTC , LBTC, and sBTC. Each asset comes with unique custody models and DeFi integrations. Christian Thompson, Managing Director at the Sui Foundation, says, “Bitcoin DeFi on Sui has gone from an intriguing concept to proving complete product-market fit in a matter of months.” He added, “OKX is choosing to bring xBTC to Sui, which speaks to the robustness” of the BTCfi ecosystem. Sui’s BTCfi ecosystem has also attracted projects like Stacks, Lombard, Babylon, Cubist, SatLayer, and RedStone. It has created a vibrant hub where Bitcoin holders can put their BTC to work in multiple ways. xBTC can turn out to be a big use up for traders as it charges no minting or redemption fees. The only cost involved would be minimal gas fees on the network.

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,650 resistance zone. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,500 and $2,520 levels. The price is trading above $2,540 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,620 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Could Gain Strength Ethereum price remained in a range above $2,350 while Bitcoin traded to a new all-time high. ETH bulls were active near the $2,440 zone. A low was formed at $2,442 and the price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $2,500 and $2,520 levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,615 swing high to the $2,442 low. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,615 swing high to the $2,442 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,620 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,720 level. A clear move above the $2,720 resistance might send the price toward the $2,840 resistance. An upside break above the $2,840 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,920 resistance zone or even $3,000 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,620 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350.

With over $300,000 raised in its first week of presale, the crypto community is beginning to wonder: Is this the next 100x opportunity since the explosive rise of PEPE? Why Wall Street Ponke is Gaining Traction Fast Unlike many memecoins that launch with little more than a logo and some community memes, Wall Street Ponke entered the scene with a mission, real-world utility, and a strong roadmap. Its first week has been nothing short of impressive—rapid fundraising, growing community buzz, and increasing mentions across crypto forums. This isn’t a random frog-themed pump-and-dump. Wall Street Ponke is blending the entertainment of meme culture with serious crypto innovation. A Secure Ecosystem, Not Just a Token What’s driving the buzz? For starters, WPONKE offers a platform that addresses one of crypto’s most pressing issues: security. At its core, Wall Street Ponke features an AI-powered detection system that continuously scans new tokens across the market. This system flags red flags like fake liquidity, suspicious smart contract behavior, and developer manipulation, helping traders avoid scams before they commit their funds. In a landscape filled with rug pulls, this alone is a major selling point. The Future of Meme Coins: Education and Empowerment Wall Street Ponke goes beyond protection—it educates. The platform includes a full e-learning ecosystem, featuring easy-to-follow courses on DeFi, staking, tokenomics, and smart contract analysis. Whether you’re just starting in crypto or looking to level up your skills, WPONKE has positioned itself as a hub for smarter trading. It’s this blend of fun and functionality that’s earning it comparisons to early-stage PEPE—but with more tools and a clearer vision. High Staking Rewards and Real Community Utility One of the project’s standout features is its staking model. Early investors are being rewarded with a staggering 1232% APY. This system doesn’t just create FOMO—it builds long-term commitment. Instead of encouraging a quick flip, Wall Street Ponke incentivizes holders to become part of a sustainable ecosystem. https://twitter.com/Wallstreetponke/status/1922793562091008367 With staking, AI security tools, and educational resources all rolled into one, it’s no surprise that WPONKE is being called one of the most complete meme coin launches in recent memory. How to Join the Presale and Buy $WPONKE It’s easy and beginner-friendly to join the Wall Street Ponke presale. Create a crypto wallet to deposit funds. Then use a popular wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. You first need to buy some crypto from a central exchange. Use a central exchange like Binance or Coinbase to buy some ETH, USDT, or BNB. Next, go to wallstreetponke.com and connect your wallet to the presale interface. After that, simply select your payment of choice, enter the amount you’d like to invest and hit confirm. At the end of the presale, you will be able to claim your $WPONKE tokens in your wallet. Those who join the presale early will be able to stake their tokens and begin earning up to 1232% APY immediately. Wall Street Ponke isn’t just riding the meme coin wave—it’s reshaping it. If PEPE were a flash, $WPONKE could be the real fire.

The market is currently at a critical point, and how XRP behaves around these key support and resistance levels could shape it’s next move. Approaching a Key Support Level On the daily time frame, XRP is getting very close to breaking below an important support zone between $2.30 and $2.34. If the price closes a daily candle under $2.30, it could open the door for a further drop, falling back toward the $2.10–$2.15 range. Despite this risk, the overall daily price structure for XRP remains bullish. The market has continued forming higher lows and higher highs, which is typically a healthy sign during an uptrend. However, temporary pullbacks and sideways moves are common even in bullish trends. On the upside, a clear break above the $2.48–$2.61 resistance range is needed to confirm a meaningful bullish breakout and signal the start of a larger move higher. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.40 and is up by more than 1% in the last 24 hours. Short-Term Struggles Continue XRP is still under the influence of a bearish divergence. As a result, XRP is struggling to move higher and remains stuck within a range. The market has yet to see a clear breakout in either direction.. Right now, XRP’s price is caught between support and resistance. Both bullish and bearish possibilities remain on the table. A small bounce into the resistance zone is possible in the short term, but unless the price breaks through those upper levels, the overall market picture won’t change much. It’s also important to keep an eye on Bitcoin’s price action since it continues to influence the broader altcoin market, including XRP. However, Bitcoin has crossed above $110k level and it remains to be seen if altcoins will also rally. Short-Term Outlook At the moment, both potential scenarios for XRP remain valid: In the bullish case, XRP might see a short-term rally into resistance, followed by a brief correction, and then continue higher. In the alternative, XRP could start a direct rally from current support levels if buyers step in.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 03:22:07

Recent policy shifts between the United States and China, two of the world’s largest economies, have helped fuel investor sentiment. Both countries have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs: the US cut rates from 145% to 30%, while China lowered its own from 125% to 10%, each over 90 days. These decisions have been interpreted by some as a step toward easing global trade tensions, supporting risk-on assets such as Bitcoin. In response to the broader bullish environment, Bitcoin has seen a steady rise, currently trading at $106,574, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours. The price earlier reached a 24-hour high of $107,844 before retreating slightly. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin remains just 2% below its all-time high of $109,000, recorded in January 2025. The consistent climb has led analysts and traders to monitor on-chain metrics more closely to gauge market behavior and possible future movements. Related Reading: Binance Bitcoin Outflows and MVRV Ratio Point to Sustained Bullish Setup, Analyst Reveals Realized Capitalization Surges as Accumulation Phase Strengthens A recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alemán has brought attention to Bitcoin’s realized capitalization, a metric that measures the total value of Bitcoin based on the price at which each coin last moved on-chain. According to Alemán, the realized cap jumped by more than $3 billion in a single day, marking a 0.33% increase in the total capital invested in Bitcoin. This significant uptick signals renewed capital inflows, and more importantly, it points to a recurring pattern of accumulation and consolidation. Alemán identified a repeating cycle beginning in April, where Bitcoin has shown sharp price increases followed by sideways movements lasting 8 to 10 days. These lateral phases, supported by rising realized cap, form a staircase-like chart structure with each step building upon the previous one. From an on-chain perspective, the steady climb in realized cap suggests buyers are entering the market at higher levels, lifting the network’s aggregate cost basis and demonstrating long-term confidence in the asset. On-Chain Trends Suggest Investors Are Positioning for Continuation Alemán also highlighted that the behavior of realized capitalization in the current market mirrors patterns seen in previous bull cycles. Historically, spikes in this metric during consolidation phases have preceded large-scale price movements. The current rise indicates that capital entering the market is doing so with a long-term view, rather than speculative short-term intent. This positions the market for a potential continuation, especially as accumulation appears to intensify around the psychological $106,000–$109,000 range. Related Reading: $3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows The analyst concluded that tracking realized cap in the days ahead will be essential to confirm whether the current phase evolves into another upward price impulse.

The case centers on Block Earner’s “Earner” product, a fixed-yield crypto investment offering that ASIC contends operates as an unlicensed financial product . ASIC says it is asking the High Court of Australia to clarify what falls within the definition of a financial product to shed light on digital assets and interest-earning options. In its statement, the regulator emphasized that the definition of a financial product was designed to be broad and technology-neutral. ASIC believes that interpreting this definition should be guided by the public interest. The ruling may change how crypto and other digital financial services are subject to Australian law . ASIC insists there is a problem with crypto and regulatory predictability for the broader financial sector. Block Earner defends its product and integrity Block Earner has welcomed the Federal Court’s decision. On April 22, Federal Court Justices David O’Callaghan, Wendy Abraham, and Catherine Button found that Block Earner’s crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product is not a financial product, a managed investment scheme, or a derivative under the Corporations Act. A spokesperson for the Block Earner said it still had confidence that the clear and robust judgment delivered by the Full Federal Court in April had been based on the facts and law of the matter and had shown that its operations were sound. They also said they remain convinced that the ruling was correct. “We believe the Full Federal Court’s April ruling was a strong and well-reasoned decision that upheld the integrity of our operations,” the spokesperson said. “We remain confident in the soundness of that judgment and will respond to ASIC’s application through the appropriate legal channels.” The spokesman said the current dispute revolves around a broader legal question: what defines a financial product in the digital age? They emphasized that this issue goes far beyond Block Earner or the crypto sector alone. They noted that one key implication concerns not just this case but the future of fintech innovation and regulatory compliance across Australia. The company said that despite the legal win, Block Earner has no plans to revive the “Earner” product. Block Earner has pivoted to other similar crypto-backed loan offerings while complying with regulatory requirements. ASIC and Block Earner battle in years-long legal duel ASIC has been battling with Block Earner for over two years . The matter commenced in November 2022 in response to ASIC’s proceedings claiming that Block Earner was issuing financial products without holding an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL). The product, Earner, allowed users to deposit crypto-assets like Bitcoin and earn a fixed rate of return. ASIC argued that this constituted a financial product under the law. In February 2024, the Federal Court agreed with the ASIC argument that Block Earner did require a license. But the court cut it a break in June 2024, opting not to levy any punishment, after determining that Block Earner had acted in good faith, sought legal counsel, and believed it was following the law. Block Earner challenged the license denial in July 2024, resulting in the April 2025 decision in its favor. Now, ASIC is seeking to overturn that outcome in the High Court. Proceeding requires leave of the High Court, which is granted only where a case raises substantial legal or constitutional issues.

Kristin Johnson Bids Farewell To The CFTC According to Johnson’s statement , the former Emory University professor has notified U.S. President Donald Trump of her decision to leave the CFTC at the end of the year. Statement of @CFTCjohnson on Her Departure from the CFTC https://t.co/YL6q62bXo3 — CFTC (@CFTC) May 21, 2025 “Although this is a difficult decision, I am proud of the work that I have accomplished and am deeply grateful for the chance to develop meaningful relationships with staff and current and former Commissioners during my tenure at the CFTC,” Johnson said. “I am confident that the Commission will continue to do important work protecting investors and customers, combatting fraud and market manipulation, and ensuring market integrity and stability,” she added. Fourth Departure of a CFTC Commissioner Johnson was originally appointed to the derivatives markets regulating agency under former U.S. President Joe Biden in 2022, with her term completed in April of this year. Her decision to step down marks the fourth departure of a CFTC commissioner in recent weeks, with Republican official Christy Goldsmith announcing her May 31 exit just last Friday. Fellow Commissioner Caroline Pham will also leave her position when Trump’s pick to lead the CFTC, Brian Quintenz, is appointed to his role – though a set date has yet to be confirmed. Meanwhile, Republican Commissioner Summer Mersinger will leave the agency on May 30 before beginning her tenure as CEO of the Blockchain Association . “It has been a privilege to work and serve at the CFTC in both the first and the current Trump Administrations, doing my part to assist in pursuing the President’s important policies,” Mersinger said in a May 14 farewell statement posted to the CFTC’s website. No future CFTC commissioners have been announced by Trump, though given the aforementioned officials’ upcoming exits, it appears highly likely that he will do so in the near future.

After a mild correction, however, the altcoin is trading below $0.28. Despite this, new data suggest that TRX has emerged as one of the most “resilient” crypto assets in a turbulent market, as it maintained proximity to its all-time high (ATH) alongside Bitcoin. This strength is supported by CryptoQuant’s Drawdown Heatmap, which revealed TRX’s significant recovery since its 2024 peak. TRX Market Recovery The report highlights TRX’s Sharpe Ratio – annualized over 180 days – hovering between 0.1 and 0.15, a range that suggests a moderate risk-return balance. This is sharp contrast to many altcoins suffering negative or near-zero Sharpe Ratios after recent corrections, TRX’s performance positions it as a more stable option. Complementing this is the Normalized Risk Metric (NRM), which remains close to 0.5. This moderate risk profile, significantly removed from high-alert or undervaluation levels, indicates healthy market behavior. Notably, TRX’s late-2024 rally was followed by only a mild correction, and its current positioning near ATH suggests underlying investor confidence and potential institutional interest. Unlike many assets still lagging behind their historic highs, TRX joins a select group showing strong macro resilience. As such, CryptoQuant stated that TRX offers a measured opportunity for risk-aware investors. The latest price action has pushed all almost all holders of the token to green. This has impacted almost all investor cohorts – from one-week traders to one-year investors – which has seen gains. Meanwhile, Tron founder Justin Sun has made headlines for reasons extending far beyond TRX’s market activity. Justin Sun Earns Trump Dinner Invite Sun has revealed himself as the top holder of Donald Trump’s TRUMP meme coin, which helped him unlock access to a private dinner and VIP reception with the US President. In a May 19 X post , Sun said he controlled the wallet under the username “Sun,” qualifying for the May 22 event hosted at Trump’s golf club. The timing of the announcement, just hours after the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, a key stablecoin regulation bill, has raised concerns from lawmakers. Sun, who happens to be a major backer and adviser to Trump-linked crypto firm World Liberty Financial (WLFI), had previously been entangled in an SEC lawsuit that was paused after Trump’s inauguration. His proximity to the Trump family has prompted criticism from Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren.

44936271,https://cryptonews.com/?p=363689,1747886240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44936271.jpeg,SafeMoon Ex-CEO Found Guilty on Every Charge,https://cryptonews.com/news/safemoon-ex-ceo-braden-karony-found-guilty-on-every-charge/,"A federal jury in the Eastern District of New York convicted former SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony on May 21 of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering after a 12-day trial that began on May 5. He now faces up to 45 years in prison and the forfeiture of illicit gains. Prosecutors detailed how Karony and his co-conspirators misled investors about the SafeMoon token design, falsely claiming that its liquidity pools were “locked” by a 10% transaction tax, that insiders could not perform a “rug pull,” and that tokens would serve only business purposes rather than personal enrichment. They also assured buyers that developers did not hold or trade SFM tokens, and that the team would manually add token pairs to the pool when trades occurred on major exchanges. (1/3) “As proven at trial, the SafeMoon digital asset was anything but safe and turned out to be pie in the sky for investors who were deliberately misled by Karony, a man who sought to get rich quick by stealing and diverting millions of dollars,” stated U.S. Attorney Nocella. — US Attorney EDNY (@EDNYnews) May 21, 2025 In reality, the defendants retained full access to the liquidity pools. Consequently, they diverted millions of dollars’ worth of SFM tokens for their own profit. $2.2M Utah Home Among Assets Bought with Fraud Proceeds Prosecutors say the defendants repeatedly bought and sold tokens at market peaks. Moreover, they routed proceeds through private wallets and pseudonymous accounts. As a result, Karony alone netted over $9m. He used those funds to buy a $2.2m home in Utah and additional properties in Utah and Kansas. He also purchased a $277,000 Audi R8, another Audi R8, a Tesla, and custom Ford F-550 and Jeep Gladiator trucks. Co-defendant Thomas Smith testified against Karony after pleading guilty and could receive a lighter sentence, while platform creator Kyle Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and remains at large. The jury also ordered forfeiture of one residential property and the proceeds from another, totalling about $2m. ‘Pie in the Sky’ Ruling Highlights Investor Betrayal The Justice Department’s business and securities fraud section is handling the case. Additionally, Assistant US Attorneys Dana Rehnquist, Sara Winik and Jessica Weigel are leading the prosecution. Meanwhile, Assistant US Attorney Laura Mantell is overseeing forfeiture matters. They are supported by paralegal specialists Asher Martin-Rosenthal and Madison Bates. “At trial, we proved that the SafeMoon digital asset was anything but safe and turned out to be pie in the sky for investors,” said US Attorney Jaqueline Romero Nocella. “Karony used his scheme to purchase homes, sports cars, custom trucks, and other luxury goods. This verdict should warn fraudsters that we will vigorously prosecute those who prey on digital-asset investors.” Karony’s trial followed the January sentencing of former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky to 12 years in prison after a guilty plea, and the 25-year term handed to former FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried in 2023. Those cases, alongside Wednesday’s verdict, point to the Justice Department’s intensified focus on digital asset markets and signal that executives who breach investor trust will face severe penalties.

Trump Coin, Chainlink (LINK), and TRON (TRX) are also gaining attention. But quietly building beneath the surface is a new contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE — and it may be the one with the most explosive setup this quarter. Dogecoin (DOGE) – 990% Network Spike Sparks Bullish Buzz As of May 16, DOGE trades at $0.2249, but user activity has exploded — with active addresses surging nearly 990% in just seven days. Forecasts for May suggest DOGE could trade between $0.305 and $0.443, with year-end targets as high as $1.00, depending on momentum and ETF chatter. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Burn Rate Surge and Ecosystem Growth SHIB is up over 12% this week, now priced at $0.000026. Technical setups point to a breakout, especially as Shibarium expands and developers continue to burn supply. Analysts see potential highs ranging from $0.0000326 to $0.00008471 in a sustained rally. Chainlink (LINK) and Trump Coin (TRUMP) – Volatile but Back in the Spotlight TRUMP COIN sits near $13, climbing over 25% this week. Past rallies have sent it to $75, and 2025 targets range from $67 to $200. With U.S. election narratives heating up and ETF speculation swirling, the stage is set for renewed volatility — and opportunity. Trading between $16.39 and $16.77, LINK is up 29% this week. If it breaks the $15.30 level with volume, analysts forecast a move toward $19.50. LINK’s role in tokenized assets and cross-chain data flows makes it a top candidate for further institutional adoption. TRON (TRX) – Quiet But Consistent Gains TRX is trading at $0.268, up 7.23% this week and 107% year-over-year. Its leadership in stablecoins and growing DeFi adoption position it as a foundational blockchain. May price targets range from $0.271 to $0.35, with $0.75 on the table if momentum continues. MAGACOIN FINANCE – This Is Still the Beginning It’s not just the price point — although MAGACOIN FINANCE remains below $0.001. It’s the structure. Whales are stepping in because they recognize the power of early-stage projects with viral potential, political timing, and strong tokenomics. With over $8 million raised, the project has already exceeded early expectations — but this isn’t about past performance. It’s about what comes next. Stage 8 is live. Stage 9 is approaching. Each new phase increases exclusivity and upside. Insiders are anticipating a series of major announcements in the coming weeks — including integrations, expanded media coverage, and updated roadmap milestones. Built for scalability, not just hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has avoided early exchange dilution and is growing through community-first momentum. Investors using promo code MAGA50X receive a 50% token bonus, a key driver behind current whale accumulation. For those asking if they’re late — they’re not. Stage 8 is live. The door is still open — for now.

A Synthetix spokesperson told Cointelegraph on May 22 that its acquisition proposal, pitched to its community and to Derive’s , “did not resonate,” and both projects agreed to “step back from the proposed acquisition.” Synthetix said on May 14 that it would acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million, pending approval from both communities. Synthetix strategy lead Ben Celermajer told Cointelegraph that other community concerns were the three-month token lock-up period and the deal’s price, part of which Synthetix tried to address with no lock-up for holders of less than 1 million DRV. “While we understand the commercials did not resonate with all community members, a number of holders from both communities believed the deal was fair and acceptable,” he said. “However, we acknowledge that the response fell short of expectations, and we have no intention of moving forward with something that was intended to be a collaborative and constructive endeavor.” Celermajer said Synthetix will continue evaluating opportunities for building a decentralized derivatives platform on the Ethereum mainnet . Source: Synthetix Derive community concerned on deal’s benefits Derive community members expressed concerns over the deal on the project's forum, particularly around the token exchange rate and the deal's overall benefit to the platform. Derive user “Ramjo” wrote on May 14 that the token exchange rate is “a poor reflection of the value of derive as a platform,” and the “equivalent of selling the bottom and locking in lows.” Related: Synthetix founder threatens SNX stakers with ‘the stick’ to fix SUSD depeg Another user, “AlvaroHK,” called the deal “difficult to justify,” as they claimed that Derive generates more revenue than Synthetix, and there was no clause in the agreement to stop Synthetix from “printing millions of new tokens and keep diluting us.” AlvaroHK claims Derive generates more revenue than Synthetix, which makes the deal a tall order to justify. Source: Derive “I have found the guidance that Synthetix plans to issue an additional 170 million SNX to increase its supply to 500 million from 330 million,” AlvaroHK added in a follow-up post. “Why this information is not disclosed when asked about it? It will dilute an additional 60% off the value of the offer made to Derive,” they added. Derive, which Synthetix started in 2021 as Lyra, operated as a decentralized options protocol but remained part of the Synthetix ecosystem. It eventually rebranded to Derive and took steps to operate independently from Synthetix, such as moving away from using Synthetix’s sUSD stablecoin and liquidity.

The price is now rising and might aim for an upside break above $2.450. XRP price started a decent increase above the $2.3650 zone. The price is now trading above $2.380 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.3580 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.450 resistance. XRP Price Eyes Steady Increase XRP price started a fresh downside correction in a range and traded below the $2.380 zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.3650 and $2.350 levels. The price tested the $2.3350 zone. A low was formed at $2.33360 and the price is now moving higher. There was a move above the $2.350 and $2.3650 levels. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.4315 swing high to the $2.3360 high. The price is now trading above $2.38 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.3580 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.410 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.4315 swing high to the $2.3360 high. The first major resistance is near the $2.4320 level. The next resistance is $2.450. A clear move above the $2.450 resistance might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.550 resistance or even $2.5650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.650. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.450 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.3650 level.
