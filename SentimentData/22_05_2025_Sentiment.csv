Trump will host his dinner for more than 200 of his leading memecoin investors, whose money will fill the coffers of the president's own business entities. They've reportedly been invited to his capital-area golf course, the Trump National Golf Club Washington, D.C., outside of which the memecoin buyers may encounter protesters. Some of the counter-programming for his dinner will start earlier in the day in front of the Capitol Building. At 12:45 p.m., Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, will round up other lawmakers in front of the House steps to rail against Trump, accusing him of abusing his White House powers to ""shamelessly promote and profit from a series of crypto ventures tied to himself and his family,"" according to a notice about the event. Waters will also introduce a new messaging bill ""to block Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption, once and for all."" The legislation, which is unlikely to make headway in a Republican-majority Congress, would ban presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress and their families from ""engaging in similar crypto crime."" It's the same type of ban that Democrats had been seeking to insert into crypto legislation, but Republicans have declined to let Trump-targeting language into the current digital assets bills, including the Senate stablecoin effort getting close to the finish line. Later on Wednesday at 2:30 p.m., another press conference of Democratic lawmakers will feature Senators Chris Murphy and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom have been prominent in congressional criticism against Trump's crypto actions. Murphy had introduced his own bill with a similar aim to Waters', the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act to stop federal officials from using their positions to profit from digital assets. That event — also outside the Capitol — will additionally feature Senator Jeff Merkley, who also intends to join an evening protest right outside Trump's golf course, hosted by progressive groups under the banner of Our Revolution . The message of the ""America Is Not For Sale"" rally is to push back on ""a blatant example of political access being sold to the highest bidder,"" according to the group. The guest list for the memecoin dinner hasn't been made public, but analysis of the buying of those coins suggest that the biggest spenders devoted millions for the privilege of joining the president at the event. The attendees' anonymity is part of the problem, according to critics, who say that foreign buyers are gaining access to the president without the knowledge of the public. Debate over the president's crypto ties temporarily delayed progress on the U.S. stablecoin legislation meant to set up rules for domestic issuers, but the bill got back on track this week to clear an important procedural hurdle in the Senate on Monday. Trump's team has downplayed accusations of corruption. White House official Bo Hines said last week at CoinDesk's Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto that the Trump family's crypto ventures do not pose conflicts of interest, and they have ""the right to engage in capital markets.""

The bill aims to provide clarity and legal protection for blockchain developers and service providers, ensuring they are not misclassified as money transmitters if they don’t handle user funds. Emmer said that the longer Congress delays the clarification, the greater the risk that the digital asset technology is pushed overseas, which will harm American investors and innovators. He believes that the bill provides clarification that will help the U.S. remain a leader in the crypto space. Emmer reintroduces bill to bring regulatory clarity to digital assets Today, @RepRitchie and I introduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act to protect blockchain developers and service providers that never custody consumer funds from unjust government prosecution. pic.twitter.com/nCbpHcpf1Y — Tom Emmer (@GOPMajorityWhip) May 21, 2025 Tom Emmer acknowledged that the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act reflects a thoughtful, bipartisan effort to get crypto policy right. He also revealed that they took feedback seriously from the last Congress , after a similar language was voted down, and returned with a smarter, sharper framework that protects innovation without compromising oversight. The American politician argued that the U.S. should be the global home for responsible innovation, not a place where developers are punished for building open-source software or experimenting with new technologies. “If we want to keep the next generation of builders in the United States, this kind of legal clarity is essential. We cannot afford to let outdated or misapplied regulations drive American talent and technology overseas. With this bill, we protect innovation, uphold civil liberties, and strengthen our global competitiveness in the 21st-century economy.” – Tom Emmer , Majority Whip in the U.S. House of Representatives. Peter Van Valkenburgh, executive director of Coin Center, believes that the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act is the best way to protect American crypto developers and innovators from undue regulation by prosecution. He also noted that recent misapplication of licensing laws has chilled the development of privacy and freedom-enhancing tech in the U.S. Valkenburgh acknowledged that avoiding surprise prosecutions, creating legal clarity, and encouraging free speech and software development are not partisan issues but are core American values, which BRCA codifies. BRCA bill aims to protect digital asset developers Amanda Tuminelli, executive director and chief legal officer of the DeFi Education Fund, said that the bill would protect developers of non-custodial, peer-to-peer software protocols from being unreasonably defined as operators of an unlicensed money service business under the Bank Secrecy Act. She also believes BRCA is an important step in the right direction for the development of digital assets in the U.S. and would deliver much-needed clarity to the builders of the financial future. Blockchain Association Interim CEO and head of policy, Sarah Milby, said the company is proud to support the reintroduction of the bipartisan Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. She mentioned that the bill affirms that innovators building and maintaining decentralized, non-custodial blockchain protocols should not be unfairly treated as financial intermediaries. Cody Carbone, CEO of The Digital Chamber, argued that blockchain developers, miners, and validators aren’t financial institutions but they’re builders. He believes that the bill will finally give them the freedom to build in the U.S. by clarifying that those who never hold customer assets don’t need bank-style licenses. He also urged swift passage and commended Majority Whip Emmer and Representative Ritchie Torres for championing the BRCA bill. Kristin Smith and Miller Whitehouse-Levine of the Solana Policy Institute said they’re proud to support the reintroduction of the bill since it provides the legal certainty blockchain developers and entrepreneurs need to build decentralized networks and the next generation of financial infrastructure in the U.S. Ji Hun Kim, president, and CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, said that the reintroduction of the bill will help ensure that non-custodial blockchain participants are not subject to unnecessary and technologically infeasible compliance burdens that would impede American innovation. Kim believes that the development of digital assets in the U.S. is critical to the U.S.’s national and economic security.

At $22.70, Avalanche is making progress in real world use cases. Meanwhile, another rising project Ruvi AI is getting attention for combining AI with blockchain, and we’re along for the ride. What is Ruvi AI Ruvi AI stands out by combining the power of AI with the security and transparency of blockchain. It’s focused on delivering tools to optimize workflows and decision making across industries like healthcare, logistics and finance. By using blockchain, Ruvi AI ensures its solutions are decentralized, secure and effective for complex tasks. The project has already hit some milestones. Ruvi AI launched its Beta platform, giving users early access to test its features. And it has got its first exchange listing, with more listings coming soon to bring the token to mainstream. Presale Success Story Ruvi AI’s presale was a sign of its strong market demand and potential. In Phase 1, tokens were priced at $0.01 and sold out in 2 weeks. Early investors have already seen a 50% gain in their tokens as the price increased to $0.015 in Phase 2. Experts think Ruvi AI tokens could reach $1 shortly after listing on major exchanges, so this is a great opportunity to get tokens at a discount. Investor Rewards Ruvi AI has a unique VIP rewards system to incentivize long term commitment to the project. Depending on the amount of tokens purchased, investors get bonuses that significantly boost their returns. Here are 3 investment cases: VIP Tier 2 Investing $750 at Phase 2 price of $0.015 per token gets you 50,000 tokens. As a VIP Tier 2 you get an additional 40% bonus and get 20,000 more tokens, so you’ll have 70,000 tokens. At listing price of $0.07, your tokens would be worth $4,900, 553% ROI.* If tokens reach $1, your investment would be $70,000, 9,233% ROI. VIP Tier 3 $1,500 gets you 100,000 tokens and makes you VIP Tier 3 with a 60% bonus. That’s 60,000 more tokens, so you’ll have 160,000 tokens. At $0.07, that’s $11,200, 1,020% ROI. If Ruvi AI reaches $1, that’s $160,000, 10,567% ROI. VIP Tier 5 For higher tier investors, $7,500 gets you 500,000 tokens. With VIP Tier 5 you get a 100% bonus, so your holdings double to 1,000,000 tokens. At $0.07, that’s $70,000, 833% ROI. If the token reaches $1, that’s $1,000,000, 12,233% ROI. These are the juicy opportunities Ruvi AI is offering to committed investors and the project itself. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Contributors To encourage early participation, Ruvi AI has a leaderboard rewards system for its top contributors. Investors who stand out get extra token bonuses: Top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens, worth $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens, worth $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens, worth $7,000 at 0.07 or $100,000 at 1. This is a great way to reward active participants and create a sense of community. This is more than an investment, it’s a solution to real world problems through technology. The Beta launch and exchange listing is just the beginning of what looks to be a big journey.

Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this trend, with on-chain data and analyst commentary confirming high-conviction buying. HBAR and Ethereum remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is now concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. Institutional confidence is rising as retail investors take profits, and forecasts for May call for an average BTC price of $119,798, with potential highs of $136,239 by month’s end. As Bitcoin’s momentum steadies above $100,000, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors looking for the next major wave of upside. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen a surge in whale accumulation as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% allocated to presale, and Hashex-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside if current momentum continues. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading around $2.07, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next resistance levels. As institutional adoption grows and futures products launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. HBAR: Technical Uptrend and Accumulation Hedera (HBAR) is trading between $0.19 and $0.21, showing a bullish structure after completing a five-wave impulse from April lows. Analysts highlight a support zone between $0.139 and $0.170, with targets set at $0.213 to $0.229 in the short term. As HBAR maintains its uptrend, some holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking faster upside before listings. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Whale accumulation is setting the tone for May, with Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge. With a clear listing roadmap, robust demand, and Stage 8 nearly complete, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the month. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

Many new projects release tokens without structure, leaving traders guessing on price. BlockDAG is breaking that pattern with a clear and limited presale model that combines transparency with massive upside. With demand rising and access capped by design, it’s no wonder BlockDAG is being called the top presale crypto by early adopters. So far, the project has raised more than $260 million and sold 20.9 billion coins. With the presale price frozen at $0.0020 until June 13, early backers have a rare chance to secure BDAG at a fraction of its actual value of %0.0262. Batches That Create Urgency & Build Trust BlockDAG isn’t running a typical open-ended coin sale. Its batch-based strategy puts structure into the process and rewards those who act fast. Each presale round is set at a fixed price and increases gradually, unlike dynamic pricing models that create confusion and volatility. This system helps build buyer confidence while also encouraging quick decisions. Currently in batch 28, with that tier priced at $0.0262, BlockDAG still offers a special $0.0020 entry until June 13. This mix of price clarity and urgency is one reason BlockDAG continues gaining ground as the top presale crypto for smart buyers looking for strong upside ahead of exchange listings. Keeping It Fair: Access Without Flooding the Market Many presale cryptos open the gates too wide, causing token oversupply before anything launches. BlockDAG flips that idea. Its model is open to both small and large buyers, but the limited supply in each batch keeps prices under control and demand high. That’s why the sale of 20.9 billion coins hasn’t caused price fatigue. This method of balancing availability and scarcity makes sure everyone has a shot without allowing whales to dominate the supply. That structure is a major reason why BlockDAG has become one of 2025’s most talked-about top presale crypto picks. With real momentum and triple-digit gains before launch, buyers are taking notice of the system behind the growth. 2,520% ROI and a Temporary Price You Can Still Catch In crypto, talk is cheap. What matters most are returns. And BlockDAG is already delivering those, fast. Its batch 1 price has grown over 25x, and thanks to the special $0.0020 offer, new buyers can still lock in that same early advantage until June 13. This isn’t speculation, it’s a live ROI figure backed by real presale traction. The project has already brought in $260 million during its presale alone. Buyers are tracking gains, not guessing. And with the “Go Live reveal” scheduled for June 13, BlockDAG will be announcing listings on 20 major exchanges, including MEXC, LBank, and BitMart. For anyone still waiting, this setup defines what a top presale crypto looks like: real performance, clear targets, and a small window before prices surge again. Key Highlights BlockDAG isn’t just running a presale, it’s rewriting how crypto launches should be done. By sticking to fixed pricing, controlled releases, and time-limited access, the team is creating stability in a space known for chaos. And with the special $0.0020 offer available only until June 13, late-stage buyers still have a rare chance to catch up. So far, the numbers are staggering: $260 million raised, 20.9 billion coins distributed, and a 2,520% ROI already realized by batch 1 holders. But more than the numbers, it’s the method that’s winning buyers over. For those building a high-return portfolio in 2025, BlockDAG is proving to be far more than hype.

SFM price dropped over 5 percent today despite the wider altcoin market following Bitcoin in bullish sentiment. A New York jury convicted Braden John Karony, a former CEO of the SafeMoon (SFM) crypto project, on all crucial charges earlier on Wednesday, May 21. Karony was charged by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. The verdict was a result of a two-week trial that concluded that the ex-Safemoon executives defrauded SFM investors by draining purportedly locked liquidity for their personal gains. The case prosecutor alleged that Karony alongside Thomas Smith, a former Safemoon CTO, and Kyle Nagy, the project’s creator, misappropriated millions of investors’ funds between 2021 and 2022. While Smith has already pleaded guilty to all charges and testified against Karony, Nagy remains a fugitive, allegedly in Russia. Meanwhile, Karony will remain in police custody ahead of his sentencing, with his properties worth over $1.8 million seized. Market Impact on the Safemoon Project The Safemoon project has struggled to regain market share in the recent past following the indictment of the ex-officials. The project dropped in net valuation from nearly $1 billion to about $7.5 million at the time of this writing, according to our latest crypto oracle. Following the announcement on Wednesday, SFM price dropped over 4 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $0.00002 during the late North American trading session. The Safemoon project has recorded sustained bearish sentiment in the recent past despite the wider altcoin market attempting to follow Bitcoin price in bullish sentiment.

Critics argue the event commodifies political access, allowing wealthy donors, some based overseas, to buy proximity to a U.S. president. The rally, branded “America Is Not for Sale,” will feature speeches from key Democratic figures and visual protests targeting crypto-related political fundraising. A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and activists is set to rally on May 22 in protest of President Donald Trump’s controversial meme coin dinner, raising concerns over political influence and crypto-fueled favoritism. The event, organized under the banner “America Is Not for Sale,” is a direct response to what critics say is the monetization of political access through Trump’s latest crypto initiative. Trump Slammed for ‘Selling Access’ via meme coin The event, held at Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, follows Trump’s announcement that the top 220 holders of his meme coin, $TRUMP, could apply for an exclusive dinner with him. The top 25 are said to qualify for a “VIP White House tour.” Blockchain data shows the token has raised nearly $150 million, with some attendees reportedly spending millions for the chance to meet Trump. Source: Public Citizen Opponents of the event, including members of Congress, say it crosses ethical lines. They claim the president is turning influence into a transaction. “Americans cannot and will not accept President Trump’s view that positions of power exist only to benefit the holder of that power,” said Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee. Public Citizen is organizing the rally with progressive group Our Revolution. Protesters are expected to display banners reading “STOP CRYPTO CORRUPTION” and enlarged graphics of the $TRUMP coin. Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is scheduled to speak at the rally, alongside several other Democratic figures. According to Our Revolution, some of the coin’s largest holders are based overseas, sparking additional concerns about foreign influence. Crypto industry figures, including Tron founder Justin Sun , Hyperithm co-CEO Oh Sangrok, Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu, and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, are among the known tokenholders expected to attend the dinner. According to the project , all attendees must pass background checks and cannot be from countries flagged by Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance lists. Public Citizen Co-President Robert Weissman echoed those concerns. “Trump’s solicitation schemes for money, gifts, and power are out of control,” he said. “Between his outrageous meme coin grift, his Tesla car show on the White House lawn, and his consideration to accept a gifted jumbo jet from Qatar, Trump’s priority goes to the highest bidder.” Trump Family’s Crypto Links Raise Ethics Concerns, Stall Stablecoin Legislation The dinner has also had political consequences in Washington. For example, some Democratic lawmakers have withdrawn support for crypto-related bills in protest , including the GENIUS Act, a measure focused on regulating payment stablecoins. Though the act passed a key Senate vote on May 19 , several senators voiced concern over Trump’s ties to World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform that launched its own stablecoin, USD1, in March. Critics worry the Trump family’s involvement with the company could present serious conflicts of interest. “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” said Sen. Mark Warner in a statement before the vote. Senator Chris Murphy, who opposed advancing the GENIUS Act , called for bipartisan efforts to add provisions that would bar a U.S. president from issuing stablecoins. The Senate has a chance – right now – to shut down Trump's biggest crypto coin corruption. The pending bill in the Senate regulates a kind of crypto called ""stablecoin"", but exempts the President from the ethics rules. We shouldn't pass that bill unless that loophole is closed. pic.twitter.com/eHLeCdBV9m — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) May 21, 2025 He also urged the White House to release a full list of dinner attendees, warning that many may be expecting favors in return for their token purchases. Murphy will join Senator Elizabeth Warren and representatives of Public Citizen at a press event on the evening of the dinner. California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, is planning a separate press conference on May 22. She is expected to introduce legislation to block Trump’s meme coin and curb what she calls “crypto corruption.” Meanwhile, additional protests are being organized by local Democratic groups, including the Arlington and Loudoun County Democratic Committees. “We have a moral responsibility to speak out against corruption, whatever the result may be,” said Ryan Ruzic, chair of the Loudoun County Democrats.

The Brazilian media outlet Livecoins reported that the company will raise funds to buy more Bitcoin as part of its newly established treasury strategy. Earlier this month, Méliuz became Brazil’s first stock market-listed BTC treasury company, s pending almost $28.5 million to buy BTC 274.52 . Méliuz (CASH3) share prices on the Brazilian B3 exchange over the past six months. (Source: Google Finance) Méliuz: Bitcoin Plans in Pipeline The company will continue to buy BTC in the weeks ahead. In a statement, the company declared its intention to raise no less than 150 million real ($26.5 million) on “new BTC acquisitions.” The firm said it had told its shareholders about its intentions and was now “evaluating” its fundraising options. Méliuz CEO Israel Salmen said the company would look to an “issuance of shares or convertible debt” in its search for funding. The firm added that it was working with the São Paulo-based investment banking firm BTG Pactual on its plan. BTG Pactual will act as a coordinator when Méliuz has the funds in place to complete its next BTC purchase. Marcio Loures Penna, Méliuz’s Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Governance, confirmed that the company may issue financial assets “representing debt securities.” These may either be convertible into shares or offered in a non-convertible form, he added. The company may alternatively choose to carry out a primary public offering for common shares, with possible subscription bonuses. Méliuz said that while its goal remains raising 150 million real, it may spend even more “if opportunities arise.” However, the firm warned that its plans remain provisional. It said that it would need to complete an evaluation process before it finalized its next BTC buy. @MeliuzBitcoin #CASH3 announced yesterday that it is evaluating a potential capital raise to expand its Bitcoin strategy, through the issuance of shares or convertible debt. BTG has been engaged to coordinate a potential public offering. — Israel Salmen (@IsraelSalmen) May 20, 2025 When Could Méliuz Make Its Next BTC Purchase? Méliuz also refused to put a timeline on its fundraising efforts or its eventual Bitcoin buy. Earlier this month, the fintech player uveiled details of its first Bitcoin buy, as well as news that its shareholders have “approved, by a wide majority, the transformation of Méliuz into the first listed Bitcoin treasury company in Brazil.” The company currently holds BTC 320.2. Penna added that Méliuz “will keep its shareholders and the market informed of any news” on its next BTC buy. He vowed that the firm would act “in line with best corporate governance practices and in accordance with applicable legislation and regulations.” Méliuz was founded in 2011. Its services include cashback and voucher offerings for online and brick-and-mortar retailers, in addition to the Méliuz credit card. The firm launched a successful $103 million initial public offering on the Brazilian B3 exchange in November 2020.

Coins like XRP and Cardano have dazzled investors with massive rallies and impressive utility stories. It’s easy to get caught up chasing the echoes of these established titans. But history shows us that the truly life-changing gains, the elusive 1000x returns, rarely come from the well-known giants already in the spotlight. Instead, they hide in the shadows, in projects so new that only a few insiders have their eyes on them. If you want to build real wealth in crypto, the smart move is to look beyond yesterday’s winners. The real fortune often lies in pre-exchange tokens, those hidden gems in their infancy. This is where the savvy “smart money” is parking bets, scooping up tokens before the market catches on. And today, we’re pulling back the curtain on one such opportunity. XRP (XRP): Riding High on Waves of Adoption and Anticipation XRP remains one of the crypto market’s heavy hitters . As of May 17, 2025, XRP trades at $2.41 and holds a solid position as the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market cap . Its continued strength is backed by adoption in cross-border payments and a community eager for regulatory clarity. Market forecasts suggest XRP could nearly double, potentially reaching $5.00 within the next four weeks. This optimism stems from ongoing developments and a resurgence of interest in digital payment rails. While XRP’s rise is impressive, its story is well-known and widely priced in by now. Cardano (ADA): The Deliberate Ascent of a Research-Driven Powerhouse Cardano has carved a niche as a research-first blockchain platform focused on security, scalability, and sustainability. At $0.7719 and ranking 9th in market cap , Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem methodically. Analysts project a climb toward $0.9950 over the coming month, fueled by upcoming protocol upgrades and growing DeFi activity on its network. Cardano’s steady, science-backed approach makes it a dependable player, but this slow and steady pace means explosive gains are rarer. The “Off-Radar” Multiplier: Why Pre-Exchange Gems Hold Explosive Potential Here’s the crucial insight: once tokens hit major exchanges, the early explosive growth phases are usually behind them. The crowd has caught on, valuations rise, and the easy gains diminish. The real 1000x plays live in the shadows : projects still in presale or the earliest community stages, where risk is high but rewards are unmatched. These are the tokens still flying under the radar, awaiting discovery by sharp-eyed investors who know where to look. Unveiling the Enigma: Introducing OpenFundNet (OFNT)—The Community’s Best-Kept Secret Meet OpenFundNet (OFNT) , a pre-exchange token quietly building momentum as the next big player in decentralized crowdfunding. While few are talking about it yet, OFNT’s mission is clear: fix the trust, fee, and accessibility problems plaguing traditional crowdfunding by leveraging Web3 technology. Currently in presale or early stages, OFNT offers an unprecedented opportunity to get in before the public stampede. This stealth positioning means early supporters could reap outsized rewards as the platform and token gain visibility. The Anatomy of a Giant Slayer: What Gives OFNT its 1000x DNA? OFNT’s blueprint for massive growth rests on innovative features that solve real-world issues: Validator-Driven Trust: Unlike traditional platforms riddled with opaque vetting, OFNT uses a validator system to score and approve projects. This transparency builds genuine trust and quality control, attracting serious backers. Zero Platform Fees: OFNT’s zero-fe e model means creators receive more funding and backers’ contributions go further. This no-extraction approach is a game-changer in an industry notorious for high fees. Dual Rewards & Emission Engine: The tokenomics reward both backers and validators daily with token emissions. This creates an engaged, sustainable ecosystem fueling continuous growth and participation. The Ground-Floor Window: OFNT’s Presale—Your Entry Before the Public Stampede Here’s where it gets exciting. OFNT has allocated 10% of its total token supply specifically for the presale phase. This limited window is a rare ground-floor chance to secure tokens at favorable terms before they hit major exchanges. Participation is streamlined; early buyers can join using widely accepted cryptocurrencies like USDT. This accessibility ensures that the early community can grow quickly, setting the stage for explosive network effects. Beyond Price Pumps: OFNT’s Vision for a Self-Sustaining Crowdfunding Universe OFNT is more than just a speculative token. Its vision is to build a decentralized, community-governed crowdfunding platform that is self-sustaining and scalable. Governance tokens empower holders to vote on critical platform decisions, ensuring the project evolves with its community’s needs. Combined with deflationary mechanisms like scheduled emission halvings , OFNT’ s design supports long-term token scarcity and value appreciation. This isn’t a flash in the pan; it’s a foundation for lasting impact. The Final Whisper: Position Yourself in OFNT Before the Market Shouts Its Name XRP and Cardano have proven their value, but the real game-changers for exponential gains are hidden pre-exchange tokens like OFNT. This opportunity offers early adopters a shot at massive returns by backing a project built on trust, innovation, and community power. If you’re ready to move beyond the obvious and claim your spot in the future of decentralized crowdfunding , now is the time to research OpenFundNet . Join their growing community channels and get in before the market wakes up to this sleeping giant. The whispers are growing louder; don’t miss your chance before the crowd rushes in.

However, the latest on-chain data reveals that despite elevated unrealized profits, there are still no signs of increased selling pressure for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Unrealized Profits Remain High But No Panic Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by Bitcoin analyst Crazzyblockk, the cohort of new investors – those who have held BTC for less than one month – is currently sitting on unrealized profits of 6.9%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? In the same vein, short-term investors – holders who have held Bitcoin for less than six months – are sitting on unrealized profits of 10.7%. These figures highlight that the unrealized profit/loss ratio remains elevated, with unrealized profits far outweighing unrealized losses. Crazzyblockk noted that while historically, a high percentage of unrealized profits across the network tends to precede sharp price corrections, the current setup appears different. They added: Past cycles have shown that extreme profit concentration tends to precede volatility; however, current market structure shows no outsized concentration of risk in one participant group. The relatively narrow spread in unrealized profits between new and short-term holders indicates that profit distribution is balanced. Furthermore, although profit levels are high, loss levels remain compressed, suggesting limited pressure from distressed sellers. The contributor remarked: While macro conditions and volatility risk remain elevated, and a price correction cannot be ruled out, there is no strong behavioral signal suggesting a high willingness to trigger major distribution or selling. Further Upside For BTC? Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently predicted further upside for Bitcoin. In a post on X, Martinez noted that BTC has undergone another bullish breakout, with the potential to reach a new all-time high (ATH) around $111,500. The current momentum has also drawn in retail investors. According to CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Aleman, wallets holding less than $10,000 worth of BTC are steadily returning to the market – a sign of growing retail participation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cycle Indicator Hints At Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says That said, some warning signs may still dampen BTC’s current bullish trajectory. For instance, despite the recent encouraging price action, Bitcoin’s Demand Momentum remains subdued. Similarly, Bitcoin’s “supply scarcity” narrative still lacks meaningful strength, as Aleman recently stressed that despite depleting exchange reserves, BTC is not likely to face genuine supply scarcity in the near term. At press time, BTC trades at $106,528, up 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges that Ian Patrick Jackson, 37, conspired with another Atlanta man to recruit at least nine business owners to submit fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications using fake tax documents. Jackson allegedly told the business owners to falsely claim they each employed 16 individuals and paid monthly wages of $120,000. The DOJ says the owners then wrote falsified payroll checks to people who didn’t work for them and then either kept the money for themselves or paid Jackson via his co-conspirator. Jackson is allegedly connected to 15 fraudulent COVID-19 relief loan applications that inked $3.39 million in proceeds. He’s the 12th person to be charged in connection with an Atlanta-based PPP fraud ring, with the 11 previous defendants having already pled guilty or been convicted at trial. The DOJ says authorities have recovered nearly $1.2 million of the defrauded funds. Jackson also allegedly applied for a separate $237,500 PPP loan using fabricated tax forms and used a forged driver’s license and false revenue statements to fraudulently apply for approximately $100,000 in PPP and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program loans. The DOJ also says he fraudulently secured another $240,035 PPP loan and $125,000 in EIDL program loans and grants on behalf of another company. Jackson has been charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, two counts of bank fraud, two counts of wire fraud and two counts of money laundering. The charges could result in decades in prison.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano Are Still Considered Major Summer Setups",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/500-into-500k-magacoin-finance-xrp-and-cardano-are-still-considered-major-summer-setups/,"As Bitcoin’s latest rally fuels confidence across the market, investors are scanning for the next wave of altcoins with exponential upside. While BTC dominates the headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects with room to outperform as capital rotates outward. This summer, MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano are emerging as top setups for outsized gains as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity. Still trading under $0.07, the project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. MAGA’s $0.007 listing target and scarcity-driven tokenomics have analysts calling for 34x–40x returns—and some models point to even more extreme upside if current momentum continues. What sets MAGA apart is not just its viral political narrative, but its transparent tokenomics, Hashex audit, and a presale structure attracting both retail and whale capital. As Stage 8 nears completion, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure early exposure before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges. In a market searching for the next SHIBA or DOGE, MAGA’s combination of community energy, clear roadmap, and realistic price targets puts it at the top of many watchlists. XRP: Futures Launch and ETF Buzz XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as the CME Futures launch and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Legal clarity in the U.S. and growing payment adoption have analysts forecasting a move beyond $5 in the short term, with $15–$30 possible if key catalysts align. While a $100 price remains a stretch, the infrastructure being built by Ethereum, Cardano, and new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the real drivers of the next major run. Cardano (ADA): Quiet Accumulation and Summer Breakout Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.85 as of May 2025, with forecasts calling for a steady climb to $1.05 by July and $1.50 by October. Developers have returned, and on-chain metrics are starting to improve. If ADA delivers on upcoming milestones, it could surprise investors with a strong recovery this summer. Many Cardano stakers are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher near-term upside, as ADA’s slow pace gives way to more aggressive early-stage plays. Litecoin and Bitcoin: Steady Anchors, But Seeking Momentum Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $103.77, showing steady accumulation but facing resistance near $105. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding above $103,000, with May price predictions between $110,000–$115,000 as institutional interest remains strong. While both remain core holdings, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward more nimble early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion As summer kicks off, the 2025 cycle is creating new lanes for growth. XRP and Cardano bring proven value, but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s introducing the kind of high-reward opportunity this market thrives on. With narrative strength, market traction, and investor interest all converging, MAGACOIN FINANCE could still be the next great crypto success story. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

The rising optimism of an altseason amid the re-emergence of FOMO traders will help $B sustain bullish sentiment. A recently launched memecoin on the BSC chain dubbed BUILDon (B) rallied over 150 percent in the last 24 hours to trade above $0.1 on Wednesday, during the late North American trading session. The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $102 million and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $60 million, recorded staggering gains after an endorsement from Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI). According to an X post, the WLFI project purchased an undisclosed amount of $B tokens following its recent move to use the USD1 stablecoin as its base pair. “We just bought some $B to support the BUILDon team. Love seeing projects choose $USD1 as their base pair — faster settlement, deeper liquidity, and growth every day. We hope to see more tokens make the switch,” the announcement noted . What Next for BUILDon Following the WLFI Support The BUILDon memecoin has attracted more than 13k on-chain holders after a net pooled USD1 of over 842k to provide liquidity. The BSC mascot is well positioned to rally further in the coming days amid the rising demand for memecoins following the Bitcoin price pump towards a new all-time high. https://twitter.com/buildonbsc_ai/status/1925314302292238396?s=46 Furthermore, the memecoin culture on the BNB chain has gained significant traction in the recent past following the deliberate decision by Binance to support project developers.

Prosecutors argued that Karony’s actions resulted in the misappropriation of millions of dollars from investors. Following a 12-day trial before US District Judge Eric R. Komitee, Korony was convicted of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. He faces up to 45 years in prison when sentenced. The jury took only a few hours to reach their decision after a trial that lasted about two weeks, during which Karony insisted he was innocent. A jury also ordered the forfeiture of one residential property and the proceeds from the sale of another, amounting to roughly $2 million. According to prosecutors, the scheme undermined investor confidence in digital assets and contributed to broader concerns about fraud in the crypto market. “The SafeMoon digital asset was anything but safe and turned out to be pie in the sky for investors who were deliberately misled by Karony, a man who sought to get rich quick by stealing and diverting millions of dollars,” US Attorney Joseph Nocella, Jr. said in a statement . Jury finds Karony guilty of conspiracy, money laundering, and wire fraud In the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the jury determined that Karony was involved in a conspiracy to defraud the United States, as well as money laundering and wire fraud. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys presented their arguments during the trial that began with jury selection on May 5. The criminal trials against the executive of a cryptocurrency company were widely viewed as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the acting US Attorney for the district, would approach cases of digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump nominee, began serving duty this month. The case began in 2023 with the arrests of Karony, former Chief Technology Officer Thomas Smith, and SafeMoon founder Kyle Nagy. Prosecutors alleged Karony and his “co-conspirators” misled investors about the structure and safety of SafeMoon, a token issued in 2021 that applied a 10% transaction tax on transfers. Half of that fee was purportedly redistributed to token holders, while the remainder was said to be locked in a liquidity pool to support trading. The Justice Department said Karony and others retained access to the liquidity pool and diverted substantial funds for personal use. During the trial, Smith testified against Karony, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and remained at large as of May 21. It was, however, unclear when Karony will be back in court for a sentencing hearing. He could spend over 40 years in prison for his role in defrauding and money laundering activities. On the other hand, Smith, who is said to have agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors, stands to get a lighter sentence. Karony’s trial came after a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York; a judge sentenced him to a 12-year prison term following a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison after going to trial, having previously maintained his innocence. Karony takes to social media to proclaim innocence as trial unfolds Karony turned to social media to defend himself, claiming he was innocent as his trial for fraud and money laundering charges started in New York. This came after he shared an X post on May 6, likely after the court proceedings had concluded for the day. He declared that he was innocent and did not commit fraud in response to news coverage about his trial. The trial, which is expected to last until May 26, has received less media coverage than other crypto cases, like the sentencing of former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Following Karony’s pleading not guilty to charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering, he had been out on a $3 million bond since February 2024. As the public eagerly waits for Karony’s sentencing hearing in court, fear has struck them as this is yet another crypto executive’s involvement in a fraud case. Investors may, therefore, decide to hold back, their investment dragging crypto space development behind.

CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch Before Stage 9 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing serious attention as Stage 8 approaches its final phase, with over $8 million raised and a hard listing target of $0.007. Unlike legacy coins where much of the upside is already priced in, MAGA offers structured scarcity, surging demand, and transparent price discovery. Analysts are projecting a 35x–40x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum continues. Whale allocations, rapid presale sellouts, and a capped 100 billion token supply audited by HashEx are positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare ground-floor opportunity for Q2 and Q3 2025. Bitcoin: Macro Momentum and Whale Accumulation Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, having gained over 14% in the past 30 days and holding well above $100,000 7 . On-chain data shows major wallets accumulating, with ETF inflows stabilizing and analysts forecasting a plausible rally toward $150,000 if current trends hold. As Bitcoin’s macro narrative strengthens, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefitting from increased capital rotation. XRP: Derivatives, ETFs, and Global Settlement XRP is trading at $2.35, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. The launch of CME futures and growing ETF speculation are fueling institutional interest, while legal clarity and Ripple’s expanding partnerships are setting the stage for XRP to serve as a global settlement infrastructure asset. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end, with $15 as a stretch target if ETF adoption accelerates. As institutional flows grow, many investors are also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside. Solana: Whale Accumulation and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $169.25, up 1.84% in the last 24 hours, and has rebounded over 50% from recent lows. Whale accumulation is accelerating, with large wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges and analysts now eyeing the $200 level as a short-term target. While $1,000 remains a bold call, Solana’s bullish momentum is undeniable, but the most aggressive capital is also moving into MAGACOIN FINANCE for earlier, higher-multiple potential. NEAR Protocol: Quiet Growth and Breakout Potential NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is trading at $2.76, up 1% in the past 24 hours. Its developer ecosystem and integrations are expanding, but NEAR still lags the market leaders in momentum. As capital seeks undervalued networks, many NEAR holders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early-stage, high-upside exposure. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Smart capital is converging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin as the top altcoin picks for the 2025 bull run. With Stage 8 nearly full, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

The Australian Securities and Investment Commission said on May 21 that it wants to ask the High Court of Australia to clarify what the definition of a financial product is and clarify the circumstances when an interest-earning product and the conversion of assets from one form to another are regulated. “The definition of financial product was drafted in a broad and technology-neutral way, and ASIC believes it is in the public interest to clarify this,” the watchdog said. “This clarification is important as it applies to all financial products and services whether they involve crypto-assets or not.” On April 22, Federal Court Justices David O’Callaghan, Wendy Abraham and Catherine Button found that Block Earner’s crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product is not a financial product , a managed investment scheme or a derivative under the Corporations Act. ASIC said the court will consider its application. Special leave is required in an appeal to the High Court, and it’s only granted in cases where it would answer significant legal questions or matters of public interest. A Block Earner spokesperson told Cointelegraph the matter has now escalated to a “broader legal question” around the definition of a financial product, which extends “well beyond Block Earner, and the crypto sector.” “We believe the Full Federal Court’s April ruling was a strong and well-reasoned decision that upheld the integrity of our operations,” the spokesperson said. “We remain confident in the soundness of that judgment and will respond to ASIC’s application through the appropriate legal channels.” Legal saga ongoing since 2022 ASIC first launched legal proceedings against Block Earner in November 2022, arguing the company needed a financial services license to offer its yield product, which was available from March 17, 2022, until the company shut it down on Nov. 16, 2022. Related: Australia outlines crypto regulation plan, promises action on debanking ASIC was arguing Block Earner needed a financial services license to offer its crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product. Source: ASIC In February 2024, an Australian court initially ruled the fintech firm would need a financial services license to operate its crypto yield-bearing products . Another June 2024 ruling in Australia’s Federal Court released Block Earner from any financial penalties because it had “acted honestly” and pursued its legal opinions before launching the products, which ASIC appealed. Block Earner appealed the Federal Court’s decision that it needed a financial services license on July 9, 2024.

As one of the top cryptocurrencies in the market, SOL’s momentum is hard to ignore, but its already-high price point has some investors searching elsewhere for more explosive upside. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a cheap crypto with analysts projecting a possible surge to $5, and potentially even faster than Solana can get to $500. Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale offers tokens at a price of $0.03 per unit. Acquisition by more than 11,000 presale buyers has produced a robust investor backing that has raised $9 million. Buyers of Mutuum Finance Phase tokens during this phase get 100% profit at the projected $0.06 launch price. For those asking what crypto to buy now with high ROI potential, this low-price altcoin might just be the unexpected frontrunner of 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: Path to $500 Still Intact Solana (SOL) is also cementing its position as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, as analysts forecast a push higher to $500 during this bull run. SOL is currently trading at approximately $170 and is riding a high of new developers’ activity, DeFi integration, and meme coin resurgence, all of which are restoring investors’ confidence. The anticipation of a Solana ETF also fuels the speculation that SOL will hit this ambitious price level sooner or later. As institutional interest grows and on-chain metrics persist in strengthening, Solana remains a core holding for those seeking exposure to blue-chip altcoins. Some traders are turning to lower-priced alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for even greater upside, though. Mutuum Finance Presale The project has surpassed a significant milestone as its presale accumulates more than $9 million from participants who have exceeded 11,000 in number. Since Phase 5 initiation the MUTM token value has increased to $0.03 and will steadily grow up to launch at $0.06. Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish direct loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P model because this system represents a superior way of managing assets. Users benefit from automated security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. Strategic Growth & Community Rewards The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing (staking rewards) mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings of new exchanges will improve inter-user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its first users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the most aggressively backed presale tokens of 2025, with over $9 million raised and more than 11,000 investors already onboard. Currently priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, MUTM is on track to hit $0.06 at launch, offering early buyers a projected 100% return before public trading even begins. Secure your position before the next price jump, or risk watching one of 2025’s biggest gainers take off without you.

In contrast, Pi Network (PI) is struggling with a sharp 35% price drop, raising concerns over liquidity and market confidence. While these events unfold, Web3 ai ($WAI) remains focused on growth, positioning itself for future success. Web3 ai is progressing through Stage 5 of its presale for $0.000365. The confirmed listing price of $0.005242 suggests a potential 1747% return. The project features an AI-powered DeFi Yield Farming Advisor, which offers real-time risk assessment and return optimisation. This tool aims to simplify complex farming decisions, making it a reliable choice for those seeking to secure value in the volatile crypto space. XRP’s Whale-Fueled Rally Raises Market Expectations XRP has reached a two-month high, driven by large-scale wallet transactions involving millions of coins. Analysts believe these movements suggest whales may be positioning themselves for a larger market shift. XRP’s price surged beyond previous resistance levels, signalling strong upward momentum. Despite ongoing regulatory concerns, the recent price spike has attracted short-term traders, as whale transactions often signal upcoming market shifts. As large holders consolidate their positions, the rising interest in XRP might indicate a potential buying opportunity, particularly if this momentum persists, making it an asset to monitor closely. Pi Network Faces Volatility After 35% Drop Pi Network’s coin recently saw a sharp 35% drop, adding to the price volatility. The coin had previously experienced a rally, but the quick sell-off following that increase has raised doubts about its long-term stability. Speculation suggests that early holders might be cashing out, contributing to the price decline. This has led to concerns about the network’s liquidity and overall stability. Despite these issues, Pi Network’s large user base and active development efforts still keep it in the spotlight. While the risk remains high, there may still be opportunities for a price rebound if it stabilises. Web3 ai’s DeFi Yield Farming Advisor Sets It Apart from Market Volatility DeFi farming can deliver high rewards, but it also carries significant risks. Without effective risk management, buyers may face quick losses. Web3 ai addresses this issue with its AI-powered DeFi Yield Farming Advisor, designed to help buyers navigate the complexities of yield farming. The tool that would be functional at launch monitors farming pools, smart contracts, and market shifts in real time, reducing the likelihood of costly mistakes. Unlike platforms that only show annual percentage yields (APYs), Web3 ai provides a detailed overview of farming opportunities. It analyses risks and rewards, enabling more informed and strategic decisions. The tool would work seamlessly in the background, so buyers can benefit without needing to constantly track their assets. Currently, the WAI coin is available in Stage 5 of the presale at $0.000365. The expected listing price of $0.005242 offers a potential return of 1747%. With over $4.5 million raised, Web3 ai is gaining traction and positioning itself as an essential tool for those looking to navigate DeFi farming with confidence. This AI-driven platform is designed to help buyers take advantage of the opportunities within DeFi farming while avoiding the risks that often come with it. The combination of real-time monitoring and comprehensive insights makes Web3 ai a valuable addition to any DeFi strategy. Conclusion XRP whale activity and Pi Network’s volatility may generate short-term excitement, but they fail to offer lasting user value. XRP’s price rise, fueled by whale transactions and Pi Network’s erratic behaviour, highlights how sentiment can shift quickly in the crypto market. In contrast, Web3 ai brings real long-term value through its AI-powered DeFi Yield Farming Advisor. This tool, set to launch with the platform, will help users manage risk and maximise returns, offering practical, ongoing utility. Currently priced at just $0.000365 in Stage 5 and aiming for a $0.005242 listing, Web3 ai presents a strong 1,747% ROI opportunity. With over $4.5 million already raised, market confidence is clearly growing, positioning Web3 ai as a reliable asset with long-term potential.

44930324,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=755951,1747875610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/44930324.jpeg,Solana’s BONK Targets 77% Corrective Move After Retrace To 200 EMA,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bonk/bonk-target-77-corrective-move/,"BONK’s price action has been back and forth in May, and the cryptocurrency is now essentially back where it started the month. Recent price action reveals that the token is attempting to stabilize at around the 200 EMA after being rejected by the local high near the 0.00002581 level. This rejection led to a measured pullback towards $0.00001820. However, according to a technical analysis on the TradingView platform, the retrace appears to be forming a bullish continuation setup with a 77% corrective move in view rather than indicating a bearish reversal. Bullish Market Structure Holds Firm For BONK BONK’s price retracement has brought it directly into a zone of heavy technical interest. At the heart of this confluence lies the 200 EMA on the 4-hour timeframe, which could technically serve as the next support zone for the meme coin moving forward. In addition, the retracement aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is commonly associated with bullish corrections. It also aligns with a daily support zone around $0.00001832 to $0.00001841 and a resistance zone around $0.00002034. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin, Analyst Says Solana Meme Coin “BONK” Is About To Explode Interestingly, this movement has led to a consolidation between these levels since May 15, and according to the TradingView analyst, the price structure suggests buyers are stepping in to defend the trend. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a higher low. From a volume standpoint, each upward impulse has shown rising volume since the first week of April. However, the recent decline occurred on diminishing volume, hinting at exhaustion from sellers. 77% Upside Move If BONK Breaks Above Resistance Even with the current range, BONK is still within a bullish setup that could send it towards a new 2025 high and possibly towards its current all-time high levels. The important level to watch now is the point of control (POC) resistance at approximately $0.00001955. This level previously acted as the pivot point before the pullback and now serves as the threshold for bullish continuation. Related Reading: This Dogecoin Rival Is Set For An Over 100% Pump – It’s Not Shiba Inu A confirmed close above this region would likely trigger a rapid expansion move toward the next resistance cluster around $0.00002581, before eventually reaching the predicted price target of $0.00003243, which would bring it close to its January 2025 open of $0.000035. As such, the projected target if this plays out will translate to a 77% rally. The price target also aligns with a previous swing high on January 15 and January 18. At the time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.00001995, up by 1,6% in the past 24 hours. Its reaction here, just above the POC resistance, will be an important deciding factor. If buyers manage to maintain pressure and secure a decisive breakout, the stage could be set for a strong rally into the upper resistance band and a retest of BONK’s 2025 swing high.

Ethereum Trading Outlook Softens & Pepe Meme Trend Grows",https://thecoinrise.com/unstaked-presale-to-bring-2700-roi-for-buyers-ethereum-trading-outlook-softens-pepe-meme-trend-grows/,"In today’s changing crypto environment, Ethereum (ETH), Pepe (PEPE), and Unstaked are each drawing attention for different reasons. While the Ethereum trading outlook hints at a short-term drop, despite a 60% rally in the past month, the Pepe (PEPE) meme trend is gaining momentum, almost doubling in value in 30 days, thanks to its viral appeal. But beyond price spikes and volatility, Unstaked is positioning itself differently. Backed by a real utility model and AI-powered tools, Unstaked has already raised over $6.5 million and is advancing quickly through its Stage 13 AI presale, currently priced at just $0.009267. This may be the beginning of something built to last. Pepe’s Price Push Continues Pepe Coin has soared nearly 98% in 30 days, pushing its market cap above $5.7 billion and making it one of the biggest meme coins right now. Trading at $0.0000136, it enjoys strong liquidity and a loyal community. While some technical indicators suggest it might be overbought, analysts still see potential for PEPE to reach $0.000033 by June. Ethereum Trading Outlook Hints at Pullback Ethereum is currently trading at $2,564, showing a 3% gain over the past day and a 60% jump in the last month. Despite that strength, analysts believe a pullback could be on the horizon. Some are forecasting a dip to $2,258 by May 17, a potential 11.6% decline. Still, the Ethereum trading outlook remains mostly positive overall. ETH’s RSI is at 78.92, which indicates it might be overbought in the short term, but many indicators show strength. ETH continues to trade above its 200-day average, and the Fear & Greed Index is reading “Greed,” a sign that optimism is still widespread. For long-term holders, a price correction could be an ideal entry point before Ethereum’s next potential leg up. Unstaked’s AI Ecosystem Offers Real Value and 2,700% ROI Potential Unstaked is not riding trends, it’s building tech. At the heart of its platform is an AI-powered system that allows users to launch autonomous agents across social platforms like X, Telegram, and Discord. These agents engage, post, manage communities, and help execute tasks in real time. What makes Unstaked different is its Proof of Intelligence system. Every action by an agent is tracked on-chain, turning real engagement into real earnings. Instead of just holding tokens, users power AI agents that deliver measurable results. With a current price of $0.009267 in Stage 13 and an estimated launch price of $0.1819, this AI presale offers a possible 2,700% return. Unstaked has already raised over $6.5 million across 13 presale batches. Its $1 million giveaway adds to the momentum, with 20 winners set to receive $50,000 each.

While Solana, Bitcoin, and XRP continue to dominate the top tier, one new contender is rapidly capturing trader attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 now live, over $8 million raised, and whale inflows accelerating, traders from across the ecosystem—including major Solana and Bitcoin holders—are pivoting toward what’s now ranked as one of the most explosive breakout candidates of Q2 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Driver Fueling Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin is holding strong at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC since mid-April. Institutional inflows and ETF demand remain robust, with May price forecasts calling for an average of $121,351 and potential highs of $137,264. As BTC consolidates above $100K, capital is flowing into high-upside altcoins—MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the top of that list for traders seeking the next 10,000% run. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The #1 Breakout Entry of the Moment MAGACOIN FINANCE has seen a surge in whale accumulation as its presale advances, with over $8 million raised and the price still under $0.001. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% in presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025. Analysts forecast 35x–185x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside if current momentum continues. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3. With Stage 8 nearly full and listings approaching, this is the entry window to watch. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading at $2.07, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next resistance levels. As institutional adoption grows and futures products launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. Solana: Whale Buying and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $166.71, consolidating after a sharp rally and drawing attention from large investors. Whale accumulation is on the rise, with major wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges in recent days. Analysts are targeting $200 as the next major resistance, but many are also rotating into presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater potential returns. Ethereum and Aptos: Quiet Accumulation, Early-Stage Rotation Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, rebounding from recent lows and showing renewed technical strength. With DeFi growth and ETF speculation, ETH is poised for a potential breakout toward $2,750–$2,900 in the coming months. Aptos (APT) is also seeing quiet accumulation, but as capital seeks sharper upside, more traders are rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Final Thoughts Bitcoin and Solana whales are moving first, but XRP traders are quickly following as MAGACOIN FINANCE cements itself as 2025’s most-watched presale. With robust demand, a clear listing roadmap, and analysts projecting 35x–185x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

33767162,[object Object],1747877435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Makes Meaningful Correction: Key Pullback Pattern Points To Looming Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-meaningful-correction/,"Popular dog-themed meme coin, Dogecoin , may have witnessed a bearish performance in the last few days, but this waning price action could benefit its price dynamics. Technical developments show that the current pullback is a signal of an impending major rally in DOGE’s price. Bullish Structure Forming On Dogecoin Chart After a period of bullish performance, Dogecoin’s price experienced a retracement , which led to a correction or consolidation phase. However, recent analysis from Trader Tardigrade, a seasoned crypto analyst and investor, reveals that the correction phase is about to come to an end, and a rally is just around the corner. In the analysis shared on the X platform, Trader Tardigrade stated that DOGE is gearing up for a major rise as a key technical pattern emerges on the daily chart, a typical sign of a possible uptrend. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is currently consolidating within this key structure, often associated with trend continuation after cooling off from recent highs. Specifically, the meme coin has formed a Channel Pullback. Combined with stable support levels and rising market sentiment, this channel formation raises the possibility that DOGE is preparing for a significant rise in the upcoming days. Looking at the chart, this channel pullback previously appeared between late April and early May. Following a breakout from the pattern, Dogecoin saw a notable rise from $0.17 to $0.25 in less than a week. With the structure reappearing, the expert contends that a breakout , which he believes is inevitable, is likely to trigger a similar upward trend. Should the breakout mirror the previous scenario, Trader Tardigrade has predicted a surge from current price levels to the $0.265 mark. DOGE’s reclaiming this level in tandem with significant buying pressure might act as a launchpad to a continued rally toward higher targets . Dogecoin’s bullish signal extends beyond the 1-day chart. In another post , Trader Tardigrade highlighted a growing momentum in the 3-day time frame, which increases the potential for a rebound. Following his examination of the 3-day chart, the expert found an Expanding Triangle formation, a key reversal pattern after a widening consolidation phase . Given that the market is slowly turning positive, a breakout from the pattern is expected to cause a rally to $0.275 and beyond. A Remarkable Price Growth For DOGE Incoming A view of a much larger time frame shows that DOGE’s price is headed for a new all-time high before the ongoing cycle concludes. Trader Tardigrade has underlined the recurrence of a bullish structure that triggered a massive bullish move for the meme coin on the 6-month time frame. During the 2017 and 2021 cycles, this macro pattern kick-started DOGE’s final rally all the way to its peak in each cycle. While the structure has reemerged, Trader Tardigrade foresees a similar spike that could lead to a cycle top for Dogecoin. The expert chart reveals that the meme coin might reach a top from the $6 level and above.",Dogecoin|Consolidation Phase|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Expanding Triangle Formation|Macro Pattern|meme coin|Pullback Channel Pattern|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-22 01:30:35

The VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund is expected to launch in June 2025. It will direct strategic capital to companies with real-world use cases issuing tokens on the Avalanche network. Unlike many crypto funds that pursue hype or short-term momentum, this is a fund that looks over the horizon. It aims to support mission-driven entrepreneurs building lasting value through blockchain-enabled technology. It goes after companies launching tokens with actual utility — not just speculation. The fund will make liquid token investments and early-stage venture-backed blockchain projects, focusing on areas like gaming, financial services, payments , and AI. Most investments will be made at or soon after the project’s Token Generation Event (TGE), when their tokens are first offered to the public. It’s VanEck’s play to back founders who are building for the future, not a quick pump. VanEck’s experienced team drives focused investment The team that runs the VanEck Digital Assets Alpha Fund (DAAF) will co-manage the fund . Since 2022, DAAF has garnered a reputation for investing in scalable liquid tokens associated with real-world products. And with more than $100 million in AUM, DAAF is one of the most steady performers in digital assets. This new fund builds on that success but focuses exclusively on the Avalanche network. Avalanche is now one of the most active and valuable blockchain ecosystems , with a market worth nearly $50 billion. It is recognized for its high speed, low costs, and a growing list of enterprise and decentralized applications. VanEck sees Avalanche as a hub for serious developers creating projects beyond crypto speculation. These builders are focusing on real-world sectors like fintech, real-world assets (RWAs), and artificial intelligence (AI). Capital in the bank will get put to work on-chain via Avalanche-native RWA products such as tokenized money market funds. This maintains the fund’s liquidity and supports economic activity on the Avalanche blockchain. Fund backs builders adding tangible value The PurposeBuilt Fund is about more than just capital — it’s about conviction. “The next wave of value in crypto will come from real businesses, not more infrastructure,” says Pranav Kanade, portfolio manager at VanEck Digital Assets. He thinks Avalanche has already become a beacon for intelligent founders, and the PurposeBuilt Fund hopes to offer them the financial underpinning and subsequent ongoing refuge they require. The crypto market frequently rewards short-term trends and meme coins. Yet, the founders of valuable blockchain applications often draw less attention. These earnest builders run uphill, contending for attention and capital in a noisy market. The PurposeBuilt Fund aims to change that. It provides an alternative source of patient capital that matches long-term aims. It gives developers & startup teams a framework to build for utility, adoption & longevity rather than pump-n-dump token price action. According to John Nahas, Chief Business Officer at Ava Labs, the launch of the VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund marks a turning point for the blockchain industry. He said the industry is shifting from “reality distortion to reality,” emphasizing that the focus is moving away from theoretical discussions about the technology’s potential and toward what is being built and used—and by whom. Nahas noted that the sector is evolving from one dominated by day traders to one that recognizes the true value of distributed trust. He added that the VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund provides the long-term capital and strategic support builders need to lead this transformation. Avalanche already hosts projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, AI, tokenized securities, and institutional finance. These apps are not only being adopted by the crypto native but also by traditional businesses and web2 platforms.

ProCap had boosted its IPO from $200 million to $220 million on May 20, a day before its public launch, pricing its 22 million shares on offer at $10 each. ProCap shares closed the May 21 trading day up 7% at $10.70, which continued with a 1.6% bump after-hours to $10.87, Yahoo Finance data shows. PCAPU’s share price closed up 7% on its debut trading day. Source: Yahoo Finance The company has offered underwriters a 45-day option to buy up to 3.3 million additional shares at the IPO price to cover extra demand. ProCap said in an April 30 regulatory filing that the firm will be a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) that will look to invest in, and potentially take public, companies in the financial services, digital asset, asset management or healthcare sectors. Pompliano is one of the crypto industry’s biggest cheerleaders , hosting a Bitcoin and finance-focused podcast and leading investment firm Professional Capital Management. Pompliano told CNBC on May 21 that he had been itching to take a company public over the last five years but hadn’t seen enough demand in the private market until six months ago, citing recent changes to the US regulatory landscape affecting financial markets. Related: Texas House passes strategic Bitcoin reserve bill He hinted that his blank-check firm would invest in crypto-native and traditional finance businesses as he expects the sectors to converge in the coming years. “The reason why I use the term financial services is basically the new digital world and the old incumbent world are all merging.” SPACs haven’t been done right in the past, Pomp says On CNBC, Pompliano was pressed on why he chose to make ProCap a SPAC, which have historically seen high failure rates due to sponsor conflicts, dilution, speculative valuations and regulatory scrutiny. Pompliano said SPACs have gotten a bad reputation because companies often treat them like public venture capital, targeting high-growth companies that are losing a lot of money at high valuations. Pompliano noted he has put “millions of dollars” of his own money on the line. “We’ve got real skin in the game,” Pompliano said, adding: “I’m taking a huge reputation risk.” Brent Saunders, CEO of health products firm Bausch + Lomb, also joined as a strategic adviser . Saunders completed over $300 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions over the last 17 years.

Thirty-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields catapulted to 3.15% this week, eclipsing every prior high since the tenor’s 1999 debut. That print triggered an instant warning from the markets newsletter The Kobeissi Letter: “Japan’s bond market is imploding… Japan’s 30Y Government Bond Yield has officially surged to its highest level in history, at 3.15%. For decades, Japan was known for low long-term interest rates. Now they are dealing with high inflation, shifting policy outlook, and a whopping 260% Debt-to-GDP ratio.” Liquidity, always fragile at the long end of Tokyo’s curve, vanished just hours later. From New York, Zerohedge relayed traders’ disbelief: “This is unbelievable: for the second day in a row, Japan’s bond market is bidless, with both 30Y and 40Y JGB yields at record highs. Meanwhile, as the world’s 2nd biggest bond market is imploding, the BOJ is pretending nothing is happening.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top Inside the Diet, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba delivered a stark political gloss: Japan’s fiscal plight, he conceded, is now “worse than Greece,” a phrase that would have been unthinkable during the deflationary 2010s. That assessment lands just as gross public debt pushes toward 260% of GDP and as Japanese investors—who still hold roughly $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries—contemplate selling overseas paper to shore up domestic books. Why This Is Ultra-Bullish For Bitcoin For Bitcoin analysts, the chain of causality is brutally clear. Pseudonymous macro voice Stack Hodler wrote to his followers: “Everyone expects Yield Curve Control. But Japan already tried YCC and look at what it got them—a spectacular bond-market implosion happening right in front of us. Now every Japanese bank, pension fund, and insurance company that trusted the Bank of Japan is holding a massive bag of flaming excrement… If this is the end result of YCC, why would any rational investor hold sovereign debt from severely indebted nations? Central-bank credibility is shattering in real time. Scarce neutral reserve assets—Bitcoin and gold—need to be repriced dramatically higher.” Dan Tapiero, founder of the $3.9 billion digital-asset vehicle 10T Holdings, reached much the same conclusion in fewer words: “Quietly…and off the radar…the Japanese long-bond yields are going parabolic. Time to watch Japan…Unsustainable deficits have been the norm for 30 yrs…Now a problem. Very bullish gold and Bitcoin.” The systemic-risk argument tightens further when one zooms out to the global balance sheet. Author Bruce Florian frames the macro math as musical chairs with a finite number of safe havens: “There are three times more debts than GDP, and interest rates are twice as high as economic growth… It’s like a game of musical chairs. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Fate May Be Sealed On June 9, Analyst Warns Everyone knows there are fewer chairs than players.” Florian highlights the feedback loop linking Tokyo and Washington: “The biggest buyer of US debt has been Japan… But this customer is now in financial trouble… There’s a high chance Japan will sell some of these bonds to stabilize its own situation… In a year when the USA needs to refinance $8 trillion, what happens if no buyers show up? The Fed will monetize the debt.” The punch line, he insists, is Bitcoin: “Bitcoin is shifting from a ‘nice-to-have’ asset to a must-have asset… In a world of unlimited debt, scarcity is the most radical form of reason.” Wall Street heavyweights are edging toward the same territory. JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon told investors on Monday, “I’m not a buyer of bonds. The risks are too high.” Ray Dalio wrote that the greater default risk now lies in “currency debasement,” not in missed coupons. And Larry Fink, whose firm’s spot-Bitcoin ETF has absorbed more than $31 billion since January, said on Fox Business that Bitcoin is “an international asset” fit for times when “countries devalue their currencies.” BTC Price Responds Bitcoin’s price action is responding in real time. BTC rose to $107,322 at press time, less than 4% shy of its halving-cycle high. None of this proves that Bitcoin is destined to replace sovereign debt, but the directional shift in marginal flows is no longer hypothetical. When the second-largest bond market on earth shows two consecutive bidless sessions and its prime minister compares the country to Greece, capital chases the assets whose supply cannot be printed. Bitcoin, engineered for hard-cap scarcity, slots neatly into that vacuum. Whether this is the moment sovereign debt loses the mantle of “risk-free” remains to be seen. What is indisputable is that the implosion of Japan’s ultra-long JGBs has handed Bitcoin its clearest macro tail-wind since 2020’s pandemic-era liquidity flood—except this time the narrative is not emergency stimulus but the dawning realization that even advanced nations are running out of balance-sheet room. For a growing cohort of investors, the word bond is beginning to rhyme less with safety and more with risk, while Bitcoin is rhyming—loudly—with insurance.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum Are Leading Trader Buy Lists",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/new-breakout-favorite-magacoin-finance-xrp-and-ethereum-are-leading-trader-buy-lists/,"As May 2025 unfolds, conviction-driven capital is flowing into a new set of crypto leaders. From institutional buyers to early-stage speculators, the spotlight is now on four tokens: Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA), and TRON (TRX). Each brings a distinct edge—macro leadership, payment utility, early-stage asymmetric potential, and high-throughput infrastructure. But for those seeking the biggest ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the most aggressively positioned altcoin in the space. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Backed for Major Returns MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly emerged as one of the top early-stage altcoins of 2025, with analysts calling it a rare opportunity for 20x–35x returns before listings begin. With Stage 8 live, over $8 million raised, and a fixed listing target of $0.007, MAGA’s blend of political branding, scarcity-driven 100 billion token supply, and Hashex-audited contracts is fueling massive momentum. As Stage 8 accelerates, those entering now are acting on a clear risk-reward model, not just hype. With listings approaching, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly ranked as the #1 altcoin presale for 2025, and analysts say 35x–50x returns are possible as demand surges. XRP: Utility, Legal Clarity, and Institutional Momentum XRP is staging one of the strongest comebacks in crypto history, trading at $2.38 as of May 21, 2025. With full legal clarity in the U.S. and a CME futures launch on the horizon, XRP is being positioned as the primary settlement and liquidity token for global financial institutions. Technical indicators suggest a bullish continuation, with analysts forecasting a move to $3 and beyond as volume and institutional interest grow. Ethereum: Technical Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,593.53, up 1.66% in the past 24 hours and showing strong performance after a 50% rally in the past month. As the cornerstone of DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 innovation, Ethereum’s rising institutional interest and rapid Layer-2 adoption continue to bolster its outlook. Analysts expect ETH to push toward $3,000–$4,000 if support holds, with long-term targets even higher. Bitcoin: Macro Anchor as Capital Rotates Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $107,438, up 1.33% in the last 24 hours and maintaining its position above $106,000 after a strong May rally. While BTC remains the macro anchor and foundation for the market, capital is rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ethereum as traders seek sharper returns. TRON: High-Throughput Utility and Steady Growth TRON (TRX) is trading at $0.27, with analysts forecasting a stable range for May and June 2025. TRON’s consistent throughput and low fees make it a favorite for payment corridors and DeFi applications. As speculative capital rotates, many TRX holders are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper early-stage upside. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion The smart money in May 2025 is moving with conviction—rotating into tokens with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the foundation, XRP and TRON offer scale and utility, but MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the strategic early entry for those seeking life-changing returns. With Stage 8 heating up and listings on the horizon, this could be the defining moment to secure a position before the next wave begins.

The previous peak for Bitcoin ( BTC ), reached during President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, was surpassed in late morning trading, according to crypto.news data. The buying momentum sustained after U.S. equity markets closed with the largest cryptocurrency by market cap pushing above $110,000. Bitcoin has gained more than 4.5% in the past 24 hours and over 23% in the last month, reflecting a sharp reversal from April’s downturn.

Since late April, the S&P 500 has climbed 15%, while the Nasdaq is up more than 21%. Analysts attribute the bounce to growing optimism that President Trump’s trade policies may be less aggressive than initially feared. After introducing steep tariffs in early April—including a blanket 10% import tax and additional penalties for Chinese goods—the White House signaled a partial retreat . A 90-day pause on the most severe measures was announced last week by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent following negotiations with Chinese officials. Bitcoin initially fell to a two-month low of $76,000 shortly after Trump unveiled the tariffs, reflecting market fears over a broader global slowdown. Despite Bitcoin’s reputation as a hedge against traditional financial assets, it often trades in tandem with risk-on equities, especially tech stocks.

Enclave Markets CEO Phil Wirtjes said the rally was “likely aided by policy advancements,” particularly bipartisan progress on stablecoin legislation . A draft bill that would establish clearer rules for USD-backed digital tokens has gained traction in the Senate. Institutional demand has also picked up. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $329 million in inflows over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s latest rally raises questions about how much of its performance is driven by macro versus crypto-native factors. While regulatory clarity and ETF inflows are key tailwinds, the correlation with stocks suggests that investor appetite for risk remains a dominant force in both arenas.

During an interview on Wednesday , David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s top crypto and artificial intelligence advisor, made the bold prediction. “If we provide the legal clarity and legal framework for this, I think we could create trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight, very quickly.” Sacks said in an interview . The targeted legislation is the GENIUS Act, which is short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins. It would seek to establish federal standards for how stablecoins are originated and governed. This week, the bill passed a key test in the US Senate on a 66-32 cloture vote. This means it has cleared the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster. Fifteen Democrats sided with Republicans in endorsing the measure — a testament to unusual bipartisan support. Under the bill, stablecoin issuers must hold reserves to cover every token they put into circulation. Those reserves must be easily accessible and safe assets, such as cash or US Treasury bonds. The idea is to make sure stablecoins remain exactly that: stable. David Sacks described the bill as “a national economic strategy” that would strengthen the US dollar in the internet industry. He said stablecoins provide a new, more efficient, cheaper, and real-time settlement payment system. Trump family’s crypto involvement raises financial and ethical concerns The bill has gained support but has also courted controversy , mostly because of the deep ties between the Trump family and the crypto industry. World Liberty Financial launched its stablecoin, USD1, backed by President Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. US Treasuries and dollar deposits collateralize this coin — the precise type of asset that the GENIUS Act would sanction and regulate. Earlier this month, Abu Dhabi-based investment fund MGX pledged a significant investment in USD1, routing the funds through Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. This marks the largest investment in the Trump-linked stablecoin to date. The development has alarmed many Democrats, who warn that the bill could funnel money directly into the President’s and his family’s financial pockets, creating an unprecedented conflict of interest. Senator Elizabeth Warren and other critics demand that stronger ethical safeguards be incorporated into the legislation to prevent elected officials from profiting personally. Despite those fears, Sacks expressed confidence that the bill would pass. However, he declined to address questions regarding Trump’s financial ties to crypto. Investors flock to stablecoins as Bitcoin surges past $110,000 Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the United States dollar. Unlike Bitcoin or many other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are intended to remain steady and easy to use as payment. Their popularity is skyrocketing. A recent report by Deutsche Bank revealed that transactions of $28 trillion worth of stablecoins were conducted last year — more than even Visa and Mastercard combined. The stablecoin space is currently led by Tether, representing over 60% of the market, and is banked in the US by Cantor Fitzgerald. For now, bitcoin keeps soaring. It reached a fresh high on Wednesday at nearly $110,000 a coin. Sacks believes that stablecoins can be a tool to help the US keep the dollar strong in a world that’s going online and fast. “It also gives the dollar continued dominance online,” he said.

As major digital assets fluctuate, attention has turned toward altcoins promising substantial growth amid shifting market dynamics. Qubetics has emerged as a strong contender in this space, offering a compelling mix of real-world utility, advanced scalability, and AI-driven innovation. Identifying the top altcoin for massive return potential has become a critical focus for market participants—and Qubetics is increasingly being recognized as a project poised to deliver outsized gains in a volatile environment. One such project rising above the noise is Qubetics ($TICS), positioned to solve real-world challenges that older cryptocurrencies have struggled to address. With its unique ecosystem and ongoing crypto presale, Qubetics is attracting considerable attention as the next top altcoin for massive return potential. This article explores why Bitcoin, despite its dominance, may have been a missed opportunity for many, while Qubetics provides a fresh avenue with promising upside. Bitcoin: The Missed Giant in the Race for Massive Returns Bitcoin undeniably revolutionized finance by introducing decentralized digital currency to the masses. It sparked a global movement and built the foundation for the entire crypto industry. However, many who overlooked Bitcoin in its early days now reflect on missed chances to secure extraordinary returns. The cryptocurrency’s historical price surges from mere cents to tens of thousands of dollars per token remain legendary. Despite Bitcoin’s pioneering status, its scalability issues, transaction fees, and environmental concerns have led to growing interest in alternative projects that can deliver faster, more versatile solutions. Bitcoin’s relatively high price per token today presents barriers to new entrants seeking exposure to crypto growth without risking excessive capital. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s established presence often overshadows innovative projects that might offer higher growth trajectories. In a market where timing is critical, missing Bitcoin’s early rise serves as a cautionary tale. Meanwhile, altcoins with advanced technology stacks, targeted use cases, and accessible entry points are becoming increasingly attractive. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential Qubetics is redefining the possibilities of blockchain utility with its multi-application ecosystem designed to serve businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Unlike many projects that focus solely on speculation, Qubetics delivers practical tools and decentralized services that address real-life problems — from secure cross-border transactions to developer-friendly integrated development environments. Currently in its 35th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 513 million tokens to more than 26,800 holders, raising upwards of $17.2 million. The token is priced at an accessible $0.2785 during this phase, making it an enticing entry point for those aiming to capitalize on future growth. Analysts project that $TICS could reach $1 post-presale, representing a 258% return on investment, with even more optimistic forecasts placing it at $5 or higher after the mainnet launch. Application and Ecosystem Impact Qubetics introduces several core applications including QubeQode and Qubetics IDE, which empower users with decentralized tools for privacy, coding, and asset tokenization. QubeQode facilitates secure, private communication and transactions across borders. Businesses dealing with international clients benefit from lower fees and increased security, making it an attractive alternative to traditional financial networks. Qubetics IDE targets developers by providing an intuitive, decentralized development environment that supports multi-chain projects and seamless integration with blockchain protocols. Scenarios illustrate the ecosystem’s potential: A freelance developer in Central Asia leverages Qubetics IDE to build and deploy smart contracts without intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing transparency. An export-import firm uses QubeQode to conduct cross-border payments securely and quickly, bypassing slow legacy banking systems and avoiding hefty transaction fees. Individual users concerned with data privacy rely on Qubetics’ decentralized VPN features to safeguard their online activities without sacrificing speed or reliability. These real-world applications position Qubetics as a versatile platform beyond mere speculation, increasing its appeal and utility within the growing digital economy. Presale Details and Price Projections The ongoing presale offers a rare opportunity to acquire $TICS tokens at an early stage price of $0.2785. This presale phase, now at stage 35, reflects strong community support and growing confidence in the project’s roadmap. With over 513 million tokens sold and a holder base exceeding 26,800, momentum is accelerating. Price predictions from market analysts suggest: At $1 post-presale: approximately 258% ROI At $5 post-mainnet launch: approximately 1694% ROI At $10 to $15 post-mainnet launch: estimated returns soaring above 5000%, reflecting the disruptive potential of Qubetics technology and adoption trends. Such projections underscore why Qubetics is rapidly becoming the top altcoin for massive return potential within the crypto space. Conclusion: Seizing the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential The cryptocurrency market’s dynamic market rewards timely decisions and strategic insights. Bitcoin’s rise was a historic opportunity, yet many missed the chance to capitalize on its early gains. Presently, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as the top altcoin for massive return potential , backed by innovative applications, a strong presale performance, and bullish analyst forecasts. Securing $TICS tokens at the current crypto presale price represents a compelling proposition for those seeking exposure to next-generation blockchain technology. Acting swiftly to acquire Qubetics during its crypto presale phase could unlock remarkable gains. The top altcoin for massive return potential today offers a unique blend of practicality and growth, making it a worthy contender for portfolio inclusion. Awareness and informed choices will remain crucial in navigating this growing crypto market.

Bullish momentum is reinforced by weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index and limited upside in the S&P 500, favoring capital rotation into cryptocurrencies. Potential risks include a bearish Deep Crab pattern and political uncertainty around the U.S. strategic cryptocurrency reserve, but these are not my base case. I will reconsider my outlook if Bitcoin falls below $106,140, but current sentiment and technicals support further upside in the near term. When I last covered Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) on March 2nd, 2025, with my article “Bitcoin: I Was Wrong”, cryptocurrency prices were beginning to lose some of the luster that was present following President Donald Trump’s public comments suggesting that he intended to become the world’s first cryptocurrency President . Of course, these were not just words, there were real actions supporting the bullish long-term cryptocurrency outlook in the United States . Of course, these are deeply positive scenarios for anyone holding large-cap cryptocurrencies, and BTC-USD prices have responded in kind. Since my last analysis was developed, BTC-USD has actually gained by more than +13% even while the S&P 500 has encountered losses of -1.81%. But the story is a bit more complicated than that because bitcoin prices have actually been on a bit more of a roller coaster ride than those somewhat subtle gains might imply. Given bitcoin’s ability to recover losses and form a base at elevated levels, I am raising my rating outlook to a “strong buy” while this newest rally is still in its earliest stages. Bitcoin: Substantial Two-Way Reversals (Income Generator via TradingView ) First, let’s quickly define the most recent “rally” because there are definitely elements of the bitcoin trend that seem to contradict this outwardly bullish assertion. As we can see in the chart above, BTC-USD actually continued to drop (by about -22%) after my prior pessimistic article was published. As a result, I suppose that you could say I was “right” about being “wrong” but market prices quickly reversed into the positive direction after falling below $75,000. This reversal is essentially the main reason I will have to eat some crow with my analysis update today because the bullish trend wave was forceful enough to generate gains of nearly 48% and break above an all-time high resistance level in the process. Bitcoin: Significance of Recent Breakout (Income Generator via TradingView ) When discussing these events with my own trading group, I described the price action of the last few days as being a textbook example of a consolidation zone. Whenever you are dealing with the test of an all-time high (especially when dealing with a high-volume and highly volatile trading asset), the general expectation is that selling pressure is likely to start building as prices continue moving upward. Unfortunately, this can occur either as short-sellers begin to emerge near a critical resistance zone or as bullish cryptocurrency investors start to take profits on prior successful trades. Bitcoin prices, however, really did not experience very much of this type of price action. Almost like a snake hiding in the grass and waiting to strike its prey, BTC-USD prices hovered just below the triple-top resistance region near $107,355 (as well as the +2 standard deviation on the shorter-term time frames). When we did not see any significant pullback from the $107,355 level, I immediately flipped bullish because there were two different negative technical signals (bearish triple-top resistance pattern and the movement of prices into the +2 standard deviation) and neither of them were having much of an effect. Bullish volumes were also rising quite sharply right into this resistance level, and all of this essentially provided a perfect storm of bullish elements that allowed buyers to overcome sellers and print a new record high. Bitcoin: Comparative Trends in U.S. Dollar Index (Income Generator via TradingView ) In order to get a better sense of where cryptocurrency trends are actually headed next, I think it might be important to assess relative performances in peripheral asset classes. As the world’s reserve currency , trends in the U.S. Dollar are often best assessed using the U.S. Dollar Index, and we can see some interesting developments for the greenback when looking at the daily timeframe. Specifically, we can see that the U.S. Dollar Index recently invalidated prior trend momentum readings in the Relative Strength Index ((RSI)) near the beginning of this month. However, upside follow-through has been lacking, with the RSI breaking back below the daily exponential moving average (EMA). In the chart above, this activity is shown with the purple line in the indicator panel falling under the yellow exponential moving average. Importantly, share prices themselves are also trading back below all four major exponential moving averages (20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day periods) and this gives us a bearish confluence of events that seems to contradict the negative momentum break that was experienced earlier this month. As a result, our next downside price target for the U.S. Dollar Index is not seen until 97.921 (April 21st, 2025 lows). Overall, I expect this to have a positive BTC-USD impact in terms of price action - at least until major support in the U.S. Dollar Index is retested (and confirmed to hold). Bitcoin: Comparative Trends in S&P 500 (Income Generator via TradingView ) Another major peripheral asset that cryptocurrency trades should be watching would be the S&P 500 itself. At this stage, it is probably becoming irritating for many investors to listen to stock pundits talk about the potential for cryptocurrencies to become safe-haven assets . But if this characterization is actually an accurate characterization of the market majority, it might be reasonable to suggest that declining momentum in the S&P 500 could actually become beneficial for bitcoin investors. Based on the chart above, bullish BTC-USD arguments can be made right now, due to the fact that the S&P 500 has already failed at resistance following the sizable rallies that emerged after the crash into $4,835.04 in early April. Of course, the May 19th price highs at $5,968.61 rests less than 3% below the S&P 500’s all-time high of $6,147.43. For all of these reasons, I think it is very difficult to make the argument that the S&P 500 has a great deal of upside potential when the benchmark has already recovered most of the losses that have been experienced since January 31st, 2025. Bitcoin: Potential Bearish Signals (Income Generator via TradingView ) If we do believe that the potential for upside is limited in both the U.S. Dollar Index and S&P 500, where would we then expect investors to start flocking next? Small-cap stocks might be one possibility, perhaps treasuries might be another (especially given the long-term complexities of the current market environment). However, if broader selling pressure in DXY and the major U.S. stock benchmarks is not far away, bullish cryptocurrency investors really needed to see a break of important resistance levels in BTC-USD. This week, this did occur as the time-tested flagship cryptocurrency broke through prior all-time highs, but I will also mention potential risks to the positive outlook. In the chart above, we can see that even though historical resistance zones have been invalidated, cryptocurrency prices are still trading outside the +2 standard deviation and a bearish harmonic pattern has developed after the rally from just above $102,105 on May 19th. Specifically, this is a bearish Deep Crab pattern, and it is large enough to suggest that BTC-USD prices could fall back below $100,500 if the pattern reaches a full point of completion (which does not occur in a large majority of instances). We must also be aware of the fact that there has been a great deal of criticism with respect to the viability of President Donald Trump’s strategic cryptocurrency reserve, so much so that a BBC News article actually used the term “ pig in lipstick ” to describe Trump’s plans for a cryptocurrency future. Of course, if these criticisms turn out to be accurate, I think we might see the U.S. government reconsider efforts to operate the strategic cryptocurrency reserve under the next administration. Unfortunately, any financial news headlines centered in this direction would likely be accepted unfavorably by the cryptocurrency market, and I think that this is the type of event that could lead to the next crypto winter (if these types of events actually materialize). Of course, there are a lot of unknowns here and that negative scenario is not my base case right now. Ultimately, I think that the recent breaks of important resistance levels suggests that market sentiment is actually quite healthy and that the influence of short-sellers is diminishing in size. For all of these reasons, I am upgrading my BTC-USD outlook to a “strong buy” rating and I will reconsider my outlook if we see bitcoin fall below $106,140 (near-term pivot lows recorded during the May 21st trading session).",BTC-USD|SP500|DXY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-22 02:30:00

Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a new all-time high of $110,788.98 on Coinbase late on May 21, just before 11:30 pm UTC, according to TradingView. Bitcoin has gained around 3% over the last 24 hours, surpassing its all-time high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its previously long-held Jan. 20 peak. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now gained 17.5% so far this year and is up 47% since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets. Bitcoin’s new peak comes as US stock markets were rattled by a weak 20-year bond auction, which sent treasury yields soaring on May 21. The S&P 500 fell 80 points in half an hour while the Nasdaq and Dow Jones mirrored the move, with all US indexes trading down on the day. Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows it has climbed out of a slump earlier this year. Source: TradingView Caroline Bowler, CEO of the Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said in a note to Cointelegraph that Bitcoin’s new high “reflects a mature interest in digital assets worldwide, not the speculative surge seen in past cycles.” “Today’s demand is driven by institutional-grade infrastructure and stronger regulatory clarity. Investor sentiment has shifted decisively, reflecting institutional-style allocations,” she added. According to Google Trends, searches for Bitcoin have been trending down since November and are at lows typical of crypto bear markets, indicating a low retail interest in the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks market sentiment, was at a score of 72 out of 100 on May 22, indicating “greed.” The index is down from its 2025 high of 84 on Jan. 22, which came two days after Trump’s inauguration. Related: How high can Bitcoin price go? Edward Carroll, head of global markets and corporate finance at MHC Digital Group, told Cointelegraph in a note that growing demand driving the price higher in the medium-term could push Bitcoin to at least $160,000 by the fourth quarter of this year and $1 million by 2030. Trader’s leveraged Bitcoin bet tops $1.1B Meanwhile, leverage trader James Wynn’s Bitcoin long position on the crypto platform Hyperliquidity has become the largest onchain margin trade when it exceeded $1.1 billion amid Bitcoin’s price peak. The entry point for the 40x leveraged position was $108,065 and it has an unrealized profit of $20 million. It will be liquidated if Bitcoin’s price falls to $103,800.

The fund has a large allocation to Bitcoin, which could hurt returns if a true 'altseason' were to manifest. At 2.5%, the fund has a high expense ratio and doesn't stake any of the PoS assets under management, producing an opportunity cost relative to holding the assets directly. The top 4 assets make up over 97% of the fund's capital; none of those 4 assets are 'cheap' in my view. At a 14% discount to NAV, BITW could serve as a potential arbitrage trade if/when more spot ETFs cover the crypto market in the US. I've covered the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF (BITW) for Seeking Alpha four times going back to 2023. My general thinking on the fund can be summed up in this way; I like it slightly better than its closest peer, the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ETF (GDLC) because of a broader offering of assets, but I don't think it's the best way to play a rally in the altcoin market at this juncture. While the fund can occasionally serve as an interesting arbitrage opportunity when it trades a steep discount to net asset value, there are disadvantages with both the fund and its construction. In this update, we'll briefly review some of the pros and cons to holding BITW shares, as well as assess how I view the current valuation setup for the fund's top 4 holdings. Pros and Cons of BITW For speculators who want simple exposure to the digital assets in a single ticker, BITW works fine. As I see it, these are the top advantages of BITW over something like GDLC: BITW GDLC AUM $1.44b $775m NAV Per Share $70.90 $48.81 Market Price $60.83 $42.40 Discount to NAV 14.2% 13.1% BTC Weighting 78.0% 79.5% Fund Holdings 10 5 Sources: Grayscale and Bitwise as of May 20th Closing Prices Not only does BITW have a slightly bigger discount to NAV at 14.2% currently, but the fund also offers exposure to more assets than GDLC and has slightly less reliance on BTC for fund performance. With roughly double the AUM than that of GDLC, BITW has strong liquidity and gets a 'B+' liquidity grade from Seeking Alpha. As I see it, there are three important disadvantages to holding a fund like BITW over alternatives; expense ratio, asset weighting, and opportunity cost. At a 2.5% expense ratio, BITW is way too expensive for what is essentially a passively managed fund that is nearly 80% Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Bitcoin Dominance 5/21/25 (CoinGlass) Bitcoin's dominance of the $2.06 trillion digital asset market is 61.5% per CoinGlass data. While this is obviously a large share of the crypto market, BITW and GDLC are both closer to 80% BTC. To be sure, the overwhelming majority of the assets in the cryptocurrency market are entirely uninvestable. Thus, over-weight BTC makes sense. But there are assets held within BITW that I do think could be long-term successes and even potentially outperform BTC over the next 10 to 20 years. In that regard, choosing BITW over something like a self-directed crypto-IRA might not make sense for long-term investors who have a willingness to open such an account - and there are several providers. Another potential issue with BITW is the opportunity cost of holding stake-able assets dormant in a fund that isn't generating yield. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ) collectively make up nearly 15% of BITW positioning. Each of those assets are stake-able for yield and provide investors a positive real yield after token emissions inflation. It is anticipated that staking could soon be permitted in US-based crypto ETFs under the current administration. If such products enter the market, BITW could theoretically trade at a deeper discount to NAV. Top Holdings Valuation Assessment The fund always has 10 assets under management, though those assets with smaller allocations do often change. As of May 20th, BITW asset weightings are as follows: BITW Holdings 5/20/25 (Bitwise) I've already mentioned the large weighting to BTC. From there, ETH commands 11%, XRP ( XRP-USD ) claims 5%, and SOL comes in at 3.2%. With less than 2% combined allocation to the bottom five assets in the fund, I'm not going to spend much time on those networks. However, the top 4 coins in the fund do have a meaningful allocation and represent more than 97% of BITW. We'll take a look at network valuation metrics for those funds and examine what, if any, alternatives there may be for investors who want larger exposure to those assets than what is currently provided by Bitwise. We already know BITW trades at a discount to the fund's liquidation value. But what about the assets themselves? Can we justify such coin prices based on fundamental usage? I've covered Bitcoin's valuation in prior SA pieces. My personal view is that the NVT ratio is a decent way to assess BTC valuation because it utilizes the coin's market cap as well as the dollar-denominated value transferred over the network. BTC Price vs 30 Day Average NVT ( Coin Metrics ) The multi-year trend in BTC's 30-Day average NVT ratio is admittedly not a great one. What this shows is that over the longer term, as BTC's price moves higher, the NVT ratio generally does as well. That said, at 186 currently, the NVT ratio is well-off highs from last summer. I would personally like to see this ratio come down even further. But what I find to be a positive sign currently is the price rise in BTC near the end of last year was accompanied by a deep drop in NVT ratio. This would indicate that the coin price wasn't outgrowing the transferred value. In my view, NVT is good for networks that intend to be 'payment chains.' Because of this, we could choose to view XRP through this lens as well: BTC vs XRP NVT Ratio ( Coin Metrics ) Believe it or not, XRP was actually cheaper than BTC based purely on NVT ratio for most of the last two and half years. While the 220 ratio reading for XRP currently is back ahead of BTC, the long-term trend for XRP's NVT valuation has been quite opposite that of BTC. I'm not arguing either of these coins are 'cheap' based on this metric - quite the opposite, actually. But I think these can be helpful in showing long-term price vs usage trends. For the smart contract chains, fees are a meaningful part of the underlying economics of the networks. There, I like to look at price to fees ratios of the chains: Weekly Circulating P/F Ratios (Token Terminal) Token Terminal's data shows Ethereum is trading at over 760x fees. Based on this metric, Ethereum is now valued more richly than NEAR Protocol ( NEAR-USD ). Solana, which has been cheaper than Ethereum on a circulating P/F multiple since October, is also seeing the ratio generally moving in the wrong direction. At 136x fees currently, Solana has seen significant multiple expansion since February. What Alternatives to BITW Are There? I've already mentioned that investors who have a willingness to open self-direct crypto IRAs can certainly do that. In those types of accounts, there are typically no storage fees, but transaction fees can be high for those who are active traders. There are usually dozens of trade-able digital assets, and it would be quite easy to overweight most of the top 'altcoins' in the market if one were so inclined. However, not everyone wants to open an additional account due to either the inconvenience or the potential personal data security concern - each of which are justifiable in my view. Can BITW's current digital asset exposure be mimicked by purchases of single-asset products that are already available in the market? Possibly. Asset Spot ETF? Closed-End Fund? Leveraged Fund? Bitcoin Yes Yes Yes Ethereum Yes No Yes XRP No No Yes Solana No Yes No Cardano ( ADA-USD ) No No No Sui ( SUI-USD ) No No No ChainLink ( LINK-USD ) No Yes No Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) No No No Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) No Yes No Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) No Yes No Source: Author's compiled data, funds must be secondary market trade-able not only available through private placement As far as I can tell, only three of the assets in BITW are lacking direct exposure through some combination of spot ETFs, closed-end funds, or leveraged funds. Collectively, those three assets make up less than 2% of BITW. So it is theoretically possible to self-direct exposure to the majority of the assets in BITU through a standard brokerage account utilizing the single-asset products that are already available in the market. Closing Thoughts For those who want a simple way to get exposure to some of the top assets in the cryptocurrency market, BITW will work perfectly fine. Potential investors should keep in mind that there are downsides to getting exposure in this way. In my view, the expense ratio is too high, 78% exposure to BTC defeats the purpose of a 'diversified' fund, and there is an opportunity cost to holding stake-able assets in a fund that doesn't stake them for yield. That said, at a 14% discount to NAV, BITW is somewhat interesting as a potential arbitrage trade should be more of these assets get spot ETFs in the US. While I don't personally hold this fund at this time, it's one of which I've held in the past and would consider holding again if the discount gets to parity with the non-BTC asset allocation of the fund. That said, the discount arbitrage can close simultaneously to a drop in share price. That's a major risk to consider. I would argue that none of the assets in BITW could realistically be considered 'cheap' based on network usage levels.",BTC-USD|ETH-USD|SOL-USD|XRP-USD|BITW,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-22 02:45:00

According to experts, if this momentum continues, Bitcoin could soon target $115,000 to $116,000. However, like always, some ups and downs are expected along the way. Market data confirms that the trend is still bullish. Many who predicted a market crash have gone silent, as current charts and on-chain data show a different picture. While Bitcoin leads the way, several altcoins have also posted gains. Dogecoin rose by 7%, while other major altcoins gained between 2-4%. Pi Coin Eyes $1 One standout is Pi Network’s coin, which jumped 10%, reaching a high of $0.86 before settling around $0.84. The next target for Pi is to cross the $1 mark, a level many supporters are eagerly watching. However, for Pi Coin to hit $1, it should first cross the important resistance level at $0.94. Even though more Pi coins are being unlocked, the price is still rising. This could be because of various factors: First, a $100 million fund was launched to support Pi projects. Second, many people are choosing to hold their Pi instead of selling. What’s Next For Crypto Market? Experts believe that once Pi Network secures listings on major exchanges, it could see a big rise in price and popularity. On the other hand, Bitcoin is still looking strong on the charts, with indicators like RSI and MACD showing positive momentum. Although Bitcoin has entered the overbought zone, it hasn’t reached extreme levels yet, meaning there’s still room for growth. If Bitcoin slows down after a while, altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP might see stronger price movements next.

Analyst Forecasts: 25x–35x returns are considered conservative, with some models projecting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues Pre-Listing Momentum: Stage 8 is nearly full, and listings are imminent, making this a rare ground-floor opportunity before public price discovery. Summary: MAGACOIN FINANCE is the only major altcoin still in accumulation mode before listings, offering the highest risk-adjusted upside window heading into Q3 2025. 3. XRP — Regulatory Clarity, but Price Action Cools Recent Performance: XRP trades between $2.36–$2.65 and has surged over 300% since late 2024, driven by regulatory clarity and institutional partnerships. However, the price has cooled since its recent peak, and short-term momentum is slowing as the market consolidates. Outlook: Analysts project a breakout above $3.40 could push XRP toward $5–$7.50, but for now, the asset is in a holding pattern. 4. Ethereum (ETH) — Technical Breakout Pauses Recent Performance: Ethereum has rebounded from $1,800 to over $2,500 in May, but the rally is now cooling off. Technical indicators suggest a potential retest of $2,700–$2,900 if support holds, but short-term momentum is slowing. Outlook: ETH remains a core holding for DeFi and institutional investors, but the most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. 5. TRUMP (MAGA) — Narrative-Driven, but Not the Focus TRUMP trades at $0.195–$0.20, but it is distinct from MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale token, which is still under $0.001 and targeting a $0.007 listing price.For clarity, this article focuses on presale MAGACOIN FINANCE as the breakout play, offering structured ROI and political narrative appeal EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion As summer 2025 unfolds, MAGACOIN FINANCE is accelerating while Ethereum, Solana, and XRP slow down. With Stage 8 nearly full and listings approaching, MAGA is being positioned as the breakout coin of the season—offering a rare combination of structured ROI, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and early-stage momentum. Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns as conservative, with some models projecting even greater upside if current trends continue. For investors seeking the next crypto supercycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only major altcoin still in accumulation mode before listings—making it the highest-conviction play heading into Q3.

While Solana (SOL) and Stellar (XLM) continue to build their networks through technical upgrades and institutional support, BlockDAG (BDAG) is focusing on something different: accessibility. Instead of relying on a small group of experts, it offers a system that invites more people to build. BlockDAG has introduced tools that lower the barrier to entry, like a no-code dApp builder and a developer grant program. These changes are meant to bring in a broader community. With over $260 million raised and more than 20.9 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is creating a space where building on Web3 is more about creativity and less about coding skills. Compared to Solana and Stellar’s price-driven attention, BlockDAG is centered on use cases, ease of entry, and a long-term goal to reshape how crypto apps are made. Solana (SOL) Eyes $180 Breakout Solana’s (SOL) price has stayed strong above $160, and it’s now testing the $180 resistance level, a spot that has previously sparked sharp moves. This higher low pattern suggests growing market support. Along with stronger trading volume, it shows buyers are preparing for a breakout. If SOL closes above $180 with solid volume, it could trigger a larger upward move. However, traders remain cautious and are watching the price closely. A clear push past this level may confirm renewed strength and attract more market attention. SOL continues to be on watchlists due to this critical range. Stellar (XLM): Smart Money Builds Confidence Stellar (XLM) is seeing more activity from large holders. Recent data shows institutional accumulation is rising, often seen as a signal of confidence in its future use. This matches XLM’s focus on real-world payment networks and integrations. Currently, Stellar is moving through a consolidation phase. Some analysts believe this isn’t a pause, but a buildup toward the next move. The platform’s steady transaction volume and wallet growth add weight to that view. Resistance levels are still in play, but the uptick in smart money activity is worth noting. While price swings continue, long-term watchers are tracking these buying signals. BlockDAG Presale Hits $260M With Simple dApp Creation Tools BlockDAG is making Web3 easier for everyone to access. Its upcoming no-code dApp builder is designed so anyone, whether a solo creator or a small business, can build and launch applications without coding knowledge. This shift removes a key hurdle that has kept many from entering the space. What makes this more powerful is BlockDAG’s structure. The platform encourages fast app building, niche use cases, and fresh ideas, thanks to tools that simplify the process. Unlike other platforms that expect builders to know blockchain code, BlockDAG gives them an entry point without that requirement. This change matters right now. BlockDAG has already raised over $260 million in its presale and sold more than 20.9 billion coins. It is now in Batch 28, priced at $0.0262. From Batch 1 to 28, early buyers have seen a 2,520% ROI. On top of that, over $7 million worth of X Series miners have been sold till now. One more highlight is the limited-time price freeze, BlockDAG is offering BDAG at $0.0020 until June 13. That makes this a key window for anyone looking at utility-backed projects. With its CertiK audit completed and builder tools rolling out, BlockDAG isn’t just riding hype, it’s creating real access to building in crypto. BlockDAG’s Utility Sets It Apart in 2025 Solana’s price is near a breakout, and Stellar is gaining institutional attention. But BlockDAG is standing out for its builder-first approach. With no-code tools, developer grants, and real funding already raised, it brings a different kind of value. The numbers are solid: $260 million raised, 20.9 billion coins sold, and BDAG priced at $0.0020 until June 13. This model isn’t just about supply, it’s about function. For those watching top crypto coins with real-world use, BlockDAG offers something unique. It’s focused on making development simple, even for those without technical backgrounds. This could help expand the reach of Web3 and push crypto toward more practical, daily use.

It combines CeFi security with DeFi accessibility, and it is one of only three chains selected for the debut. The major move comes when Bitcoin is hovering just short of 3% from its all-time high (ATH) of $109K. BTC’s price has surged by more than 21% over the last 30 days, reflecting that more investors are jumping in. However, the Fear and Greed Index flashes “Greed” sentiment among traders. OKX unveils xBTC on Sui Bitcoin holders now have more ways than ever to go onchain, and Sui is quickly becoming a BTCfi powerhouse. With the total Bitcoin Total Value Locked (TVL) climbing, xBTC is expected to lead the adoption and liquidity. Data provided by DefiLlama shows that TVL in DeFi has stood at $2.11 billion. Sui was chosen for its fast, scalable, and already building serious BTCfi infrastructure. With this move, OKX is signaling that it isn’t just another Layer 1 and is a rising hub for Bitcoin-backed DeFi. Two major protocols, Cetus and Navi, are exclusive launch partners for xBTC on day one. xBTC is minted directly on OKX and is withdrawable as a native asset. This makes it easier for users to bridge Bitcoin into DeFi without clunky wrappers or third-party trust models. It opens up new liquidity rails and reward strategies for BTC holders. Jason Lau, Chief Innovation Officer at OKX, stated that “Our unique advantage as one of the most trustworthy and transparent institutions imbues xBTC with a powerful security model.” Over 10% of Sui TVL is now BTC-backed Since February, nearly 600 Bitcoin have flowed into Sui, suggesting that Bitcoin holders are flocking to this fast-growing Layer 1 to tap into DeFi opportunities securely and efficiently. BTC-backed assets now make up over 10% of Sui’s total value locked (TVL), and that number keeps climbing. xBTC joins a strong lineup of BTC-based tokens, such as WBTC , LBTC, and sBTC. Each asset comes with unique custody models and DeFi integrations. Christian Thompson, Managing Director at the Sui Foundation, says, “Bitcoin DeFi on Sui has gone from an intriguing concept to proving complete product-market fit in a matter of months.” He added, “OKX is choosing to bring xBTC to Sui, which speaks to the robustness” of the BTCfi ecosystem. Sui’s BTCfi ecosystem has also attracted projects like Stacks, Lombard, Babylon, Cubist, SatLayer, and RedStone. It has created a vibrant hub where Bitcoin holders can put their BTC to work in multiple ways. xBTC can turn out to be a big use up for traders as it charges no minting or redemption fees. The only cost involved would be minimal gas fees on the network.

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,650 resistance zone. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,500 and $2,520 levels. The price is trading above $2,540 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,620 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Could Gain Strength Ethereum price remained in a range above $2,350 while Bitcoin traded to a new all-time high. ETH bulls were active near the $2,440 zone. A low was formed at $2,442 and the price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $2,500 and $2,520 levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,615 swing high to the $2,442 low. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,615 swing high to the $2,442 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,620 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,720 level. A clear move above the $2,720 resistance might send the price toward the $2,840 resistance. An upside break above the $2,840 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,920 resistance zone or even $3,000 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,620 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350.

With over $300,000 raised in its first week of presale, the crypto community is beginning to wonder: Is this the next 100x opportunity since the explosive rise of PEPE? Why Wall Street Ponke is Gaining Traction Fast Unlike many memecoins that launch with little more than a logo and some community memes, Wall Street Ponke entered the scene with a mission, real-world utility, and a strong roadmap. Its first week has been nothing short of impressive—rapid fundraising, growing community buzz, and increasing mentions across crypto forums. This isn’t a random frog-themed pump-and-dump. Wall Street Ponke is blending the entertainment of meme culture with serious crypto innovation. A Secure Ecosystem, Not Just a Token What’s driving the buzz? For starters, WPONKE offers a platform that addresses one of crypto’s most pressing issues: security. At its core, Wall Street Ponke features an AI-powered detection system that continuously scans new tokens across the market. This system flags red flags like fake liquidity, suspicious smart contract behavior, and developer manipulation, helping traders avoid scams before they commit their funds. In a landscape filled with rug pulls, this alone is a major selling point. The Future of Meme Coins: Education and Empowerment Wall Street Ponke goes beyond protection—it educates. The platform includes a full e-learning ecosystem, featuring easy-to-follow courses on DeFi, staking, tokenomics, and smart contract analysis. Whether you’re just starting in crypto or looking to level up your skills, WPONKE has positioned itself as a hub for smarter trading. It’s this blend of fun and functionality that’s earning it comparisons to early-stage PEPE—but with more tools and a clearer vision. High Staking Rewards and Real Community Utility One of the project’s standout features is its staking model. Early investors are being rewarded with a staggering 1232% APY. This system doesn’t just create FOMO—it builds long-term commitment. Instead of encouraging a quick flip, Wall Street Ponke incentivizes holders to become part of a sustainable ecosystem. https://twitter.com/Wallstreetponke/status/1922793562091008367 With staking, AI security tools, and educational resources all rolled into one, it’s no surprise that WPONKE is being called one of the most complete meme coin launches in recent memory. How to Join the Presale and Buy $WPONKE It’s easy and beginner-friendly to join the Wall Street Ponke presale. Create a crypto wallet to deposit funds. Then use a popular wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. You first need to buy some crypto from a central exchange. Use a central exchange like Binance or Coinbase to buy some ETH, USDT, or BNB. Next, go to wallstreetponke.com and connect your wallet to the presale interface. After that, simply select your payment of choice, enter the amount you’d like to invest and hit confirm. At the end of the presale, you will be able to claim your $WPONKE tokens in your wallet. Those who join the presale early will be able to stake their tokens and begin earning up to 1232% APY immediately. Wall Street Ponke isn’t just riding the meme coin wave—it’s reshaping it. If PEPE were a flash, $WPONKE could be the real fire.

The market is currently at a critical point, and how XRP behaves around these key support and resistance levels could shape it’s next move. Approaching a Key Support Level On the daily time frame, XRP is getting very close to breaking below an important support zone between $2.30 and $2.34. If the price closes a daily candle under $2.30, it could open the door for a further drop, falling back toward the $2.10–$2.15 range. Despite this risk, the overall daily price structure for XRP remains bullish. The market has continued forming higher lows and higher highs, which is typically a healthy sign during an uptrend. However, temporary pullbacks and sideways moves are common even in bullish trends. On the upside, a clear break above the $2.48–$2.61 resistance range is needed to confirm a meaningful bullish breakout and signal the start of a larger move higher. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.40 and is up by more than 1% in the last 24 hours. Short-Term Struggles Continue XRP is still under the influence of a bearish divergence. As a result, XRP is struggling to move higher and remains stuck within a range. The market has yet to see a clear breakout in either direction.. Right now, XRP’s price is caught between support and resistance. Both bullish and bearish possibilities remain on the table. A small bounce into the resistance zone is possible in the short term, but unless the price breaks through those upper levels, the overall market picture won’t change much. It’s also important to keep an eye on Bitcoin’s price action since it continues to influence the broader altcoin market, including XRP. However, Bitcoin has crossed above $110k level and it remains to be seen if altcoins will also rally. Short-Term Outlook At the moment, both potential scenarios for XRP remain valid: In the bullish case, XRP might see a short-term rally into resistance, followed by a brief correction, and then continue higher. In the alternative, XRP could start a direct rally from current support levels if buyers step in.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 03:22:07

Recent policy shifts between the United States and China, two of the world’s largest economies, have helped fuel investor sentiment. Both countries have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs: the US cut rates from 145% to 30%, while China lowered its own from 125% to 10%, each over 90 days. These decisions have been interpreted by some as a step toward easing global trade tensions, supporting risk-on assets such as Bitcoin. In response to the broader bullish environment, Bitcoin has seen a steady rise, currently trading at $106,574, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours. The price earlier reached a 24-hour high of $107,844 before retreating slightly. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin remains just 2% below its all-time high of $109,000, recorded in January 2025. The consistent climb has led analysts and traders to monitor on-chain metrics more closely to gauge market behavior and possible future movements. Related Reading: Binance Bitcoin Outflows and MVRV Ratio Point to Sustained Bullish Setup, Analyst Reveals Realized Capitalization Surges as Accumulation Phase Strengthens A recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alemán has brought attention to Bitcoin’s realized capitalization, a metric that measures the total value of Bitcoin based on the price at which each coin last moved on-chain. According to Alemán, the realized cap jumped by more than $3 billion in a single day, marking a 0.33% increase in the total capital invested in Bitcoin. This significant uptick signals renewed capital inflows, and more importantly, it points to a recurring pattern of accumulation and consolidation. Alemán identified a repeating cycle beginning in April, where Bitcoin has shown sharp price increases followed by sideways movements lasting 8 to 10 days. These lateral phases, supported by rising realized cap, form a staircase-like chart structure with each step building upon the previous one. From an on-chain perspective, the steady climb in realized cap suggests buyers are entering the market at higher levels, lifting the network’s aggregate cost basis and demonstrating long-term confidence in the asset. On-Chain Trends Suggest Investors Are Positioning for Continuation Alemán also highlighted that the behavior of realized capitalization in the current market mirrors patterns seen in previous bull cycles. Historically, spikes in this metric during consolidation phases have preceded large-scale price movements. The current rise indicates that capital entering the market is doing so with a long-term view, rather than speculative short-term intent. This positions the market for a potential continuation, especially as accumulation appears to intensify around the psychological $106,000–$109,000 range. Related Reading: $3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows The analyst concluded that tracking realized cap in the days ahead will be essential to confirm whether the current phase evolves into another upward price impulse.

The case centers on Block Earner’s “Earner” product, a fixed-yield crypto investment offering that ASIC contends operates as an unlicensed financial product . ASIC says it is asking the High Court of Australia to clarify what falls within the definition of a financial product to shed light on digital assets and interest-earning options. In its statement, the regulator emphasized that the definition of a financial product was designed to be broad and technology-neutral. ASIC believes that interpreting this definition should be guided by the public interest. The ruling may change how crypto and other digital financial services are subject to Australian law . ASIC insists there is a problem with crypto and regulatory predictability for the broader financial sector. Block Earner defends its product and integrity Block Earner has welcomed the Federal Court’s decision. On April 22, Federal Court Justices David O’Callaghan, Wendy Abraham, and Catherine Button found that Block Earner’s crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product is not a financial product, a managed investment scheme, or a derivative under the Corporations Act. A spokesperson for the Block Earner said it still had confidence that the clear and robust judgment delivered by the Full Federal Court in April had been based on the facts and law of the matter and had shown that its operations were sound. They also said they remain convinced that the ruling was correct. “We believe the Full Federal Court’s April ruling was a strong and well-reasoned decision that upheld the integrity of our operations,” the spokesperson said. “We remain confident in the soundness of that judgment and will respond to ASIC’s application through the appropriate legal channels.” The spokesman said the current dispute revolves around a broader legal question: what defines a financial product in the digital age? They emphasized that this issue goes far beyond Block Earner or the crypto sector alone. They noted that one key implication concerns not just this case but the future of fintech innovation and regulatory compliance across Australia. The company said that despite the legal win, Block Earner has no plans to revive the “Earner” product. Block Earner has pivoted to other similar crypto-backed loan offerings while complying with regulatory requirements. ASIC and Block Earner battle in years-long legal duel ASIC has been battling with Block Earner for over two years . The matter commenced in November 2022 in response to ASIC’s proceedings claiming that Block Earner was issuing financial products without holding an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL). The product, Earner, allowed users to deposit crypto-assets like Bitcoin and earn a fixed rate of return. ASIC argued that this constituted a financial product under the law. In February 2024, the Federal Court agreed with the ASIC argument that Block Earner did require a license. But the court cut it a break in June 2024, opting not to levy any punishment, after determining that Block Earner had acted in good faith, sought legal counsel, and believed it was following the law. Block Earner challenged the license denial in July 2024, resulting in the April 2025 decision in its favor. Now, ASIC is seeking to overturn that outcome in the High Court. Proceeding requires leave of the High Court, which is granted only where a case raises substantial legal or constitutional issues.

Kristin Johnson Bids Farewell To The CFTC According to Johnson’s statement , the former Emory University professor has notified U.S. President Donald Trump of her decision to leave the CFTC at the end of the year. Statement of @CFTCjohnson on Her Departure from the CFTC https://t.co/YL6q62bXo3 — CFTC (@CFTC) May 21, 2025 “Although this is a difficult decision, I am proud of the work that I have accomplished and am deeply grateful for the chance to develop meaningful relationships with staff and current and former Commissioners during my tenure at the CFTC,” Johnson said. “I am confident that the Commission will continue to do important work protecting investors and customers, combatting fraud and market manipulation, and ensuring market integrity and stability,” she added. Fourth Departure of a CFTC Commissioner Johnson was originally appointed to the derivatives markets regulating agency under former U.S. President Joe Biden in 2022, with her term completed in April of this year. Her decision to step down marks the fourth departure of a CFTC commissioner in recent weeks, with Republican official Christy Goldsmith announcing her May 31 exit just last Friday. Fellow Commissioner Caroline Pham will also leave her position when Trump’s pick to lead the CFTC, Brian Quintenz, is appointed to his role – though a set date has yet to be confirmed. Meanwhile, Republican Commissioner Summer Mersinger will leave the agency on May 30 before beginning her tenure as CEO of the Blockchain Association . “It has been a privilege to work and serve at the CFTC in both the first and the current Trump Administrations, doing my part to assist in pursuing the President’s important policies,” Mersinger said in a May 14 farewell statement posted to the CFTC’s website. No future CFTC commissioners have been announced by Trump, though given the aforementioned officials’ upcoming exits, it appears highly likely that he will do so in the near future.

After a mild correction, however, the altcoin is trading below $0.28. Despite this, new data suggest that TRX has emerged as one of the most “resilient” crypto assets in a turbulent market, as it maintained proximity to its all-time high (ATH) alongside Bitcoin. This strength is supported by CryptoQuant’s Drawdown Heatmap, which revealed TRX’s significant recovery since its 2024 peak. TRX Market Recovery The report highlights TRX’s Sharpe Ratio – annualized over 180 days – hovering between 0.1 and 0.15, a range that suggests a moderate risk-return balance. This is sharp contrast to many altcoins suffering negative or near-zero Sharpe Ratios after recent corrections, TRX’s performance positions it as a more stable option. Complementing this is the Normalized Risk Metric (NRM), which remains close to 0.5. This moderate risk profile, significantly removed from high-alert or undervaluation levels, indicates healthy market behavior. Notably, TRX’s late-2024 rally was followed by only a mild correction, and its current positioning near ATH suggests underlying investor confidence and potential institutional interest. Unlike many assets still lagging behind their historic highs, TRX joins a select group showing strong macro resilience. As such, CryptoQuant stated that TRX offers a measured opportunity for risk-aware investors. The latest price action has pushed all almost all holders of the token to green. This has impacted almost all investor cohorts – from one-week traders to one-year investors – which has seen gains. Meanwhile, Tron founder Justin Sun has made headlines for reasons extending far beyond TRX’s market activity. Justin Sun Earns Trump Dinner Invite Sun has revealed himself as the top holder of Donald Trump’s TRUMP meme coin, which helped him unlock access to a private dinner and VIP reception with the US President. In a May 19 X post , Sun said he controlled the wallet under the username “Sun,” qualifying for the May 22 event hosted at Trump’s golf club. The timing of the announcement, just hours after the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, a key stablecoin regulation bill, has raised concerns from lawmakers. Sun, who happens to be a major backer and adviser to Trump-linked crypto firm World Liberty Financial (WLFI), had previously been entangled in an SEC lawsuit that was paused after Trump’s inauguration. His proximity to the Trump family has prompted criticism from Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren.

44936271,https://cryptonews.com/?p=363689,1747886240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44936271.jpeg,SafeMoon Ex-CEO Found Guilty on Every Charge,https://cryptonews.com/news/safemoon-ex-ceo-braden-karony-found-guilty-on-every-charge/,"A federal jury in the Eastern District of New York convicted former SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony on May 21 of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering after a 12-day trial that began on May 5. He now faces up to 45 years in prison and the forfeiture of illicit gains. Prosecutors detailed how Karony and his co-conspirators misled investors about the SafeMoon token design, falsely claiming that its liquidity pools were “locked” by a 10% transaction tax, that insiders could not perform a “rug pull,” and that tokens would serve only business purposes rather than personal enrichment. They also assured buyers that developers did not hold or trade SFM tokens, and that the team would manually add token pairs to the pool when trades occurred on major exchanges. (1/3) “As proven at trial, the SafeMoon digital asset was anything but safe and turned out to be pie in the sky for investors who were deliberately misled by Karony, a man who sought to get rich quick by stealing and diverting millions of dollars,” stated U.S. Attorney Nocella. — US Attorney EDNY (@EDNYnews) May 21, 2025 In reality, the defendants retained full access to the liquidity pools. Consequently, they diverted millions of dollars’ worth of SFM tokens for their own profit. $2.2M Utah Home Among Assets Bought with Fraud Proceeds Prosecutors say the defendants repeatedly bought and sold tokens at market peaks. Moreover, they routed proceeds through private wallets and pseudonymous accounts. As a result, Karony alone netted over $9m. He used those funds to buy a $2.2m home in Utah and additional properties in Utah and Kansas. He also purchased a $277,000 Audi R8, another Audi R8, a Tesla, and custom Ford F-550 and Jeep Gladiator trucks. Co-defendant Thomas Smith testified against Karony after pleading guilty and could receive a lighter sentence, while platform creator Kyle Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and remains at large. The jury also ordered forfeiture of one residential property and the proceeds from another, totalling about $2m. ‘Pie in the Sky’ Ruling Highlights Investor Betrayal The Justice Department’s business and securities fraud section is handling the case. Additionally, Assistant US Attorneys Dana Rehnquist, Sara Winik and Jessica Weigel are leading the prosecution. Meanwhile, Assistant US Attorney Laura Mantell is overseeing forfeiture matters. They are supported by paralegal specialists Asher Martin-Rosenthal and Madison Bates. “At trial, we proved that the SafeMoon digital asset was anything but safe and turned out to be pie in the sky for investors,” said US Attorney Jaqueline Romero Nocella. “Karony used his scheme to purchase homes, sports cars, custom trucks, and other luxury goods. This verdict should warn fraudsters that we will vigorously prosecute those who prey on digital-asset investors.” Karony’s trial followed the January sentencing of former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky to 12 years in prison after a guilty plea, and the 25-year term handed to former FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried in 2023. Those cases, alongside Wednesday’s verdict, point to the Justice Department’s intensified focus on digital asset markets and signal that executives who breach investor trust will face severe penalties.

Trump Coin, Chainlink (LINK), and TRON (TRX) are also gaining attention. But quietly building beneath the surface is a new contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE — and it may be the one with the most explosive setup this quarter. Dogecoin (DOGE) – 990% Network Spike Sparks Bullish Buzz As of May 16, DOGE trades at $0.2249, but user activity has exploded — with active addresses surging nearly 990% in just seven days. Forecasts for May suggest DOGE could trade between $0.305 and $0.443, with year-end targets as high as $1.00, depending on momentum and ETF chatter. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Burn Rate Surge and Ecosystem Growth SHIB is up over 12% this week, now priced at $0.000026. Technical setups point to a breakout, especially as Shibarium expands and developers continue to burn supply. Analysts see potential highs ranging from $0.0000326 to $0.00008471 in a sustained rally. Chainlink (LINK) and Trump Coin (TRUMP) – Volatile but Back in the Spotlight TRUMP COIN sits near $13, climbing over 25% this week. Past rallies have sent it to $75, and 2025 targets range from $67 to $200. With U.S. election narratives heating up and ETF speculation swirling, the stage is set for renewed volatility — and opportunity. Trading between $16.39 and $16.77, LINK is up 29% this week. If it breaks the $15.30 level with volume, analysts forecast a move toward $19.50. LINK’s role in tokenized assets and cross-chain data flows makes it a top candidate for further institutional adoption. TRON (TRX) – Quiet But Consistent Gains TRX is trading at $0.268, up 7.23% this week and 107% year-over-year. Its leadership in stablecoins and growing DeFi adoption position it as a foundational blockchain. May price targets range from $0.271 to $0.35, with $0.75 on the table if momentum continues. MAGACOIN FINANCE – This Is Still the Beginning It’s not just the price point — although MAGACOIN FINANCE remains below $0.001. It’s the structure. Whales are stepping in because they recognize the power of early-stage projects with viral potential, political timing, and strong tokenomics. With over $8 million raised, the project has already exceeded early expectations — but this isn’t about past performance. It’s about what comes next. Stage 8 is live. Stage 9 is approaching. Each new phase increases exclusivity and upside. Insiders are anticipating a series of major announcements in the coming weeks — including integrations, expanded media coverage, and updated roadmap milestones. Built for scalability, not just hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has avoided early exchange dilution and is growing through community-first momentum. Investors using promo code MAGA50X receive a 50% token bonus, a key driver behind current whale accumulation. For those asking if they’re late — they’re not. Stage 8 is live. The door is still open — for now.

A Synthetix spokesperson told Cointelegraph on May 22 that its acquisition proposal, pitched to its community and to Derive’s , “did not resonate,” and both projects agreed to “step back from the proposed acquisition.” Synthetix said on May 14 that it would acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million, pending approval from both communities. Synthetix strategy lead Ben Celermajer told Cointelegraph that other community concerns were the three-month token lock-up period and the deal’s price, part of which Synthetix tried to address with no lock-up for holders of less than 1 million DRV. “While we understand the commercials did not resonate with all community members, a number of holders from both communities believed the deal was fair and acceptable,” he said. “However, we acknowledge that the response fell short of expectations, and we have no intention of moving forward with something that was intended to be a collaborative and constructive endeavor.” Celermajer said Synthetix will continue evaluating opportunities for building a decentralized derivatives platform on the Ethereum mainnet . Source: Synthetix Derive community concerned on deal’s benefits Derive community members expressed concerns over the deal on the project's forum, particularly around the token exchange rate and the deal's overall benefit to the platform. Derive user “Ramjo” wrote on May 14 that the token exchange rate is “a poor reflection of the value of derive as a platform,” and the “equivalent of selling the bottom and locking in lows.” Related: Synthetix founder threatens SNX stakers with ‘the stick’ to fix SUSD depeg Another user, “AlvaroHK,” called the deal “difficult to justify,” as they claimed that Derive generates more revenue than Synthetix, and there was no clause in the agreement to stop Synthetix from “printing millions of new tokens and keep diluting us.” AlvaroHK claims Derive generates more revenue than Synthetix, which makes the deal a tall order to justify. Source: Derive “I have found the guidance that Synthetix plans to issue an additional 170 million SNX to increase its supply to 500 million from 330 million,” AlvaroHK added in a follow-up post. “Why this information is not disclosed when asked about it? It will dilute an additional 60% off the value of the offer made to Derive,” they added. Derive, which Synthetix started in 2021 as Lyra, operated as a decentralized options protocol but remained part of the Synthetix ecosystem. It eventually rebranded to Derive and took steps to operate independently from Synthetix, such as moving away from using Synthetix’s sUSD stablecoin and liquidity.

The price is now rising and might aim for an upside break above $2.450. XRP price started a decent increase above the $2.3650 zone. The price is now trading above $2.380 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.3580 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.450 resistance. XRP Price Eyes Steady Increase XRP price started a fresh downside correction in a range and traded below the $2.380 zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.3650 and $2.350 levels. The price tested the $2.3350 zone. A low was formed at $2.33360 and the price is now moving higher. There was a move above the $2.350 and $2.3650 levels. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.4315 swing high to the $2.3360 high. The price is now trading above $2.38 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.3580 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.410 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.4315 swing high to the $2.3360 high. The first major resistance is near the $2.4320 level. The next resistance is $2.450. A clear move above the $2.450 resistance might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.550 resistance or even $2.5650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.650. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.450 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.3650 level.

The massive bill combines tax, immigration, energy, defense, and debt-ceiling measures. It has also reopened many old divisions in the GOP and created a few new ones, a risky mix for leaders who can afford to lose only a handful of votes. Conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus are pressing hardest, according to Fox News . They want the bill to shrink Medicaid’s Affordable Care Act expansion and to implement work requirements for able-bodied adults on the healthcare program before the bill’s 2029 deadline. Most Republicans agree that people who are able to work should do so in order to keep government health coverage, but moderates warn that cutting too deeply into the Obamacare expansion could cost them support in tight districts. Freedom Caucus lawmakers say their goal is simply to move limited resources toward the poor, women, and children who need help the most. The same conservatives also demand a full reversal of President Joe Biden’s green-energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. That stance has put them at odds with Republicans from districts where companies have already based business plans on those incentives. At the same time, moderates from California, New York, and New Jersey are focusing on the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction cap. They argue that lifting that limit is essential for residents of high-cost areas such as New York City and Los Angeles. Several of those lawmakers say the issue will decide whether the GOP can keep its seats, and possibly the House majority, in 2026. They also note that their narrow 2024 wins relied on the same voters. GOP clash over raising the state and local tax deduction limit The $10,000 SALT cap first appeared in President Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It remains popular with most Republicans, especially those from lower-tax states. Republicans in Tennessee and Missouri say raising the cap gives unfair tax breaks to high-tax Democratic states. Republicans in coastal states say they send more money to Washington, which benefits low-tax states. Some Republicans in states with green-energy companies don’t want big cuts to those tax credits. Representatives from Arizona and Pennsylvania say taking the credits away now would hurt businesses that already counted on them. In March, twenty-one House Republicans sent a letter urging leaders to keep those benefits. “Countless American companies are utilizing sector-wide energy tax credits, many of which have enjoyed broad support in Congress, to make major investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure for traditional and renewable energy sources alike,” they wrote. Conservative fiscal hawks responded with their own letter, insisting that the fast-growing green-tech field is funded by government handouts, not genuine market demand. “Leaving IRA subsidies intact will actively undermine America’s return to energy dominance and national security,” they said. “They are the result of government subsidies that distort the U.S. energy sector, displace reliable coal and natural gas and the domestic jobs they produce, and put the stability and independence of our electric grid in jeopardy.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-22 05:00:38

While legacy giants like XRP and Ethereum (ETH) maintain solid footing, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) that’s rapidly shifting from outsider to headline contender. With price discovery still ahead and investor enthusiasm building, some are calling MAGA the next major altcoin explosion in waiting. Add in continued development from Solana (SOL) and Cosmos (ATOM) , and it’s clear: the next wave of crypto growth could be led by a mix of institutional favorites and politically charged newcomers. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW XRP Holds Steady, But Multiples Look Capped XRP continues to benefit from legal clarity and real-world utility. Its place in global remittance remains strong, and banking partnerships support the long-term outlook. However, for short- to mid-term traders, the ceiling may already be in view. Price forecasts range from $2.50 to $4 by year-end, representing 2x–4x potential for most buyers. That’s a solid return — but one that likely won’t satisfy those chasing exponential upside. Ethereum Builds Quietly Toward ETF Tailwinds Behind the scenes, Ethereum (ETH) is strengthening its foundations. The Pectra upgrade has boosted performance, and ETF rumors continue to swirl. Trading near $2,600, ETH remains the backbone of smart contracts and Web3 infrastructure. However, its size works against it for quick gains. Most analysts expect modest movement relative to small caps, pushing traders to explore higher-risk, high-reward altcoins in parallel. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Drawing Analyst Attention Unlike legacy tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fresh, politically charged, and deeply narrative-driven. With a strong cultural hook and emerging visibility across major media platforms like MSN and Google News, MAGA is being quietly loaded by traders who see a breakout forming. Its roadmap includes exchange listings, influencer partnerships, and growing community initiatives — all positioned to drive virality in Q3. Analysts are now projecting that MAGA could hit $0.007 , translating to up to 25x upside from current levels. And with a limited-time PATRIOT35X bonus , early buyers are maximizing their token counts — pushing projected returns closer to 35x. This is the type of asymmetric setup that retail and whale wallets alike are hunting for. Solana and Cosmos Gain Steam — But Eyes Are on MAGA Solana (SOL) continues to scale rapidly, gaining traction in NFT integrations and transaction speeds. Cosmos (ATOM) is also pushing forward with interchain interoperability, attracting developers and niche investors. Yet despite their growth, neither SOL nor ATOM offers the entry price or early-stage excitement that MAGACOIN FINANCE brings to the table. Traders seeking breakout returns are increasingly favoring MAGA as the go-to allocation heading into Q3. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Final Thoughts As the crypto market eyes its next explosive move, a new narrative is taking shape. Legacy tokens like XRP , Ethereum , Solana , and Cosmos remain solid picks — but for traders chasing 10,000% potential, the early signals point to MAGACOIN FINANCE . With a cultural edge, aggressive tokenomics, and rising analyst coverage, MAGA is quickly becoming a high-conviction bet for those ready to move before the listings go live.

Per the DOJ release , he used investors’ money to fund a lavish lifestyle. “Jordan-Jones’s alleged blatant lies funded his personal lifestyle at the expense of unknowing victims,” said Christopher Raia, FBI assistant director. The prosecutors noted that he falsely claimed that Amalgam had lucrative high-profile partnerships with major-league sports teams and prominent payment-processing platforms. He also made misleading statements regarding the blockchain firm’s financial condition, they added. “He touted his company as a groundbreaking blockchain startup, backed by high-profile partnerships,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “In reality, Jordan-Jones’s company was a sham, and investors’ funds were siphoned off to bankroll his lavish lifestyle.” Founder Touted Fake Amalgam Crypto Token Listing Additionally, Jordan-Jones solicited investments by promising that the money would be used to initiate the listing of Amalgam’s crypto coin. He also promised to use the investors’ money for hardware, software, and other expenses associated with the Amalgam’s operations. Further, he submitted falsified financial statements to a bank, the release read. The FBI warned users that fraudsters often use the “promise of new technology to cloak their schemes.” Last month, the Bureau had recorded a staggering $9.3 billion in losses to crypto-related fraud, scams and extortion.

This pressure came directly from Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who on Wednesday urged Trump to force Elon and all other employees in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to sign legal documents stating they won’t use non-public data gained while working for the government. This request followed concerns that Elon and his team had access to confidential data spanning a wide range of agencies, which could end up being used for personal gain once they leave public service. Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, pointed out that DOGE’s staff includes many former employees from Elon’s companies like Tesla and SpaceX, and that they’ve had what she described as “unprecedented” access to massive amounts of sensitive information. The agencies involved include the Social Security Administration, the Treasury, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and others that aren’t named. Shaheen’s concern is that without firm restrictions, some of these individuals could jump right back into the private sector and use what they’ve seen behind closed doors to strengthen their own businesses or those tied to Elon. Shaheen raises alarm over ethics risks with DOGE departures In her letter to Trump, Shaheen warned about what she described as the dangerous mix of tech insiders and government access. “I am very concerned that SGEs [special government employees], many of whom come from the tech field, may return to the private sector and use nonpublic information from the federal government to give their personal business activities an unfair and anticompetitive boost,” she wrote. Shaheen also said that Steve Bannon, a former White House strategist under Trump, shares this concern. Bannon told Semafor’s Ben Smith he wanted official proof that no one has taken data from the government. When asked whether that meant he didn’t trust Elon, Bannon replied, “Trust, but verify.” Despite all that, a White House official dismissed Shaheen’s letter as “pointless” and said the employees in question already have to follow federal ethics rules. That includes regulations that forbid them from misusing their position or any information obtained while in government service. Elon, who gave financial support to Trump’s 2024 campaign, currently leads a mix of high-profile companies. Those include Tesla, SpaceX, and Starlink, as well as xAI, which builds artificial intelligence tools like the Grok chatbot. xAI recently merged with X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, which is currently under investigation by Canada’s privacy regulator for allegedly using user data to train Grok without permission. These developments have fueled even more criticism of Elon’s access to government records during his term in DOGE. DOGE was created to help cut waste in federal operations, and Trump handed Elon the reins. Since then, Elon has slashed departments, gutted agencies, and proposed eliminating entire regulatory offices—most of which are directly responsible for overseeing his private companies. Elon’s 130-day term as an SGE is nearly up, and so is the term for several DOGE employees. While a few are expected to take permanent government jobs, others are planning a return to the private sector.

Big Bitcoin Moves The asset has now gained more than 17% since the beginning of the year and is up around 47% since its April 7 crash to $75,000. Momentum is being driven by institutions as spot exchange-traded funds and corporations continue to aggressively accumulate the asset. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have seen six consecutive trading days of inflows totalling more than $2 billion. Meanwhile, companies such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japanese investment firm Metaplanet continue to scoop up BTC for their treasuries.

Strategy’s unrealized profit soared to $23.5 billion with the new Bitcoin all-time high. The stash is now worth an eye-watering $63.7 billion, according to the Saylor Tracker. Nevertheless, things are relatively quiet on the retail front with macroeconomic clouds darkening, inflation woes increasing, and social sentiment and searches at bear market lows.

BTC rose nearly 3.5% to touch $111,878 during Asian morning hours, CoinGecko data shows, lifting overall market capitalization 1.7%. Major tokens from xrp to dogecoin (DOGE) showed little movement The demand isn’t just coming from crypto-native funds or retail traders. Publicly listed companies increasingly treat BTC as a treasury asset, using capital markets to raise cash and buy more of the token. “We think that large institutions are driving Bitcoin’s rally,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, said in a Telegram message. “This trend will likely continue, especially as more companies tap public markets and ETF inflows remain strong. May alone saw $3.6 billion in net ETF demand. ”Options traders have taken note.

After years of public skepticism, JPMorgan Chase reportedly offers clients access to bitcoin, signaling a deeper shift in how traditional finance views crypto exposure. “As the largest bank in the U.S., its decision adds a new layer of legitimacy to Bitcoin, potentially nudging other traditional financial institutions toward similar offerings to avoid falling behind,” said Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, in a message to CoinDesk. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, including rising bond yields, geopolitical noise, and a downgraded U.S. credit rating, bitcoin has shown “remarkable resilience,” said QCP Capital in a Thursday note. “A breakout to new highs could ignite a fresh wave of FOMO,” they added, “dragging in sidelined retail capital and pushing prices even higher.”",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Pizza Day|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-22 05:24:48

That’s a sharp contrast from Trump’s usual public line, where he’s painted Putin as a leader who actually wants peace. This new take came during a private call that included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, according to The Wall Street Journal . Until now, Trump has avoided publicly stating that Putin has no interest in ending the war. That changed on this call. Despite this private acknowledgment, Trump hasn’t taken the action that Zelensky and the Europeans have repeatedly pushed for, he still hasn’t moved to put pressure on Russia with new sanctions. Trump changes his position before and after Putin call A day before that call, on Sunday, Trump spoke with Macron, Merz, Meloni, and new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He told them he might consider imposing sanctions if Putin rejected a cease-fire. Instead of sanctions, Trump said he wanted to speed up low-level talks between Ukraine and Russia, and have them take place at the Vatican. Zelensky was part of Monday’s call. European leaders had spent ten days building pressure on Trump, hoping he would use America’s influence to get Putin to stop. That effort didn’t work. Trump didn’t commit to anything serious. He just kept repeating that the war wasn’t his fight. “This isn’t my war,” Trump told reporters on Monday. “We got ourselves entangled in something we shouldn’t have been involved in.” Some of the Europeans on the call wanted any talks at the Vatican to include an unconditional cease-fire. Trump didn’t like that. He claimed he never used the word “unconditional,” even though his May 8 post on Truth Social clearly included it when he called for a 30-day cease-fire. Eventually, the Europeans gave up on using that word. Europeans test Trump after Merz takes power The diplomatic push got more aggressive when Friedrich Merz became chancellor earlier in May. Unlike former chancellor Olaf Scholz, Merz is more willing to take on Putin. His government even changed Germany’s constitution to allow for more military spending. On May 10, Merz, Macron, Starmer, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk made a surprise visit to Zelensky in Kyiv. During the visit, they called Trump directly using Macron’s phone and told him Ukraine was on board with the 30-day cease-fire. They warned Putin that Europe would push fresh sanctions if he didn’t go along. Putin responded to that warning by offering direct talks with Ukraine for the first time in three years. Trump jumped at that and even suggested he might travel to Turkey to join the talks. A meeting happened in Istanbul, but Putin didn’t show up. He sent mid-level negotiators instead, who repeated Russia’s usual demands, which Ukraine had already rejected. After that no-show, the European leaders came back to Trump again. They told him Putin’s behavior proved that stronger action was needed. They passed some minor sanctions, but bigger ones are still in the works. Trump said he had scheduled a new call with Putin because he believed that a peace deal couldn’t happen without a conversation between the two leaders. During the Sunday call with European leaders (before speaking with Putin) Trump said the US could team up with Europe on sanctioning Russian oil and banks. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, said Wednesday that he had already secured 81 co-sponsors for a bill that would hit Russia hard with energy and financial sanctions. That Sunday call also had moments of typical Trump. He praised Merz for his English. “I love it even more with your German accent,” Trump told him. But he also veered into attacking Europe’s migration policies, saying their countries were at the “brink of collapse.” Macron, who has known Trump longer than anyone else on the call, asked him to stop. “You cannot insult our nations, Donald,” he said. Even with that awkward moment, some on the call thought Trump might support new sanctions if Putin refused peace. But those hopes were short-lived. The Vatican talks are now scheduled for mid-June.

While Bitcoin explores historic highs above $110K, WLD exhibits a bullish structure, catalyzed by the latest sale of $135 million worth of tokens by World Foundation’s subsidiary World Assets. Notably, early supporters, including Bain Capital Crypto and a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), purchased the tokens. The announcement indicated that the funding will offer Worldcoin financial support to bolster its global expansion after its latest entry into the United States . Criptovaluta.it @CriptovalutaI · Follow . @Worldcoin raises 135M from Bain and Andreessen Horowitz 7:22 PM · May 21, 2025 20 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply Moreover, the latest move comes after previous investments from leading companies like Selini Capital, Artic Digital, and Miran Ventures, confirming impressive institutional appetite for Sam Altman’s project. Notably, Worldcoin remains in pursuit of its objective of introducing internet-verified biometric identification, a narrative that has attracted limitations in multiple jurisdictions. Recently, Kenyan regulators directed the AI project to suspend its operations in the country and delete the collected biometric data. Worldcoin’s biometric device, Orb, which scans irises to generate unique user IDs, has attracted controversy globally. Individuals can use the IDs to partake in the WLD ecosystem, verify their uniqueness, and access different online services. Despite setbacks from surveillance and privacy concerns, the AI project continues to onboard users. Worldcoin will use the latest funding to support biometric data collection and issue World IDs. WLD price outlook The alt jumped from the 24-hour low of $1.103 to $1.2536 (a 13.65% increase) hours after the funding news. WLD trades at $1.24 after brief corrections from its daily high, though still 11% up on its 24-hour timeframe. Its trading volume has increased by 92% within the past day, signaling renewed trader and investor interest in the altcoin. Chart by Coinmarketcap The bullish outlook suggests a positive reaction due to institutional backing and capital inflow. These elements could support Worldcoin’s long-term growth. Nevertheless, WLD should reclaim $1.30 to change its short-term outlook to bullish. A candlestick closing above this mark could support rallies to $3.30 before extending to $3.60. That would mean a 190% surge from current prices. Meanwhile, the $3.30 – $3.60 resistance will likely catalyze near-term pullbacks. That could print a “classic” head and shoulders formation, setting the grounds for bullish continuation. Nonetheless, intensified regulations could halt the projected uptrend. In the near term, the altcoin should stabilize above $1.30 for extended rallies. Broad market sentiments would be vital for shaping WLD’s trajectory in the upcoming sessions. Bitcoin trades at record highs, and analyst Ali Martinez anticipates continued upswings as the top crypto enters a price discovery phase. BTC bulls target the $116K mark to open the gates towards the $126K zone.

Just as the chart pattern emerged, Volatility Shares announced it will launch the first XRP futures ETF under the ticker XRPI on May 22, further solidifying XRP's growing appeal among professional investors. XRP Forms First-Ever Weekly Golden Cross Against Bitcoin, Marking Potential Turning Point in Crypto Market In what could mark a watershed moment for altcoin markets, XRP has just achieved a rare and historic technical milestone: its first-ever golden cross against Bitcoin on the weekly chart. The move, which occurred as XRP’s 50-week moving average crossed above its 200-week moving average, is widely interpreted by analysts as a powerful bullish signal and could foreshadow a long-awaited breakout from a years-long consolidation phase. The technical achievement comes amid strengthening fundamentals for the XRP Ledger and a wave of renewed investor interest driven by regulatory clarity, increasing network activity, and long-term accumulation trends. With this golden cross, XRP may be positioned to outperform Bitcoin for the first sustained period since the onset of its legal troubles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020. Golden cross on the XRP/BTC weekly chart (Source: TradingView) A golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average—in this case, the 50-week moving average—crosses above a longer-term moving average, typically the 200-week MA. This event is seen by many traders as a long-term bullish reversal indicator, suggesting a shift in momentum that favors upward price action. For XRP, the significance is heightened because the asset has spent nearly four years in a tight range against Bitcoin, mostly due to the chilling effect of regulatory uncertainty stemming from the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple. The golden cross, appearing on a high timeframe like the weekly chart, signals a potential long-term reversal of that trend. Since late 2020, XRP has struggled to keep pace with Bitcoin’s explosive growth. While other altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche rode the wave of crypto adoption and institutional interest, XRP found itself sidelined due to legal constraints. The SEC’s case alleging Ripple Labs conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP significantly suppressed investor sentiment and exchange listings. However, the tide began to turn in mid-2023 when a US federal court partially ruled in Ripple’s favor, stating that XRP is not a security in itself—a legal nuance that opened the floodgates for renewed market participation. Now, with regulatory clarity, XRP is once again viewed as a viable long-term bet. Network Growth Confirms Strength Behind the Charts This technical breakout isn’t happening in a vacuum. According to Messari’s “State of XRP Ledger Q1 2025” report, XRP is experiencing a surge in fundamental usage that aligns with its bullish chart pattern. The report highlights that XRP’s market capitalization increased by 2% quarter over quarter, while Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) experienced a combined decline of 22%. On a year-over-year basis, XRP's circulating market capitalization has grown a stunning 252%, rising from $34.6 billion at the end of Q1 2024. Further reinforcing the bullish picture, XRP network activity has soared: Average daily active addresses surged by 142% quarter over quarter to reach 134,600. Total new addresses climbed 12% from the previous quarter, hitting 568,300—a 210% increase from Q1 2024. Daily receiver addresses rose by 168%, indicating strong user inflow and payment utility. Daily sender addresses grew by 14.5%, showing both new participation and ongoing transactional engagement. These metrics point to real usage growth, not just speculative trading, which adds credibility to the idea that XRP's current rally could have longer-lasting momentum. The golden cross also coincides with rising institutional and retail demand for XRP and XRPL-based services. With US-based exchanges re-listing the token and developers increasingly turning to the XRP Ledger for decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset tokenization solutions, interest in the ecosystem is ramping up. Blockchain intelligence firm Kaiko recently noted a “resurgence in XRP liquidity across major centralized exchanges,” particularly against BTC and stablecoins, which further validates the potential for increased trading volume and capital rotation. Additionally, tokenization efforts on XRPL, combined with Ripple’s ongoing global partnerships in cross-border settlements and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), are attracting long-term believers who see XRP as more than just a trading vehicle. Short-Term Outlook The market has already begun to price in XRP’s technical breakout against BTC, with some traders rotating from Bitcoin and Ethereum into XRP in anticipation of higher beta moves. The XRP/BTC pair is currently testing key horizontal resistance levels not seen since mid-2021. A successful breakout from this consolidation range could see XRP rapidly climb to higher satoshi values, with chart watchers eyeing the 0.00003000 and 0.00004500 BTC levels as possible upside targets. Analysts caution, however, that golden crosses do not guarantee sustained bull runs. Volatility Shares to Launch First-Ever XRP Futures ETF, Fueling Hopes for Spot XRP ETF Approval Meanwhile, Volatility Shares is set to launch the world’s first-ever 1x XRP Futures ETF on May 22, ushering in a new chapter in the institutional adoption of Ripple’s native token. The announcement, confirmed by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on X, has sent waves through the market as anticipation builds around XRP’s growing legitimacy in the eyes of regulators and traditional finance players. Trading under the ticker XRPI, the ETF will be part of the Volatility Shares Trust and represents the first XRP-linked futures exchange-traded fund to offer 1x exposure, a more conservative investment product compared to existing leveraged alternatives. The move positions XRP as the third major cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin and Ethereum, to receive such ETF treatment, reinforcing its standing as one of the most watched digital assets in the institutional space. XRP’s Institutional Milestone Volatility Shares’ decision to roll out the 1x XRP Futures ETF comes just 48 hours after the CME Group debuted XRP futures trading, a long-anticipated listing that finally opened the door for regulated futures exposure to XRP. That listing has proven to be a catalyst, rapidly expanding interest from hedge funds, market makers, and asset managers who previously lacked access to compliant XRP derivatives. Now, with an ETF product wrapping those futures contracts in a more accessible structure, institutional demand is expected to surge. The move by Volatility Shares also sets the stage for potential competition with Tectrium’s 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, which was launched just a few weeks earlier. While Tectrium’s product offers double the daily gains of XRP, it carries higher risk due to its leveraged structure. Despite the volatility, Tectrium’s ETF already commands $120 million in AUM and sees $35 million in daily trading volume, making it a significant player in the crypto ETF space. However, many analysts argue that a non-leveraged product like XRPI will attract a wider class of investors, particularly conservative institutions and retirement-focused funds that are often barred from investing in leveraged ETFs. The timing of Volatility Shares’ ETF could not be more strategic. XRP futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are already drawing attention, as the listing provides legally compliant access for US-based institutions. The trading pairs offer monthly and quarterly contracts, settled in cash, and are already showing signs of robust liquidity. By providing 1x exposure through an ETF, Volatility Shares bridges the gap between complex derivatives markets and traditional ETF rails, allowing investors to trade XRP indirectly via any brokerage account that supports ETFs. This structure mimics the success of BITO (ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF) and BTF (Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF), which are based on CME Bitcoin futures. Spot XRP ETF on the Horizon? With the launch of XRPI imminent, speculation has reached fever pitch regarding the fate of a spot XRP ETF. While the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to publicly comment on such an application, insiders suggest that the groundwork is being laid. Ripple’s partial legal victory against the SEC in 2023 provided regulatory clarity around the non-security status of XRP in secondary markets, and the successful launch of CME XRP futures appears to have removed one of the biggest hurdles for spot ETF approval—regulated market surveillance. Industry observers are drawing parallels to the Bitcoin spot ETF approval process, which also began with the launch of CME futures followed by years of market maturation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-22 05:30:00

The token's ability to recover from a sudden drop to 0.0000143 with extraordinary volume support suggests institutional accumulation rather than retail panic. With the psychological support at 0.000015 holding firm and multiple tests of upper resistance, SHIB appears poised for potential continuation of its upward trajectory if current accumulation patterns persist. Technical Analysis Highlights SHIB demonstrated remarkable resilience over the 24-hour period, climbing from 0.0000146 to 0.0000150, representing a 2.85% gain with a range of 0.00000081 (5.64%). The token experienced significant volatility at 17:00 when price plummeted to 0.0000143 before finding strong volume support. A massive 2.83 trillion volume spike—nearly 4x the average—provided crucial support during the recovery phase. Key resistance at 0.0000151 was tested twice during the period, with accumulation patterns forming in the final hours. Three consecutive high-volume candles (23:00-01:00) established a solid foundation above the 0.000015 psychological level. In the last hour, SHIB exhibited notable volatility with a significant price surge at 01:22 when it broke above the 0.0000151 resistance level, reaching 0.00001514 by 01:31. Elevated trading volumes supported the bullish momentum, particularly during the 01:36 candle which recorded nearly 80 billion in volume. A sharp correction at 01:37-01:38 dropped the price 5% to 0.00001505, before establishing a consolidation pattern.

Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Still Outside Of Overbought Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the NVT Golden Cross for Bitcoin. The NVT Ratio is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the BTC market cap and transaction volume. If the utility of the network (measured in terms of the transfer volume) is considered as a reflection of its ‘true’ value, then this ratio can be used for judging whether the price is undervalued or overvalued. Related Reading: $3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows When the value of the indicator is high, it means the value of the network (that is, the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins. Such a trend may be a sign that the asset is becoming overpriced. On the other hand, the indicator being low could imply room for growth in the cryptocurrency’s market cap, as its value is low when compared to the transaction volume. In the context of the current topic, a derivative form of the NVT Ratio is the indicator of interest. This metric, known as the NVT Golden Cross, is a signaling indicator for the NVT Ratio similar to the Bollinger Bands, telling us about whether the ratio’s value is near a top or bottom. The NVT Golden Cross compares two moving averages (MAs) of the NVT Ratio in order to determine this: the 10-day MA to gauge the short-term trend and the 30-day MA for the long-term one. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has been on the rise recently as the cryptocurrency’s price has rallied to a new ATH. At present, the indicator is sitting at a value of 1.5. In the chart, the quant has highlighted two zones for the metric that have been of significance in the past. The region beyond 2.2 (shaded in red) corresponds to the territory where tops generally occur for BTC and that under -1.6 (green) to the bottoming zone. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say Clearly, despite the recent uptrend, the NVT Golden Cross hasn’t yet broken into the red zone, a potential sign that the cryptocurrency may still not be too overpriced. Naturally, this could allow room for the run to continue further. BTC Price Bitcoin set a new record earlier today as its price briefly went to $109,400, surpassing the previous ATH around $109,200.

Tether’s decision to pull USDT from top European exchanges stems from MiCA’s tight rules with no interest payouts, strict cash reserves, capped issuance/redemptions, and required links to EU banks. With USDT gone, RLUSD might be the top contender poised to dominate, since Bitstamp, the leading European cryptocurrency exchange, has already listed RLUSD stablecoin , making it a prime fit. As crypto analyst Jake Claver put it, “Tether took one look and said, ‘we’re out.’” And just like that, a $150 billion liquidity engine exited one of the largest crypto markets. The EU lost its most widely-used stablecoin with USDT being pulled from major exchanges across Europe, all thanks to new MiCA regulations—and Tether’s decision not to play along. That opens up a huge opportunity in the market. But the real question is: who’s going to benefit? The… pic.twitter.com/aqM5WWYTPg — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) May 22, 2025 Ripple Moves In: RLUSD Grabs the Spotlight Without USDT, Europe’s crypto trading landscape looks dented. Liquidity is drying up, and users are slowly shifting to platforms outside the EU. Meanwhile, he said Circle is stepping in with MiCA-compliant USDC and EURC, but their combined market size is still small compared to USDT. While Circle offers compliance, it lacks the scale to replace Tether’s dominance fully. Claver explains, “USDC is compliant but small. Tether is massive but non-compliant. Ripple’s RLUSD brings the best of both worlds.” USDC vs RLUSD: Who Can Fill Tether’s $150B Shoes? Claver highlights that Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could quietly become the biggest winner in this scenario. RLUSD launched in December, fully compliant with MiCA, runs on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, and is supported by Ripple’s institutional partnerships. Unlike other projects focused on the US, Ripple had already built strong global connections, particularly in Asia, where regional stablecoins are gaining popularity. However, Ripple’s early preparation is now paying off. RLUSD offers a rare combination of regulatory alignment and global reach. According to Claver, this positions Ripple as the most likely candidate to fill the stablecoin gap in the EU. With USDT stepping aside and Circle struggling to scale, Ripple has a clear opportunity to reshape the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Launches Digital Asset Authority to Regulate Crypto, Targeting $25B Market , On the Contrary… Hey Jake, How does Tether not being MiCA compliant and not being compliant with the Genius act , affect Bitcoin.

Tether withdrew USDT due to MiCA’s strict regulations, which impose tight rules on stablecoin issuers, including no interest payouts, strict cash reserves, capped issuance, and mandatory links to EU banks. What is MiCA and how does it affect stablecoins in the EU? MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) is a comprehensive EU framework that sets stringent rules for stablecoin issuers, demanding full reserves, regulatory authorization, and transparency to enhance consumer protection and market stability. How does RLUSD compare to Circle’s USDC in the EU market? While USDC is MiCA-compliant, it lacks the scale to fully replace USDT. RLUSD, also compliant, offers a combination of regulatory alignment and Ripple’s global reach, positioning it strongly. What are the broader implications of USDT’s departure for the EU crypto market? USDT’s exit is causing liquidity drying up and users shifting platforms.

According to the official announcement , USD1 will begin trading at 12:00 UTC on May 22 and withdrawals will open the following day. USD1 is a fiat-backed stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. It was launched in March by World Liberty Financial, a Miami-based fintech firm tied to Donald Trump and his family. The token is backed by cash, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and dollar deposits and is issued and managed by BitGo Trust Company, a regulated U.S. trust entity. While reserve audits are conducted regularly, detailed breakdowns remain private. The Binance listing could significantly boost USD1’s liquidity and visibility. Already listed on exchanges like KuCoin, USD1 has quickly become the seventh-largest stablecoin by market cap, surpassing a $2.1 billion market capitalization in May. You might also like: World Liberty Financial approves proposal to airdrop a fixed amount of USD1 to WLFI holders Its rapid rise has been fueled by institutional backing, including a $2 billion investment agreement with Abu Dhabi’s MGX, as well as its growing application in retail payments and decentralized finance platforms. USD1 currently operates on Ethereum ( ETH ) and BNB Chain ( BNB ), with plans to use Chainlink’s ( LINK ) cross-chain protocol to expand to other networks. USD1 aims to become a major competitor to well-known stablecoins like Tether ( USDT ) and USD Coin ( USDC ) by offering features like fee-free minting and institutional-grade custody. But there has been some controversy surrounding stablecoin’s rise. U.S. lawmakers, particularly Senate Democrats, have expressed concern about the Trump family’s close ties to WLFI. The company’s “Chief Crypto Advocate” is Donald Trump, and its “Web3 Ambassadors” are his sons. Given that stablecoin regulation, including the proposed GENIUS Act, is still a contentious topic, critics argue that this raises the possibility of conflicts of interest. Despite the political scrutiny, WLFI maintains that USD1 is fully compliant with U.S. regulations, including anti-money laundering and know-your-customer standards. A recent legal response to a congressional probe dismissed the concerns as “fundamentally flawed.” As USD1 prepares to debut on the world’s largest crypto exchange, all eyes are on whether its momentum can continue.

It took just over four months, but bitcoin managed to do what many thought was impossible just 45 days ago when its price slumped beneath $75,000 and broke its January all-time high of over $109,000. In the following hours, it retraced hard to $106,000, but the bulls took over once again and sent it flying to almost $112,000, which is the current peak. This puts the asset in a price discovery mode, which means a couple of things: 1) all investors are in profit, and 2) there are no historic resistances ahead.

In a market saturated with speculation and short-term gains, UGO takes a bold step toward creating a more balanced and inclusive Web3 economy. Traders can now access UGO through decentralized trading on PancakeSwap, while the token’s user-centric reward structure seeks to empower users, promote longevity, and foster true ecosystem participation. “This isn’t just another token launch—it’s a reimagining of how Web3 ecosystems can and should operate,” said the UGO founding team. “We believe that sustainability, fairness, and utility must coexist from day one. The Hybrid Token Model is our answer to that challenge.” The UGO Difference: A Launch Built for Long-Term Value UGO moves away from traditional crypto launch tactics that favor insiders and early profit takers.

44939942,https://coinpaper.com/9219/genius-act-seen-as-turning-point-in-stablecoin-legitimacy,1747892768,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,GENIUS Act Seen as Turning Point in Stablecoin Legitimacy,https://coinpaper.com/9219/genius-act-seen-as-turning-point-in-stablecoin-legitimacy,"People in the industry like Andrei Grachev argue it could legitimize stablecoins as financial instruments and serve as a cornerstone for a global, programmable financial system. However, some people like Bitget’s Vugar Usi Zade warn that the bill could hurt US-based issuers by placing them at a regulatory disadvantage against dominant offshore players like Tether. The rise of yield-bearing stablecoins also triggered pushback from traditional banks, who are accused of lobbying to block interest payments on stable assets. Meanwhile, Hong Kong passed its own fiat-backed stablecoin legislation, opening the door to licensed issuance by year-end. GENIUS Act Advances Stablecoin Legitimacy The adoption of stablecoins by institutional investors could be poised for massive growth as the United States Senate moves forward with its landmark bill to regulate the sector. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act aims to create a clear legal framework for stablecoin collateralization and enforce Anti-Money Laundering compliance. It advanced past a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and will now proceed to full Senate debate. The GENIUS Act is a big step toward mainstream acceptance of stablecoins. Industry leaders like Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance, believe the bill goes beyond regulation and effectively legitimizes stablecoins as financial instruments. In a Chain Reaction X Spaces interview on May 20, Grachev said that the clarity provided by the legislation could be the confidence booster institutions have been waiting for. According to him, stablecoins have moved beyond the experimental stage and now offer a superior alternative to traditional fiat money by delivering benefits in speed, simplicity, and transparency. Grachev also described the GENIUS Act as potentially the first building block of a more unified digital financial system that is borderless, programmable, and efficient. He noticed that when the US moves on digital asset policy, the global market tends to follow. Co-sponsor of the bill, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, indicated that Memorial Day could be a realistic timeline for the bill’s passage. However, Grachev still warned that regulatory clarity alone will not be enough to trigger widespread institutional adoption. He specifically brought up the need for products that offer stable and predictable yield, and pointed to Falcon Finance’s development of a synthetic yield-bearing dollar product that is tailored for this purpose. On the other hand, not all voices in the industry are entirely satisfied with the bill. Vugar Usi Zade , COO of the Bitget exchange, pointed out that the GENIUS Act does very little to address the influence of offshore stablecoin issuers like Tether, which continue to dominate global liquidity markets. He warned that increased regulatory burdens could place US-based issuers at a disadvantage, and could potentially drive market consolidation and favor larger firms that can afford to meet compliance demands. Despite these criticisms, Zade conceded that the legislation could introduce greater stability to the US stablecoin market if its provisions are implemented effectively. Stablecoins Threaten Bank Monopoly Meanwhile, the rise of yield-bearing stablecoins is igniting tensions between traditional banks and the crypto industry, and critica are accusing the banking sector of lobbying to protect its monopoly on interest-bearing financial products. Austin Campbell , a professor at New York University and founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting, warned in a May 21 social media post that the powerful American banking lobby is ”panicking” over stablecoins' growing ability to disrupt conventional financial services—particularly those that offer yield. Campbell’s post was titled “The Empire Lobbies Back,” and it criticized the banking industry’s efforts to sway lawmakers into opposing interest-paying stablecoins. He mostly directed his comments at Democratic policymakers, and argued that banks are seeking protectionist policies under the guise of safeguarding consumers, while in reality trying to maintain their hold on a system that offers depositors minimal returns. He pointed out that fractional reserve banking allows banks to profit immensely while giving customers very little back, and stablecoins offering interest threaten this model. He also said that the claim stablecoin interest payments would ”harm” banks is little more than an appeal for cartel protection. Campbell urged lawmakers not to back any form of legislation that imposes a blanket ban on stablecoin yield, and warned that doing so would serve banks at the expense of everyday voters. He has been a longtime advocate for practical and transparent stablecoin regulation in the United States and previously warned a Congressional subcommittee in 2023 that failure to pass legislation will push innovation offshore. His comments were made as yield-bearing stablecoins are gaining more traction in the market. In February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first stablecoin security to offer yield, which was Figure Markets’ YLDS token, which pays 3.85% interest. Since then, other initiatives followed suit. Tether co-founder Reeve Collins introduced the Pi Protocol’s USP stablecoin, which is minted in exchange for an interest-bearing counterpart called USI. Meanwhile, Spark Protocol's USDS stablecoin distributes interest derived from decentralized lending and tokenized Treasury products. Industry voices argue that it is no longer acceptable for stablecoin holders not to receive at least the equivalent of the risk-free rate on their assets. Spark Protocol CEO Sam MacPherson explained to Bloomberg that fair yield is a necessary evolution in stablecoin utility. Growth of stablecoins (Source: S&P Global ) According to Coinbase Canada CEO Lucas Matheson , global stablecoin volumes now surpass those of traditional payment giant Visa by a factor of nearly three. For now, the fight over who controls access to interest-bearing products is escalating. Hong Kong Passes Stablecoin Bill Hong Kong officially passed its Stablecoin Bill, which is a major step toward establishing itself as a global hub for digital assets and Web3 development. The region’s Legislative Council approved the bill on its third reading. According to council member Johnny Ng Kit-Chong , the legislation sets the foundation for a regulated framework that will allow major institutions to apply for stablecoin issuer licenses with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority by the end of the year. The bill requires that all stablecoins be backed by fiat currency reserves for investor protection and to ensure the integrity of the digital asset ecosystem. In his announcement, Ng extended a welcoming message to global enterprises that are interested in issuing stablecoins in Hong Kong, and even offered personal assistance to facilitate introductions and strategic partnerships. Ng said that this legislative milestone is just the beginning of a broader push to develop real-world applications for Web3 technologies. He believes stablecoins will play a crucial role in modernizing payment systems, enabling more efficient cross-border transactions, and empowering peer-to-peer commerce. He also advocated for sharing interest earnings with stablecoin holders, and framed it as both an innovation and a tool to enhance financial market stability. With this bill, Hong Kong positions itself as a first mover in the Asia-Pacific region.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-22 05:46:08

The Theory Has Emerged,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/claims-deepen-in-this-huge-altcoin-did-the-founder-sell-a-large-amount-of-coins-the-theory-has-emerged/,"Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson has denied allegations that he embezzled more than $500 million worth of ADA from community funds, but the suspicions of investors and community members remain lingering. Hoskinson, who announced that his company Input Output Global (IOG) would be opened to full auditing after the scandal and handed over control of his social media accounts to independent researchers, continues to be the target of criticism despite this. While all eyes are still on the details of the so-called “redeem scandal” involving 318 million ADA, the audit process continues. In this atmosphere of uncertainty, a new theory has emerged on social media: the claim that Hoskinson indirectly made a fortune from unsold ADA. According to critics, although Hoskinson said he did not sell ADA directly, he may have transferred or directed the assets to asset managers, who in turn sold shares to individual investors through ADA-backed exchange-traded products (ETPs). Allegedly, Hoskinson may have received shares of these funds and then cashed out using capital channeled into ETPs by third-party investors. This method would allow him to claim he did not sell ADA directly, while potentially allowing him to profit indirectly. Related News: New Development in GENIUS Bill That Will Determine the Fate of Cryptocurrencies in the US Some ETP structures allow large investors to redeem their shares in exchange for cash, provided they pay certain transaction fees. This allegedly allowed Hoskinson to technically access cash in exchange for unsold ADAs. Some ETPs with 100% allocation to Cardano include 21Shares Cardano ETP, CoinShares Physical Staked Cardano, WisdomTree Physical Cardano, Bitwise Physical Cardano ETP, Wave ADA Yield Fund, and Valour Cardano ETP. Apart from that, there are also many public altcoin and cryptocurrency index funds that include ADA. However, there is no public information on whether Hoskinson or his affiliates provide ADA to these funds. Charles Hoskinson has often expressed his long-term commitment to ADA and its community. Hoskinson, who often refers to his background as one of the co-founders of Ethereum, has repeatedly said that he has no need to sell ADA. Hoskinson, who categorically denied the allegations, stated that he fully supported the process carried out by the independent auditing firm BDO and the law firm McDermott Will & Emery. IOG said in a statement that the allegations were “unfounded and malicious” and were the product of a “coordinated FUD campaign” designed around the ADA refund program for Japanese investors. *This is not investment advice.

BTC jumped as much as 2.2% before dropping slightly. This is mainly driven by progress on a stablecoin bill in the U.S. Senate that traders believe will bring more straightforward rules and reduce long-standing uncertainty in the crypto industry. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin gains strength as U.S. optimism and institutional demand grow Crypto investors are now more confident about how the U.S. government handles crypto regulation after lawmakers moved forward with a stablecoin bill (Genius Act). The bill creates clear rules for how stablecoins should work and who can issue them. Crypto supporters say the bill shows the U.S. is slowly opening the door to a legal framework that will let companies operate without constantly worrying about getting sued or shut down. If the bill becomes law, the firms will gain more trust from the public and investors. At the same time, Bitcoin prices keep rising because large companies continue to buy more with Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, purchased over $50 billion worth of Bitcoin to become the biggest Bitcoin-holding public company in the world. Saylor has built his entire business strategy around buying and holding as much of it as possible, as he believes Bitcoin is the strongest form of money, inspiring many small-cap companies and newly listed public firms to copy his approach and start putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets. These companies raise money by offering convertible bonds, selling preferred stock, and using SPACs or PIPE deals to buy Bitcoin. Twenty-One Capital Inc., a new firm backed by powerful financial players like Cantor Fitzgerald, stablecoin issuer Tether, and Japanese tech investment firm SoftBank, has also come into play with backers working together to build a company that holds Bitcoin as its main asset and mirrors Strategy’s model. Strive Enterprises Inc., co-founded by entrepreneur and political figure Vivek Ramaswamy, also has one of its subsidiaries merging with Nasdaq-listed Asset Entities Inc. Traders bet big on future highs as Bitcoin regains momentum On Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange, the highest number of open option contracts has gathered around strike prices of $110,000, $120,000, and even $300,000. These contracts are set to expire on June 27, which shows many traders believe Bitcoin will hit or get close to these levels in the near term. Global co-head of markets at crypto platform FalconX, Joshua Lim, explained that Bitcoin is rising slowly and steadily in what he called a “slow-motion grind” into new all-time highs. Much demand is coming from SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) and PIPE deals (private investments in public equity) as companies rush to raise funds quickly. Lim also said that one of the most popular crypto exchanges in the U.S., Coinbase, is showing a price premium on spot Bitcoin trades because people are willing to pay more to buy Bitcoin directly on Coinbase compared to other platforms when demand is much stronger than supply. Tony Sycamore from IG Markets explained that Bitcoin’s big drop from its January high of over $100,000 down to below $75,000 in April was a normal correction inside a larger uptrend. This kind of dip is common during long bull markets and helps reset the market before prices increase. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Jeremy Jordan-Jones was arrested and indicted on May 21 and charged with wire fraud, securities fraud, making false statements to a bank, and aggravated identity theft, the Department of Justice said on May 21. Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton claimed Jordan-Jones “touted his company as a groundbreaking blockchain startup,” but alleged that, in reality, the “company was a sham, and investors’ funds were siphoned off to bankroll his lavish lifestyle.” FBI Assistant Director Christopher Raia alleged that Jordan-Jones defrauded investors of more than 1 million dollars through “misrepresentations of his purported company's capabilities, partnerships, and investment intentions.” Raia claimed the Amalgam founder’s “blatant lies” funded his personal lifestyle at the expense of unknowing victims. An excerpt from the indictment of Jeremy Jordan-Jones. Source: US Department of Justice According to an indictment filed in a Manhattan federal court, from January 2021 to November 2022, Jordan-Jones deceived investors and financial institutions using fabricated documents, fake sports partnerships, and misleading claims, ultimately misappropriating over $1 million for personal use. Related: Ex-Cred execs plead guilty to wire fraud over $150M crypto collapse Amalgam claimed to offer point-of-sale systems and blockchain-based payment and security solutions, the filing states. The indictment alleged the firm had “no operable products, few, if any, customers, and zero legitimate business partnerships.” The filing alleged that instead of channeling the funds into tech development and crypto exchange listings as promised, Jordan-Jones spent the money on luxury vehicles, high-end vacations, clothing and fancy restaurants in Miami. Charges carry decades in prison Jordan-Jones was also accused of submitting a fake bank statement claiming Amalgam held over $18 million in order to secure a company credit card, but prosecutors claimed there were no funds in the bank account and it had been closed in late 2021. Wire fraud and security fraud carry potential penalties of up to 20 years in prison per count, while making false statements to a bank carries up to 30 years. Jordan-Jones was also charged with one count of aggravated identity theft , which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison. The government is seeking forfeiture of any property or money traceable to the fraud, including substitute assets if the original funds are unavailable.

Will DOGE Break $0.25 After Elon’s Latest Endorsement? Could The SEC’s 90% LTC ETF Approval Odds Push Prices Past $120? Why Are Investors Racing To Secure BitLemons Before Stage 4? The crypto market is showing impressive strength with DOGE surging 10% on renewed risk-on sentiment and LTC bouncing 7% on promising ETF developments. Meanwhile, BitLemons ($BLEM) continues to captivate investors with its revolutionary GambleFi protocol and deflationary tokenomics. With Stage 3 now 11.23% complete and Stage 4 on the horizon, this could be your last chance to enter before prices increase from $0.03 to $0.04. Is BitLemons ($BLEM) Positioned To Dominate The Trillion-Dollar Gambling Market? BitLemons ($BLEM) has emerged as the frontrunner in analysts’ top crypto picks for 2025, with its revolutionary approach to disrupting the $450 billion traditional casino industry. Early investors have already witnessed the project’s explosive potential, with the presale already raising an impressive $2,045,922.01 to date. With Stage 3 currently active at $0.03 per token and Stage 4 priced at $0.04 just around the corner, market sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish on this GambleFi powerhouse. What sets BitLemons apart is its robust revenue-sharing model and deflationary tokenomics. This Ethereum-based crypto-betting protocol allocates a substantial 30% of its Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) toward creating sustainable value – 15% for token buybacks and burns, reducing supply to drive prices upward, while the remaining 15% flows directly to $BLEM stakers as rewards. This ingenious strategy transforms $BLEM into a deflationary, passive income-generating asset with built-in upward price pressure. The project has achieved what many crypto projects only dream of – a fully functional platform generating real revenue 24/7 across 8,000+ games from premium providers like Evolution and Pragmatic. While other projects are still developing prototypes, BitLemons is already capturing market share in the massive online gambling sector. Security-conscious investors will appreciate BitLemons’ dual audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, providing a level of validation that competitors simply can’t match. With the current token price at $0.03 and a projected listing price of $0.17-$0.18, early investors stand to gain potentially 6x returns from the current stage price. The presale has already sold 3,670,604 BLEM tokens with 29,021,703 BLEM remaining in Stage 3, explaining why investors are rushing to secure their positions before the next price increase. Will DOGE Break $0.25 After Elon’s Latest Endorsement? The original meme coin shows no signs of slowing down as DOGE surged 10% to $0.226 over the past week. This impressive rally comes amid renewed “risk-on” sentiment in the broader crypto market, bolstered by positive developments in U.S.-China trade relations and growing optimism around crypto ETFs. The technical picture for DOGE looks increasingly bullish as trading volume has spiked 35% week-over-week. After establishing solid support near the $0.20 psychological level, DOGE is now testing critical resistance at $0.24. Analysts suggest that a decisive break above $0.25 could trigger a rapid ascent toward the $0.30 mark. However, failure to breach this level could result in consolidation within the current range. With Elon Musk’s continued endorsements fueling retail interest, DOGE remains a strong portfolio addition for 2025, though its potential returns pale in comparison to what $BLEM offers at this early stage. Could The SEC’s 90% LTC ETF Approval Odds Push Prices Past $120? Litecoin has captured significant attention after the SEC delayed Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin ETF decision on May 6th. Despite the delay, market sentiment remains overwhelmingly positive as industry analysts assigned a 90% probability to eventual approval, triggering LTC’s 7% climb toward the critical $100 threshold. On the charts, LTC has transformed the $95-$100 zone into a robust support level, with bulls defending this area vigorously during recent market fluctuations. Trading volume has increased by 28% as investors position themselves ahead of potential ETF approvals. The technical indicators suggest LTC is coiled for a substantial move, with the $105 resistance representing the final barrier before a potential rally to $120. While LTC presents attractive upside potential with its “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” narrative and renewed interest in fast, low-fee payment networks, early $BLEM investors stand to capture significantly greater returns in the same timeframe. Why Are Investors Racing To Secure BitLemons Before Stage 4? The clock is ticking for investors looking to capitalize on BitLemons’ incredible value proposition at current prices. With Stage 3 already 11.23% sold and the price set to increase from $0.03 to $0.04 in Stage 4, smart money is moving quickly to secure positions. How often does an opportunity arise to invest in a fully functional platform already generating revenue, backed by dual security audits, and offering a proven deflationary tokenomics model? BitLemons represents that rare convergence of timing and value that seasoned crypto investors recognize as potentially life-changing. Unlike speculative projects with nothing but promises, $BLEM offers a tangible product disrupting a massive global industry, with 30% of all gaming revenue flowing back to token holders through burns and staking rewards. The project’s momentum is undeniable – having already raised over $2 million with 3,670,604 BLEM tokens sold to date. With multiple payment options available, including direct crypto purchases and credit card payments, BitLemons has made it remarkably simple for investors of all backgrounds to participate in this groundbreaking opportunity before prices increase again.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such project—an unexpected contender that’s now drawing attention from seasoned XRP and ETH holders looking to diversify. With Polkadot (DOT) also gaining quiet traction, the landscape is shifting fast, and speculative capital is on the move. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE become the surprise breakout of the 2025 cycle? Many analysts now believe so—and early investors are positioning accordingly. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Altcoin Positioned for a 25x–35x Run MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most talked-about early entries of 2025. Fueled by a bold political identity, rising visibility, and a carefully crafted token structure, this project is striking a chord with both retail speculators and strategic traders. It offers a rare blend of cultural relevance and structural integrity—two traits that rarely align this early in a project’s life cycle. With a target listing price of $0.007 and current entry levels still deeply undervalued, analysts estimate a 25x upside in the months ahead. And with a promotional bonus still available through the PATRIOT35X code, some are projecting up to 35x returns through increased token allocations for early backers. Here’s why traders are increasingly betting on MAGACOIN FINANCE: It taps directly into the U.S. political narrative—perfectly timed for 2025 election-driven attention Its media presence is expanding across major platforms like Google News and MSN , increasing visibility The project is aggressively incentivizing early buyers through exclusive bonus offers, drawing in high-risk capital XRP: Institutional Use, But Limited Multiples Ahead XRP continues to deliver value as a payment-focused asset, supported by global settlement use and a strong institutional narrative. However, with prices hovering near $2.30 and short-term projections topping out around $5–$10, the upside is relatively capped. For long-term holders, it remains a core part of the portfolio—but for aggressive growth, many are reallocating toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum: Solid Infrastructure, Slower Growth Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady around $2,700 , buoyed by ETF optimism and Layer-2 expansion. While ETH remains the dominant Layer-1 for smart contracts, it’s less attractive to risk-on traders in search of outsized returns in the current market environment. That gap in potential is drawing capital toward emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin and Polkadot Stay Grounded Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating above $104,000 , acting as a macro anchor. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT) is gradually reawakening, with developers revisiting parachain projects and investors watching for renewed activity. Both remain solid foundations—but in terms of breakout narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is pacing ahead. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion The 2025 cycle may ultimately belong to the unexpected. While XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and Polkadot continue to play important roles, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s capturing real FOMO among high-risk portfolios. With Stage 8 nearly filled and listings on the horizon, MAGA could be the surprise altcoin that defines this cycle’s upside.

Hyperliquid Sees Record Trades Led by Bitcoin and a $1B Bet from Top Trader Hyperliquid’s trading volume reached $19.15b over the past 24 hours. BTC alone accounted for $11.5b of that, followed by ETH at $4.03b and SOL at $1.2b. Meme coins such as HYPE, kPEPE, and FARTCOIN also saw substantial activity, with HYPE crossing $454m in volume. One of the most notable developments was top trader James Wynn Real’s leveraged position on BTC, which became the first to exceed $1b on Hyperliquid. His position used 40x leverage and involved over 10,000 BTC. The entry price was $108,084, while the liquidation price was $103,640. As a result, the unrealized profit stood at $17.5m at the time of reporting.

Open interest in HYPE and SOL showed the fastest growth, up 18% and 82% respectively in 24 hours. The bullish sentiment is bolstered by legislative momentum in the US Senate, where the advancement of a stablecoin bill has rekindled hopes for clearer regulation.

Interestingly, as ETH climbs, tokens built on its platform often follow, and PEPE is no exception, thanks to its strong community support and steady price action. However, one new ETH token, Remittix (RTX) , is quietly stealing the show. It emerges with a focus on making online payments easy and reliable. Find out what is currently making these tokens key players to watch in the market. Ethereum Price Eyes Recovery As Whale Activity And ETF Inflows Rise Source: Glassnode Ethereum’s supply on major exchanges has dropped to a 10-year low as large investors buy and hold more ETH. Over 1 million ETH were removed from exchanges in just one month, indicating strong confidence in Ethereum’s future. Since late April, large holders have added over 450,000 ETH , reaching their highest ownership since March. Source: Ali Martinez on X Institutional interest is rising, with $30 million invested in the U.S. Ethereum ETFs last month and BlackRock managing over $2.9 billion in ETH assets. Recent upgrades, such as the Pectra Upgrade , have enhanced Ethereum’s network and boosted Layer-2 activity.

Dormant PEPEWhale Sparks Major Market Rally Source: X/LookOnChain A dormant PEPE whale re-emerged after two years, withdrawing over 2.2 trillion PEPE tokens worth approximately $29 million from Binance in two separate transactions within 24 hours. This large-scale withdrawal, moving roughly 2% of Binance’s PEPE reserves into self-custody wallets, signals a shift toward long-term accumulation and renewed confidence in the meme coin’s future. Source: Coinmarketcap Following the whale’s activity, PEPE’s price surged significantly, marking a 72% gain over the past month. PEPE price rally also boosted derivatives markets, with $2 million in short position liquidations and a 15% increase in futures open interest, which now exceeds $500 million. Remittix: Making Crypto Payments Actually Useful What sets Remittix apart isn’t flashy branding or speculative frenzy. It’s the fact that it works, and it solves a problem most crypto users have run into at least once: how to send money using crypto and have the other person receive actual fiat in a bank account. Remittix makes that possible in just a few clicks. Users connect their wallet, enter recipient details, and send crypto. Conversely, the recipient receives fiat directly into their bank account. There are no extra apps, no exchange logins, no blockchain learning curve, just results. This simplicity hides a powerful engine behind it. Remittix uses Ethereum’s smart contracts and local payment networks in over 100 countries to quickly convert crypto to fiat, often on the same day. It supports more than 30 local currencies and ensures no foreign exchange markups or hidden fees, so what you send is exactly what they receive. From freelancers invoicing across borders to businesses settling payments in real time, Remittix opens up various possibilities. It’s a DeFi solution built with TradFi usability, bridging two worlds that usually struggle to communicate. Remittix Presale Momentum Builds With Over 537 Million Tokens With the current price set at $0.0781, RTX has already seen a whopping $15.2 million raise in presale. The next phase will push the price to $0.0811, offering a final opportunity for investors to lock in at a competitive rate before broader market exposure. Adding to the excitement, the token’s limited supply of 1.5 billion ensures scarcity, further driving potential value. Participants also have the chance to enter a $250,000 giveaway, with 10 winners sharing the prize. So, don’t wait on the sidelines. Join the new PayFi revolution with Remittix’s presale.

With XRP now priced at $2.33 after a meteoric 500% uptick late last year, analysts are setting even more bullish XRP price predictions with targets set at $20 per XRP. Stellar’s XLM is also making a huge comeback, as seen by its 165% uptick in the last year. Both XLM and XRP price predictions are bullish. However, for those looking to ride the PayFi wave, no other token offers a better chance for a 100x gain than Remittix . This emerging PayFi protocol has seen its presale raise over $15.2 million in a brief spell and analysts say it could rally 3,000% on launch. Bullish XRP price predictions resurface while institutional FOMO sets in XRP will now be incorporated into UAE banks thanks to a partnership between Ripple and the UAE’s Zand and Mamo bank. In addition to increased efficiency through XRP’s cross-border payment network, Ripple’s partnership with UAE banks will also reduce fees and shorten transaction settlement periods. There’s more: XRP’s institutional adoption is taking off as seen by Dubai’s move to adopt XRP’s ledger for the tokenization of its real estate market. Also, with the easing of US regulatory standards, XRP price prediction forecasts a brighter future for XRP and its legal battle with the SEC. Increased demand for XRP internationally and among institutions in the US could lead to increased buying pressure that could see XRP reach new highs. Image Source: Coingecko On the charts, XRP is setting up for a bullish resurgence above $3.0. In the last month, XRP’s price has surged 13.7%, but its year-to-date uptick is over 350%. With XRP’s increasing institutional appeal, a bullish XRP price prediction could materialize. Stellar XLM sets up a bullish Gartley pattern with a price set to reach $0.90 The PayFi sector is growing and institutional adoption is not just focused on XRP price predictions but also on XLM’s progress. With a reputation for running on one of the most interoperable blockchains, XLM’s chart has set up a Gartley pattern with Fibonacci support showing imminent bullish potential. Image Source: CoinMarketCap From its current price of $0.28, analysts are forecasting a potential upward move that could see XLM break the $0.50 resistance zone and settle at the $0.65 to $0.75 range. XLM’s price is gaining bullish momentum as seen by its year-to-date uptick of over 165%, adding to a monthly price increase of 16.9%. While XLM still faces short-term risk if it fails to hold the $0.27 support level, its upward potential in the long run is inevitable. Remittix’s RTX presale shakes up the PayFi space Remittix’s RTX is the new kid on the PayFi block. Remittix plans to reinvent cross-border payments in a way that rivals what XRP and XLM have done in the past. Remittix has gained the attention of investors who have raised over $15.2 million in its ongoing presale. RTX is now priced at $0.0781 and the next stage of the presale will see the price increase to $0.0811. Analysts are forecasting a potential 3,000% uptick that would turn a modest $1000 investment into millions. At its core, Remitix is a revolutionary PayFi protocol that prioritizes simplicity and affordability. Crypto holders can use Remittix to send funds to a recipient’s bank account across more than 30 fiat currencies. There is also a PAY API that businesses can use to accept crypto payments from their customers. All transactions come at a flat fee and there are zero hidden costs. With a focus on serving everyone, no matter their location and economic standing, Remittix is gearing up for mass adoption. Could RTX lead the future of remittances?

Cointelegraph shared the exciting news on X. This initiative aims to facilitate the integration of traditional financial instruments, such as stocks and bonds, onto blockchain platforms, potentially unlocking a market valued at approximately $30 trillion. Following this announcement, Sistine Research drew attention to Robinhood’s acquisition of Bitstamp , which is building a perpetual Decentralized Exchange (perp DEX) on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), exciting the XRP army as the digital asset and its network are prime candidates for RWA tokenization. Robinhood is also acquiring Bitstamp which is building a perp dex on XRP Ledger. https://t.co/Q0rYwm6c7R — Sistine Research (@sistineresearch) May 20, 2025 Robinhood’s Major Moves in the Crypto Space Last year, Robinhood acquired Bitstamp for approximately $200 million, and the company recently commended Ripple’s success in tokenization on the XRPL . Its acquisition of Bitstamp is more noteworthy as the perp DEX on the XRPL could start a broader range of tokenization services on the ledger. Bitstamp holds over 50 active licenses and registrations worldwide, providing Robinhood with an immediate expansion into global markets. In early 2024, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev emphasized that the absence of clear regulations in the U.S. hampers innovation and could result in the country lagging behind other global financial markets in adopting tokenized securities. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This proposal aims to fix that problem, offering a framework for regulating RWAs. A regulated environment for these products would ensure investor protection while facilitating broader market participation. This is a critical step toward bridging traditional finance with emerging blockchain infrastructure. Tokenization on the XRP Ledger Tokenization involves creating digital representations of RWAs on a blockchain, enabling improved liquidity, faster settlement times, and fractional ownership. Robinhood’s initiative formalizes how blockchain technology can serve established financial systems. Tokenization has numerous benefits for XRP and the broader ecosystem. By enabling the representation of RWAs on-chain, tokenization can increase utility and demand for XRP as a bridge currency in transactions. It enhances liquidity, reduces settlement times, and lowers costs. Dubai Land Department recently launched tokenized land deeds on XRPL . With Robinhood leading the charge for regulated RWA tokenization, XRP will get the chance to fulfill its goal of dominating the tokenization market and integrating into traditional financial circles.

Frog memecoins are established within the decentralised space and have been consistently set in motion by high profile references to the Pepe meme. These mentions have been made by the likes of Elon Musk and even Donald Trump. Frogger is setting the trend and aligning itself in a similar manner which led these memecoins to billions in market cap. A key differentiator for Frogger is its broad token distribution—less than 55% is held by the top 100 holders, with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as the largest holder. This distribution resembles other memecoins such as $DOGE $PEPE and $SHIBA before they went parabolic. Recognition and Growing Credibility Frogger has already captured attention and recognition amongst multiple social media influencers and content creators. This was expected as Frogger has History, Culture and Relevance. The 1981 arcade Frogger game was one of the most popular and most sold out during the Arcade Era grossing $135million in North America for Sega/Gremlin becoming their most successful release. Additionally Vitalik Buterin is the top holder having acquired Frogger organically. What’s more is the Pepe Deployer is also one of the top 100 holders garnering watchful eyes within domain. Frogger isn’t just riding a wave—it is the wave. With deep roots in internet lore, cultural cachet from day one, this isn’t another memecoin—it’s a movement. Tokenomics Frogger’s decentralized ethos and simple tokenomics mirror those of other major memecoins like $SHIBA, $PEPE, $DOGE, $WIF, and $FLOKI. A rapidly growing community, zero tax and a burnt liquidity pool. Thanks to its minimalist contract design, transactions are seamless and scalability is built-in, ensuring new holders can join easily—crucial in the swift-moving meme coin market. Will Frogger be the next Frog meme to hit BILLIONS in market cap? Historically, frog memes have proven to be some of the most powerful and enduring symbols in the meme coin world. Take $Pepe, for example — it dominated the last cycle, soaring to a fully diluted valuation exceeding $12 billion. This undeniable success highlights one clear truth: frog-themed tokens have a unique ability to capture the hearts of retail investors. So, the question is — could Frogger be the defining frog meme of this cycle? With its community-driven story and a rapidly growing base of over 2,000 holders, Frogger is poised to be far more than just another meme coin. It represents an evolving narrative that every participant can shape, potentially leading the next wave of meme coin culture. Get Involved with Frogger Frogger offers something new in the Memecoin space. An evolving frog-themed cryptocurrency attracting new investors and arcade game lovers from the 80s and 90s.

The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) will serve as a regulatory body to oversee licensing, regulate exchanges , custodians, wallets, tokenized platforms, stablecoins and decentralized finance applications, according to a May 21 report from the state-owned broadcaster, PTV. Muhammad Aurangzeb, federal minister for finance and revenue, told the broadcaster, “Pakistan must regulate not just to catch up, but to lead” in the industry. “With the PDAA, we are creating a future-ready framework that protects consumers, invites global investment, and puts Pakistan at the forefront of financial innovation,” he said.

The new regulatory body was part of a recommendation from the Pak­istan advisory body, the Cryptocurrency Cou­ncil, which was launched on March 14 and has former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao as an adviser . “This is not just about crypto — it’s about rewriting our financial future, expanding access, and creating new export channels through tokenization, digital finance and Web3 innovation,” said Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of Pakistan's Crypto Council. Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency previously proposed a regulatory framework for digital assets designed to address terrorism financing, money laundering provisions, and Know Your Customer concerns, according to am April 10 report from local newspaper, The Express Tribune. Pakistan crypto market rises despite early skepticism In May 2023, former Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Aisha Ghaus Pasha said that Pakistan would never legalize cryptocurrencies due to the potential for digital assets to circumvent regulations created by the Financial Action Task Force, the supranational organization that polices finance for money laundering.

XRP is not left out, especially after a major update on the XRP ETF, the U.S. Senate’s surprising approval of a stablecoin regulation bill, and the rise of a game-changing player in crypto-to-fiat payments—Remittix. While the XRP news continues to spark investor excitement, many eyes are now on the practical side of crypto adoption. Since linking digital money and traditional banks is so important today, Remittix is taking the lead by redesigning how payments are made between countries. Let’s learn more about Remittix and the recent XRP news. XRP news: XRP’s ETF delays, Stablecoin expansion, and Ripple–Circle rumors fuel market buzz The crypto world is buzzing after the U.S. SEC again delayed its decision on a spot XRP ETF. Analyst James Seyffart noted that while key deadlines loom, no action is expected until late June or possibly year-end. Despite the ETF delays, there’s some positive news for the XRP ecosystem. The Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin, XSGD, has officially launched on the XRP Ledger. Developed by StraitsX and supported by major banks DBS and Standard Chartered, XSGD offers faster, more secure, and lower-cost digital transactions. Meanwhile, a new rumor is swirling: Ripple may have secretly acquired Circle, the company behind USDC, the second-largest stablecoin. Source: Coinmarketcap While unconfirmed, the speculation has stirred excitement in the XRP community. Ripple recently launched its stablecoin (RLUSD), but acquiring USDC would instantly boost its position in the stablecoin market. XRP is currently up 10% this month. Remittix Simplifies Asset Transfer—Presale Raise Surpasses $15M Imagine being able to send crypto like USDT or ETH and having it instantly arrive as dollars, euros, or naira in a local bank account—no conversion fees, no delays, and no technical fuss. That’s precisely what Remittix does. Unlike traditional remittance systems that involve third-party banks, wire fees, or clunky wait times, Remittix lets users connect their wallets and instantly send funds that land in over 30 fiat currencies. This isn’t just theory. Remittix is making it a tangible reality! Instead of waiting endlessly for a money transfer and getting ripped off by the usual exorbitant transfer fees, anyone can use Remittix’s PayFi solution to facilitate instant money transfers globally with no surprise deductions. Security and transparency are integral to Remittix. Every transaction is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, and Remittix smart contracts have undergone audits to ensure safety. The user interface mimics familiar banking apps, making it easy even for non-tech-savvy users. The recipient never has to know the payment started as crypto; they just receive their money as a standard bank deposit. Many industry experts believe that this smooth crypto-to-fiat layer will finally push mainstream adoption.

The Bitcoin price has now surged and marked new highs a few moments ago. This move seems to have flipped the market trajectory, as the altcoins like Solana are close to validating a bullish breakout. The SOL price seems to be at the foothill of a massive explosion, and hence, a rise above $220 seems to be imminent. The crypto markets have turned bullish as Bitcoin smashed a new ATH close to $112K. Despite the rise, the bearish activity is restrictive, suggesting more upside potential for the token. As a result, the top 10 cryptos, including Solana, are believed to remain elevated, while the pace of the rally may fade to some extent. Currently, the SOL price is working hard to validate a rebound from the crucial support. A successful rise could elevate the levels by nearly 8%; however, a final correction could be in place before rising above $200. As seen in the above chart, the Solana price is trading close to the apex of the rising wedge. The price triggers a rebound from the support and seems to be advancing towards the resistance close to $195. The CMF has been rising since the start of the month, while the MACD is about to undergo a bullish crossover, being within the positive range. Hence, the price could be poised to maintain a healthy upswing ahead. Meanwhile, after a breakout from the rising wedge, the token may face a correction that could drag the levels back to $180 or slightly lower. After squeezing out all the selling pressure, the bulls are believed to take over the rally and push the levels back above $200 in a short time. However, the Solana (SOL) price may face some bearish action at these levels, but the bulls could have held a tight grip over the rally, which may keep up the bullish momentum over the rally and test the higher targets at $220 initially and later at $250.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 06:16:16

According to Mister Crypto, daily gains of up to 40% may soon become the norm. Three of the top altcoins investors can buy in anticipation of gains like these are Ethereum (ETH), Unilabs (UNI), and Cardano (ADA). Let’s see how high these altcoins are set to go in the coming altseason. Ethereum (ETH) Could Peak At $10-20K This Year Since the Pectra upgrade launched, Ethereum has been one of the most bullish coins in the market. Starting the month as low as $1,750, the Ethereum price soared to a monthly high of $2,700. While it faced a rejection at this level, there are hints that the ETH altcoin price could be ready for a massive pump. Crypto_Goos has spotted a golden cross on the 12H Ethereum price chart. This bullish pattern often happens just before a massive Ethereum price pump. A repeat of the golden cross pattern could see Ethereum set a new ATH above $5,000. Another crypto commentator, Friedrich, has set his price target as high as $10k for Ethereum. The prediction from the popular crypto signal channel, Crypto GEMs is more bullish. According to Crypto GEMs, ETH is behaving like it did in the 2016-2017 bull cycle. With the same bullish breakout expected, they predict that the Ethereum price could soar above $20k, possibly reaching $35k this year. Whales Jump on Unilabs (UNIL) For Next Level Profitability Unilabs (UNIL) has emerged among the top crypto coins receiving massive whale interest ahead of the altseason. Unilabs launched to huge early interest from investors because of its unique positioning as the world’s first AI-backed DeFi asset manager. Unilabs uses advanced AI technology to review the crypto market and discover the best crypto investment selections. People who invest in Unilabs can join one of four funds, the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and the Mining Fund. AI insights are used at Unilabs to control every fund to maximize their profitability. Unilabs also automatically rebalances the portfolios of its investors to make the most profit from different assets. So, investors on every level can begin earning money without effort. While just beginning its crypto ICO phase, Unilabs already manages over $30 million in AUM for investors. The high number of happy clients suggests Unilabs has the potential to play a leading role in the crypto investment market. Another reason why UNIL has been in great demand is because of its high APY, up to 122%. Over 163 million $UNIL has been sold, helping Unilabs raise over $750k in presale. While $UNIL is still priced at $0.0051, experts believe it could crack the top 50 cryptos as more investors register on Unilabs. Cardano (ADA) Set for Massive Pump Ahead of Upgrade Just like Ethereum, Cardano (ADA) is anticipating a major blockchain upgrade. Charles Hoskinson recently said that Cardano’s Leios upgrade could potentially reach 11,000 TPS, outperforming Solana. With this excitement, experts believe the Cardano price could experience a massive pump could happen soon. JRNYTV predicts that the Cardano update will propel the $ADA price to a new all-time high of $10 in 2025. TapTools also posted an update implying that the Cardano coin could experience a major pump soon. According to TapTools, over $932 million in Cardano has been removed from controlled exchanges (CEXs) since the beginning of 2025. They announced that the last time we saw ADA outflows of this level was in 2021. Similarly, in 2021, Cardano was one of the top altcoins to buy, as it pumped to its current ATH of $3.10. If the trend repeats, Sssebi believes ADA could easily pump by 10-20x. The Best Crypto To Buy As the altseason nears, investors seeking big returns are jumping on Ethereum and Cardano. This is understandable as they are among the top 10 altcoins. However, $UNIL looks set to deliver the biggest gains. Because Unilabs generates massive profits for its investors, it could potentially secure up to 0.1% of traditional investors, giving $UNIL massive upside potential.

Microsoft said in a May 21 blog post that a federal court in Georgia allowed the firm’s digital crimes unit to take down, block or suspend nearly 2,300 websites critical to Lumma’s operations, and it has collaborated with local and international law enforcement agencies to dismantle the project’s infrastructure. The company said the US Department of Justice seized Lumma’s central command structure and disrupted marketplaces where the tool was sold to other cybercriminals. Microsoft says that Lumma has been sold via underground forums since 2022 and that it has undergone multiple upgrades since its launch. Domains seized by Microsoft. Source: Microsoft Blog Europol’s European Cybercrime Center and Japan’s Cybercrime Control Center also facilitated the suspension of locally based Lumma infrastructure. Lumma is a malware tool that allows malicious actors to steal everything from passwords, credit card information, bank account details, and crypto wallet information. Between March 16 and May 16, Microsoft said it identified over 394,000 Windows computers infected by the Lumma malware and worked with law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity firms to sever communications between the tool and the infected devices. Malicious activity on the rise Crypto drainers are software designed to steal the contents of crypto wallets and are common on phishing sites, malicious extensions, fake airdrops and more. Earlier this week, Chinese printer manufacturer Procolored had reportedly distributed Bitcoin-stealing malware alongside its official drivers, resulting in the loss of around $953,000 worth of crypto. Related: Beware of ‘cracked’ TradingView — it’s a crypto-stealing trojan Last month, an AMLBot report said that crypto drainers are now being sold as a SaaS product, allowing unsophisticated bad actors to rent the service for as little as $100. A Feb. 7 report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said that almost $51 billion worth of crypto was lost in 2024 due to fraudulent activity and that professional crime networks, fraud cartels, nation-state-sponsored hackers and AI-powered scams have taken center stage. The FBI’s cyber arm reported that Americans lost around $9.3 billion in 2024 through crypto scams and frauds. The most vulnerable age group was above the age of 60. Meanwhile, North Korean hackers have stolen nearly $3 billion worth of cryptocurrencies between 2017 and 2023, which crypto firm Paradigm said have become more sophisticated over the years.

The milestone follows a brief dip to $106,000 and shows growing investor appetite for alternative assets amid rising macroeconomic uncertainty. The immediate catalyst appears to be the weak demand in the U.S. Treasury’s $16 billion 20-year bond auction on May 21. Investors pushed for lower prices, which in turn drove bond yields above 5.1%. In bond markets, yields and prices move inversely, meaning that when demand falls, prices drop and yields rise. Bonds are usually more appealing when yields are higher, but when yields rise too quickly because of poor demand, it may be an indication that people are losing faith in government debt. The ripple effect extended across other maturities, with the 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields climbing to 4.58% and 5.08%, respectively. Additionally, Japan’s 30-year yield jumped to a record 3.19%. Given that long-term government debt is typically seen as a safe haven in the global bond market, these moves point to a wider sense of unease.

Trenchev cited soft U.S. inflation data, a U.S.-China trade de-escalation, and Moody’s downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. “It’s possible a three-month window has opened for risk assets to thrive,” he added. On-chain data supports this rotation. Bitcoin’s realized market cap has crossed $912 billion, marking a $27 billion capital inflow since early May. Exchange inflows have dropped 82% since November, according to CryptoQuant, suggesting fewer holders are selling. Meanwhile, Tether ( USDT ) balances on exchanges, seen as a proxy for crypto buying power, have hit a record $46.9 billion. Bitcoin just hit a new all-time high.

In a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Ohio-based Strive says it is joining hands with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to secure Bitcoin holdings at a discount price. The plan is to go after BTC claims that have already received definitive legal judgments but are still awaiting distribution. Strive is interested in the Bitcoin claims related to Mt. Gox. The now bankrupt crypto exchange operated between 2010 and 2014 and oversaw more than 70% of Bitcoin transactions at its peak. The Tokyo-based firm collapsed following a security breach that led to the theft of 750,000 BTC. The 75,000 BTC claims from the Mt. Gox estate are currently worth over $8.2 billion based on the flagship crypto asset’s price of $109,963. “This strategy is intended to allow Strive the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin exposure at a discount to market price, enhancing Bitcoin per share and supporting its goal of outperforming Bitcoin over the long run.” Strive submits the disclosure as it plans to team up with the social media marketing firm Asset Entities to form the first publicly traded asset management Bitcoin treasury company.

44942568,https://nulltx.com/?p=149831,1747897473,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Tron Surpasses $75B in USDT Supply as Network Solidifies Its Role in Global Settlement,https://nulltx.com/tron-surpasses-75b-in-usdt-supply-as-network-solidifies-its-role-in-global-settlement/,"Tron has become a powerhouse in the stablecoin ecosystem. The total supply of Tether (USDT) on the network hit a significant milestone last week, surpassing $75 billion. That figure represents over half of the total supply of USDT across all blockchains (most of which is on Ethereum), and signals not just explosive growth since the start of 2025, but also a shift in how and where stablecoins are being used. The upsurge in USDT supply is only one facet of this complex tale. Tron has emerged as a favored infrastructure layer for a range of applications. These include cross-border payments, retail transfers, and exchange settlements. This places Tron in the center of a burgeoning financial services ecosystem. Its rapid growth positions it as a key player, if not the key player, for the aforementioned applications. Tron Becomes the Leading Chain for USDT Activity Although Ethereum is still a key space for DeFi and high-end, institutional applications, Tron has established itself as the go-to place for some very specific decentralized finance activities—and the only place for some of this activity. It has become the dominant chain for Tether activity. More than half of the USDT circulating in the world today is on Tron, and it might as well be a kind of central bank for stablecoin liquidity. Even more remarkable is how big the scale of this activity is. Last week, the on-chain volume for USDT on Tron hit an all-time high of $166.5 billion — the highest weekly volume the network has ever seen. And this uptick in USD(T) not only translates into a lot more tokens floating around, but also seems to indicate a fair amount of actual usage, with all kinds of money-moving happening from Tron’s user base. Tron has been integrated into almost all of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, and has very low transaction fees. Because of these two reasons, Tron’s blockchain has become a great layer for moving funds around swiftly and at a very low cost, especially when you compare it to Ethereum, which has a layer that’s far from speedy, and whose transaction fees (known as “gas” fees) tend to spike during times when the network is congested. Retail Usage Dominates by Count, But Volume Comes from Big Players The other thing that makes the Tron network so dominant is that it has the most user activity of all the networks. It hosts about 75% of all USDT addresses. And those addresses, on average, do about 2.15 million transfers a day. On average. The vast majority of those transfers are between $10 and $10,000. So these are not big transfers. For everyday users, the utility of stablecoins is growing, as seen in the current explosion of small transfers. This trend seems most pronounced in regions where limited access to traditional banking and volatile fiat currencies push people toward more reliable financial instruments. In such places, USDT on Tron seems a go-to option for a simple, stable way to store value, make payments, and access the global economy. The USDT supply on @trondao surpassed $75 billion last week, following explosive growth since the start of the year. Let's dive into Tron's stablecoin success pic.twitter.com/TbHBgN3RpS — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 20, 2025 However, even though retail is very active in terms of the sheer number of transactions, it is still large-scale movement of funds that drives the major share of retail’s outsize appearance in the flat little pie charts that crypto exchanges like to publish. Approximately 71% of all USDT volume on Tron comes not from people buying and selling, but from transfers of a better-than-average-size using the network for settlements and managing treasury functions. This two-fold structure — a large number of small transfers counterbalanced by a handful of large ones — demonstrates that Tron is becoming ever more vital as both a means for retail transactions and a vehicle for settling wholesale accounts. Illicit Use Declines as Legitimate Activity Surges One area where Tron has made remarkable strides is in mitigating the obscene behavior associated with transfers of stablecoins. In 2023, the network drew the ire of many in the crypto world for being the home of a huge volume of dubious transactions. But by April 2024, when we crunched the numbers, they showed that the share of these kinds of transactions had dropped by nearly half, suggesting that the network is being used in a more legitimate way and is maturing, in the regulatory sandbox sense. This decrease occurs as the crypto sector makes a concerted effort to clean up on-chain finance. By using on-chain finance, a person should comply with global regulations. The current effort by the crypto sector makes a clear case for the sustainable and transparent ecosystems that should accommodate the building blocks of on-chain finance. If on-chain usage continues to attract business flows in a legitimate way, then the on-chain finance that it uses has the potential to be a strong signal for all who are likely to build on-chain finance next. Conclusion The stablecoin economy is now receiving a huge boost from the blockchain network Tron. It had no share, as all, of USDT (the Tether stablecoin) in 2019. Now, Tron has the majority share of USDT in 2025, making it the network that serves the greatest number of USDT users globally. Alongside this, Tron serves over two million users a day who rely on its various smart contracts to complete their business transactions — making Tron into something not at all unlike the traditional global payments network, Visa. The network is developing rapidly under an ever-watchful eye of regulators, and it remains to be seen whether Tron can keep the system compliant while also yielding the efficiencies of a finance protocol working in the real world. For now, though, Tron’s success with a stablecoin seems like a step toward making its network more suitable for all kinds of crypto activities, from trading to lending.

This incident underscores the growing risks of social engineering attacks in the crypto sector and highlights the urgent need for tighter operational security at major exchanges. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With Bitcoin having recently broken the $107,000 mark for the first time since January, much excitement has spilled over into discussions around several other big-name tokens. Attention has been focused once more on Bitcoin and on its fundamental role as a hedge against inflation and as a long-term store of value. Yet at the present moment, a rather mixed bag of assets—DeFi tokens, politically linked assets, stablecoins—are generating their own waves of conversation and speculation, not all of which is entirely sane. Bitcoin Eyes New All-Time High, Social Buzz Follows Bitcoin is still the leading topic in the cryptocurrency discussion as it nears what could be a new all-time high. After breaking through the $107,000 level, the number one cryptocurrency seems to have a renewed engagement on social media. The dialogue appears to have shifted back to some of its long-standing talking points, and they are as follows: 1. Long-term investment case (still valid, still holding strong, still a conversation point). 2. Ability to withstand macroeconomic shifts (Bitcoin “isolationism”). 3. Safety and soundness: decentralized, not controlled by anyone, and no one can mess with it. Renewed momentum has long-term holders celebrating, while new entrants wonder if they have missed the boat or if this is still a very early stage. Analysts are watching the institutional inflows closely and, in the context of inflation and global economic uncertainty, are drawing Bitcoin’s newfound status as a modern digital reserve asset into the appeal conversation. Altcoins in the Spotlight: From Politics to DeFi Innovation Bitcoin may yet lead the way in value, but a range of altcoins commands attention for reasons that go beyond price action. Among the most talked-about is TRUMP ($TRUMP), a politically charged token that keeps the waters stirred. Recently, a surge of media coverage and online chatter spilling over from discussions about Donald Trump, both in his capacity as former U.S. president and as a current player in global politics, has lent the coin an ever-increasing visibility. In the decentralized finance space, Aave ($AAVE) is making all the right headlines. The on-chain lending platform has posted stellar performance numbers—its Total Value Locked (TVL), by various estimates, is now somewhere between 25 and 40.7 billion dollars (for contrast, Aave’s all-time low TVL, in October 2022, was 6.7 billion). Its actual $AAVE token price has increased this past week between 15% and 25%, and the trading volumes have been very healthy—up between 35% and 50% (depending on the source) over this past week—across the three major exchanges. Overall, Aave provides a clear compliance pathway for regulatory acts like the GENIUS Act. As Bitcoin has climbed above $107K for the first time since January, teasing a new all-time high, these are the coins seeing the top rises in talks across social media: Bitcoin $BTC : Crypto's #1 coin breached $107K, closing in on a new ATH. Chats include long-term… pic.twitter.com/DeoHORxZaL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 20, 2025 Ankr ($ANKR), meanwhile, sits at a crossroads. Community sentiment has split, with some users expressing frustration over perceived delays and poor communication from the team. Criticism focuses on what some see as stagnation and unmet expectations. But others point to ongoing development, like integration with Neura and enhancements to token utility. They’re call for transparency and community engagement. Leader’s gonna lead. Stablecoins and XRP: Financial Infrastructure Under the Microscope The stablecoin sector is also creating a stimulating social media discourse, with USD Coin ($USDC) at the center of all the speculation. As a cornerstone of digital finance, USDC’s role is being analyzed and reanalyzed as the same old, same old conversation around USDC’s purported liquidity starts to bubble up again. Why? Because once again, people are asking whether USDC might be sort of kinda close to maybe, possibly, a stablecoin under threat from the same forces that seem to be threatening a lot of crypto: regulation and litigation. Now, XRP is becoming all the more relevant, and not by coincidence. The various converging factors influencing some recent price momentum make an up-to-the-minute look at XRP quite interesting. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity service, which uses XRP as a bridge currency, is now operational in 24 countries. The service, underscoring XRP’s cross-border utility, attracts very little of the front-line attention that is quickly funneled to Ripple’s many efforts to scale this product. Introducing XSGD, a Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin deployed on the XRP Ledger, and Ripple’s push into global payments and finance have made XRP a key player in the crypto infrastructure. The ongoing competition between Ripple and Coinbase in places like the institutional finance adds to the intrigue. Conclusion With Bitcoin almost touching its all-time high, the larger crypto universe is abuzz with talk, speculation, and even some intrigue. From DeFi breakthroughs and regulatory optimism to political narratives and stablecoin skirmishes, the market’s complexity is on full display. And all these stories, increasingly, seem to point in the same direction: That crypto, once a fringe movement, is quickly becoming a central force in the future of finance, and by some accounts, the future of politics and global technology.

44942709,https://nulltx.com/?p=149829,1747897737,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,AI Agent Market Surges to $10.87B as Virtuals Ecosystem Expands Despite Price Dip,https://nulltx.com/ai-agent-market-surges-to-10-87b-as-virtuals-ecosystem-expands-despite-price-dip/,"The AI agent sector keeps growing at a dramatic pace. The sector’s total market capitalization has climbed nearly 3% in the last 24 hours, reaching $10.87 billion as of May 21st, 2025. The latest growth spurt detailed in that day’s Virtuals Daily Update shows a renewed wave of inflows into the sector and highlights a pretty sizable bump in mindshare — one of the AI agent industry’s long-favored key performance indicators. The compound ecosystem, one of the most closely watched projects in the space, had a mixed week. Even though the price of its native token, $VIRTUAL, slid a little over 3%, other indicators pointed to an almost alarming surge in the ecosystem’s attention and relevance to both the crypto and wider AI agent landscapes. With a modest gain in market cap for the DeFi products within the ecosystem and what can only be described as a week where Virtuals shot up in everyone’s mind (no doubt thanks to that ‘next-gen’ appearance at these events), the project seems to be positioning itself for some degree of long-term influence. Mindshare Reaches Record Highs as Sector Accelerates The latest data yield an impressive highlight: agent mindshare reached an unprecedented 43.33% high for the first quarter of 2023, with gauge 43.33% high for the first quarter of 2023. Mindshare gauges how much attention, interaction, and activity AI agents are commanding across digital environments—and it is quickly becoming the new benchmark for evaluating protocol influence. This jump indicates growing agent engagement and utility, but perhaps more importantly, it underscores how entrenched these systems are becoming in digital businesses and consumer applications. AI agents’ total market capitalization increased 2.98% over the last 24 hours, not just showing interest from speculators but also signaling some increasingly substantive investments. The Virtuals ecosystem itself, now valued at $2.39 billion, posted a 0.53% gain over the same period. While just a modest increase, if you will, this gain puts it among the broader top contributors to the sector’s growth and solidifies its role as a critical part of the AI agent economy. The more general lesson is that while the prices of individual tokens may bounce around, fundamental parameters like market capitalization and the amount of attention being paid to the space—mindshare, in the old marketing term—are moving in a clearly positive direction. Virtuals Sees Short-Term Price Pressure, Long-Term Ecosystem Strength Even though the sector is on the upswing, the $VIRTUAL token is facing some challenges in the market. For the last 24 hours, it has dipped by 3.11% to its current price of $1.9275. Market analysts see this price dip as a result of some short-term profit-taking and a bit of the volatility that is currently buffeting the broader crypto market. They do not see it as any sort of fundamental weakness in the Virtuals platform itself. Actually, the ecosystem-level metrics for Virtual tell a much more positive story. The platform’s mindshare increased by a robust 8.26%. This fair value estimate pushed its total share of attention in the AI agent sector to 21.25%. Meanwhile, over the weekend, the Discord team reported a remarkable 1,200 new members in just two days. The last time we checked, there were approximately 14,000 members in the Virtual Discord server. Virtuals Daily Update | May 21st 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/MpYha0mWFW — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 21, 2025 The gap between token value and ecosystem performance is typical of emerging tech, and Virtuals is handling that by the book. It today has a user and developer count that is both meaningful and rapidly growing—an absolute necessity if Virtuals is to be any sort of long-term player in this AI agent economy that is maturing so quickly. Small-Cap Breakout Leaders: SANTA, STATE, and HANA Stand Out While the expanded ecosystem demonstrates resilience and forward movement, a few smaller-cap gaining projects are turning heads with their stunning weekly growth. At the top of the list is SANTA (@santavirtuals), which saw a not-to-be-missed 140.5% increase in its market cap over the past seven days. That move makes it a breakout project, and it’s attracting a lot of eyeballs from both investors and analysts. STATE (@State_Of_Mika) and SQDGN (@helloSQDGN) are making significant strides, with growth rates of 42.97% and 36.87%, respectively. These niche projects, focused on unique applications of AI agents, seem to be much more tightly targeted than the average crypto project. Indeed, they are in the midst of some serious momentum right now. The top five are rounded out by RWAI (@RWAIAgent) and HANA (@HanaPersona_), who post 28.41% and 27.62% gains, respectively. HANA’s rise, in particular, reflects and is creating an area of significant interest in the coming months: personalized AI personas. Gains of these tokens underscore a repeated theme in emerging technology markets: small-cap projects tend to be the early movers in adoption, and they tend to be the ones that perform fastest and the ones that perform best during that early adoption period. Of course, there’s a reason for that: these small-cap tokens offer access to nascent projects that have a real shot—however slight it might be—of becoming something huge. Conclusion The artificial intelligence agent sector keeps developing at a dazzling pace. Reinvented capital, a rising profile, and new focus projects push its plotlines forward. At the same time, our nearest rival — despite some momentary price volatility — keeps showing up as a leading influence and generator of engagement across the space. With this combination of institutional and grassroots interest, the market is rarin’ to expand — and these guys are at the center of what’s shaping up as a next big thing.

44942800,https://nulltx.com/?p=149828,1747897882,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Sky Protocol launches SKY token as new governance standard, urges MKR holders to upgrade promptly",https://nulltx.com/sky-protocol-launches-sky-token-as-new-governance-standard-urges-mkr-holders-to-upgrade-promptly/,"An important shift is taking place in the decentralized finance space. Sky Protocol, which used to be known as MakerDAO , is rebranding and moving forward with a new token that will act as the “exclusive governance asset” for its ecosystem. Meanwhile, the MKR token has been “retired from all governance responsibilities” and is on a trajectory to a skyward future. The current holders of MKR tokens are being urged to upgrade their holdings to SKY, lest that influence and benefits the holders get from the ecosystem be lost as the MKR fades into obsolescence. This alteration embodies a decisive movement in the arrangement and appearance of the future decentralized governance, staking, and performance-based incentives envisaged by the Sky Protocol team. This remaking of Sky Protocol, according to the team, is not simply a rebranding effort. It represents a complete makeover—a total transformation from a governance model based largely in Web2 to one designed for Web3. If this next-generation governance system works, it should allow for totally decentralized decision-making by a community of nearly 6,000 Sky Protocol token holders. From MakerDAO to Sky Protocol: A New Era of DeFi Governance Sky Protocol signals the evolution of MakerDAO—not only one of the earliest but also one of the most influential DeFi projects—into an even more expansive and forward-thinking protocol. With the introduction of the SKY token, governing MakerDAO becomes even simpler and fairer. The SKY token offers even greater accessibility and flexibility to users, and it incentives long-term performance of the protocol by linking much of its governance directly to the performance of SKY. The governance model we are introducing empowers holders of the SKY governance token with an array of rights, including the right to vote on protocol changes (as well as the ability to direct this voting power to trusted representatives, if desired) and the right to significantly influence the development direction of Sky Protocol. Sky Protocol Introduces SKY as Exclusive Governance Token — MKR Holders Urged to Upgrade! @SkyEcosystem (prev. Maker DAO) has officially transitioned $MKR to $SKY , which is now the sole governance token powering the protocol’s future. Holders of $MKR must upgrade to $SKY to… pic.twitter.com/DiRXTjUIWv — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) May 21, 2025 We hope that also makes our governance mechanism more robust and responsive—in other words, capable of being both well-run and well-scaled. Sky Protocol has stressed that all holders of MKR must upgrade their tokens in order to still take part in governance decisions and receive protocol rewards. The upgrade rate has been set at 1 MKR = 24,000 SKY, a rate that highlights the protocol’s desire to grow its community and governance participation. Time-Sensitive Transition: Penalties Begin in September 2025 To promote fast engagement in the upgrade process, Sky Protocol has put forward a penalty mechanism that operates on a time basis. Beginning on September 18, 2025, holders of MKR who have not yet completed the transition to SKY will suffer a devaluation in their conversion rates; in other words, the MKR holdouts will get precisely 0.78 SKY tokens for every MKR they do manage to convert, instead of the 1.0 SKY tokens the protocol would otherwise issue. Although this is the first time we have seen a penalty mechanism employed in this context, and it almost seems like a more sophisticated version of the nudges used to promote health behaviors or save money for retirement, in Sky’s case, it’s all about getting its community up to speed on a new and better version of its decentralized operating system. Individuals who finish the update prior to the deadline of September 18 will obtain the entire 24,000 SKY for each MKR token and will enjoy unhindered governance and staking benefits. On the other hand, users who upgrade after the deadline may have less governance power and diminished opportunities to earn rewards, reinforcing the importance of upgrading sooner rather than later. Unlocking New Features with the Sky Staking Engine A feature that stands out with the launch of the SKY token is the Sky Staking Engine, a new rewards system that allows for returns earned on SKY that are based on how well the protocol performs. When users stake SKY, they are doing more than just supporting the network’s security and decentralization; they are now co-investing (with the protocol) in the protocol’s success. And the rewards scale with how well the protocol performs. Sky Protocol’s mission is to align community incentives with long-term growth. The staking engine is a component of that. It is said to be a core component, but not the only one, obviously. The way I look at it, there are two main parts to what the engine does. The first part has to do with rewards. Our reward models are very unlike the static reward models that are common in the blockchain space. Those models often tend to be somewhat inflationary, and they don’t really give you any signals. When you stake in Sky Protocol, what you’re effectively doing is issuing a performance-based model in which your returns are much more influenced by the productivity of the protocol and the overall economic health of the ecosystem. This aligns very well with the broader philosophy of Sky Protocol: to empower not just with voting rights, but with a stake in the very outcomes of the protocol, token holders. This is, in fact, an articulation of the shift from governance that is by the few to governance that is by the many—economically incentivizing more community members to engage in and with the governance of the network. Conclusion The initiation of the SKY token and MakerDAO’s complete shift to the Sky Protocol symbolizes a crucial moment for one of the DeFi sector’s cornerstone ecosystems. With a clear roadmap, enhanced governance tools, and the innovative Sky Staking Engine, the protocol now stands ready to facilitate a new era of decentralized coordination and rewards. For holders of MKR right now, the message couldn’t be clearer: upgrade to SKY immediately in order to keep influencing the future of Sky Protocol, or else face what could be some hefty penalties come September 18. For some acts of congress, as DeFi acts go, this one’s pretty important. The Shapeshift Foundation, which oversees Sky Protocol, has made it known that if you want to engage with this newly DeFi’d ecosystem, you might want to upgrade. And it could be pretty essential to do so. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO up today? JTO’s price gained strong buying demand around the low of $1.9. As a result, buyers gained confidence and pushed the price above $2.1. Will JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a continuation of the current upward trend. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

Bitcoin surged past $111,800 early Thursday, setting a fresh record. 15 years ago on this day developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas, then worth roughly $40. The May 22, 2010, purchase marked the first recorded commercial transaction using BTC, a turning point that took the asset from cypherpunk code to actual currency. That same 10,000 BTC can buy over 70 million pizzas at current prices. It is worth over $1.1 billion as of Thursday. Hanyecz has long shrugged off the missed fortune” tag, telling CBS in 2019 that the transaction made bitcoin “real” to him. He mined the coins back when BTC was under a penny, and few could have predicted the multi-trillion-dollar asset it would become. Still, the transaction remains a cultural milestone for the crypto market — a moment that showed internet money could work as actual currency. Now, it’s not just pizza being paid for with bitcoin.

BTC Reaches All-Time High as $609 Million Inflows Into Spot Bitcoin ETFs This strong capital inflow coincided with Bitcoin breaking a new record, surpassing its previous peak of $108,000. The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading above $111,000. According to experts, Bitcoin’s recent surge is largely due to institutional factors, with major funds turning to spot ETFs and public companies raising funds for Bitcoin investments being among the main drivers of the rise. “Today’s demand is driven by institutional infrastructure and a clearer regulatory environment. Investor sentiment has now shifted significantly in favor of institutional-grade allocations,” said Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets. According to data provider SoSoValue, the largest portion of net inflows on Wednesday was made to BlackRock’s IBIT fund: a full $530.6 million. Other major ETFs, including Fidelity’s FBTC, Bitwise’s BITB and Grayscale Mini BTC Trust, also recorded positive inflows exceeding $20 million. VanEck, Ark & 21Shares and Valkyrie funds also finished the day with net inflows. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $7.64 billion in trading volume on Wednesday, the highest daily volume since Feb. 25. Net inflows of $4.24 billion were made to the ETFs in May, bringing the total cumulative inflow to $43.38 billion.

One bill would allow public pension funds to invest in Bitcoin through regulated exchange-traded products. Another bill proposes a state-level ban on supporting or promoting a U.S. central bank digital currency. Michigan lawmakers introduced four new crypto-focused bills on Wednesday, signaling a growing state-level push to define digital asset policy and limit federal influence over financial innovation. Rep. Bill Schuette (R-MI) introduced House Bill 4510 , which would authorize the state treasurer to invest retirement funds in cryptocurrencies, provided the assets averaged a market cap of at least $250 billion over the prior year. This effectively limits the scope to Bitcoin, which hit a record $111,000 this week. The bill mandates such investments be made through exchange-traded products managed by registered investment firms to ensure oversight. Another Bill Targets CBDCs A second bill, House Bill 4511 , sponsored by Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-MI), targets federal efforts to roll out a central bank digital currency (CBDC). It proposes a ban on any state agency or department from supporting, testing, or promoting a U.S. CBDC. The legislation also seeks to shield digital asset holders from additional state-level restrictions or taxes. On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Mike McFall (D-MI) filed two companion bills—HB 4512 and HB 4513—focused on Bitcoin mining and environmental remediation. One bill outlines a “Bitcoin Program” that would grant private firms temporary rights to mine Bitcoin at abandoned oil or gas well sites, using leftover fuel. In return, companies would be responsible for site restoration. The accompanying bill offers state tax deductions for income generated through this type of mining activity. The program would be regulated by the Supervisor of Wells, who would oversee a public registry of eligible sites, conduct annual bidding rounds, and enforce restoration obligations. Michigan’s proposals add to a growing patchwork of crypto legislation emerging across the U.S. Earlier the same day, Texas lawmakers passed a bill to establish a state-run Bitcoin reserve. New Hampshire recently became the first state to authorize crypto and precious metal investments for public funds. Blackstone Makes First Crypto Move On May 20, Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, made its first move into crypto markets , purchasing shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares as of March 31, valued at approximately $1.08 million. Prior to that, shares of Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp surged by over 91% on May 19 , after the Nasdaq-listed company announced plans to raise $100 million to initiate Bitcoin purchases as part of a new treasury strategy. The Jakarta-based firm revealed that its board has approved the creation of a Bitcoin treasury reserve. DigiAsia says it intends to allocate up to 50% of its net profits toward acquiring Bitcoin, signaling a shift in how it plans to manage its capital amid growing corporate interest in digital assets. Notably, public companies continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, leading the charge.

This time, the finance guru insists that “the party is over” and “the end is here.” In a tweet addressing the latest developments in the U.S. bond market, Kiyosaki affirmed that millions of Americans are about to be wiped out financially. However, those who hold bitcoin (BTC), gold, and silver will be safe. The End is Here: Kiyosaki The Rich Dad Poor Dad author claimed that no one showed up for the Federal Reserve’s auction of U.S. bonds on May 20, so the Fed bought $50 billion of the bonds itself. He called both the bonds and the U.S. dollar fake money. Despite Kiyosaki’s claims that no one showed up to the auction, data from TreasuryDirect shows that the Fed recorded over $69 billion in bids for its 42-day bills with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.97. Regardless of the bond auction outcome, Kiyosaki’s message remains the same: buy bitcoin because the U.S. economy is collapsing. He claims the dollar is hyperinflated, and the end he has warned about is here. While the dollar faces the risk of collapsing, Kiyosaki believes the value of gold could surge to $25,000, while silver could touch $70. On the other hand, BTC could be worth between $500,000 and $1 million. At the time of writing, gold was worth $3,300, silver was trading at $33, and BTC shot up to a new all-time high today of over $111,000. Moody’s Downgrades U.S. Debt Kiyosaki’s latest doom forecast comes as the credit rating agency Moody’s downgrades U.S. debt from Aaa to Aa1. Aaa is the highest rating possible, while Aa1 is one notch down the scale. The agency cited a sharp rise in U.S. federal debt over the past decade due to a continuous fiscal deficit. According to Moody’s, federal spending has risen while tax cuts have declined, significantly increasing interest payments on government debt. This comes as successive U.S. administrations and Congress fail to implement measures to reverse the trend of annual fiscal deficits. Reacting to the downgrade of U.S. debt, Kiyosaki recommended that more people become entrepreneurs and invest in real estate as “America is in serious trouble.” Most importantly, saving in BTC and precious metals.

Pepe’s whale-driven momentum signals a potential rally, while Mutuum Finance’s innovative DeFi model fuels demand. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) raising $9,000,000 and selling over 500 million tokens to 11,000 holders since its presale began, its phase 5 is underway at $0.03. Investors are flocking to these top cryptocurrencies, chasing high returns. As the market shifts, positioning in these new crypto coins could unlock significant gains. Let’s explore why Pepe and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are among the best cryptocurrencies to buy now. Pepe’s Whale Surge Sparks Rally Hopes Pepe (PEPE) is riding a wave of whale accumulation. A dormant investor recently scooped up 1.79 trillion tokens, worth over $22 million, from Binance. This massive buyup hints at a looming liquidity crunch. Despite a recent 8.64% price drop to $0.00001246, crypto charts show volatility. The Relative Strength Index sits at 63.23, just below oversold levels. Bollinger Bands signal heightened price swings. Historically, Pepe thrives in May, boasting an 82.3% average monthly gain since 2023. This month’s 40.4% surge keeps it on track. Investors eyeing the next big crypto see Pepe as a speculative bet, but its meme-driven nature lacks Mutuum’s stability. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi Edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in DeFi with its lending model. Unlike Pepe’s hype-fueled swings, it offers real utility. Lenders deposit assets into pools, earning interest via mtTokens like mtETH or mtDAI. These tokens accrue value over time, ensuring passive income. Borrowers access funds by posting collateral exceeding loan amounts, minimizing default risks. This overcollateralized system stabilizes the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also supports peer-to-peer lending, letting users negotiate terms directly. Such flexibility sets it apart in the crypto market. Investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in find Mutuum’s practical approach compelling, especially with its presale momentum. Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting investor fervor in phase 5 of its 11-phase presale. Priced at $0.03, a 200% jump from the $0.01 opening phase, it reflects surging demand. Phase 4 sold at $0.025, meaning current phase 5 buyers gain 16.7% when phase 6 opens at $0.035. The tokenomics guarantee a 100% ROI at the $0.06 launch price. Analysts predict a post-launch climb to $2.50, yielding an 8,233% ROI. The first phase sold out swiftly, and phase 5 is following suit, creating urgency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for holding their spots, further driving engagement. Buy Pressure Fuels Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is bolstering its value with a buy-and-distribute mechanism. Platform revenue buys back MUTM tokens, redistributing them to mtToken stakers. This creates constant demand, supporting price growth. A $100,000 giveaway adds excitement, offering ten $10,000 prizes to presale participants. The team is finalizing a Certik smart contract audit, with results soon to be shared on social platforms. This focus on security builds trust. As crypto prices rise, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a top crypto to buy. Its structured growth and DeFi utility make it a safer bet than Pepe’s volatility. Why These Coins Shine Pepe (PEPE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer distinct paths to profit in the crypto market. Pepe’s whale-driven surges appeal to short-term traders betting on the next crypto to explode. Its historical May gains fuel optimism, but volatility demands caution. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, blends DeFi innovation with presale gains. With phase 5 at $0.03 and a guaranteed 100% ROI at launch, it’s a prime pick for long-term investors. As crypto investing heats up, these altcoins top the list of best cryptos to buy now.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-ledger-is-quietly-becoming-the-core-settlement-layer-heres-the-latest/,"On May 20, 2025, StraitsX officially announced the deployment of its Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin, XSGD, on the XRP Ledger. The move marks a significant milestone in the development of real-time, regulated digital payments infrastructure across Asia. This is meant to increase access to compliant and efficient financial rails. StraitsX, a key Southeast Asian digital payment infrastructure provider backed by institutions such as Standard Chartered and DBS, announced a partnership with Ripple. This deployment aims to enable faster, cost-effective, and more secure transactions denominated in Singapore dollars using the XRP Ledger’s advanced capabilities. XRP Ledger as a Settlement Core in a Global Financial System In response to this development, well-known crypto investor Mr. Man commented on the broader implications through a tweet that presents the XRP Ledger as a central framework within the emerging global financial system. We’re witnessing the formation of a unified global financial operating system, and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is quietly becoming the core settlement layer, the heart that pulses liquidity, compliance, and interoperability across this multi-rail ecosystem. Ripple has built… pic.twitter.com/f7wiX3M4v0 — Mr. Man (@MrManXRP) May 19, 2025 According to the pseudonymous investor, what is unfolding is not simply a regional deployment of a stablecoin, but rather the continued establishment of a unified global operating structure for finance. Mr. Man describes the XRP Ledger as quietly becoming the core settlement layer—a foundation through which liquidity, compliance, and interoperability can move seamlessly across interconnected financial systems. From RLUSD to Multi-Chain Interoperability He emphasizes that Ripple has already constructed a robust institutional-grade infrastructure, referencing the RLUSD stablecoin recently launched, along with innovations such as cross-chain liquidity bridges, burn-to-mint protocols, decentralized recovery (DeRec), and multi-party computation (MPC) custody features. All of these developments collectively support an ecosystem in which stablecoins issued by sovereign-regulated entities, such as XSGD, AUDD, and BBRL, are now being integrated into the XRP Ledger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Mr. Man also points to Ripple’s growing network of wallet tooling and custody solutions through collaborations with Metaco and Hedera and the firm’s alignment with major financial standard-setting bodies such as ISDA and the CPMI. These components, he argues, are elevating the XRP Ledger from the status of a traditional blockchain to what he calls a “crossledger liquidity router.” Global Financial Entities Integrate into XRPL The tweet further underscores the strategic nature of Ripple’s relationships across the global financial sector. Mr. Man mentions entities such as HashKey Capital, Temenos, FedNow gateways, Aave, and CME futures, suggesting that each layer of the system is aligning to use XRPL as an underlying connectivity and liquidity framework. He argues that XRP is not positioned to compete with other ledgers but to interlink them as a neutral settlement asset. Singapore Deployment Seen as Global Layer 1 Model He concludes his analysis by stating that Ripple has successfully built a universal settlement graph, with XRP functioning as the “connective tissue” between different financial networks. The new arrangement in Singapore, according to Mr. Man, represents a Global Layer 1 (GL1) designation, where local and international institutions adopt the XRP Ledger not as a peripheral blockchain but as a core infrastructure layer. As more sovereign-backed stablecoins integrate into the XRPL ecosystem, the foundation for a harmonized, real-time, and compliant global payment network continues to solidify.

More than 200 guests reportedly spent millions of dollars just to meet him in person. Big names in crypto like Justin Sun, founder of Tron, were among the attendees. Critics argue this isn’t just about buying coins—it’s about buying private access to Trump. For the unversed, the event attendees have reportedly spent over $100 million for a chance to meet the US President. Lawmakers and Protesters Push Back Democrats and protest groups are speaking out, accusing Trump of using his influence to profit from crypto deals tied to him and his family. While a bill has not yet been introduced, Congresswoman Maxine Waters and others are planning to push legislation that would ban presidents, lawmakers, and their families from making money off cryptocurrency. On May 22, several protests and press events are planned around the Capitol and near Trump’s golf club. Groups like Public Citizen, along with Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Murphy, and Jeff Merkley, are set to lead rallies under the slogan “America Is Not for Sale.” Critics are also worried that some of the biggest memecoin buyers could be foreign investors, raising questions about who really gets access to power. The controversy over Trump’s crypto connections has even slowed progress on important U.S. stablecoin legislation, though the bill has recently moved forward in the Senate.

Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) price is up 15% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $35.50, with the trading volume surging 130%. With this surge, the price has now broken the local resistance at $28, marking the upper boundary of the consolidation range that held for almost two weeks after the previous leg up in early May that had lifted the price 30% to $25 level. The $28 level was also the key horizontal resistance that held firm from late December through late February. With all the post-ATH resistances broken, the path is now clear to retest the $35 peak, after which HYPE would enter price discovery territory. Moreover, today’s swing high marks the fifth consecutive higher high since HYPE price bottomed below $10 in early April. During this entire uptrend, the price has remained above both the 20 EMA and 50 SMA, with a bullish crossover between the two moving averages occurring in mid-April, further confirming the uptrend. Momentum is decisively bullish, with MACD line over the singal line and green historgram rising. RSI is at 76, in the overbought territory, potentially signaling a short-term pullback or consolidation.

David Sacks, President Donald Trump’s top advisor on crypto and artificial intelligence, said the administration expects the U.S. Senate to pass the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill that he claims could drive massive new demand for U.S. Treasuries. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Sacks said there are already over $200 billion in stablecoins, though currently unregulated, adding that providing legal clarity and a proper framework could create “trillions of dollars of demand for our Treasuries practically overnight, very quickly.” The bill, officially known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, cleared a key Senate hurdle this week when 66 senators voted to advance it, including 15 Democrats, giving the legislation enough support to avoid a filibuster. Sacks said the administration now has every expectation that the bill is going to pass, though he didn’t respond to a question about potential conflicts of interest involving Trump and his family’s crypto businesses. You might also like: With the Genius Act vote nearing final passage — who wins, and who loses? Critics have pointed to Trump’s financial ties to the crypto sector as the Trump family is backing World Liberty Financial, which recently launched a stablecoin called USD1. It’s backed by U.S. Treasuries and dollar deposits. Abu Dhabi’s MGX fund invested $2 billion in USD1 in Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange that admitted to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws in a $4.3 billion plea agreement. The GENIUS Act would create a federal framework for stablecoin issuers and bring dollar-backed digital currencies under U.S. oversight. Sacks framed it as an economic opportunity, saying that stablecoins offer a “new, more efficient, cheaper, smoother payment system — new payment rails for the U.S. economy.” Still, the bill’s final passage could be delayed.

However, the ongoing battle at the $2.69 resistance continues to weigh on investor sentiment and casts doubt on an immediate breakout. XRP Price Analysis Crypto analyst CasiTrades recently pointed out on X that XRP has successfully bounced off the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $1.90 and reclaimed the 0.382 level at $2.25 , showing signs of bullish momentum. However, he also noted that XRP has yet to form a new local high , a key signal for confirming a trend reversal. “XRP is holding $2.25 and building structure, but needs a breakout above $2.69 to confirm a bullish trend,” – CasiTrades When Will XRP Price Go Up? Technical analysis shows that XRP faces a strong resistance at $2.69 , a level it has failed to break several times. On May 12 , XRP reached $2.65 but fell short, and on May 14 , another attempt was met with heavy selling pressure. Between May 14–17, the price dropped by over 8.85% , highlighting ongoing market uncertainty. As long as XRP trades below $2.69 , analysts warn that a downside move toward $1.50 remains on the table . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple’s RLUSD Poised to Replace USDT in Europe After MiCA Shake-Up , What Next For Ripple (XRP)? According to CasiTrades, XRP is currently in a Wave 4 consolidation phase , which typically signals sideways movement as the market builds structure. This phase suggests a potential setup for a strong move— up or down . In the past 24 hours, XRP posted a modest 0.8% gain , with a daily close at $2.3950 , after briefly pushing above a short-term resistance at $2.375 . However, at the time of writing, XRP is trading slightly below that level again. Key Levels to Watch Support: $2.25 Short-term Resistance: $2.375 Major Resistance: $2.69 Downside Risk: $1.50 The analyst emphasized that holding above $2.375 is crucial for any continued upside. A breakdown below this level could trigger another retest of the $2.25 support —and possibly lower. Conclusion: XRP’s price action remains at a critical juncture. While bulls are defending key levels , the lack of a breakout above $2.69 continues to limit upside potential. If momentum builds, XRP could target a new high—but if support fails, traders should be prepared for a dip toward $1.50. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to World Foundation’s official fundraising announcement on May 21, the funds will be used to expand its iris-based identity network, World ID. Leading the raise were Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Crypto, who purchased Worldcoin ( WLD ) tokens at market value, increasing the supply of tokens in circulation. With more than 26 million users and 12.5 million Orb-verified IDs in oved 160 countries, this institutional support lends more credibility to the project. The market has responded positively to the news. Trading volume is up 87% to over $508 million, while derivatives volume has exploded by 112% to $879 million. Open interest is also up 23%, now sitting at $280 million, as per Coinglass data . After months of decline, this steep increase points to a change in trader sentiment as capital moves back into WLD. However, the token is still 89% below its peak of $11.74 in March 2024.

After recovering from support around $1.00, it has climbed back to $1.24. The move is accompanied by strong momentum and rising volume, indicating that bulls might be regaining control. The price is trading above the short- and mid-term moving averages, which are currently trending upward, often a bullish sign. Worldcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The relative strength index is slightly above 60, indicating that there is still potential for growth without reaching an overbought level. The expanding Bollinger Bands suggest a possible breakout move. If bulls can break through the crucial resistance level, which is around $1.30, the next major barrier is near $1.38. On-chain fundamentals continue to be a risk as well as a strength. More WLD is now in circulation as a result of the recent token sale, which could put short-term pressure on the price. But the fact that this was not a VC dump, but rather a sale to two long-time backers at market price, changes the narrative. Furthermore, if Worldcoin can use the new funding to successfully scale its World ID infrastructure, especially in jurisdictions like the U.S., where digital identity regulation is tightening, it could carve out a unique niche at the intersection of AI, privacy, and identity. If the current momentum holds, WLD might move in the $1.37–$1.50 range. A breakout above that area could result in a more pronounced rally as shorts are squeezed. However, if buyers lose interest and the token falls below $1.20, a retrace to $1.10 or even $0.95 is still possible.

Cardano (ADA) continues to attract long-term believers with its development roadmap, while Hypeliquid (HYPE) draws attention through community-driven appeal. Meanwhile, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has surged rapidly, capturing retail interest through viral traction and unexpected market performance. As the Bitcoin price climbs, it often signals the beginning of broader interest across the market , especially in promising altcoins that tend to outperform during bullish trends. These three altcoins mentioned above are highlighted as the best performers this cycle, with FloppyPepe (FPPE) standing on top. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Meme Coin Built To Outpace Bitcoin (BTC) FloppyPepe (FPPE) is reshaping the meme coin space by combining viral culture with real, AI-powered functionality. It's tools like Meme-o-Matic, which instantly turns text into memes, and FloppyX, a video generator, that empower users to create and engage with content effortlessly. Inspired by Matt Furie’s legacy, FloppyPepe (FPPE) raised nearly $1 million in its private sale, moving over 5 trillion tokens in just 24 hours. This kind of early momentum has attracted attention not just from meme investors but from traditional Bitcoin (BTC) holders looking for high-upside altcoins this cycle. With a deflationary supply model and constant utility upgrades, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out among altcoins positioned to outperform the Bitcoin price this cycle, especially as social-driven tokens dominate short-term momentum. Low-Cap, High-Speed: Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Dominating This Cycle FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining attention for its explosive early performance, with sharper returns than Bitcoin (BTC) in this cycle. While the Bitcoin price moves steadily, this altcoin surged in its presale, attracting thousands of buyers within hours, outpacing even top altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Hypeliquid (HYPE) in early growth. With a presale price of just $0.0000002 and an ongoing 80% bonus using the promo code FLOPPY80, retail investors are flooding in to capitalize on its low-cap upside. This early traction fuels fast gain. While Bitcoin (BTC) anchors the market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) rides the wave of meme culture, speed, and scarcity, proving that in this cycle, agility and attention can outperform tradition. Analyzing Cardano (ADA)’s Technical Strength In The Current Bull Cycle Cardano (ADA) is showing steady technical strength in this cycle, which renews investor confidence. According to crypto analyst Ali, Cardano (ADA) is holding above $0.72 within an ascending channel, which could open the path toward a short-term target of $0.92 if support holds, especially as the broader market, led by Bitcoin (BTC), continues to gain traction. Another top analyst, Tyler Burke, forecasts a major breakout, predicting Cardano (ADA) could hit $8 by August 2025. Backed by continuous development and strong on-chain activity, Cardano (ADA) is positioning itself as one of the top altcoins, potentially outperforming the Bitcoin price as excitement builds around scalable, utility-rich blockchain platforms. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price At Crossroads: Breakout Or Breakdown? Hyperliquid (HYPE) has shown impressive strength this cycle, trading near $25.82. Its rapid growth is fueled by surging trading activity on the Hyperliquid platform, attracting both retail and institutional interest. Despite its gains, technical indicators suggest that Hyperliquid (HYPE) may be entering a cooling phase as bitcoin price consolidation influences short-term sentiment. Recent price action shows Hyperliquid (HYPE) is struggling to break above resistance around the $27 level, forming a lower high and showing signs of weakness. If selling pressure continues for Hyperliquid (HYPE), a pullback toward the $21–$22 support zone is likely. This setup, while still within a broader uptrend, is unfolding in a market closely tracking the Bitcoin price. What This Cycle’s Top Altcoins Are Telling Us In a market where Bitcoin (BTC) often leads, some altcoins are rewriting the script this cycle. Cardano (ADA) brings long-term vision, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) shows short-term strength, but FloppyPepe (FPPE) is capturing momentum with both utility and energy, echoing the kind of breakout potential once seen in early Bitcoin (BTC) moves. Backed by a vibrant community and an active 80% bonus campaign, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly positioning itself as a serious competitor to outperform the Bitcoin price. For those tracking high-growth opportunities, this meme-powered movement might just lead to the next altcoin breakout story.

Two Papa John’s Pizzas, 10,000 BTC, and a Billion-Dollar Lesson appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today isn’t just any other day for the crypto world. It’s Bitcoin Pizza Day , a quirky, legendary anniversary that marks one of the most famous transactions in financial history. And in a fitting twist, Bitcoin hit a brand new all-time high today, soaring to $111,861.22 — making this year’s Pizza Day extra legendary. Fifteen years ago, on May 22, 2010, a Florida-based programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz was craving pizza. Instead of paying in dollars, he made an unusual offer on a Bitcoin forum — 10,000 Bitcoins for two large Papa John’s pizzas. At the time, those Bitcoins were worth about $40. 15 years ago, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Floridian programmer, bought 2 Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 $BTC . Today, those pizzas would be valued at over $1.07B today. Happy #Bitcoin Pizza Day, everyone! pic.twitter.com/H7oeBTEIJM — CoinGecko (@coingecko) May 22, 2025 A fellow forum user accepted the deal, placed the pizza order using his credit card, and had it delivered to Hanyecz’s doorstep. What seemed like a simple food trade became a historic moment. Because if you check today’s Bitcoin prices, those same 10,000 BTC would be worth over $1.07 billion. Yes — two pizzas for a billion bucks. But it wasn’t about getting rich. Hanyecz was proving a point: that Bitcoin could actually work as money — something you could use to buy real, everyday stuff. And what better than pizza, the universal fuel for programmers and crypto enthusiasts alike? Since then, Bitcoin Pizza Day has become a fun, annual tradition. Every May 22, crypto fans around the world grab a slice, post pizza memes, and reflect on how far the industry has come — from an obscure internet experiment to a multi-trillion-dollar global market.

The move is being driven by institutional activity, particularly in futures, where open interest has hit a record $72 billion . That’s 8% higher over the last week, which means big players are getting directional. Over $3 billion in short positions are concentrated between $107,000 and $108,000, which is now a liquidation cluster. If Bitcoin breaks $113,369, it could trigger a short squeeze and send price parabolic. Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72B today as institutional leverage climbs. Around $1.2B in shorts between $107 K and $108 K could be liquidated, boosting breakout odds. CME leads with $16.9 B in OI, while Binance follows at $12 B. pic.twitter.com/spdzrWek9G — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) May 20, 2025 “$108K flipped resistance into support. This structural shift could accelerate price discovery into the $117K-$120K range,” a senior derivatives analyst said. Key support has moved up to $108,000, which was previously resistance. This reassignment of support levels means more confidence in the market and is bullish in the short term. Golden Cross Formation Signals Potential Breakout Above $110,000 The technical analysis indicators are even more bullish with a golden cross coming on the daily chart. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is closing in on the 200-day EMA—an event that has historically led to big upside. Bitcoin is about to flash a Golden Cross, shortly after a Death Cross. Insanely bullish. pic.twitter.com/M8oRuUfA1b — CryptoGoos (@crypto_goos) May 20, 2025 Golden cross has preceded 45-60% gains in past BTC cycles A close above $110,000 would be a 17% May gain Current monthly performance is nearly double the 10-year average of 9.2% If Bitcoin holds these levels into month-end, May could be the strongest month since 2019. That would be more evidence of demand and set up for fresh inflows into the second half of the year. Bitcoin Key Levels: $113K Resistance, $117K-$120K Target From a price structure standpoint, Bitcoin is still in a steep ascending channel that started in early April. The MACD histogram is still bullish but is flattening out—a sign that the move may need a consolidation phase before it extends. Resistance is at $113,369. A daily close above that would be a breakout and open up $117,141 and $120,913. If rejected, we could see a retest of the $108,000 breakout zone, which would be a re-entry point for trend followers. Resistance zones: $113,369 → $117,141 → $120,913 Support zones: $108,000 → $106,500 Technical signal to watch: Spinning top or rejection candle near $113K Short term momentum may pause at resistance but overall structure is still bullish as long as price is above $106,500 and the channel midline. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.98M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As BTC holding near $104K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $6.06 million out of its $6.98 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,062,795/ $6,981,682 Token Price: $0.00252 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

Besides, the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price is also inching close to its ATH at $35. After maintaining consecutive higher highs and lows, the HYPE price is expected to trigger a 30% upswing in the coming days and mark new highs. The Hypeliquid price is marching strongly past $30 after breaking above the consolidated zone around $25. The rise reflects a massive increase in the trader’s confidence as whales and influencers are stacking, fueling a blend of retail FOMO and deep-pocket conviction. As the price surged, the Open Interest of the token also marked new highs which has reaching over $1.1 billion. An increase in the open interest suggests that new money or capital is entering the market, potentially signaling a continuation of the current trend. It also indicates that more traders are actively holding positions in a particular market. The higher open interest is considered a positive sign as it indicates greater market participation and liquidity. The historical chart of HYPE suggests the price is strongly heading towards the highs as it is working hard to secure the highs above the 0.786 FiB levels at $29.64. A daily close above this level is expected to keep up the trend, as the technicals also point towards a bullish continuation. The DMI has displayed a bullish divergence while the ADX is heading towards the upper threshold. Meanwhile, the RSI, which was consolidating along the upper threshold, is rising into the overbought zone. This suggests the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price is poised to maintain a healthy ascending trend and test the ATH at $35. With this, the price is believed to enter the discovery phase and eventually reach the 1.2 FIB at $42.15, marking new highs for the current price cycle.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 07:48:13

It’s often the one quietly accumulating in institutional wallets while the broader market watches the headlines. These wallets don’t chase hype—they anticipate where the momentum is building next. In 2025, investors are paying closer attention to wallet activity rather than influencer commentary. With more capital flowing into blockchain assets that blend utility, innovation, and narrative strength, tracking wallet movements offers an early view of which cryptocurrencies are positioned for a strong long-term presence. One project slowly appearing on the radar is Dawgz AI —an Ethereum-based coin that merges meme culture with AI-driven technology. While it remains early-stage, its presence alongside other AI-integrated tokens hints at a broader institutional interest in combining familiar formats with emerging tech. Why Institutional Wallet Activity Signals Long-Term Potential Institutional wallets operate with a different objective than retail traders. They don’t chase short-term price spikes or follow hype-driven trends. Instead, they allocate capital based on research, long-term value, and underlying utility. When these wallets begin acquiring a specific cryptocurrency, it often signals a calculated move based on internal modeling and market potential. Analysts tracking smart money behavior have observed that large funds typically enter before major price movements. According to CoinDesk , institutional inflows into crypto funds returned sharply in late 2024. The interest was focused on coins with real use cases, including tokens in the AI, infrastructure, and Ethereum-based ecosystems. This activity helps build a baseline of support that tends to reduce volatility and create momentum that retail investors follow later. Watching what institutional wallets do, not what they say, can offer an advantage. These wallets often interact with smart contracts, DeFi protocols, or accumulate in stages using centralized exchanges and multi-signature cold wallets. By observing these behaviors through platforms like Nansen or Arkham , investors can see early signs of accumulation. These patterns provide more than a trading signal. They reflect confidence in a token’s ability to hold value for the long term. What Are Institutions Actually Buying in 2025? In 2025, institutional wallets are not focused on hype coins or trend-based tokens. Their attention is shifting toward blockchain projects that solve real problems or offer scalable infrastructure. Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions remain a priority because they support transaction throughput and lower gas costs. Projects like Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism are still seeing steady inflows based on their foundational role in decentralized applications. AI-powered coins are also gaining traction. A recent feature by Forbes pointed to an increase in trading volume for coins that link artificial intelligence with blockchain automation. Investors are not only looking at the tech. They are also tracking how these tokens are being used. It includes decentralized data processing, AI agents for smart contracts, and even AI-supported community tools. These trends reflect a search for practical application, not just narrative appeal. Projects like Dawgz AI are appearing within this momentum. As a token that connects meme coin virality with AI-based development tools, it fits a new category of utility-backed community tokens. While it does not offer NFTs or traditional staking, its smart contract framework on Ethereum and focus on AI integration make it a project that on-chain data analysts are beginning to track. Investors watching this segment are not always focused on immediate returns. They are often building positions in tokens that have technical or cultural significance that can grow over time. Dawgz AI — Where Blockchain Meets Artificial Intelligence The rising interest in AI-linked blockchain projects is not limited to enterprise solutions. Some tokens are building attention by combining narrative strength with real development focus. Investors are not only tracking price movements but also watching which projects are building tools that align with future use cases. As a result, some lesser-known coins are gaining quite traction, particularly those that merge community-driven appeal with technological potential. AI-based tokens are no longer seen as speculative. They are now part of portfolios that prioritize long-term experimentation with smart contracts, data flow, and decentralized logic. While most large-cap tokens still lead the market, there is a separate tier of coins that are pulling in attention because of their integration with blockchain utilities. These include tools for decentralized automation, generative agents, and platform-native AI infrastructure. Dawgz AI runs on Ethereum and connects artificial intelligence capabilities with meme coin appeal. What separates it is not just branding but how it approaches smart contract interaction. The project is gaining attention from crypto enthusiasts tracking new hybrid formats. It focuses on building an AI-informed system that can eventually be applied across Ethereum-based tools. While still early, on-chain data from April shows a steady pattern of accumulation in smaller wallet clusters, which signals early interest that could scale with broader recognition. For more insights, please check out this video: What On-Chain Wallet Data Is Revealing Institutional wallets often leave digital trails that can be tracked using public blockchain data. These wallets do not move in and out of positions frequently. They accumulate over time and often spread large buys across multiple transactions. Platforms like Arkham Intelligence and Nansen allow users to monitor wallet tags and smart contract interactions. This kind of tracking helps investors see which tokens are being accumulated before they trend across exchanges. In April, analysts using Lookonchain reported increased wallet activity in coins related to artificial intelligence and community-driven utility. While large-cap tokens like Ethereum and Solana still dominate the charts, a growing number of wallet clusters are focusing on small-cap coins that combine purpose with cultural traction. These projects include early-stage tokens that offer something new, such as a different approach to automation or blockchain-based tooling. Consistent accumulation across unrelated wallets is often a signal of interest based on utility, not speculation. Tokens like Dawgz AI have started to appear in data dashboards that track long-hold behavior. These wallets are not buying based on price spikes. They are acquiring during periods of low volatility, which often suggests positioning ahead of broader exposure. While Dawgz AI remains under the radar of most mainstream platforms, its presence on Ethereum, paired with its AI focus, has made it one of the projects investors are quietly tracking as the next potential long-term hold. 3 Cryptos Investors Are Tracking Closely in 2025 Dawgz AI – AI Utility Meets Meme Culture Alongside larger tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors are quietly tracking a handful of smaller coins that show early signs of traction. These tokens often sit outside the spotlight but still register meaningful wallet activity. Some of them combine familiar branding with actual blockchain use cases. One project that has entered this conversation is Dawgz AI. Built on Ethereum, Dawgz AI is currently priced at under $0.00438 and has raised over $3.6 million during its presale. It merges meme coin simplicity with a clear direction in AI tooling. While it does not include staking, NFTs, or DeFi layers, it has gained attention by positioning itself as a utility-focused meme token backed by real smart contract infrastructure. According to its SolidProof audit, the project has passed multiple contract checks related to safety, ownership, and token mechanics. Dawgz AI is not being traded based on hype cycles. Wallet tracking tools show gradual accumulation, often in smaller, longer-hold addresses. This kind of behavior typically reflects conviction or interest in a utility-based future use case. While it remains under most retail radar, the intersection of AI and cultural tokens continues to attract capital from investors who are planning for a longer horizon. Bitcoin (BTC) – The Original Store of Value Bitcoin remains a priority for institutional investors in 2025. It continues to serve as a digital store of value, offering predictability in a market full of speculation. As of May 21, 2025, Bitcoin is trading at around $106,395.53 with a market cap of over $2.11 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap . Its capped supply of 21 million coins still plays a key role in its long-term appeal. Wallet tracking platforms regularly show steady Bitcoin accumulation by long-term holders. These include hedge funds, treasury wallets, and public companies. Investors often treat Bitcoin as a macro hedge, similar to gold. This perspective makes it one of the few cryptocurrencies that attract capital even in downtrends. Its liquidity, market depth, and institutional-grade products like ETFs make it accessible for large-scale entry. Analysts from CNBC reported that Bitcoin ETFs have driven consistent inflows since Q4 2024. This activity reflects a rising interest in long-term hold strategies over short-term trading. While Bitcoin lacks the programmability of other coins, it offers unmatched consistency. For many institutional players, it remains a core part of their digital asset portfolios. Ethereum (ETH) – Layer 1 With Real Utility Ethereum has secured its place as the infrastructure layer for much of the crypto ecosystem. It powers decentralized finance, smart contracts, and token issuance. As of May 21, 2025, Ethereum is priced around $2485.80 with a market cap of nearly $300.10 billion, according to Binance . Its transition to proof-of-stake and integration with Layer 2 solutions has improved scalability while reducing energy use. Ethereum remains at the center of DeFi, NFTs, and DAO frameworks. Institutional wallets are drawn to it for its flexibility. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum allows investors to back programmable assets and long-term application platforms. Wallet activity often includes staking, liquidity provision, or participation in governance. It makes Ethereum both a holding asset and a tool for engaging with blockchain-native finance. In April, data from DeFiLlama showed Ethereum still holding the highest total value locked (TVL) across DeFi protocols. That dominance reflects a network effect that is hard to replace. For investors building multi-year positions, Ethereum’s role in powering blockchain-based applications continues to make it one of the best crypto assets for long-term exposure. Timing the Market vs. Tracking the Smart Money Trying to time the crypto market often leads to missed opportunities or late entries. Retail traders tend to react to social trends or sudden price spikes. In contrast, institutional wallets depend on measured accumulation and structured allocation. This approach is not based on guessing short-term moves. It is grounded in data, protocol fundamentals, and long-term value storage. As reported by Coinbase Institutional , major funds continue to build exposure over time rather than chase short-term highs. It is where wallet tracking offers insight. By observing patterns in wallet behavior, investors can follow where capital is being deployed with intent. These signals are especially useful when identifying tokens that have not yet entered a high-volume exchange cycle. In 2025, this method has gained more relevance. According to The Guardian , institutional interest in AI-integrated tokens has been growing based on long-term thematic positioning. This interest is not speculative. It comes from models built around utility, token supply, and developer activity. For investors researching the best crypto to buy now , the answer may not lie in trending hashtags. It often appears in on-chain data, audit reports, and smart contract deployments. Projects like Dawgz AI, which blend clear utility with forward-looking narratives, are being watched by wallet clusters that have historically entered before major listings. These patterns can offer signals that are more reliable than short-term price charts or influencer sentiment. How to Track Institutional Wallets Without Guessing Tracking institutional wallets does not require advanced coding skills or private data access. Most of the insights are drawn directly from public blockchain records. Platforms like Nansen allow users to monitor labeled wallets linked to funds, market makers, and smart money accounts. These labels include purchase history, token allocations, and interactions with DeFi protocols. Users can identify which coins are being bought, how long they are held, and whether the wallets are still active. Another tool worth using is Dune Analytics , which offers free dashboards built by the community. These dashboards often display live on-chain data like token transfers, exchange movements, and staking behavior. Some analysts build custom trackers to follow wallet clusters linked to early-stage tokens. It is useful when researching lesser-known projects such as Dawgz AI. Seeing how tokens are moving between wallets can give a better sense of whether accumulation is based on conviction or trading patterns. Platforms like Arkham Intelligence have also introduced wallet intelligence layers, combining blockchain data with entity mapping. It helps users identify how funds move between exchanges, cold wallets, and protocols. For investors building long-term strategies, tools like these offer a more reliable entry point than guessing price swings. Wallet tracking shows action, not opinion—and that makes it valuable in a market where timing and research matter equally. Bottom Line: Why This Matters Now More Than Ever The crypto market in 2025 is not being shaped by hype alone. Data, smart wallet behavior, and the steady movements of institutional capital are shaping it. Investors who depend on signals from retail channels often arrive after the momentum has passed. Those who track wallet activity and focus on utility-driven tokens position themselves with more intention and fewer surprises. As more projects connect blockchain functionality with AI, identity, and automation, the types of coins drawing institutional interest are changing. These are not always the most talked about or highest ranked. They are often the most quietly accumulated. Following where capital flows—not what headlines say—remains one of the clearest ways to build conviction in a crowded market. Dawgz AI is one of the few early-stage projects aligning with that quiet accumulation trend. It brings AI integration into a meme-format token without losing focus on actual smart contract use. For those looking beyond short-term gains, it's worth understanding how tokens like this are structured and why they're beginning to show up in wallet data. Explore Dawgz AI further to see how it fits into the growing category of AI + utility tokens. The best opportunities often appear before they trend.

The “G6 plus one” meeting ended with the hosts Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, and Italy unitedly concerned and disappointed over Trump’s tariffs. The G7 finance ministers and central bank governors were striving to issue a joint communiqué covering non-tariff issues, including support for Ukraine, the threat from non-market economic policies of countries including China, and combating financial crimes and drug trafficking. Particularly, the finance leaders were trying hard to avoid a repeat of a shattered G7 finance meeting hosted by Canada in 2018, when Trump’s first-term steel and aluminum tariffs made the joint statement impossible. However, French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said there was a marked improvement in the mood and that the discussion between the allies was both sincere and honest. Lombard earlier said that he was willing to live without a joint statement as long as the G7 reached a better understanding of how to reduce trade imbalances, better growth policies, and the war in Ukraine. Giorgetti says reaching a communique compromise is crucial Ministro Giorgetti al #G7 di Banff: “Italia continua a lavorare affinché si possa raggiungere il comunicato finale di compromesso. Un passaggio che consideriamo cruciale”. #G7Canada #G7Kananaskis2025 pic.twitter.com/72QQXk1MnU — MEF (@MEF_GOV) May 21, 2025 Italian Economy and Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said reaching a communiqué compromise was a crucial step that needed careful consideration. A European source said U.S. officials wanted to delete language describing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “illegal” from the draft, but Giorgetti said Italy was pushing a proposal to bar countries that had supported Russia’s war effort from being part of Ukraine’s reconstruction. The G7 finance ministers also put a positive spin on discussions in Banff, Alberta, to try to reach an agreement on a joint communique largely covering non-tariff issues. They agreed that excessive forex movements could negatively impact economies. As such, they were looking for closer coordination to stabilize currency and financial markets, particularly in the face of trade tensions and protectionist measures. However, Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato called out recent U.S. tariffs for creating market uncertainties, emphasizing the need for freer trade regimes. “Making progress is what matters ultimately. It’s not just a question of agreeing on a statement today for the sake of it.” – Eric Lombard , French Finance Minister With discussions set to close Thursday, hopes for a final communique reflecting unity among the Group of Seven advanced economies remained uncertain as tensions persisted on Trump’s trade policies. Champagne urges ‘common ground’ as he talks of bridging differences The meeting’s host, Canadian Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, said there was always tension around tariffs, as would be expected, but at the same time, there was a lot that could be achieved together. He, however, declined to say whether he raised the issue of tariffs in his bilateral meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent but insisted the pair “get along very well.” He added that he and Bessent wanted to build on the positive tone Trump struck with Prime Minister Mark Carney at their meeting in Washington earlier this month. Champagne brought Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko to his opening press conference Tuesday and talked of bridging differences even as G7 member countries grappled with a raft of steep tariffs that the U.S. imposed on them. He largely avoided commenting directly on U.S. tariffs but said the G7 for him was “going back to basics,” quickly adding that for him, the basics also meant a “fair, free and rule-based multilateral trading system” — a counterpoint to unilateral actions by Trump that were disrupting international commerce. Champagne also said he wanted to coordinate with the U.S. to tackle challenges such as “overcapacity” and “non-market practices,” where countries like China subsidized industries and overproduced products that could flood world markets and swamp foreign competitors.

With XRP currently trading around $2.39, there are signs that something big could be coming. According to Dr. Martin Hiesboeck, Head of Research at Uphold , if things go well, June might be a turning point for the token. XRP ETF Approval Around the Corner One of the biggest things fueling this optimism is the possibility of a spot XRP ETF finally getting approved. The U.S. SEC is expected to decide on Franklin Templeton’s application by June 17. If it gets a green light, this would be a huge step forward, bringing XRP closer to mainstream finance and making it easier for big investors to jump in. Of course, not every ETF leads to a price boom, as seen with Ethereum last year. But given XRP’s unique legal journey and strong community backing, many believe this one could be different. Fed Meeting Could Unlock Crypto Flows Another key moment is coming with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s next meeting. If they decide to cut interest rates, investors may start looking for better returns in places like crypto. That could bring more attention and money into altcoins like XRP. Meanwhile, lower rates mean cheaper money, and that usually drives up interest in altcoins like XRP. Ripple’s Big Developer Event in Singapore On top of all that, Ripple’s developer event , XRPL APEX, is set for June 10–12 in Singapore. These events often include major announcements, updates, or new partnerships. If Ripple reveals something big, it could boost confidence in XRP even more. June Might Be a Turning Point Dr. Hiesboeck isn’t the only one who thinks something big might be coming. Many analysts are watching XRP closely, and some believe June could be the month when it finally breaks out of its long-term range.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-22 07:59:13
44944413,https://coinpedia.org/?p=459275,1747900761,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,MicroStrategy Records $15 Billion Profit as Bitcoin Hits All-Time High,https://coinpedia.org/news/microstrategy-records-15-billion-profit-as-bitcoin-hits-all-time-high/,"The post MicroStrategy Records $15 Billion Profit as Bitcoin Hits All-Time High appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MicroStrategy (MSTR) is back in the spotlight, and this time, it’s not just about Bitcoin buys. With BTC hitting a new all-time high of $109,500 , the firm is set to record a staggering $15 billion gain in a single quarter, positioning it for entry into the S&P 500 for the first time ever. But beyond the numbers, industry watchers like Jeff Walton believe MSTR is quietly shaping the entire crypto investment landscape. $MSTR is the apex Bitcoin accumulator. They've accumulated 324,000 BTC in the last 8 months That is 105,000 more Bitcoin than EVERY SINGLE company that has BTC on balance sheet COMBINED Lots of people sour on $MSTR 's future because of a single day of price action need to zoom… — Jeff Walton (@PunterJeff) May 21, 2025 The Apex Bitcoin Holder According to Walton, MSTR has accumulated 324,000 BTC in the last 8 months alone, an amount that surpasses the combined holdings of every other company with Bitcoin on their balance sheet by 105,000 BTC. This makes MicroStrategy the undisputed leader in corporate Bitcoin holdings . While short-term market swings may raise eyebrows, Walton urges investors to “zoom out.” He argues that MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation isn’t just about speculative plays, it’s about long-term structural shifts. “This ecosystem exists because of MSTR’s continued accumulation,” he said. Not Just Holding—Redefining Investment Infrastructure Walton further calls MicroStrategy the “500 lb Gorilla” of crypto, meaning it’s the biggest and most powerful player in the space. He believes the company can pull money out of traditional markets like real estate and bonds and redirect it into Bitcoin using smart financial tools like STRK and STRF. He also says MicroStrategy is “the moon that controls gravity,” meaning its moves have a big impact on the whole crypto market. When MSTR makes a move, it influences everything around it. Strong Performance Since the 21/21 Plan Since announcing its “ 21/21 plan” on October 30, 2024 , MicroStrategy’s stock has surged 63.9%, outperforming Bitcoin’s own 47.1% rise in the same period. While critics argue that the growth could be even better, Walton counters that the current trajectory is impressive enough and the future holds more promise. I’m sure a good chunk of the “negative on MSTR” folks are bots or engagement farming. I for one appreciate your signal though the noise right now . MSTR is the kind of stock I’d like to keep for decades and Saylor is building a foundation of granite to make this feasible. — News Reader (@2836P) May 21, 2025 He also noted that most of the recent FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) around MicroStrategy comes from low-engagement accounts, possibly bots or trolls, echoing the sentiment manipulation seen in stocks like GME. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ‘America Is Not for Sale’: New Bill Targets Trump’s Crypto Cash-Grab , S&P 500 Entry Could Change the Game BTC ATH! $MSTR Q2 Pro Forma earnings With BTC at $109,500, $MSTR has ~ $15B single quarter gain Estimated EPS of Q2 ~ $54 per share (7.7 P/E ratio) This would qualify $MSTR for S&P 500 for the first time, leading to Billions of dollars in passive inflows Higher pic.twitter.com/XcdAmFMFMr — Jeff Walton (@PunterJeff) May 21, 2025 If Bitcoin keeps trading near its highs, MicroStrategy is set to report a massive Q2 earnings bump, which would be around $54 per share, with a price-to-earnings ratio of just 7.7. That kind of performance could finally push MSTR into the S&P 500, opening the door to billions in passive investment flows. And it wouldn’t just be a win for shareholders, it would also be a major validation of MicroStrategy’s bold, high-stakes Bitcoin strategy. It could be the spark that draws even more institutional players into the space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As the flagship crypto nears the next barrier, some analysts suggest that this cycle’s top isn’t in yet. Related Reading: SUI Preparing For Another Leg Up – Is $5 The Next Target? Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High On Wednesday, Bitcoin hit a new ATH of $109,800 after breaking out of the $107,000 short-term resistance, eyeing the $110,000 barrier as its next target. The cryptocurrency has significantly recovered over the last seven weeks, surging around 47% from its five-month low of $74,000 toward its current levels. Amid its May rally, BTC couldn’t break the crucial $106,000 resistance, trading between the $102,000-$105,000 range for nearly two weeks. However, its consolidation ended over the weekend as Bitcoin Weekly Closed above this barrier for the first time in history. Since reclaiming this crucial level on Monday, Analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that the flagship crypto appeared to be forming an ascending triangle pattern in the lower timeframes, which suggested a rally toward the $115,000 level once the price broke above the $107,000 mark. In the early hours of Wednesday, BTC’s bullish breakout saw it retest the $108,000 barrier, facing rejection toward the $106,000 support before bouncing and smashing this barrier and rallying toward its new ATH. Rekt Capital affirmed that the Second Price Discovery Uptrend is ahead for the cryptocurrency, as its First Price Discovery Correction is finally over. The analyst previously highlighted that Bitcoin would rally to a new ATH after Weekly Closing above its re-accumulation range and post-breakout retest. BTC Preparing For Another 20%-30% Jump? Analyst crypto Jelle suggested that BTC’s news target is around the $140,000 mark, pointing to a Power of Three (PO3) setup on Bitcoin’s chart. The pattern divides the price action into three phases: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. In the first phase, a consolidation near the recent high occurs after a strong price performance. This is followed by a token’s price falling below the accumulation phase’s support level in the second phase, trading within a range below the recently lost zone. Lastly, the distribution phase consists of a strong price breakout, with momentum building and participants entering the market. Based on this setup, the flagship crypto started the accumulation phase during the Q4 2024 rally, entering the next phase during the March-April retraces. Amid its late April-May rally, Bitcoin has arrived at the setup’s final phase, with the analyst forecasting $140,000 as the next target after breaking above the $108,500 mark. Related Reading: Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs Similarly, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted the same Po3 pattern on BTC’s chart, affirming that investors could expect a “strong expansion” toward the $125,000-$130,000 levels after breaking out of its previous ATH levels. He previously pointed out that “BTC is clearly repeating the summer 2021 price action and trading in a perfectly bullish structure on high time frame,” which could suggest that the cycle’s top isn’t in yet. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades 1.8% below its new ATH, at $107,502.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. MultiBank Group brings institutional weight to web3 with MBG utility token, deflationary model, and plans for real-world asset tokenization. Table of Contents Utility in token design Deflationary mechanisms and token economy Real-world asset tokenization: Future plans Implications for the web3 ecosystem The digital asset industry is evolving, with more major financial institutions applying their knowledge to web3. MultiBank Group, a significant financial derivatives institution based in Dubai, demonstrates this tendency. The MultiBank Group’s size and regulatory compliance have garnered it several awards in 2025, including “Most Reputable Forex Broker” at Money Expo Abu Dhabi and “Best Global ECN Broker” at the Forex Traders Summit in Dubai. These awards recognize MultiBank’s strong presence in traditional markets as well as its continuous commitment to responsible technology integration. Utility in token design The impending launch of MultiBank’s utility token, MBG, in mid-2025 will be essential to the company’s web3 expansion. Unlike many previous tokens that were largely driven by speculation, MBG was designed from the start to have actual purposes. It enables users to pay fees across MultiBank platforms, collect loyalty incentives, and stake tokens for native returns. This utility-focused design represents a larger industry movement toward tokens that provide concrete value and user advantages while adhering to regulatory norms and consumer security. Deflationary mechanisms and token economy One defining aspect of MBG is its deflationary buyback and burn scheme. MultiBank Group has pledged to eliminate up to half of the token’s entire supply during the next four years. In the first year alone, $58.2 million worth of tokens will be removed from circulation. This method seeks to decrease supply in order to possibly promote long-term value through scarcity, a notion well known in traditional finance but less prevalent in the cryptocurrency sector. This endeavor demonstrates how experienced institutions are using existing capital market methodologies in blockchain ecosystems, indicating a developing approach to token economics. You might also like: A look into the growing role of real-world assets and tokenization in web3 finance Real-world asset tokenization: Future plans Beyond utility tokens, MultiBank is working to tokenize real-world assets , including a $3 billion real estate portfolio that will be reflected on the blockchain. The Group plans to build a crypto-focused electronic communication network (ECN) and prime brokerage service by 2026, followed by a decentralized infrastructure in 2027. These developments point to a future in which traditional banking and blockchain technology are more interwoven, with huge institutions using their regulatory experience and size to create more robust and transparent markets. Implications for the web3 ecosystem As web3 grows, the presence of licensed financial institutions such as MultiBank Group is expected to have a substantial influence.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to a new all-time high of $111,544 on Thursday, May 22, afternoon Asian time, breaking past its previous record of $109,400 from just the day before. This new high marks a 48% jump from the April 7 low of just under $75,000, making it the second all-time high for BTC in 2025. Alongside the price surge, Bitcoin’s market cap hit $2.2 trillion, while its realized cap also reached a new peak at $915 billion, highlighting how much value is flowing into the network. A sharp uptick in trading activity has driven the rally. CoinGecko data shows 24-hour volume surged to $73.7 billion, compared to $50 billion on Wednesday and $40 billion on Tuesday. That’s a noticeable jump, especially considering that earlier this month, daily volume had fallen below $30 million, its lowest since February. BTC’s futures open interest also hit a fresh record of $81.35 billion, up sharply from the $46 billion level seen in early March. That signals growing confidence from institutional and leveraged traders.

That correction came shortly after President Trump hinted at new tariffs on major U.S. trading partners. But sentiment improved mid-April, especially after the U.S. reached fresh trade agreements with several nations. Another major factor driving the surge is the continued demand from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen over $7.4 billion in net inflows over the past five weeks, including $609 million just on Thursday. This has been backed by Bitcoin’s growing role as a treasury asset, prompting a wave of public companies to load the flagship crypto onto their balance sheets. Strategy, for example, has continued its aggressive accumulation , now holding over 2.7% of all Bitcoin in circulation. BTC technicals flash bullish patterns On the 1-day BTC/USDT chart, Bitcoin has flipped the 21-day EMA into support after weeks of acting as resistance. More importantly, the 50-day SMA (blue) just crossed above the 200-day SMA (green), forming the highly watched golden cross pattern. Historically, BTC rallied over 37% in just 3 months following a similar pattern in October 2024.

BTC has broken out of a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart | Source: crypto.news The measured target of this breakout points toward $150,000, matching projections based on the flagpole height added to the breakout zone. If the golden cross plays out fully, the next realistic stop could be around $153,600. Veteran trader Peter Brandt acknowledged BTC’s new highs but reminded followers that hitting all-time highs is just what bull markets do. In an earlier May 1 X post , he predicted that Bitcoin could reach the bull market cycle top in the $125k to $150K level by Aug-Sep 2025, although he warned of a possible 50% correction afterwards. Meanwhile, analyst Gert van Lagen is far more bullish, predicting BTC could reach $300K to $320K by the end of the bull cycle. He based his outlook on a breakout from a 4-year Megaphone Pattern, which features widening price swings and often precedes sharp moves upward. Short-term risks still in play Despite the overwhelming bullish momentum, a short-term pullback can’t be ruled out. BTC’s RSI and Stochastic Oscillator have both entered overbought territory, indicating the rally may be due for a pause or short-term consolidation.

So, while a run toward $150K looks increasingly likely, it may not happen in a straight line. A short-term correction could offer a healthier setup for long-term gains.

Judge Torres recently declined a joint request from both Ripple and the SEC seeking an “indicative ruling” that would permit settlement discussions to proceed based on revised terms. The proposal aimed to replace the previously ordered $125 million penalty and permanent injunction against Ripple with a significantly reduced $50 million fine and no injunction. Her rejection of the motion was not based on the content of the agreement but rather on procedural deficiencies in the request submitted to the court. While the parties are anticipated to file a corrected version of the motion shortly, Prosper has suggested that certain high-level interventions or disclosures could alter the trajectory of the case, potentially leading Judge Torres to vacate her prior judgment. Circumstances That Could Justify a Reversal According to Prosper, one possibility is the submission of confidential evidence showing that XRP holds strategic relevance to the federal government. This may include classified documentation from agencies such as the U.S. Treasury or the Department of Justice (DOJ). #XRP #XRPCommunity What Could Force Judge Torres to Vacate her Judgment? A. Classified or Confidential Federal Interest If either the SEC or Ripple presents sealed evidence (e.g., ex parte communications from the U.S. Treasury, Fed, or DOJ), Judge Torres would be required to… — Ashley PROSPER (@AshleyPROSPER1) May 21, 2025 For instance, internal memos indicating XRP’s potential role in a proposed national digital currency infrastructure, or security assessments warning that the continuation of the lawsuit could negatively affect financial or diplomatic stability, could compel the court to reconsider. Such materials would likely be presented under seal due to their sensitive nature. Prosper noted that courts sometimes adjust or vacate rulings when matters of national interest are credibly demonstrated, particularly if high-ranking government agencies are involved. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Executive Branch Involvement Could Influence Outcome Another pathway to reconsideration, Prosper added, would be direct involvement from the federal executive branch. If entities like the Treasury Department or the Federal Reserve were to submit an amicus curiae brief urging the court to reconsider its position, this could introduce significant legal weight. These agencies might argue that XRP plays a critical role in the national or international financial system. Prosper further explained that the court could apply the principle of Chevron deference, which allows judicial bodies to give weight to federal agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous legislative provisions, especially in matters falling within their expertise. Although infrequent, similar interventions have led to judicial reversals in past financial and regulatory cases. Implications and Community Response If either classified documentation or federal agency participation redefines XRP as essential to government financial strategy, Judge Torres could vacate her original ruling. Such a decision could mark a shift in how XRP is legally classified and utilized, potentially positioning it as a key tool in national financial infrastructure rather than a conventional crypto asset. Nevertheless, some voices within the cryptocurrency community have expressed skepticism, arguing that the scenarios proposed are largely speculative and improbable. Despite this, Prosper maintains that these legal avenues remain viable, depending on the direction taken by both Ripple and the U.S. government in the coming months.
