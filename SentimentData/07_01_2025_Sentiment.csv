Web3Bay is doing just that. As other projects shout about their potential, Web3Bay focuses on a steady build-up, positioning itself as a transformative force in online shopping. This underappreciated project is gearing up for significant impact, making now a prime time for discerning crypto enthusiasts to engage. How Web3Bay Is Reinventing E-Commerce Web3Bay is more than your typical blockchain initiative. It’s pioneering a new way of shopping online—without middlemen, reducing fees, enhancing data privacy, and ensuring secure, user-driven transactions. But why isn’t this making more noise? Web3Bay prefers real progress over flashy promotion. Its presale stages are designed to benefit early supporters discreetly, attracting genuine interest over fleeting speculation. Those looking for the best investments to watch right now see Web3Bay’s groundwork as especially compelling. The Value of Web3Bay Tokens Currently, Web3Bay tokens, named 3BAY, are available at the low price of $0.0039675 during the third presale stage. Early buyers stand to see significant gains, with token prices projected to reach $0.1959—a 6,430% increase by the end of the presale. So far, the presale has raised over $420,000 and sold 110 million tokens, signaling strong market trust. However, this valuation doesn’t yet match the platform’s full future potential. Why Web3Bay Is a Game-Changer in Online Shopping Web3Bay’s model is simple and globally applicable. It tackles issues like excessive fees, opacity, and privacy—problems that millions encounter online. By employing blockchain, the platform promises lower costs, transparency, and better security. Its dual payment system, supporting both cryptocurrencies and traditional methods like PayPal, bridges existing e-commerce with blockchain innovation, making it accessible to a broad audience. Why Join Web3Bay’s Presale Now In blockchain ventures, timing is crucial. Early involvement in Web3Bay could differentiate between modest earnings and substantial rewards. Each new presale stage increases token prices by 15%, rewarding proactive participants. Moreover, early investors can influence the platform’s direction through decentralized governance, offering a community-focused alternative to the centralized setups of current e-commerce leaders. This positions Web3Bay as a significant DeFi player and a bullish crypto to monitor. Web3Bay’s Bright Future in Blockchain Commerce Web3Bay has big plans, including introducing an NFT marketplace, DeFi staking options, and cross-chain features to enrich the user experience and extend utility. These steps will attract both blockchain enthusiasts and mainstream users, setting the stage for Web3Bay to become a well-known name in the Web3 arena. With its practical solutions and commitment to decentralization, Web3Bay is set to lead in the evolving e-commerce sector, making it a wise choice among the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Wrapping Up Web3Bay is set for a significant lift-off. Its current undervaluation reflects a market oversight, one that’s quickly adjusting as more recognize its potential. Joining now places you at the forefront of a transformative wave in how we shop online. Web3Bay isn’t just another blockchain project—it’s at the vanguard of redefining buying, selling, and connecting digitally. It stands out as a top DeFi crypto and is poised to dominate in a forthcoming bull market. Get ahead of the curve—join Web3Bay before it becomes mainstream.

Barr is resigning from his position as Vice Chair for Supervision. In a statement , Barr said he didn’t want a potential dispute over the position in the near future to distract from the Fed’s “mission.” “The position of vice chair for supervision was created after the Global Financial Crisis to create greater responsibility, transparency, and accountability for the Federal Reserve’s supervision and regulation of the financial system. The risk of a dispute over the position could be a distraction from our mission. In the current environment, I’ve determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor.” Barr’s resignation comes less than two weeks before pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. In 2023 during a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C., Barr warned about the “special risks associated with stablecoins,” advocating for stiffer regulations on the asset class. Said Barr, “Stablecoin issuers seek to have—but don’t—some of the same characteristics as federally insured bank deposits. Stablecoin issuers represent that their liabilities can be redeemed on demand at par, a dollar for a dollar. In fact, however, the assets backing the liability can fluctuate in value… The banks we regulate, in contrast, are well protected from bank runs through a robust array of supervisory requirements. Consider the consequences if a stablecoin not subject to appropriate supervision and regulation were to be adopted as a widespread means of payment, which some stablecoin developers state as a goal. Stablecoins have the potential to scale quickly because of network effects. An unregulated, unsupervised, deposit-like asset could create tremendous disruptions, not just for financial institutions but for people who might rely on the coin if it were to get wide adoption. We must learn from the past to ensure that we do not allow for new forms of unregulated private money subject to classic forms of run risk, and with the associated spillovers and systemic implications for households, businesses, and the broader economy.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This trial stemmed from the CFTC’s 2022 lawsuit, which accused Gemini of providing false or misleading information during the evaluation of its Bitcoin futures product. The CFTC alleged that between July 2017 and December 2017, Gemini made inaccurate claims about whether its proposed Bitcoin futures contract would be “readily susceptible to manipulation.” Additionally, the lawsuit highlighted that Gemini engaged in undisclosed fee arrangements with specific market participants, such as market makers. These arrangements, designed to boost trading in Gemini’s Auction, were not disclosed to all customers or made available on the company’s website. Under the terms of the settlement, Gemini agreed to pay a $5 million penalty and refrain from making false or misleading statements to the CFTC in the future.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Evaluating Ethereum, XRP, Rollblock, Solana, Pepe, and Shiba Inu as the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Table of Contents Rollblock gaining attention during presale Ethereum tipped to reclaim $4000 XRP slightly declines amid market downturn Shiba Inu suffers with most speculative crypto Solana demonstrates potential Pepe diminishes after a bullish Q4 Conclusion The recent cryptocurrency decline drew parallels to the market dynamics of December 2020. During that period, the dip in prices preceded a historic altcoin rally in Q1-Q2 of 2021, when several assets surged to unprecedented highs. If the 4-year cycle theory holds true, the recent downturn may be setting the stage for another explosive bull run. Ethereum, XRP, Shiba Inu, Solana, Pepe, and Rollblock are all positioned to benefit from this potential resurgence. Rollblock gaining attention during presale Rollblock aims to transform the play-to-earn iGaming sector with its state-of-the-art casino platform that combines strong fundamentals, attractive incentives, and unparalleled growth potential. The platform will have an extensive catalog of over 7,000 games, offering a diverse range of options, from classic favorites like blackjack and poker to cutting-edge blockchain-based titles. Recently, Rollblock expanded its offerings by introducing sports betting, solidifying its position as a leader in the rapidly growing GambleFi market. Security is a top priority for Rollblock, which leverages advanced encryption technologies and AI-powered safeguards to create a transparent and secure environment for both players and investors. The platform’s credibility is further bolstered by its recent SolidProof audit and licensing by Gaming Arjun, establishing its legitimacy as it approaches a highly anticipated bull run ahead of its official launch. One of Rollblock’s standout features is its revenue-sharing system. Up to 30% of weekly profits will be reinvested into token buybacks, with 60% of these tokens burned to reduce supply and drive scarcity. The remaining tokens will be distributed to investors as staking rewards, fostering a loyal community and enhancing RBLK’s long-term value. Ethereum tipped to reclaim $4000 Ethereum recently slipped below the critical $4,000 level during a broader market downturn, temporarily halting its December rally, which had been fueled by strong retail interest and record-breaking inflows into Ethereum ETFs. Despite this dip, optimism remains strong. December saw over $1 billion in ETH accumulation, with 104,000 ETH withdrawn from exchanges, signaling growing confidence among long-term holders. Whale wallets now hold 57% of Ethereum’s total supply — the highest concentration in the platform’s history — demonstrating substantial support from major players. Market analysts anticipate a swift recovery, with Ethereum poised to reclaim the $4,000 mark and potentially surpass its all-time high of $4,891 as early as Q1 2025. As the market stabilizes and the anticipated “alt season” begins in January, Ethereum is set to maintain its leadership position. Its dominance in DeFi, coupled with rising institutional interest and increased whale activity, reinforces Ethereum’s role as a cornerstone of the crypto market and a key player in the next bullish wave. You might also like: Here are the expected bull market top prices for XRP, Solana and Rollblock XRP slightly declines amid market downturn In Q4 of 2024, XRP became one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market, surging over 400%, fueled by speculation surrounding Gary Gensler’s rumored resignation and the pro-crypto sentiment anticipated from Donald Trump’s incoming administration. Adding to the bullish sentiment were whispers of an XRP ETF launch targeted for 2025-2026. However, the mid-December market correction put downward pressure on XRP, weakening its performance on both daily and weekly charts. Despite the short-term decline, XRP has demonstrated notable resilience compared to many altcoins. This relative strength is supported by Ripple’s strategic initiatives, including the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin, which enhances XRP’s utility within the ecosystem. Analysts predict that as Bitcoin dominance eventually cools off, XRP could see a significant influx of new capital, setting the stage for another rally and maintaining its optimistic long-term outlook. Shiba Inu suffers with most speculative crypto After reaching $0.000033 and sparking renewed investor interest earlier in Q4, Shiba Inu has faced a challenging period, declining by over 20% in the past month. This drop coincided with Bitcoin’s price correction below $90,000, which placed additional downward pressure on speculative assets. Despite these setbacks, Shiba Inu demonstrates resilience and ongoing community support. A recent 1,068% spike in the burn rate resulted in the destruction of over 51.7 million tokens, which highlights efforts to reduce supply. Additionally, Shibarium’s total value locked (TVL) has seen an explosive increase of 850% since September, reflecting the growing utility and adoption of Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 solution. At the time of writing, 64% of Shiba Inu holders were in profit, suggesting solid investor confidence even amidst broader market turbulence. As a leader in the meme coin sector, Shiba Inu retains its position as a dominant player, buoyed by its strong community and expanding ecosystem.

The blockchain’s unprecedented 66.9 million daily transactions underscore its dominance in the layer-1 ecosystem, outpacing the combined activity of major competitors. This performance reflects Solana’s speed, cost efficiency, and scalability, solidifying its reputation as an attractive alternative to Ethereum. Notably, Solana’s Brazilian transaction volumes recently surged to nearly $84 million, further showcasing its growing global adoption. Looking ahead, analysts have identified Solana, alongside XRP, as a leading candidate for spot ETF approval in 2025. While potential classification as securities poses regulatory hurdles, analysts anticipate that Solana ETFs could soon join Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as mainstream investment vehicles, presenting significant upside for the ecosystem and its native SOL token. Pepe diminishes after a bullish Q4 Pepe has firmly established itself as the third-largest meme coin, fueled by tier-1 exchange listings and renewed retail interest, which triggered a series of impressive rallies earlier in the cycle. Adding to this bullish momentum was notable whale activity, including a massive $52 million transfer from a wallet that had been dormant for 600 days, signaling renewed confidence in Pepe’s potential. However, mid-December market turbulence weighed heavily on Pepe, aligning with broader meme coin declines. On both daily and weekly charts, Pepe invalidated key bullish patterns, prompting “smart money” holders to reduce their positions. The tracked holdings of Pepe fell from 8 trillion to 7.5 trillion tokens, indicating a bearish sentiment in the short term. Despite these challenges, analysts believe Pepe’s long-term outlook remains optimistic, as meme coins are likely to rebound during the anticipated altcoin season in Q1-Q2 2025. Pepe’s strong community backing and established position in the meme coin sector suggest it could recover and maintain its relevance in the next market cycle. Conclusion The recent market correction aligns with historical patterns observed in previous cycles and is far from bearish when viewed in context. Corrections like this often set the stage for a robust recovery, especially for large-cap juggernauts such as Ethereum, XRP, Shiba Inu, Solana, and Pepe. Additionally, emerging projects like Rollblock are carving out their own space, offering investors a chance to capitalize on niche market opportunities.

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 23:10:00

With several ETFs lined up for launch in 2025, each firm is trying to put its best foot forward to appear on top of the chain. In submissions made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission towards the end of 2024, very lucrative offers would excite investors. One of the unique proposals was an ETF from ProShares that would denote the S&P 500’s return in Bitcoin. Besides, funds managed by Strive Asset Management and REX Shares will enable convertible bonds by companies to purchase Bitcoin. Volatility Shares, an ETF firm, hopes to trigger Solana funds with a vessel that tracks it using futures products. As more launches are anticipated, there are deliberate attempts to incorporate crypto strategies into ETFs . Most of these scenarios will be in play in 2025 because crypto is currently the hot thing, and issuers love to drop them when the theme is on fire. Crypto ETFs are gaining traction out of their one-year existence The US Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF were only approved and launched last year. If the SEC approves all the filed applications for crypto ETFs, there will be more than a dozen crypto ETFs in 2025. Cryptocurrency enjoyed a good ride in 2024, with Bitcoin growing more than 120% to trade above $100,000. The surge could be attributed to the US President-elect, Donald Trump, who has openly embraced cryptocurrency. The Trump administration is expected to loosen its regulatory stance regarding crypto, making digital assets grow accordingly. The excitement surrounding Trump’s election helped to push annual inflows for the biggest Bitcoin ETF . BlackRock rose above $37 billion for the year, ranking third among all funds. Corporates are using a mix of new equity and sales of convertible bonds to buy more crypto Some of the strategies that may dominate 2025 began last year. For instance, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor leveraged the surging crypto prices to double down on his Bitcoin purchase tactics, acquiring large tokens for its company reserve. The firm has used both new equity and sales of convertible bonds to help sponsor its crypto buying. Other entities have also laid down plans for their firms based on MicroStrategy’s style. Fillings from REX ETF indicate that the firm wants to invest most of its assets in convertible bonds from companies that deal in Bitcoin. Also, according to paperwork filed last week, Strive is proposing to launch a fund that invests in derivatives such as swaps and options to get exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy or other companies with similar investment strategies.

This makes the Southeast Asian giant the latest addition to the coalition of emerging economies, which now consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, alongside newer members like Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Indonesia had been eyeing the group for years, pushing to become part of its mission to challenge Western-dominated systems and amplify the voice of the Global South. The approval came in 2023 during the BRICS summit in Johannesburg, but Indonesia, waiting for political stability after its presidential elections, delayed formalizing its membership. Now, with President Prabowo Subianto in charge since October, the timing finally lined up. BRICS grows stronger with Indonesia on board BRICS has been on an expansion spree. Together, the countries represent 37.3% of global GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) and are home to over 3.3 billion people. With Indonesia in the fold, BRICS now boasts some of the fastest-growing economies on the planet, along with a ton of political and economic clout. Indonesia’s economy is valued at over $1 trillion, and its role in trade, manufacturing, and natural resources makes it a valuable player for the bloc. Adding to this, Indonesia has been vocal about its support for BRICS’ goals of reforming global governance systems. The statement from Brazil summed it up like this: “Indonesia contributes positively to the deepening of cooperation in the Global South.” The de-dollarization agenda BRICS has been working overtime on de-dollarization, to cut ties with the U.S. dollar in trade and financial transactions. One major piece of the puzzle is the “BRICS Bridge,” a blockchain-powered payment system in development. Think of it as an alternative to SWIFT, designed to allow member countries to settle trade using their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). For BRICS, blockchain is a weapon. You see, they’re considering creating a new reserve currency, the “Unit,” backed by a basket of member currencies and possibly gold. India has already been leading the charge in local currency trade agreements. The country has sealed deals with 22 nations, allowing trade in domestic currencies instead of the dollar. This strategy has picked up steam as sanctions on countries like Russia push them to look for financial workarounds. Still, there’s a long road ahead. Critics say the dollar’s dominance isn’t going to crumble overnight, no matter how hard BRICS tries. Internal issues like fluctuating currencies, economic disparities, and logistical challenges could slow the pace. But BRICS doesn’t seem to care. Putin, Trump, and BRICS Here’s where things get even messier. Vladimir Putin’s Russia has been one of the loudest voices in BRICS, pushing hard for de-dollarization. But now there’s a new wildcard on the table: Donald Trump. His return to the U.S. presidency is expected to shake things up, especially for Russia’s economic plans and BRICS’ overall strategy. Let’s break it down. Trump’s administration has always been unpredictable when it comes to Russia. While there’s speculation that Trump might seek to cool tensions with Moscow, many in his camp favor tougher sanctions. If Trump doubles down on economic warfare, it could isolate Russia from Western financial systems even more, making BRICS’ de-dollarization efforts even more critical. For Putin, BRICS is a lifeline. Russia’s economy has been battered by sanctions, with inflation soaring to nearly 30% last year and the ruble losing 33% of its value since August 2024. Oil revenues, once the backbone of Russia’s economy, have plummeted. Daily earnings from fossil fuels have halved since 2022, while Ukraine’s decision to cut off transit rights for Russian gas to Europe has cost Moscow another $5 billion annually. Despite these setbacks, Russia has been doubling down on BRICS. For the rest of BRICS, the dynamic between Trump and Putin matters. If Russia faces tighter sanctions, it could accelerate BRICS’ push for alternative financial systems. On the flip side, if Trump opens up new opportunities for Russia, it could give the bloc more breathing room to focus on its long-term goals.

The company announced earlier today that it has reached a $5 million settlement. This ends allegations that Gemini misled regulators during its bid to launch America’s first Bitcoin futures contract. This settlement is part of the ongoing conflict between the crypto industry and regulators. It reflects the changing policies influenced by shifting political climates. Gemini’s Regulatory Hurdles: A Case of Misrepresentation? The controversy dates back to 2017 when Gemini Trust submitted proposals to the CFTC to launch future contracts for Bitcoin. However ,the CFTC alleged that Gemini misrepresented critical safeguards to prevent price manipulation. These safeguards were supposed to form the backbone of a trusted financial product, yet the regulator argued Gemini fell short of expectations. Fast forward to January 2025, just weeks before a trial was set to unravel in Manhattan federal court , Gemini and the CFTC struck a deal. Gemini agreed to pay $5 million to settle the claims, neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. This settlement underscores the legal tightrope walked by crypto firms aiming to push boundaries while facing increasing scrutiny. Ripple Effects in the Crypto Landscape Gemini’s settlement coincides with broader regulatory movements, including the high-profile Ripple SEC case. Former SEC enforcement lawyer Marc Fagel recently predicted a possible settlement in the ongoing lawsuit against Ripple . He pointed to the incoming Trump administration, which is expected to take a more industry-friendly approach. As SEC Chair Paul Atkins prepares to take the reins, many expect regulatory leniency to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has already attributed a surge in U.S. business activity to what he dubbed the “ Trump effect .” In a recent X post, he shared that 75% of Ripple’s hiring is now U.S.-based. This shift is driven by a surge in domestic deals following Trump’s election victory. Ripple’s newly launched RLUSD stablecoin has also gained prominence, surpassing competitors like PYUSD and EURC in trading volume. Biden’s Legacy vs. Trump’s Crypto Promise The settlement is an important moment in the broader narrative of U.S. crypto regulation. Under President Biden, more actions were taken against crypto companies, showing a tougher approach to market rules. The Gemini case was one of many, as regulators worked to ensure fairness and prevent abuse in the growing crypto market. However, with President Trump returning to office, regulations may change. Known for supporting the industry, Trump’s administration is expected to be more lenient with crypto rules.

Why Are Pengu and Meme Coins Facing Fierce Competition,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/1fuel-or-dogecoin-why-are-pengu-and-meme-coins-facing-fierce-competition,"Meme coins have long been driven by internet hype, but now they are facing increasing competition from utility tokens like 1Fuel in the crypto space. Some top meme coins are Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), but they are now overshadowed by 1Fuel. 1Fuel is now in its presale stage, and allows investors to purchase the OFT token at a very low price before the value goes up by 100x in 2025. But why is 1Fuel a strong competitor to these meme coins? Continue reading to learn why 1Fuel is attracting the attention of savvy investors. Meme Coins Face Strong Competition in the Crypto Space Dogecoin, known as the largest meme coin by market cap, has seen an impressive growth. It is currently valued at $0.3877, which is a major 383.87% increase from 2024. Similarly, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has reached a value of $0.04211. The value skyrocketed by an impressive 742.40% in 2024 alone. There’s a lot of optimism around DOGE investors since analysts predict it would reach the $1 mark. As for PENGU, its predictions go between $0.086 and $0.1 by the end of the year. Both tokens are easily stored on well-known platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Despite their impressive growth potential, meme coins like DOGE and PENGU face strong competition from utility tokens in the crypto space. These meme coins rely heavily on social media trends and internet hype, which do not provide sustainable long-term growth. Due to this, smart investors consider utility tokens as top cryptocurrencies to invest in. Why 1Fuel Offers an Edge in DeFi Innovation 1Fuel OFT is one of the tokens challenging the dominance of meme coins in the crypto space. One of 1Fuel’s top features is its cross-chain transaction capability, which allows you to easily interact with different blockchain networks from a single wallet. This makes it stand out from other top platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. 1Fuel is highly committed to user privacy, as it features an inbuilt mixer that keeps all transactions confidential. This is unlike many platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, which offer limited privacy features. With these innovations, 1Fuel is quickly becoming one of the top utility tokens in the market, setting the stage for long-term growth. Investors Rush to Secure 1Fuel from its Presale As meme coins like DOGE and PENGU face increased competition, investors are turning their attention to 1Fuel . It is now in its presale stage and offering the token at its lowest-ever price of $0.012. With the presale already surpassing the $1 million mark and over 114 million tokens sold in record time, it’s clear that investors are highly confident in the token’s future. The presale’s rapid success speaks volume about investor enthusiasm, making it one of the top utility tokens. With its DEX wallet features standing out among platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, 1Fuel has become a standard tool for interacting with blockchains. The Crypto Space Leans Towards from 1Fuel As the 1Fuel live presale progresses, more and more investors are taking advantage of this opportunity to secure their stake before its public release. The crypto space is leaning towards 1Fuel, and investors can take advantage of this enticing opportunity before it's too late.

The swap will shift the stablecoin from other blockchains to Tron network to improve the communication between the supported chains. Details of the Tether USDT Chain Swap to Tron Network On January 6, Tether revealed via its X account that it is coordinating with a top third-party exchange to move $1 billion worth of USDT. The swap will involve transferring a portion of the stablecoin held in cold wallets to the Tron blockchain. Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, is currently available on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. The issuer clarified that the process will not alter the total USDT supply but will ensure that liquidity is optimized across various networks. This mechanism enables traders and users to leverage their assets on any blockchain supported by the crypto firm. Meanwhile, the stablecoin issuer recently joined the bandwagon of firms increasing their Bitcoin reserves, adding 7,629 BTC worth $705.25 million. The funds, transferred from Bitfinex after nine months of dormancy, bring Tether’s total Bitcoin holdings to 82,983 BTC. Acquired for $2.99 billion, these holdings are now valued at $7.68 billion, reflecting its growing Bitcoin strategy. USDT’s Dominance in the Stablecoin Market Furthermore, USDT remains on top of the list in the stablecoin market cap with a value of more than $137 billion. Its main application areas are in payment systems, trading, and cross-border transactions . The stablecoin has recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $107 billion, a 69% jump in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, the second popular stablecoin, the USDC, has a market cap of $45.8 billion and a daily trading volume of $7.7 billion. However, Tether’s stability pegged to the U.S. dollar has made it an essential tool for traders in the crypto market. Nonetheless, despite the growing dominance, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has accused Tether of market manipulation following its recent 7,629 BTC purchase. Schiff claimed that the stablecoin issuer mints USDT “out of thin air” to acquire Bitcoin, likening it to quantitative easing. While Tether backs USDT with reserves and conducts audits, Schiff continues to question its practices. Role of Chain Swaps in the Crypto Ecosystem Chain swaps play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by enabling seamless asset transfers between blockchains. This allows users to access liquidity and trading opportunities across multiple blockchains, enhancing market efficiency. The stablecoin issuer decision to facilitate a chain swap to Tron underscores its commitment to maintaining liquidity across supported networks. The Tron blockchain remains one of the primary platforms for USDT, driving substantial trading activity. However, despite its dominance, the stablecoin issuer has not been without some challenges. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, proposed in December last year, has impacted the stablecoin market directly.

Per the South Korean media outlet NoCut News , a branch of the Daegu District Court found the group guilty of violating the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information, the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act, and obstructing business. ‘Kimchi Premium’ Crypto Trading Gang Jailed None of the gang’s names were released for legal reasons. But a man referred to as “A” (age 43), was identified as the group’s ringleader. The court jailed him for three and a half years. The presiding judge sentenced another defendant to two years and two months in prison. Kimchi premium prices (Bitcoin) at the time of writing. (Source: Cryprice) The presiding judge jailed a third individual for two years. The group’s final member was given a suspended 18-month sentence and ordered to perform 160 hours of community service. The Daegu District Court also handed out fines, including an “approximately 3 billion won” (over $2 million) bill for A. The judge also ordered the group to pay legal and other “additional” fees. Prosecutors told the court that the group worked with “investors” in Japan. They took tokens from Japan-based vendors and resold them in South Korea to “make a profit.” They did this at a time when the “ kimchi premium ” was at a periodic high, prosecutors said. The kimchi premium is a phenomenon whereby high retail demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins leads to tokens trading on South Korean exchanges at much higher prices than on international platforms. At its highest point (circa 2020-2021), the premium rose above the 35% mark.

The court heard that the group “received approximately 27 billion won [$18.5 million] in return” for its services.

Recently, Cardano recorded 20 million transactions in just two days, highlighting its robust scalability. Predictions are also favorable for Stellar, with an expected 471% rise in a bullish market scenario. BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves with the buzz around its cinematic-style Keynote 3, rumored to be in collaboration with a notable Hollywood producer. As an emerging foundational blockchain project, BlockDAG has accumulated over $176 million from its presale, paving the way with significant technological leaps. As the year 2024 winds down, these cryptocurrencies are certainly ones to keep an eye on. Here’s a deeper look at what makes them stand out. What’s Behind Cardano’s 20M Transactions Surge? Ranked ninth globally by market cap, Cardano (ADA) has experienced substantial activity, recording over 20 million transactions in the past two days. Factors such as Cardano’s advances in decentralized governance, especially CIP-1694, may be influencing this surge. Notably, Intersect recently moved the Plomin hard fork governance proposal to the ratification stage, signaling a step forward in Cardano’s on-chain governance. As 2024 concludes, the spike in Cardano transactions signals a robust interest, potentially driving more accumulation as ADA’s price increases from $0.887 after a minor dip to $0.85. Stellar’s Market Outlook: Anticipating a 471% Jump Stellar’s (XLM) market trajectory looks promising, with analysts forecasting a significant 471% increase, based on Fibonacci Extension levels in optimistic market conditions. The growth is supported by Stellar’s expanding ecosystem, including strategic partnerships and enhancements in smart contracts. Despite a recent 10% downturn bringing Stellar close to oversold conditions, it maintains a trading price of $0.3532 with a market cap of $10 billion, keeping market watchers optimistic about its potential to reach $2.12, and even $8 in highly favorable conditions. Is BlockDAG Teaming Up with a Hollywood Producer for Keynote 3? BlockDAG is gearing up for its highly anticipated Keynote 3, slated for release in 2025. This presentation is expected to break new ground, rumored to feature a cinematic collaboration with a renowned Hollywood producer. This pioneering method aims to redefine the presentation of blockchain advancements by integrating engaging storytelling with the latest technological innovations. The centerpiece of the keynote will be BlockDAG’s Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture. This cutting-edge architecture tackles the longstanding scalability challenges faced by traditional blockchains. Unlike conventional linear blockchain systems, DAG allows for more efficient transaction processing, which leads to quicker confirmation times and lower energy consumption. Moreover, BlockDAG’s compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) increases its attractiveness, enabling developers to effortlessly migrate their decentralized applications to this more advanced platform. This compatibility not only expands the ecosystem’s functionality but also attracts a broader range of developers. These groundbreaking features have significantly fueled interest in BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, which has now amassed over $176 million and sold more than 17.7 billion BDAG coins. Priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, the presale has provided an astonishing 2380% return to early participants since its inception. With these compelling figures, BlockDAG is establishing itself as a formidable leader in the cryptocurrency arena. The Crypto Coins to Keep an Eye on as 2024 Ends! As 2024 draws to a close, the crypto landscape is marked by significant achievements and promising prospects. Cardano’s transaction surge underscores its leading position, while Stellar’s market potential continues to attract bullish forecasts. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s upcoming Keynote 3, merging cinematic storytelling with cutting-edge technology, is setting a new standard for crypto presentations. Spotlighting its innovative DAG architecture and EVM compatibility, BlockDAG remains a prominent cryptocurrency to watch into 2025.

The traffic on L2 is more than 4.5 times higher than Ethereum transactions, signaling a permanent shift to scalable chains. L2 chains, led by Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, invite more than 4.5 times the traffic of Ethereum (ETH). On the main L1 chain, transactions stabilized around 1.16M, shifting toward high-value stablecoin transfers, ETH movements, and fewer swaps or NFT activities. L2 activity growth was mostly due to the effect of Base, but other top chains provided a robust baseline of transactions. | Source: GrowThePie More of the complex transactions shifted to L2, where each chain holds a specific profile. DeFi activity and liquidity from stablecoins has accumulated to Arbitrum and a handful of top chains, drawing in users for easier DEX swaps. As a result, L2 activity has posted new records for months. On a weekly basis, L2 activity passed the 10M users milestone, with just 1.96M for Ethereum on a weekly basis. Users are active in the Ethereum Ecosystem – Last weeks stats: Over 10,000,000 Addresses interacted with 1 or more Layer 2. Over 1,960,000 Addresses interacted with Ethereum Layer 1. pic.twitter.com/eMXlz3Yyk2 — growthepie.xyz 🥧📏 (@growthepie_eth) January 6, 2025 While Base remains the leader with high-speed transactions, some of the traffic remains tied to organic DEX trading and DeFi lending on the other top L2 chains. Base also gets a boost from CbBTC traffic, while also accumulating $3.49B in value locked. Stablecoins are also one of the drivers of L2 adoption. In the first days of 2025, L2 held more than $11B in bridged or native stablecoins, where Arbitrum was the leader with $6.35B. Base was in second place, with $3.5B worth of stablecoins. The rising trend reflects the strong baseline from Arbitrum, but most of the expansion still comes from Base. The chain is among the top carriers of DeFi, through its version of Uniswap and the Aerodrome high-liquidity DEX. Arbitrum is close behind based on DeFi activity, reaching $33.6M on a daily time frame. Most L2 chains slowed down significantly after the end of their airdrop mining activity. Returning to organic traffic has been a struggle for multiple chains. Base is still not officially preparing for an airdrop, though there are still expectations for a native token in the future. L2 chains grow based on specialized activities Linea, while carrying smaller traffic, remains instrumental for L2 activity in NFT swaps and decentralized social media. Optimism serves as an all-purpose utility chain, while ZKSync Era has the biggest share of simple token transfers. Arbitrum is the biggest hub for cross-chain activity, with more than $15M on a daily basis. Overall, L2 do not communicate between chains, but rely on bridging and flows to and from Ethereum. Additionally, dozens of smaller networks aim for specialized tasks, such as gaming or a specific DEX. However, newer networks may lack liquidity, and older ones may be unwilling to become interoperable. Growing L2 traffic leads to fee and block space competition The growing traffic also makes L2 more expensive, with regular spikes in rent paid to Ethereum. While the rent is small compared to Ethereum’s block production incentives, there is a shift from the previous months of near-zero payments. To compare, Base at one point paid no more than $3,000 for its activity, while a recent spike led to $93,000 in daily rent paid to Ethereum. The increased on-chain activity means chain operators may choose how to post to Ethereum. Data shows Arbitrum switches between blobs and calldata, depending on which one is cheaper at the moment. However, this L2 activity actually takes up block space on Ethereum, making regular transactions more expensive. Ethereum transactions are still more expensive at $1.10, with regular price spikes for specialized tasks. Arbitrum retains $0.09 per transaction, though even L2 are not offering virtually free transfers. However, Arbitrum swaps can go as low as $0.27, while Ethereum DEX deals can cost $21.38 without special priority or additional block-builder payments. L2 chains retain real economic activity and the top ones show robust demand. However, the L2 narrative remained subdued. A total of 127 high-profile chains were launched, each competing for either niche or mass activity.

Here’s How High ADA Could Pump in 2025,https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-to-7-80-heres-how-high-ada-could-pump-in-2025/,"The Cardano (ADA) price looks poised to pump back to its December highs in the low $1.30s, with chart analysis painting a bullish picture for ADA’s near-term outlook. Could this be the start of a new pump that could take ADA as high as $7.80? ADA was last changing hands around $1.10, having pumped over $0.25 or over 30% since the start of the year. That pump saw the Cardano price break to the north of a downtrend in play since early December, as well as back above its 21 and 50DMAs, suggestive that the bulls have retaken control of the market. Over the last few days, the ADA rally has stalled, with the Cardano price forming a range in the $1.056-$1.118 area. But with Bitcoin (BTC) having broken back above $100,000 and seemingly carrying strong momentum, the mood in the broader crypto market looks set to remain positive ahead of the arrival of the incoming Trump administration in two weeks. Trump’s administration is the most pro-crypto in history, marking a full 180-degree reversal from the anti-crypto stance of the outgoing Biden administration. That, coupled with the start of a new pro-crypto Congressional session, means crypto markets are on the cusp of entering a new golden age. Trump’s crypto Czar, David Sacks, on Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/M6fi1Y3iiL — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) December 6, 2024 Perhaps Trump’s arrival in office might be a “sell-the-news” event. But that is still two weeks away, so its very likely altcoin markets and the Cardano price could continue to rally in the upcoming sessions. Strong Year for ADA Likely Coming Most signs suggest that this crypto bull market still has plenty of room to run. Firstly, Bitcoin only just recently entered the final and most explosive phase of its four-year cycle, which typically runs between 6-18 months of the halving (which took place last April). That, combined with rapidly rising institutional adoption and the possibility of the establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve this year, should keep the world’s largest crypto pumping in 2025. But there are also signs that altcoin season has yet to really get going this cycle, of which Cardano could be a major beneficiary. Bitcoin dominance has only just recently started to show signs that it is starting to break down after breaking below a long-term uptrend. During the 2021 bull cycle, a similar breakout was the precursor for a massive altcoin season that saw assets like Cardano post massive gains. Cardano also has a bunch of narratives that could help it pump hard if a new altcoin season is right around the corner. ADA is set to pivot to becoming a Bitcoin DeFi chain as soon as May. Meanwhile, the incoming SEC Chair may back off from the outgoing anti-crypto SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s position that ADA is an unregistered security. Moreover, it’s co-founder and biggest advocate Charles Hoskinson might secure a position in the White House as an advisor to incoming President Trump , which could help bolster Cardano’s adoption in the USA.

Looks like Cardano users see polymarket as a “nice poll” pic.twitter.com/ktjq0W60KP — 竜 SM₳UG (@SmaugPool) January 6, 2025 How High Can ADA Pump This Bull Market? Many signs thus point towards Cardano pumping hard in 2025. So how high might it go? Well, during its 2020/2021 bull run, Cardano rallied to the 2.618 Fibonacci extension beyond its 2017 record highs. If it can match the same feat during this bull run, that would imply an ADA price of around $7.80. That would mean gains of almost exactly 7x from current levels. As a result, Cardano could be great candidate for best crypto to buy now . Cardano Risks to Consider That said, potential investors need to be aware of risks to the Cardano outlook. The main one is that, despite its massive market cap of around $50 billion, Cardano has very little on-chain adoption to show for it. Its TVL of crypto in smart contracts is still yet to hit $1 billion, per DeFi Llama , and compared to its major rivals (like Ethereum or Solana), Cardano lags in terms of transaction activity and dApp activity in a big way. Crypto investors are advised not to put their eggs all in one basket (unless that basket is Bitcoin!) and should consider diversifying exposure across a few different high potential altcoin plays.

This mixed reaction highlights the uncertainty surrounding the XRP price’s ability to sustain an upward trajectory, leaving investors to weigh their options carefully. As XRP price momentum slows down, savvy investors are shifting focus to RCO Finance (RCOF), an AI altcoin emerging as a Ripple rival. With its advanced AI features and a potential of 20,000x ROI, RCO Finance is a game changer in the crypto market. XRP Price Trajectory Slows Down The XRP price is changing hands at $2.48, a 1.3% rise in the past 24 hours and a 15.8% rise in the past week. The XRP price just broke out of a falling wedge, a typical bullish signal, but the breakout closed red. The impact is that it signals the XRP price isn’t gaining momentum as expected. Analysts predict that the next key level for XRP price is $2.90, aligning with a projection of an upward spiral. But, the analysts feel that the breakout strength is still in question. If the XRP price doesn’t break out of this level, it could retract to $2.00 or even $1.47, which are the critical support levels before a stronger move. RCO Finance: Emerging AI Altcoin Targeting 20,000x ROI The XRP price movement has left investors at a crossroads, as its recent breakout for a falling wedge shows bullish momentum.

This anticipated market uptick presents an excellent opportunity for strategic investments in cryptocurrencies with significant potential. Amidst a crowded field of contenders, pinpointing top crypto coins for the 2025 bull run is vital for optimizing investment outcomes. These top cryptocurrencies are notable for their cutting-edge technologies and robust community support, positioning them to excel in the rapidly evolving blockchain environment. Notably, the Web3Bay presale is at the forefront, recognized for its potential to revolutionize decentralized ecosystems. 1. Web3Bay Presale: Pioneering Decentralization The Web3Bay presale is capturing attention with its innovative approach to blockchain-based solutions. By providing decentralized tools for both users and developers, Web3Bay aims to streamline interactions within the crypto ecosystem. The success of its presale underscores significant community engagement, and the token’s increasing use across various Web3 applications could lead to considerable gains by 2025. Currently in its third presale phase, priced at $0.0039675 with $420,000 raised, Web3Bay is projected to achieve a launch price of $0.1959, offering early investors a potential ROI of 6,430%. The token’s defined applications, from NFT integrations to decentralized finance platforms, coupled with early support from key industry influencers, position Web3Bay as one of the top crypto coins for high-growth opportunities. 2. Floki (FLOKI): Beyond a Meme Coin Floki stands out in the crypto market by melding the charm of meme coins with substantial utility. Its ecosystem spans NFT marketplaces, play-to-earn gaming platforms, and educational projects. Supported by a dynamic community and strategic promotional efforts, Floki combines entertainment with investment potential, set for further expansion in the upcoming bull run. 3. Fetch.ai (FET): Bridging AI with Blockchain Fetch.ai is a leader in merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its platform enables autonomous agents to enhance efficiency in various sectors, including supply chain, finance, and transportation. With the global rise in AI adoption, Fetch.ai’s capacity to deliver scalable and efficient solutions makes it a prime candidate for the 2025 bull run. Developments in Fetch.ai’s partnerships and ecosystem expansion are closely monitored by investors. 4. Immutable (IMX): Advancing NFT Gaming Immutable has become a significant player in NFT gaming and blockchain gaming infrastructure. Its Layer 2 scaling solution facilitates seamless NFT transactions, essential for both developers and gamers. As the gaming and metaverse sectors continue to grow, Immutable’s technology will likely play a vital role in their success. Its partnerships with prominent gaming studios and platforms further bolster its prospects for 2025. 5. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Evolving from Meme to Utility Shiba Inu has evolved from a mere meme coin to a utility-rich ecosystem supported by the Shibarium blockchain. It encompasses decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, and staking mechanisms, attracting a broad base of retail investors. Its accessible price point and active community base make it a popular choice for rapid gains during bullish periods. The 2025 bull run could propel SHIB to new heights as its ecosystem continues to mature. Why These Cryptos Are Noteworthy Robust Use Cases: Each listed cryptocurrency delivers unique advantages through its use cases in AI, gaming, or decentralized finance. Community Engagement: Projects like Floki and Shiba Inu exemplify how a strong, active community can foster growth and adoption. Potential for Appreciation: The promising presale of Web3Bay and the AI-driven capabilities of Fetch.ai highlight their potential for substantial returns, making them top crypto coins for the bull run. Portfolio Preparation Strategies Sector Diversification: Incorporate tokens from diverse sectors like gaming (Immutable), AI (Fetch.ai), and meme coins (Floki, Shiba Inu). Early Investments: Engaging in presales such as Web3Bay’s can lead to significant rewards. Continuous Monitoring: Remain informed about the latest developments, partnerships, and market trends for each project. Key Insights The 2025 crypto bull run offers substantial opportunities for gains, yet careful asset selection remains essential. Investing in Web3Bay’s presale, Fetch.ai’s AI capabilities, Floki’s vibrant ecosystem, Immutable’s gaming innovations, and Shiba Inu’s utility-focused growth stand out as top crypto coins.

After announcing late last year that it had purchased ¥1 billion worth of Bitcoins, the Japanese company is making headlines again by announcing its plans to increase its holdings to 10,000 Bitcoins. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Hit $1? Expert Calls It A Realistic Goal For 2025 – Here’s Why Metaplanet’s decision to double down on the world’s top digital asset comes during favorable political and economic conditions, with analysts expecting that Bitcoin may hit $200k soon. Currently, Metaplanet boasts 1,762 Bitcoins, worth $173.4 million, and is one of the top companies following MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investing playbook. CEO Announces Target Of 10k Bitcoins CEO Simon Gerovich shared the company’s latest investment plan in a New Year post for shareholders. In a Twitter/X post last January 5th, Gerovick acknowledged the company’s exceptional performance, where it expanded its Bitcoin holdings and solidified its standing as the region’s biggest holder of digital assets. In the lengthy message, he reiterated the company’s commitment to the asset and boosting shareholder value. Happy New Year to Our Valued Shareholders! As we step into 2025, I couldn’t be more excited about what lies ahead for Metaplanet. Last year was transformational, as we broke records, expanded our Bitcoin treasury, and reinforced our position as Asia’s leading Bitcoin Treasury… pic.twitter.com/K2HsOS8TaZ — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) January 5, 2025 Gerovick announced at least four targets for Metaplanet this year. The company’s primary target is to expand its BTC holdings to 10k Bitcoin. In addition, Metaplanet also plans to boost transparency, leverage partnerships to promote Bitcoin adoption and explore other innovative opportunities that can grow the company’s influence in the Bitcoin and blockchain niche. Investing Plans Come At A Time Of Favorable Conditions The Japanese company’s aggressive moves into the crypto space come during favorable market conditions and better price prospects. Both Bitwise and VanEck predict that Bitcoin will trade anywhere from $180k to $200k this year. They believe that the top digital asset can trade at higher price points if the US government approves the plan to adopt the strategic digital asset reserve. Other analysts are offering bolder price predictions for Bitcoin and potentially better performance from altcoins thanks to a second Trump administration. According to Gerovich, if the US government pushes with the Bitcoin strategic reserves, then others can follow suit. Metaplanet’s CEO added that Japan is one of the first countries to follow, and other Asian countries will implement the same initiative. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Reveals Bold Dogecoin Price Prediction For 2025 Starting A Movement In the same post, Gerovich describes the company’s initiative as a “movement” anchored on its commitment to excellence. He then teases his followers, saying that 2025 will be another breakout year for Metaplanet in terms of innovation, progress, and success. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings are currently the biggest in Asia and 15th among global public companies. The company first started investing in Bitcoin last year, as Bitcoin surged considerably due to increased institutional adoption.

The attackers reportedly targeted him, falsely believing he possessed an immense amount of Bitcoin. The incident has left the man and his family in a precarious situation as they move from one temporary residence to another, fearing for their safety. Crypto Forum Moderator Targeted in Bitcoin Kidnapping The alleged incident, which took place in November 2024, started when two masked people allegedly got close to the Crypto forum’s house. As per the statement , the suspects escaped from the scene after the man closed the door on them. A few days later, the victim saw the masked men in an unmarked vehicle near his house while he was taking his child to daycare. The suspects are said to have followed the man onto a main road. When the situation worsened, he was on the phone with the police when the suspect vehicle turned and three of its occupants escaped on foot. Shortly after, the driver of the vehicle reportedly came out and confronted the victim, and another suspect brandished a firearm. The man stated that he used bear spray as a way of protecting himself from the suspects until the police came in to arrest the duo. Claims of Torture Equipment Discovered In the report, the Crypto forum moderator stated that the suspects intended to kidnap and torture him in order to get his cryptocurrency. The police investigations suggested that the attackers thought he had 2.5 million Bitcoins worth billions of dollars because he was a moderator of a cryptocurrency Facebook group. ‘The guys had equipment to torture me,’ the man said to La Presse. They had a tarp with a hole in the middle and claws to cut off a limb and stop the bleeding. It’s incredibly violent.” The victim claimed that his actual BTC investment was $10,000 which is like 0.1 of a Bitcoin as per current price. Suspects Released on House Arrest Four suspects, two of which are adults and two are juveniles, were taken into custody in relation to the event. The adults are to be charged with conspiracy to kidnap and use of prohibited firearms. However, all these four suspects were released on house arrest to await their trial that is set to commence in March. The release of the suspects has been a matter of concern to the family of the Crypto forum moderator since there is a possibility of their attack. The family was told by the authorities that they should move away from the area saying that the suspects could be linked to organised crime. The family has since been transferring from one short term lease house to another in an effort to flee any danger. A representative of Quebec’s provincial police, Sûreté du Québec stated that although the police offer guidance to victims, they cannot offer round the clock protection. ”We do not advise people to change their address but it is one of the measures we are considering, the other ones are to change the locks or to install cameras and alarms,” the spokesperson said. Despite this, the victim has expressed frustration over the suspects’ release, stating it has forced his family into hiding. “The police told us they can’t ensure our safety,” he said, adding that his family has been burning through their savings to stay safe. The man also revealed that the Youth Protection Department (DPJ) became involved after rumors of the incident spread at his children’s school.

From quirky characters to wild community-driven hype, these coins are about fun, innovation, and serious profits. Today, we’re diving into three of the best new meme coins to join now: BTFD Coin , Dogs, and Pudgy Penguins. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or someone just getting your feet wet, these coins capture attention for all the right reasons. The rise of meme coins has been nothing short of spectacular. They started as jokes but have become legitimate investment opportunities with massive communities. Coins like Dogecoin paved the way, showing that humour and community spirit can have a real monetary value. Now, BTFD Coin is leading the next wave, combining meme magic with robust financial benefits like a 90% APY on staking . Let’s talk about BTFD Coin—it’s a game-changer. Its presale has already raised over $5 million and is only just starting. Meanwhile, Dogs and Pudgy Penguins are creating their own buzz, proving that the meme coin craze is far from over. Keep reading to find out why these coins are worth your attention. BTFD Coin: Staking Your Way to Unmatched Gains BTFD Coin is shaking up the meme coin market with a killer mix of humor and real financial perks. Forget about coins that only make you laugh; this one’s stacking up real gains. If you haven’t heard, the presale is in its 13th stage , with the coin priced at $0.000142. Over 62 billion BTFD coins have been sold to 7,700+ holders, and there’s no slowing down. The standout feature? That 90% APY on staking. Imagine earning nearly double your investment by simply staking your coins. Crypto enthusiasts are flocking to this project because it offers a rare way to blend the meme coin hype with serious long-term rewards. Analysts predict BTFD Coin could skyrocket once it hits major exchanges, and the current presale price might seem like peanuts compared to its future value. You put $1,000 into BTFD Coin during its current presale at $0.000142 per coin. That gives you roughly 7,042,254 coins. Imagine the price skyrocketing to $0.0006 after the presale—a totally realistic possibility considering the coin’s momentum and the buzz driving it. Dogs: Man’s Best Friend, Now Crypto’s Best Bet Dogs are stealing the spotlight in the meme coin universe. Whether you’re talking about loyalty, cuteness, or viral potential, this coin has all the elements to charm its way into your wallet. Dogs, inspired by our four-legged companions, combines heartwarming branding with community-driven momentum. Its recent social media campaigns have exploded, pushing the coin’s value higher. Recent developments have further solidified Dogs’ position in the crypto market. In August 2024, Dogs was listed on Binance’s Launchpool, significantly boosting its trading volume and market visibility. This listing allowed users to stake their Binance Coin (BNB) and other tokens to farm Dogs, increasing accessibility and driving adoption. Although its price reached an all-time high of $0.001633, it has since stabilised around $0.000565 as of January 2025, reflecting broader market trends. The Dogs project continues to focus on community engagement, leveraging social media platforms to build a loyal following. Its upcoming plans for NFT collaborations and charitable donations to animal shelters highlight its commitment to making an impact beyond just financial gains. This combination of utility and heartwarming branding sets Dogs apart in a crowded field. Imagine waking up one morning to see your Dogs investment doubling or tripling. It’s happened with other meme coins, and there’s no reason Dogs can’t follow suit. The buzz is real, and the community support is massive. If you’re a dog lover with a penchant for smart investments, Dogs might be your perfect match. Pudgy Penguins: The Coolest Meme Coin on Ice Pudgy Penguins has become a standout in the meme coin space, combining charm and bold strategy to capture the public’s imagination. The project’s native token, PENGU, has grown 13% on January 5 and marked a staggering 250% increase since its December 17 launch. Trading at $0.040 with a market cap of $2.5 billion, PENGU is a testament to the power of a well-executed meme coin. But it’s not just the numbers grabbing attention. Pudgy Penguins’ marketing strategies are breaking new ground. With over 1.1 billion GIF and sticker views in just the first five days of January, the project’s viral campaigns on Instagram and TikTok have helped propel it to new heights. The team’s approach—leveraging humour, nostalgia, and community spirit—has made Pudgy Penguins a household name in the crypto world. Despite the buzz, some large holders are cashing out, taking advantage of the rally. On January 4, a wallet withdrew 84 million PENGU tokens, worth $3.13 million, from Binance. Meanwhile, NFT sales have dipped by 52% in the past week, reflecting a broader cooling trend. Still, Pudgy Penguins remains the second-largest NFT collection by market cap at $721 million, trailing only CryptoPunks. Looking ahead, PENGU is poised for further growth. Operating on Solana, with plans to expand to Ethereum and Abstract, an Ethereum layer-2 solution, the token’s potential use cases include governance and access to exclusive ecosystem perks. With a total supply of 88.88 billion tokens, 25.9% of which are allocated to NFT holders via airdrops, Pudgy Penguins continues to innovate and capture attention. PENGU’s blend of utility and charm makes it one of the best new meme coins to join now. Whether you’re drawn by its viral marketing, NFT pedigree, or long-term potential, Pudgy Penguins is a project worth watching. Conclusion: The Time to Join is Now BTFD Coin, Dogs, and Pudgy Penguins are hands down the best new meme coins to join now. Each offers something unique—whether it’s BTFD’s incredible 90% APY on staking, Dogs’ charitable edge, or Pudgy Penguins’ metaverse dreams.

The token’s delay, which at first was attributed to the fundraising, such as the $12 million venture capital round in April 2024 for the Layer-3 privacy blockchain, created some confusion. However, the Shiba Inu team has recently announced that the token will not be launched to the public before January 14. Despite the official confirmation, misinformation has been circulating. A user known as CryptoMumms posted that the TREAT token had already been launched in January of 2023. This claim and the fake TREAT token have led to a lot of confusion among the Shiba Inu community. Treat did not stealth launch years ago. This simply isn't true. — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) January 5, 2025 This fake token is currently operating on ShibaSwap through the wallet contract address “0xFBD…146B” and has been misleading people about its existence. DEXTools shows that its market capitalization is $2.86 million; however, the Shiba Inu team has confirmed that this is not the real TREAT token. Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous leader of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, also addressed these allegations in public. He pointed out that TREAT has not been launched and asked the community not to interact with this fake token. On X, Kusama posted a video that was quite comedic in nature and showed how pointless the entire thing was. He further backed up the message with a caution to avoid falling for such narratives. TREAT’s role in Shiba Inu’s ecosystem The TREAT token is essential for Shiba Inu’s vision of becoming fully decentralized. After its launch, it will enable governance, rewards, and real-world use within the ecosystem. Kusama said that the token is a “capstone and key” to Shiba Inu’s future and plans to explain the details in his weekly podcast. TREAT will also support WOOF Wars: Farming 2.0, a sophisticated yield farming system where users will be able to increase their profits. Using veTREAT (vote escrowed TREAT), holders will be able to participate in the governance process. While liquidity providers will get extra rewards. This system is meant to enhance the decentralization of the Shiba Inu network so that its holders can decide on the future of the coin. Besides governance, TREAT will be incorporated into SHIB Pay, an on-chain payment system. This will allow users to make payments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem without involving conventional processors and with the help of blockchain verification. The Shiba Inu team has revealed that TREAT will be instrumental in the future of the crypto-commerce revolution. As of the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002401, a 1% uptrend in the last 24 hours. The token has risen by nearly 10% since the beginning of the year. The Shiba Inu has four tokens in its ecosystem: SHIB, LEASH, BONE, and TREAT.

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 00:33:00

The report also shared that Bitcoin still dominated the crypto exchange-traded funds, accounting for about $573 million of the Bitcoin assets under management in global ETP s . Butterfield further noted in the report that global crypto ETPs recorded about $44.4 billion in net inflows in 2024. CoinShares explained that Bitcoin ETPs dominated the digital asset investment products markets in 2024, accounting for about 29% and $38 billion of all BTC assets under management in global ETPs. Ethereum ETPs came in second, accounting for about $4.5 billion of global crypto ETP inflows last year, accounting for about 26% of all Ethereum assets under management global ETPs. The value was also about 60x more than Ethereum inflows recorded in the ETPs in 2023 and 2.4x more than what was recorded in 2021. Other altcoins registered net inflows of $813 million in 2024, accounting for 18% of all non-ETH altcoin assets under management in crypto investment products. Solana was among the top coins among the other altcoins, recording a $69 million inflow in 2024 and 4% of its total assets under management. The total inflows recorded in 2024 increased above the all-time high experienced in the 2021 bull market. Global crypto investment products reached over $10 billion in net inflows in 2021. The 2024 statistics indicate an over 4x increase compared to the 2021 values. U.S. spot ETFs contribute to the 2024 surge 2024 saw US$44bn inflows in to crypto ETPs, 2025 off to a good start with US$585m inflows so far https://t.co/OczGDBUdph — James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) January 6, 2025 Butterfield attributed the surge in 2024’s global crypto investment products net inflows to the introduction of spot ETFs in the U.S. in January 2024. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 10 and 8 Ether spot ETFs on May 22. The Bitcoin ETFs have accounted for a greater percentage of the inflows recorded since their introduction in 2024. The report highlighted that inflows recorded by digital asset investment products were solely from U.S.-based spot ETFs. The CoinShares head of research explained that the surge in U.S. spot ETFs indicates the products’ impact on other crypto investment products. Butterfield also revealed that the ETFs would change the path crypto investment flows took in the future. The asset management firm’s executive also touched on the recent resurgence seen by Ethereum ETFs at the end of 2024. The ETFs had seen significant outflows before rebounding within the last days of the year. Butterfield suggested that the recovery indicated ETH’s evolution in the digital assets market. CoinShares’ statistics for this year’s net flows indicate that U.S. spot ETFs are still the top performers in the ETP industry. The report also showed that Australia and Switzerland are still showing promise, with about $1.1 million and $8.4 million in inflows, respectively. Galaxy Digital expects U.S. Bitcoin spot ETPs to hit $250 billion in 2025 A Galaxy Digital report from December 31, 2024, predicted the possible trajectory of U.S. spot ETPs in 2025. The report suggested that the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETPs would hit $250 billion in assets under management in 2025. Alex Thorne, Head of Firmwide Research, highlighted in the report that the ETPs were about 19% and $24 billion away from reaching the U.S. gold ETPs. Throne also predicted that Bitcoin would be among the top-performing assets this year. The head of Firmwide Research revealed that the coin remained one of the top 3 performers on a risk-adjusted basis. Thorne further mentioned that his predictions were based on 2024’s Bitcoin and BTC ETPs performances. Another analyst, Christine Kim, revealed that Ether spot ETPs would also likely surge in 2025. According to Kim, the ETPs might get the opportunity to stake some of their Ether for investors. The analyst suggested that the development would come due to possible regulatory changes under Donald Trump’s administration.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 306,000 followers on the social media platform X that DOGE appears to be in the early stages of a new five-wave rally on the 12-hour chart. The trader follows Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave surge before entering an ABC-wave correction. Says Bluntz, “Monster DOGE move overnight, now looking undeniably impulsive again, in my opinion. The move back up to fresh highs above $0.50 is probably underway.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Dogecoin will hit prices above $0.60 before its fifth-wave rally comes to a close. The analyst is also keeping an eye on the Dogecoin versus Bitcoin (DOGE/ BTC ) trading pair. Bluntz says the chart tells him that DOGE will outperform BTC before the bull market expires. “DOGE/BTC ratio is basically still accumulating. There is not a snowball’s chance in hell this isn’t going significantly higher by the end of the cycle.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.379. As for Ethereum, Bluntz says ETH looks bullish on both the USD and BTC trading pairs. According to the analyst, Ethereum may be flashing signals suggesting that its relative underperformance is now a thing of the past. “Solid two-week range breakout on ETH here with a nice higher low being put in on ETH/BTC high timeframe. Clowning on ETH is easy and fun until it isn’t.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $3,618.

However, as XRP establishes itself in the crypto market, other projects like Stellar (XLM) and the nascent RCO Finance (RCOF) are beginning to mirror this success, offering potentially lucrative alternatives for those looking to diversify their investment portfolios beyond XRP. Stellar (XLM) Mirrors XRP Price Amid Shared Focus The trajectory of both XRP and Stellar (XLM) has been fascinating, especially in the context of their shared focus on facilitating fast, cost-effective cross-border payments. XRP, having navigated through regulatory challenges, saw a robust recovery in 2024, with its price climbing due to increased adoption and partnerships with financial institutions. This trend has not only solidified XRP’s position but has also paved the way for other blockchain solutions like Stellar to gain traction. Stellar, with its mission to democratize financial services globally, is showing similar patterns of growth. After a period of consolidation, Stellar’s XLM has started to see upward momentum, driven by strategic partnerships and the expansion of its network’s capabilities. Analysts suggest that this momentum could be a precursor to XLM catching up with XRP’s price performance, as both cater to similar use cases in the financial sector but with nuanced approaches towards inclusivity and transaction speed. RCO Finance Presale on the Brink of Completion RCO Finance (RCOF) , entering the crypto scene with its AI-powered financial platform, is currently in the fourth stage of its presale , with only one stage remaining before the token is listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. The presale has already seen the RCOF token price jump by 509% from its initial price to $0.07770, indicating strong investor interest and confidence in its future prospects. This surge reflects the market’s anticipation of RCO Finance’s potential to replicate the success of established projects like Ripple’s XRP. As the presale concludes, the token price is expected to rise by another 175% to $0.21420 in the bonus round, setting the stage for a listing price between $0.4 and $0.6. This trajectory suggests that early investors could see significant returns if the project delivers on its promises. The Innovative Features Poised to Send RCOF’s Value to the Moon The excitement around RCO Finance (RCOF) doesn’t just stem from its presale performance but is deeply rooted in the innovative features of its upcoming RCO Finance platform. RCO Finance aims to revolutionize investment by providing an AI-driven Robo Advisor that tailors investment strategies to individual user profiles, analyzing market data in real time to optimize portfolios. This level of personalization and automation is expected to drive the RCOF price upwards once the platform launches. Moreover, RCO Finance will offer access to over 120,000 assets across various classes, including tokenized real-world assets, which opens up investment opportunities previously inaccessible to many. In addition, the platform boosts a no-KYC policy, which further enhances user privacy, making it appealing to those prioritizing anonymity in financial dealings. Additionally, the security is bolstered by the fact that the smart contract has already been audited by SolidProof , ensuring that potential vulnerabilities are addressed before the platform’s full release. This blend of innovation, security, and user-centric features positions RCO Finance to potentially soar in value, offering a compelling alternative to XRP for those looking for the next big wave in cryptocurrency investments. In sum, while XRP continues to lead in the cross-border payment space, Stellar (XLM) and RCO Finance (RCOF) are not far behind, each carving out their niche with unique offerings that could very well mirror, if not exceed, the gains seen in Ripple’s 2024 rally.

This phase introduces an upgraded staking web app and focuses on testing new functionalities within the Babylon Proof-of-Stake chain. The testnet emphasizes interoperability and collaboration among key protocol participants. Key Features of The Babylon Phase-2 Testnet According to a recent blog post , the Babylon Phase-2 testnet will include a Proof-of-Stake chain secured by both Bitcoin PoS stakes and Signet Bitcoin stakes. This will incorporate both existing stakes from Phase-1 and newly created ones. Participants can register their Phase-1 stakes using the upgraded staking web app, which goes live at 10 AM UTC on January 8. The new testnet will allow developers, stakers, and other participants explore the registration of Phase-1 Signet Bitcoin stakes for Phase-2 operations. The testnet encourages collaboration among stakers, wallets, and developers by supporting the deployment of permissionless smart contracts. However, the tokens involved in this testnet are simulated and hold no monetary value. Moreover, it is important to note that BOB recently integrated with Babylon to leverage Bitcoin finality for securing transactions. This integration uses Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to enhance Bitcoin liquidity in DeFi while retaining the robust security of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Faucets and Testnet Participation To enable participation, the Bitcoin staking network has provided testnet faucets for acquiring the necessary funds. The faucets will distribute test Signet Bitcoin and tBABY tokens after the testnet launch. Signet Bitcoin, available through the Discord and OKX faucets, will be used for creating new stakes. Similarly, the Discord faucet will distribute 0.3 tBABY tokens per address weekly. Additionally, the staking app enables migration of Phase-1 stakes to the Phase-2 testnet. New stakes can also be created, and the app provides fast unbonding times of approximately 16-17 hours. Staking and Validation in The Bitcoin PoS Testnet Participants in the Babylon Phase-2 testnet include stakers, finality providers, CometBFT validators, and wallets. Stakers can register stakes through the staking app or CLI tools, while finality providers ensure network security by casting finality votes. CometBFT validators participate in block production, contributing to the consensus mechanism of the Bitcoin PoS chain. In addition, stake limits for Phase-2 have been established to prevent spam and manage stake flow. Transactions require a minimum stake of 0.0005 Signet Bitcoin, with a maximum stake of 350 Signet Bitcoin per transaction. The active set size for finality providers and CometBFT validators is capped at 100 slots each.

Here’s why this could be good for the rally. Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment Has Remained Negative Recently As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment still has a red value. The “Weighted Sentiment” here refers to an indicator from the analytics firm Santiment that tells us about the dominant sentiment related to a given asset that’s present on the major social media platforms. This metric is based on two other indicators: Sentiment Balance and Social Volume. The first of these, the Sentiment Balance, calculates the net sentiment present on social media. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Make $1.08 Billion Net DOGE Purchase It works by putting the various posts/messages/threads through a machine-learning model to differentiate between positive and negative posts. Then, it takes the two counts and subtracts them to determine the net market situation. While the Sentiment Balance does provide a rough overview of social media, it may not always be the best representation of the majority of the users, as all it can do is take into account the data of the posts currently present. That is, it only says about the sentiment of the active users, regardless of whether they are actually a minority by count. To mitigate this problem and achieve more accuracy, the Weighted Sentiment incorporates the second element: the Social Volume. This indicator measures the total unique number of posts on social media that mention the cryptocurrency. Thus, by weighting the Sentiment Balance by this metric, the Weighted Sentiment ensures that its value only registers a spike (in either direction) when there is both a significant tendency towards one sentiment and a large number of users voicing said sentiment. Now, here is the chart for the Weighted Sentiment for Dogecoin shared by the analyst that shows the trend in its value over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment turned negative in December as the meme coin’s bull rally hit an obstacle, and its price reversed to the downside. The negative sentiment hasn’t changed in 2025 so far, but interestingly, the trend in the price has. Over the past week, the asset has seen a recovery rally of more than 20%. The continued bearish sentiment would imply this run hasn’t been enough to change the opinion of social media users yet. Historically, digital assets have tended to move in a way that’s opposite to the expectations of the majority. From the chart, it’s apparent that Dogecoin’s tops in November were accompanied by sharp positive spikes in the Weighted Sentiment.

Therefore, considering that the traders are pessimistic towards DOGE right now, chances may be that this latest rally could have further room to run before encountering a wall. DOGE Price Following its recovery during the last few days, Dogecoin has seen its value climb to the $387 mark.

Speaking during a recent interview, Garlinghouse cited the company’s substantial holdings of XRP, now valued at over $100 billion, as a key factor altering Ripple’s valuation outlook. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Calls $11B Valuation Outdated According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse the company now has more than $100 billion worth of XRP tokens. This development changes the valuation proposition of the blockchain infrastructure company dramatically. The CEO noted that Ripple’s trading in private markets has been much cheaper to the net asset value of the company than other companies that are linked to cryptocurrencies such as MicroStrategy. “The total value of the XRP we hold is now greater than $100 billion,” said Garlinghouse. He also compared Ripple’s valuation metrics with MicroStrategy noting that the latter trades at a premium to its assets. ”Ripple has been trading in the private markets at a discount while MicroStrategy has trading at 3x premium to its net asset value,” he said. Ripple was last valued at $11 billion in early 2024 when the company bought back $300 million worth of shares. Nevertheless, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that such an estimate is no longer relevant to the current financial position of Ripple, thanks to the increasing XRP price and institutional adoption. XRP Price Growth Attracts Attention Amid Market Trends XRP price has also seen a significant rise in value, it has risen five times its value before the election periods in late 2024. Ripple’s token has had increased liquidity and trading volume, sometimes even outperforming Bitcoin, as per data from FalconX. This upsurge is in line with other developments within the cryptocurrency market such as the high probability of a crypto ETF launch and debate on a U.S. based blockchain reserve. Crypto analyst Peter Brandt noted in his recent analysis of XRP’s technical chart that if the current bullish flag pattern would be fulfilled, XRP market cap may hit $500 billion. Furthermore, the SuperTrend indicator has just turned bullish on the XRP 12-hour chart for the first time in several months. Analyst Ali Charts pointed out that “The last time the SuperTrend indicator changed direction to the bullish side, XRP rose by 470%.” Ripple CEO Stance on Company Strategic Focus Although XRP is gaining popularity in the market, Ripple’s main business is still centered on offering blockchain technologies to financial companies. In the interview, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse restated his company’s focus on the B2B sector including banks, payment providers, and corporates, where Ripple is offering solutions like custody and cross-border payments. Recently, Ripple announced that it would launch its stablecoin called Ripple USD (RLUSD) with the license from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Garlinghouse stressed that the RLUSD will leverage XRP rather than replace it, increasing its liquidity, and opening more possibilities for the utilization of Ripple’s DEX and automated market maker (AMM) functionalities. The acquisition of Switzerland-based custody firm Metaco which was completed about 18 months ago has also put Ripple in a vantage position to offer its institutional products. The CEO was upbeat on the increased demand of the company’s custody services especially from Tier 1 banks. Changing Regulatory Environment Fuels Optimism Ripple’s growth has been supported by changing perceptions in the legal environment. Garlinghouse claimed that the previous several months marked a ‘turning point’ due to the exit of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and the chance for regulatory certainty under the new administration. As a result of the recent changes in the US government’s stance with regard to cryptocurrency innovation, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said, “The winds have changed.” Recently, he also stated that 95% of Ripple’s customers are outside the United States, but he expects the interest to return in the United States in the next few months.

The market’s buzzing with options, but picking the right project isn’t always easy. Qubetics ($TICS) , Kaspa, and Stacks are catching the attention of investors, each offering something fresh. Whether you’re drawn to blockchain development, fast transactions, or Bitcoin-powered smart contracts, there’s plenty to unpack. Qubetics is stepping in to tackle some of the pain points in Web3, creating smoother paths for developers and businesses. While many platforms offer blockchain tools, Qubetics’ approach brings everything under one roof, making development and integration less complicated. With its presale in full swing, $TICS might be worth keeping on your radar as the project moves closer to launch. Qubetics is Transforming Blockchain Development with QubeQode If you’ve been curious about blockchain but felt like the tech was too complex, Qubetics is the kind of project that flips that idea on its head. The QubeQode IDE makes it easier for anyone—whether you’re a developer or a business owner—to create blockchain applications without getting tangled up in code. Picture someone running a small online store. They could use QubeQode to add blockchain-based payment methods or authentication systems to their site without needing to hire an expert. This type of accessibility opens the door for more businesses to step into Web3, even if they don’t have the technical know-how. For larger companies, QubeQode offers ready-made tools to build advanced applications. Imagine a logistics firm wanting to use blockchain for tracking shipments. Instead of spending months developing custom software, they can leverage QubeQode’s drag-and-drop components to streamline the process. This platform isn’t just about coding—it’s about simplifying the way blockchain fits into real-world operations. On top of that, Qubetics recently announced its partnership with SWFT Blockchain to introduce a new wallet that could shake things up. This wallet will enable cross-chain transactions at lightning speed, letting users move assets seamlessly between different blockchains. Whether you’re a casual user trading crypto or a large organization managing multiple tokens, this kind of functionality could make a significant difference. Right now, Qubetics is in its 16th presale stage, and $TICS tokens are selling at $0.0455. Over 404 million tokens have already been purchased, pushing the tally beyond $8.9 million with more than 13,500 investors on board. The presale moves fast—every seven days, the price jumps by 10% as each stage ends. Analysts are projecting $TICS to hit $0.25 by the time the presale wraps up, which could lead to a 448.60% return. If $TICS hits $1, you’re looking at a 2094.42% ROI, and if things really heat up and it reaches $10 after the mainnet launch, the potential return could skyrocket to over 21844.27%. To break it down, if you invested $8.6 million today, the returns could multiply significantly depending on where $TICS lands. If you’re curious about what Qubetics brings to the table, check out the project video here . Kaspa is Winning Attention With its High-Speed, Scalable Blockchain Kaspa has been generating buzz lately for good reason. The project’s proof-of-work consensus, powered by the GHOSTDAG protocol, delivers high block rates and near-instant transaction confirmations. Unlike older blockchains that process one block at a time, Kaspa’s structure allows parallel blocks, making everything faster without compromising security. This scalability is turning heads among investors looking for tech that can keep up with growing demand. Analyst Alex Clay recently highlighted Kaspa’s strong performance, pointing out over a year of price accumulation and retracement, signaling potential growth. According to reports, whales are eyeing Kaspa as it continues to climb. This steady growth isn’t just hype—it’s backed by solid fundamentals that show Kaspa could be positioned for further gains. Kaspa’s fair launch model, with no pre-mining or early allocations, adds to its appeal for investors who prefer a level playing field. Right now, its circulating supply stands at about 25.48 billion KAS, with a cap set at 28.7 billion. This open, transparent approach has been key in building trust within the community. Kaspa’s developers frequently engage with their audience, keeping everyone in the loop on updates and improvements. Stacks is Bringing Smart Contracts to Bitcoin Stacks takes a different route by layering smart contracts on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. For years, Bitcoin has been the gold standard in crypto, but it lacked the flexibility of platforms like Ethereum that support decentralized applications. Stacks changes that by connecting directly to Bitcoin’s security, making it possible to build dApps while benefiting from Bitcoin’s robust network. The recent Nakamoto upgrade has made Stacks even faster and more secure. This upgrade enhances the platform’s speed, making it a more attractive option for developers. As a result, Stacks has been outperforming many cryptos on the market, reflecting the growing demand for Bitcoin layer-2 solutions. If you’ve been tracking STX, you’ve probably noticed its positive price movement, which speaks to increasing investor confidence. One thing developers love about Stacks is its Clarity programming language. Clarity prioritizes security and allows developers to write predictable, verifiable smart contracts—something that’s crucial in preventing bugs or vulnerabilities. This feature makes Stacks a go-to for projects that need bulletproof reliability while building within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Looking At Top Cryptos To Invest In This Year Whether you’re intrigued by Qubetics and its ambitious Web3 development platform, Kaspa’s lightning-fast blockchain, or Stacks’ innovative use of Bitcoin smart contracts, each of these projects offers a solid reason to pay attention. Qubetics is already capturing significant investment, Kaspa continues to gain traction with its high-speed performance, and Stacks is showing just how far Bitcoin can stretch with added functionality. If you’re serious about finding top cryptos to invest in this year , these three deserve a closer look.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 01:52:00

Today, on January 7, 2024, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (formerly Twitter) and made a bold prediction for XRP. Expert Says Buy Signal for XRP In a post, the expert noted that the last time a technical indicator named Supertrend flipped to bullish on the 12-hour time frame, XRP skyrocketed by 470%. Now, the altcoin has once again flipped bullish and flashing buy signal. This post on X is gaining widespread attention from crypto enthusiasts across the globe, as they are expecting a similar kind of rally this time as well.

At press time, XRP is trading near $2.41 and has experienced a modest price surge of 0.81% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped 10%, indicating a rise in participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. XRP Price Action and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP has been consolidating in a tight range between $2.37 and $2.46 for the last five days, following the breakout of a bullish pennant pattern on the daily time frame. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if XRP breaches this consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $2.48 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 85% to reach the $4.54 level in the future. Investors and Traders Rising Interest As of now, traders and long-term holders seem more interested in the altcoin, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Source: Coinglass Data from spot inflow/outflow revealed that during the same consolidation period, exchanges witnessed an outflow of a significant $38.02 million worth of XRP.

After examining technical indicators and historical trends, analysts are pointing to a possible surge in Cardano’s price to $4 in the near term. Meanwhile, the presale market is compelling as a promising Cardano rival, RCO FInance (RCOF) , is showing potential for an extraordinary leap from $0.077 to $5. This rising contender has captured investor attention, fueling anticipation for substantial returns as it continues its upward trajectory. Cardano Price Eyes $4 Amid Renewed Bullish Sentiment The Cardano price continues to outperform its peers, establishing itself as a leader in the DeFi market. Over the past year, ADA has surged 72.2%, with a notable 13.1% increase in daily charts and 21.8% weekly gains. Despite a minor pullback in December 2024, investor sentiment around the Cardano price has rebounded sharply.

Meanwhile, Solana continues to lead the charge in processing speed and efficiency, making it the platform of choice for DeFi and NFT initiatives. Web3Bay: Redefining E-Commerce with Decentralization Web3Bay is boldly stepping forward to reshape global e-commerce by creating a decentralized marketplace that fundamentally changes how buyers and sellers connect. Unlike conventional platforms burdened by intermediaries and high fees, Web3Bay removes these barriers, facilitating direct interactions with enhanced transparency and security, thanks to blockchain technology. What sets Web3Bay apart is its inclusive payment model that supports both crypto and traditional payment methods like PayPal. This innovative approach not only caters to crypto enthusiasts but also welcomes a wider audience, bridging the divide between conventional and digital commerce. For merchants in less accessible regions, this platform opens up a world of opportunity, providing them access to global markets without traditional constraints. In its second presale stage, Web3Bay has already raised over $420,000 and sold 110 million tokens at $0.0036975 each.

Ethereum: Gearing Up for a Breakout Year Ethereum continues to dominate the smart contract and decentralized application space, with signs strongly pointing to a breakout year in 2025. Currently, Ethereum’s price action is consolidating, indicating a potentially significant upcoming movement. With its price hovering around $3,519 and showing strong support, predictions suggest it could soar to $4,022 or higher. The anticipated surge in Ethereum’s market value is supported by its ongoing advancements, notably its shift to a Proof of Stake model, which enhances both scalability and energy efficiency. These improvements make Ethereum increasingly attractive to a broader range of institutional investors and secure its position as the foundational platform for numerous DeFi and NFT projects. Solana: Pioneering Speed in the Blockchain World Solana has set a new standard in the blockchain community for its incredible transaction speeds and minimal fees. Its distinct Proof of History consensus mechanism allows for processing thousands of transactions per second, making it an ideal solution for widespread adoption. Solana’s ability to handle immense transaction volumes effectively is evidenced by its recent achievement of processing over 72 million transactions in a single day. This capability, combined with a robust and active developer community, solidifies its position as a critical solution for developers seeking scalability without sacrificing speed. Summing Up Looking ahead to 2025, Web3Bay, Ethereum, and Solana each stand out with their unique capabilities to transform and dominate their sectors. Web3Bay is set to revolutionize the e-commerce landscape, providing a decentralized platform that offers unmatched control and opportunities to its users. Ethereum looks to continue leading the smart contract space with significant technological advancements, while Solana is poised to remain a top choice for developers needing high-speed and scalable blockchain solutions. These projects underscore the diverse and dynamic nature of blockchain technology, each offering unique opportunities for growth and innovation. For investors and tech enthusiasts alike, these best crypto coins present not just investment opportunities but a chance to be part of a transformative movement in the digital world.

According to crypto service provider Matrixport , these changes do not necessarily signal a bearish turn in the cryptocurrency market. In a recent X post , Matrixport emphasized the importance of stablecoin performance as a key market indicator. While such trends often correlate with market corrections, the firm suggests that Tether’s decline may simply reflect a seasonal downturn tied to the Christmas holidays , rather than a shift toward bearish sentiment. Stablecoins as Market Indicators Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) play a vital role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, often serving as a bridge between fiat currencies and digital assets. Key Metrics to Watch Market Capitalization Growth : Rising market cap typically indicates an influx of fiat money into crypto markets, supporting bullish momentum. Trading Volume : Increased volume suggests heightened market activity and strong demand for digital assets. When Trends Reverse Declines in these metrics can indicate reduced market activity and potential corrections, as investors withdraw funds or reduce exposure to risk. Matrixport’s Analysis of Tether’s Decline Current Trends Market Cap Drop : Tether’s market cap has seen a decline, raising concerns about potential market corrections. Volume Decline : Trading volumes have similarly dipped, a trend often associated with reduced investor activity. Matrixport’s Perspective Seasonal Factors : The firm attributes the decline to seasonal factors , particularly the slowdown during the Christmas and New Year holidays. Not Necessarily Bearish : Matrixport believes it is too early to conclude that the market has turned bearish based solely on Tether’s recent performance. Implications for the Crypto Market Potential Scenarios Seasonal Downturn : If Matrixport’s assessment holds, the market may rebound as trading activity picks up post-holiday season. Bearish Signal : A prolonged decline in Tether’s market cap and volume could eventually signal reduced liquidity and a shift toward a bearish trend. Role of Stablecoins in Market Sentiment Stablecoins often serve as a barometer for overall market health, making their performance critical to understanding broader trends. What Investors Should Watch 1. Tether’s Market Cap Recovery A rebound in Tether’s market cap would likely indicate renewed fiat inflows and bullish sentiment. 2. Stablecoin Trading Volume Increased trading volumes, especially for USDT, suggest heightened market activity and investor confidence. 3. Broader Market Indicators Key metrics such as Bitcoin’s price action , altcoin performance , and on-chain activity will provide additional context to Tether’s trends. FAQs What does Tether’s market cap decline indicate? A decline in Tether’s market cap could suggest reduced fiat inflows into the crypto market, often signaling potential corrections. However, Matrixport attributes this to seasonal factors rather than a bearish turn. Why is Tether important for the crypto market? Tether serves as a bridge between fiat currencies and digital assets, making its market cap and trading volume critical indicators of overall market sentiment. Is the crypto market turning bearish? Matrixport believes it is too early to conclude that the market is bearish based solely on Tether’s recent trends, attributing the changes to holiday seasonality. What should investors monitor in the coming weeks? Investors should track Tether’s market cap and trading volume for signs of recovery, along with broader crypto market trends like Bitcoin price movements. Conclusion Tether’s recent decline in market cap and trading volume has sparked concerns about potential market corrections. However, Matrixport suggests these changes are more likely tied to seasonal factors than a fundamental shift in market sentiment. As the holiday season concludes, all eyes will be on Tether’s performance and broader market indicators to determine whether the crypto market’s bullish momentum will continue.

Fantom is seeing a rise in both new and existing addresses, which points to an expanding ecosystem and hints at enduring value. Concurrently, Render whale activity is illustrating the impact of strategic moves that capitalize on price rebounds to realize substantial returns. As these established projects build steam, experts are eyeing a $20 target price for BlockDAG (BDAG) , following its announcement of WASM technology and an impressive presale that accumulated $176 million. BlockDAG is on track for rapid growth within the memecoin arena, attracting proactive traders looking to capitalize on what might be the major breakthrough of 2025. Growth Signals Emanate from Fantom Network The Fantom network is experiencing a boost in activity, suggesting a hopeful recovery. Recent figures indicate significant rises in new and active participants, underscoring the network’s increasing charm for developers and traders. Market insights currently set critical support for FTM at $0.7316, with a resistance level of $0.9671.

This move resulted in a $466,000 gain, highlighting the effectiveness of seizing profits amid recent price improvements. This increase in Render whale activity coincides with a 10% rise in large transactions reported by IntoTheBlock. This surge indicates a solid interest, bolstering a positive outlook for Render.

Latest Insights on TRX Price Prediction & ADA Market Analysis,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-stirs-excitement-with-usdt-rewards-up-to-10-latest-insights-on-trx-price-prediction-ada-market-analysis/,"Identifying the top crypto to buy in 2025 is increasingly crucial for those looking for substantial growth, with Cardano, Tron, and BlockDAG standing out as frontrunners. Recent Cardano price predictions signal a mix of hope and realism, with ADA’s future being molded by ongoing tech developments and market changes. In contrast, Tron market analysis shows a complex picture, with TRX poised on the brink of either significant gains or setbacks. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) captures attention with its Refer and Earn USDT program, which allows for instant cashback of 6% to 10% with no limit to earnings. This unique offer provides a compelling opportunity to benefit from BlockDAG’s unprecedented $176 million presale. TRON Market Outlook: Uncertainty Ahead for TRX The latest TRON market analysis paints a picture of uncertainty with TRX currently priced around $0.2587 as of December 30, 2024, experiencing a slight drop of 1.51% from the day before. Analysts are split, suggesting TRX could either drop to the $0.15 support in tough market conditions or climb to $0.40, supported by favorable economic trends such as potential Federal Reserve rate reductions. Despite high transaction volumes, these have not markedly impacted TRX’s pricing yet. The technical indicators are mixed, with some short-term averages indicating a ‘Strong Buy’ while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, advising a cautious approach. Cardano’s 2025 Prospects: Can ADA Reach New Heights? Cardano’s latest price forecasts show a balance between optimism and caution, with ADA currently around $0.87 after a recent dip. Analyst @LucidCiC on X enthusiastically states, “$ADA is about to go Interstellar!” while other experts suggest a potential climb to $2.42 or even $4.69, driven by market dynamics and technological advances. Noteworthy developments like the Chang hard fork and increased adoption efforts, particularly in Africa, reinforce this positive sentiment. Furthermore, the anticipated Bitcoin halving in 2025 could impact the wider crypto market, likely benefiting ADA. As one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025, ADA holds promise, though a careful review of Cardano’s market trends and price forecasts is advisable. BlockDAG Unleashes Unlimited USDT Cashback for Referrals and Purchases BlockDAG has taken the crypto market by storm with its groundbreaking presale, amassing over $176 million and registering an incredible 2380% increase in value since its initial batch. This impressive growth is propelled further by its interesting Refer & Earn USDT program, which provides immediate cashback rewards for both those who refer and those who buy, without any caps on earnings. This approach redefines reward systems in the crypto space, positioning BDAG as a standout choice. The referral mechanism is straightforward and highly beneficial. Referrers receive instant cashback between 6% and 10% in USDT (BEP-20) based on purchases made through their links, with the percentage increasing as transaction volume grows within a 24-hour cycle, resetting at 00:00 UTC. Purchasers benefit from a steady 6% cashback on every transaction, fostering a mutually advantageous environment that promotes ongoing engagement. The immediate nature of the cashback, coupled with no limits on potential earnings, positions this program as exceptionally rewarding in today’s market. As BDAG’s popularity continues to climb, analysts predict its price could hit $1 by 2025, potentially yielding a 4,200% ROI for holders from batch 27, and affirming its status as one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025. The ongoing presale presents a unique opportunity to purchase this cryptocurrency at just $0.0234 per coin, along with the benefit of immediate cashback rewards. With more than 17.7 billion BDAG sold, time is running out for those looking to buy this top crypto coin. Final Say As we edge closer to 2025, the Cardano price prediction indicates a bright future for ADA, supported by its technological innovations and expanding adoption, though a careful analysis of market trends is essential. Conversely, Tron market analysis suggests a volatile journey ahead, with TRX balancing on the cusp of potential upswings and downturns, influenced by broader economic indicators. Yet, BlockDAG stands out as the top crypto to buy in 2025 , thanks to its unparalleled referral program that offers 6% to 10% instant USDT cashback rewards. With its record-setting presale, remarkable growth trajectory, and forecasts predicting a significant rise in value, BlockDAG combines the allure of immediate financial incentives with substantial long-term growth prospects, making it an exciting prospect for proactive market participants.

33767162,[object Object],1736217045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,CFTC Charges Resolved: Crypto Exchange Gemini Strikes $5 Million Deal In Proposed Order,https://bitcoinist.com/cftc-charges-resolved-gemini-strikes-5-million-deal/,"In a major advancement for the cryptocurrency sector, Gemini Trust, headed by the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, has consented to pay $5 million to resolve allegations made by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Gemini Addresses CFTC Claims Of Deception In Bitcoin Futures Launch According to a Bloomberg report , the agreement seeks to address allegations that the exchange allegedly deceived the regulator while trying to launch the inaugural US-regulated Bitcoin futures contract. The suggested agreement was revealed in a combined court submission on Monday, preventing a trial that was scheduled to start on January 21, coinciding with Donald Trump’s second inauguration as US president. The CFTC first initiated its lawsuit in 2022, claiming that Gemini issued “false and misleading statements” about its actions to avert market manipulation in Bitcoin prices. These prices were meant to act as a benchmark for derivative agreements related to the cryptocurrency. The complaint states that from July to December 2017, Gemini, directly and via other means, supplied the CFTC with deceptive information while it assessed a possible self-certification for a Bitcoin futures contract. The suggested futures contract would be settled according to the spot Bitcoin price established by an auction held on Gemini’s trading platform for digital assets, referred to as the Gemini Bitcoin Auction. The CFTC asserted that several statements issued by Gemini were misleading or failed to include vital information necessary for grasping the vulnerability of the suggested contract to manipulation. Regulatory Oversight In Cryptocurrency Sector As stated in the complaint , Gemini staff allegedly knew or ought to have known that their remarks might deceive the CFTC, which depends on precise information from market participants to carry out its regulatory duties. This suggested Bitcoin futures contract was especially important as it was slated to be among the initial digital asset futures contracts offered on a specified contract market. The reliability of the information given was crucial for the CFTC to maintain the financial integrity of transactions and safeguard market participants from manipulation and other disturbances. This civil enforcement action involving Gemini was part of a larger effort by the Biden administration to create regulatory control over the cryptocurrency industry. The upcoming inauguration of Trump, seen by numerous crypto supporters as a possible ally for the sector, brings up queries regarding the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the US. In a similar vein, Gemini had earlier complied with subpoenas requesting laptops from two ex-executives during a criminal investigation that eventually ended without any charges being brought. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is trading at $102,130 for the first time in over two weeks, up more than 10% on a weekly basis.

Increased Liquidity : A rise in stablecoin holdings typically boosts liquidity, enabling more purchasing power for digital assets or staking in DeFi protocols. Why It Matters Investor Confidence : The significant inflow indicates heightened investor trust in Ethereum’s ecosystem amid broader market fluctuations. DeFi Resurgence : The stablecoin surge could signify renewed activity in Ethereum-based DeFi platforms, as users seek to capitalize on yield opportunities. Layer-2 Networks See Stablecoin Outflows Arbitrum Outflow : $2.36 billion in stablecoins withdrawn in the past week. Implications : This substantial withdrawal may reflect a shift in liquidity preferences, with users moving funds back to Ethereum’s mainnet. Optimism Outflow : $14.08 million in stablecoin withdrawals during the same period. Trend : While smaller in scale compared to Arbitrum, the outflows highlight a broader trend of liquidity returning to Ethereum’s primary chain. Reasons for the Shift Ethereum’s Robust Ecosystem : Users may be drawn back to Ethereum’s expansive DeFi landscape and higher security guarantees compared to layer-2 solutions. Market Dynamics : A potential market rally could be encouraging users to position themselves on the mainnet for easier access to liquidity and trading opportunities.

A stablecoin influx typically reflects increased liquidity and investor confidence, as stablecoins are often used for purchasing digital assets or participating in DeFi protocols. Why is liquidity moving back to Ethereum’s mainnet? The shift may be driven by Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, heightened security, and better access to liquidity for trading and DeFi activities. What does the $2.36 billion outflow from Arbitrum signify? It suggests that users are reallocating funds to Ethereum’s mainnet, potentially due to market conditions or strategic positioning for upcoming opportunities. How might Ethereum benefit from this influx? The increased liquidity could boost transaction volumes, DeFi activity, and demand for ETH, potentially supporting its price and network growth.

This forecast, shared by The Block , attributes Bitcoin’s rise to increasing demand from institutional and corporate entities while excluding potential government purchases. If realized, this milestone would solidify Bitcoin’s position as a global store of value, further transforming the dynamics of ownership and adoption across markets. Key Drivers of Bitcoin’s $200K Prediction 1. Institutional and Corporate Demand Bernstein analysts highlight the growing role of institutions and corporations in driving Bitcoin’s value. Bitcoin ETFs : The increasing prevalence of Bitcoin ETFs is facilitating easier access to the asset for retail and institutional investors. Corporate Treasuries : Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have set a precedent by integrating Bitcoin into their treasuries, inspiring other firms to follow suit. 2. Ownership Shifts to Long-Term Holders Gautam Chhugani, Managing Director at Bernstein, notes a key trend: Price Consolidation Below $100K : Bitcoin’s price remaining under $100,000 is prompting a shift in ownership from short-term traders to long-term holders. Entities like MicroStrategy and Bitcoin ETF investors contribute to this “permanent” ownership model. The Potential Role of Governments While Bernstein’s projection excludes government demand, the report acknowledges the potential for a game-changing shift if nations begin to include Bitcoin in their national reserves . What Could Happen? Triggering Global Competition : A U.S. decision to hold Bitcoin could spark worldwide competition among nations to acquire the cryptocurrency. Impact on Supply : Government demand would create significant scarcity, accelerating Bitcoin’s price rise. Bitcoin’s Road to $200K: Milestones and Challenges Milestones to Watch Increased ETF Adoption : A higher number of Bitcoin ETFs could lead to substantial capital inflows. Corporate Adoption : More companies adding Bitcoin to their treasuries would enhance its credibility as a reserve asset. Challenges Regulatory Risks : Regulatory uncertainty remains a key hurdle for Bitcoin’s price growth. Market Volatility : Bitcoin’s historical price swings may deter cautious investors. Comparative Analysis: Institutional and Government Demand Factor Institutional Demand Government Demand Impact on Price Gradual and sustained Sharp and exponential Likelihood High Moderate (dependent on geopolitical shifts) Potential Catalysts ETFs, corporate treasuries U.S. or major economies adopting Bitcoin FAQs Why does Bernstein predict Bitcoin will reach $200K by 2025? Bernstein’s forecast is based on rising institutional and corporate demand for Bitcoin, excluding potential government purchases. What role do ETFs play in Bitcoin’s price prediction? Bitcoin ETFs provide a regulated and accessible way for institutions and retail investors to acquire Bitcoin, contributing to increased demand. How could government demand impact Bitcoin’s price? If governments begin including Bitcoin in their national reserves, it could trigger global competition for the asset, significantly driving up its price. What factors might delay Bitcoin’s rise to $200K? Regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and slower-than-expected institutional adoption could delay Bitcoin’s growth. Who are the long-term holders driving Bitcoin’s value? Companies like MicroStrategy and investors in Bitcoin ETFs represent a shift towards long-term ownership, stabilizing Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Conclusion Bernstein’s $200,000 Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 underscores the growing influence of institutional and corporate demand on the cryptocurrency market. While the forecast excludes government purchases, the potential for global competition among nations to acquire Bitcoin adds another layer of intrigue. As ETFs and corporate treasuries increasingly dominate Bitcoin ownership, the path to $200K seems plausible, provided the market navigates regulatory and adoption challenges effectively.

This claim was made before a New York City court on Jan. 6, 2025, where Kwon is facing nine counts of felony relating to fraud at Terraform Labs. In the document submitted by acting U.S. attorney Daniel Gitner , the government outlined its intent to notify victims regarding their rights under the Justice for All Act of 2004. Due to the immense scale and global extent of Terraform Lab’s dissolution, traditional methods of notifying victims were believed to be impractical. Rather, the government proposed to set up a public website for Kwon’s case proceedings. The filing stated: “While it is difficult to precisely quantify the number of Kwon’s victims in light of the sheer number of purchases and sales of Terraform’s cryptocurrencies and the manner of those transactions (with many transactions in those assets occurring on foreign exchanges and through digital asset wallet or crypto trading accounts without personal identifying information), the Government estimates that the number of victims, in this case, exceeds hundreds of thousands of individuals and entities, and potentially totals more than one million.” The Justice for All Act provides that the victim of a federal crime enjoys particular rights such as timely notification of public court proceedings, the opportunity to be heard during sentencing or plea agreements, and the right to restitution if applicable. The Act, however, gives room for the courts to put in place in cases where a large number of victims need to be considered; reasonable procedures are evident in this case.

Kwon was sent to the U.S. in Dec. 2024 after protracted negotiations involving many jurisdictions, including South Korea, following his arrest in Montenegro in 2023 for unrelated charges. On Jan. 2, 2025, Kwon appeared before a U.S. court for the first time and entered a not-guilty plea to the charges against him. He is still being held in custody. Kwon and Terraform Labs were also charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a civil case in April 2024. In this case, he and Terraform Labs were ordered to pay nearly $4.5 billion in disgorgement, civil penalties, and prejudgment interest. Moving forward in the case, the government’s victim notification website is expected to assume a significant role in ensuring compliance with the statutory rights of a victim without overburdening the court processes. For victims, this represents a real step toward transparency and acknowledgment of the harms suffered as a result of the collapse of Terraform Labs.

The data analytics platform further revealed the top 10 projects with the most significant token unlock value, including Aptos, Optimism, and Arbitrum. The platform’s token unlock data highlighted that the tokens released by projects since the beginning of the year have amounted to over $1.3 billion. CryptoRank data also revealed that the largest unlock value recorded was on January 1, valued at $910 million, while the lowest was on January 2, valued at $62 million. The week began with token unlocks worth $63 million, with more expected throughout the week. The research platform also confirmed that the third week of this month, from January 13 to 19, will record the highest unlock value, worth $4 billion. The January 6-12 week, the 20-26 week, and the January 27- February 2 week are expected to record $986 million, $509 million, and $1 billion in unlocks, respectively. CryptoRank confirmed that token unlocks involved releasing tokens locked up by different projects over a certain period, referred to as the vesting period. Token unlocks release the tokens to different project areas, including investors, the project’s team, governance nodes, development funding, marketing, and rewards.

The unlock will account for about 2% of Aptos’ market capitalization, which currently stands at about $5.67 billion at the time of publication. The Circular Protocol will conduct the second-largest token unlock this January, accounting for about 63% of its market cap. On January 12, the project will release 28 billion CIRX tokens worth $108.35 million. Arbitrum, Optimism, Ronin, Movement, UXLINK, Immutable, Jito Labs, and StarkNET are the remaining top 8 projects, meant to release $86,24 million, $67.29 million, $66.89 million, $53.35 million, $36,73 million, $35.59 million, $35.04 million, and $32.66 million in token unlock value, respectively. Keyrock speculates that token unlocks might negatively impact markets According to digital asset liquidity solutions service provider Keyrock, the January token unlocks might trigger negative market responses. After monitoring over 16,000 unlocks, the company researched token unlocks and their effects on crypto markets. The platform published its research findings in December 2024 as investors anticipated the possible effects of this year’s unlocks. The Keyrock research report highlighted that crypto projects unlock over $600 million in weekly tokens. The firm explained in its research that despite the predetermined actions taken before the token unlocks, the recipients, scale, anticipation, timing, and other factors dictate the negative outcomes experienced after. The research ascertained that the larger the token unlocks, the higher the chances for negative feedback in the market. The report further highlighted that large unlocks could lead to approximately 2.4x price declines and significantly increased volatility depending on all factors before and during a token unlock. Keyrock still explained that 90% of the token uncocks had higher chances of triggering negative price action despite the type and size of the release. However, the research also highlighted that token release to teams causes the most notable crashes that lead to panic sell-offs. Keyrock further shared that investor unlocks triggered more stable price action, while project development unlocks yielded the most positive results. The research identified different trends investors could expect from its study, explaining that linear unlocks positively impacted the markets more than cliff unlocks. The January unlocks are, however, mostly cliff unlocks, leading to the firm’s speculation of negative price action. Keyrock shared that retail investors would be more prone to reacting to negative market dynamics than institutional investors.

These changes have not just raised Ethereum’s market size but have also increased interest in ETH tokens, showing the platform’s growing power in the crypto world.

This surge is partly due to significant accumulation by large holders, known as whales, who have purchased over 40 million XRP tokens, indicating strong confidence in the asset’s potential. Analysts suggest that if XRP maintains its current momentum, it could target the $3.5 price level, a significant resistance point near its all-time high. This optimism is further supported by increased network activity and positive developments in Ripple’s legal battles, which have historically influenced XRP’s price movements. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, XRP’s recent performance underscores its resilience and the growing investor confidence in its future prospects.

These top-rated analysts see PCHAIN as a promising alternative for investors seeking safer returns in the volatile crypto market. While the XRP price movement continues to fluctuate, PCHAIN has emerged as a standout contender, offering a unique value proposition that appeals to both seasoned investors and newcomers. With its innovative approach to tokenized real estate, PropiChain is capturing the interest of XRP price analysts, who are impressed by its potential to deliver remarkable returns of up to 12,000X. According to the XRP price analysts, PCHAIN capitalized on the stability and growth of the $600 trillion global real estate market, combined with the efficiency of blockchain technology, to offer a compelling alternative to more traditional digital assets. PCHAIN’s appeal lies in its promise of long-term stability and exponential growth potential. The XRP Price Trajectory While the XRP price has surged recently, with the asset rising by 14.7% over the last 7 days, investors are still concerned about long-term sustainability. Ripple’s collaborations with financial institutions worldwide have strengthened its reputation as a reliable digital asset. However, the XRP price has faced its fair share of challenges, including regulatory hurdles and price volatility. Despite its resilience and ongoing use cases, the XRP price movement hasn’t convinced long-term holders. These investors are increasingly exploring diversification options, and PropiChain has presented an ideal opportunity. PropiChain: A Top Contender with 12,000X Growth Potential Ahead of The XRP Price PropiChain is a blockchain-powered real estate platform that uses new-generation technologies to power the future of the global real estate market. The platform is a relatively new entrant in the crypto space and has been gaining traction for its unique value proposition. Designed as a decentralized platform for real estate tokenization, PropiChain aims to bridge the gap between traditional property markets and blockchain technology. By enabling fractional ownership of real estate assets, the platform offers investors access to high-value properties without the substantial capital typically required. This innovative model democratizes real estate investment and introduces a layer of stability often absent in the crypto market. Real estate is historically considered a “safe-haven” asset, and PropiChain’s blockchain integration ensures transparency, security, and transaction efficiency. Top XRP price analysts have pointed out that PCHAIN’s dual focus on stability and innovation makes it a compelling choice for risk-averse investors. While XRP continues to offer utility in financial systems, its price remains subject to external factors like regulatory developments. PCHAIN, on the other hand, provides a hedge against such uncertainties through its asset-backed approach. Integrating blockchain with real estate has long been touted as the next big thing, but no platform has managed to execute it effectively like PCHAIN. The platform’s clear roadmap and tangible use cases give it an edge that’s hard to ignore The 12,000x Edge: What Sets PCHAIN Apart? The claim of a potential 12,000x edge stems from PCHAIN’s strategic positioning in two high-growth markets: blockchain technology and the $600 trillion real estate. Here’s a breakdown of the factors contributing to this significant potential: Real-World Asset Backing Unlike many crypto assets like XRP price that rely solely on market speculation, PCHAIN is backed by tangible real estate assets. This real-world backing provides a cushion against extreme price swings and enhances investor confidence in the asset. Fractional Ownership PropiChain’s fractional ownership model allows small and medium-sized investors to participate in lucrative real estate markets that were previously out of reach. This inclusivity expands the investor base and boosts demand for PCHAIN, the platform’s utility token. Global Accessibility The platform’s decentralized nature ensures accessibility for investors worldwide. With blockchain’s inherent transparency, PCHAIN eliminates geographical and bureaucratic barriers typically associated with real estate investments. PropiChain’s Technological Innovation to Power the Future of Real Estate PCHAIN uses cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), the Metaverse, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and smart contracts to transform the global real estate industry. With AI-powered tools such as virtual assistants and chatbots, the platform offers investors round-the-clock support, ensuring a seamless experience throughout their investment journey. Its AI-driven market analysis features deliver predictive insights into emerging market trends, empowering investors with the knowledge to make strategic investment decisions. PropiChain enables virtual property tours through state-of-the-art 3D visualization technology by incorporating the Metaverse. This approach eliminates physical visits, creating a borderless, global marketplace where buyers and sellers can connect, interact, and complete transactions effortlessly. PCHAIN’s RWA tokenization technology transforms real estate assets into digital tokens, paving the way for fractional ownership of premium properties. This innovation significantly lowers financial barriers, making real estate investment more accessible and inclusive for a broader audience. The platform’s smart contracts also streamline property management by automating property leasing and lease renewals. By cutting out intermediaries like brokers and leasing agents, real estate investors can manage their properties more efficiently while reducing operational costs. Conclusion For these XRP price analysts, PropiChain offers crypto enthusiasts a glimpse into the future of crypto investments. With its unique blend of blockchain technology and real estate, PCHAIN is well-positioned to deliver safer returns and achieve its touted 12,000x edge. According to the analysts, your $1000 investment in the ongoing PCHAIN presale would yield over $328,432 in profit before the end of Q1 2025. The project raised over $1.3 million during its first token presale and has crossed the $640,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round, which shows investor confidence in PCHAIN’s profit potential. After this presale round, the token price will rise by over 109% for the final presale round. Join the PCHAIN presale now for life-changing gains and a low entry price. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , a sign of the project’s mission to take the crypto space by storm.

38637174,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=671524,1736218806,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,MicroStrategy Strikes Again: $100 Million Bitcoin Purchase Signals Strong Market Confidence,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/microstrategy-strikes-again-100-million-bitcoin-purchase-signals-strong-market-confidence/,"MicroStrategy, the major enterprise software company that has evolved into a Bitcoin (BTC) investment platform, has captured attention once again with its latest purchase of $101 million in BTC. The company, led by chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor, has committed to utilizing perpetual preferred stock, common shares, and debt to fuel its ongoing Bitcoin purchasing strategy. MicroStrategy Eyes $42 Billion Capital Raise By 2027 In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MicroStrategy disclosed that it purchased 1,070 Bitcoin tokens at an average price of approximately $94,000 on December 30 and 31, 2024. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 447,470 BTC, acquired for around $27.97 billion at an average price of $62,503 per Bitcoin. Notably, Saylor highlighted in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), that the company achieved a Bitcoin yield of 48% for the fourth quarter of 2024 and 74.3% for the entire fiscal year. Related Reading: XRP Eyes $11 Breakout, But A Correction Might Come First—Analyst MicroStrategy’s ambitious plans extend beyond Bitcoin acquisitions. On Friday, the firm announced its intention to raise up to $2 billion through offerings of perpetual preferred stock, which will hold seniority over its Class A common stock. This move is part of a larger strategy to raise $42 billion in capital by 2027 through various means, including at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offerings. With more than two-thirds of its equity goals already met, the company is expected to pivot towards fixed-income markets in the near future. The demand for MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has notably increased among hedge funds, which are employing convertible arbitrage strategies that involve purchasing bonds and short-selling shares. This strategy capitalizes on the volatility of MicroStrategy’s stock, a characteristic that has become a cornerstone of its business model. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer remarked: That volatility itself is a key element of MicroStrategy’s approach because it enables the company to tap into the capital markets and particularly the convertible bond market more easily. MicroStrategy’s recent proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.3 billion has sparked fears of share dilution, leading to a significant drop in the company’s stock price. MicroStrategy’s Bold Bitcoin Strategy Faces Headwinds On the day of the proxy filing in December, shares fell by as much as 9.6%. Adam Kobeissi, founder of The Kobeissi Letter, noted the dilemma faced by investors, stating: It’s a lose-lose because on one hand you have people saying that it’s dilutive and they’re selling the stock… but on the other hand you have people saying if it doesn’t pass, then they can’t keep buying Bitcoin and the whole investment strategy is kind of broken. A vote on the share increase is scheduled for January 21, 2025, and with Saylor being a significant shareholder, the amendment is expected to pass. Should it be approved, the increase in shares could lead to further volatility in MicroStrategy’s stock price as the company becomes more leveraged. Although the company has typically outperformed Bitcoin, it has faced challenges in recent months, underlining that its performance is influenced by factors beyond just cryptocurrency prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Price on the Rise: Can Momentum Fuel Bigger Gains? Despite the recent fluctuations, Palmer maintains a “buy” rating on MicroStrategy’s stock. He believes the market’s reaction to the proposed share increase has been an overreaction. “The company’s strategy has been to issue shares to make accretive Bitcoin purchases which can accrue to the benefit of shareholders,” he commented. MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach to Bitcoin acquisitions has seen it make significant purchases exceeding $1 billion in late 2024, although recent weeks have seen a slowdown in these activities amidst fluctuating Bitcoin prices. Palmer reassured investors, stating, “We’ve seen a pull forward of the company’s strategy, which is not indicative of a slowdown… it’s more a reflection of the aggressive approach that the company has taken.” At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto is inching closer to the $100,000 milestone, trading at $99,340, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 03:23:00

Yep, you read that right. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a cheeky new player that’s not only crushing it with staking rewards but also raising eyebrows with its skyrocketing presale performance. The coin hit over $2.5 million in the first two weeks of its presale launch and hasn’t slowed down since, surpassing $5 million and counting. But it’s not just about numbers. BTFD has unique features that go beyond the usual meme coin hype. With plans to incorporate decentralised tools, community-led governance, and long-term utility, BTFD isn’t just a flash in the pan. It’s aiming to carve out a solid niche in the market. Oh, and did we mention over 62 billion coins have already been snapped up by 7,700 holders? The popularity of meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has rewritten the rules of crypto. They’ve proven that community-driven projects can skyrocket with the right mix of humour and heart. BTFD Coin , however, is upping the ante. It’s combining meme culture with tangible benefits, making it one of the best new meme coins to invest in this week . Let’s dive into how it compares to Simon’s Cat and Apu Apustaja. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Offering 90% APY on Staking BTFD is the new kid on the block, but it’s playing like a seasoned pro. Starting its presale at a humble $0.000004 per coin, it has already reached $0.0000142 in Stage 13. With 16 stages total and a listing price of $0.0006, early investors stand to gain massive returns. Imagine investing $35,000 at the current price. That would snag you 246.48 million BTFD coins . When the price hits $0.0006, you’re looking at a whopping $147,888 . That’s the kind of win most crypto enthusiasts dream about. BTFD Coin is making waves with its impressive 90% APY staking rewards , offering investors a lucrative way to grow their holdings passively. Unlike traditional meme coins, BTFD combines community-driven hype with real financial incentives, making it a standout in the crypto market. Staking BTFD is simple and rewarding, allowing users to lock their coins and earn substantial returns while supporting the coin’s ecosystem. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, this high APY rate ensures your money works harder for you. With BTFD’s growing popularity and presale momentum, the 90% staking reward is the cherry on top for investors. The buzz around BTFD isn’t just about the numbers, though. Its presale has become a talking point across Gen Z and Millennial communities in Australasia and beyond. People love a good underdog story, and BTFD is delivering just that with its 16-stage structure and ambitious roadmap. And the 90% APY on staking? It’s like the cherry on top of an already irresistible crypto sundae. Simon’s Cat (CAT): A Meow-tastic Memecoin Adventure Simon’s Cat entered the meme coin space with a purr and a promise. Inspired by the viral cartoon series, CAT has quickly become a favourite for animal lovers and crypto enthusiasts alike. The coin’s value surged last week, thanks to clever marketing campaigns and an impending airdrop. But it’s not all sunshine and catnip. While CAT’s price action has been impressive, critics argue that it lacks a clear use case. Most of its hype relies on the charm of its branding and its ability to generate social media buzz. Sure, it’s a fun investment, but is it sustainable? The good news is CAT isn’t resting on its laurels. The developers are actively exploring partnerships and community-driven initiatives. If you’re looking for a coin with personality and potential, Simon’s Cat might just be your pick. Still, if you’re after a more solid return, BTFD’s structured presale offers a clearer path to gains. Apu Apustaja (APU): From Meme to Market Let’s talk about Apu Apustaja, a meme coin inspired by the iconic internet character. This one’s for the die-hard meme lovers who thrive on nostalgia. APU launched with a bang, offering playful branding and a strong focus on community engagement. Its initial decentralised exchange (DEX) debut saw a gain, making waves in a crowded market. But APU isn’t just about its debut. The project aims to integrate Play2Earn gaming and NFT marketplaces into its ecosystem, giving it a potential edge over meme coins that rely solely on hype. That said, APU has its challenges. It’s competing with heavyweights like BTFD, which has already proven its worth through a meticulously planned presale. APU may have the memes, but BTFD’s blend of staking rewards and financial potential make it a standout choice for investors. How to Buy BTFD Coin Thinking of jumping on the BTFD bandwagon? Here’s how you can get in: Go to the presale page at BTFD.io . Connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet works best). Enter the amount of $BTFD you’d like to buy. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. It’s quick, easy, and could be one of the smartest moves you make this year. Conclusion: Why BTFD Coin Deserves Your Attention Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be a game-changer in the meme coin world. With its stellar presale performance, incredible staking rewards, and long-term growth potential, BTFD offers a unique opportunity to join a community that’s not just about memes but meaningful returns.

The price is showing positive signs and might aim for a fresh increase above $2.4650. XRP price is struggling to gain pace for a move above the $2.50 zone. The price is now trading below $2.435 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $2.385 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level. The next resistance is $2.55. A clear move above the $2.55 resistance might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance or even $2.750 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.880. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.435 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.380 level. The next major support is near the $2.320 level.

Acting US Attorney Daniel Gitner claimed the government would establish a website to help inform victims of their rights, calling other notification methods “impracticable.” The US government prefers to use a website to communicate with victims of the Terra case The US government approximates the number of victims affected by the Terra ecosystem collapse to be over 1 million. Acting US Attorney Daniel Gitner submitted a motion to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on January 6 describing the procedures for notifying potential victims of Do Kwon’s public proceedings. The US attorney claimed the government would set up a website to inform victims of their rights, tagging other traditional methods “impracticable” due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency transactions, which often lack personal identifying information. Terra collapsed in May 2022, and Do Kwon is charged with nine fraud felonies In May 2022, Terra, once the third largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ether, crumbled, losing its $50 billion valuation in just 72 hours. When founder Do Kwon launched Terra, he claimed he wanted to build an ecosystem better than Bitcoin and Ethereum. He added that he needed a stablecoin to compete directly with fiat currencies. Sadly, his entire project lacked transparency. According to the US Department of Justice, Kwon misled investors by falsely claiming the company’s blockchain products and manipulated their markets to create the illusion of a functioning and decentralized financial system. Earlier this year, Kwon was extradited from Montenegro to the United States, where he now faces nine felony fraud charges. On January 2, he appeared before a US judge for the first time and pleaded not guilty. However, authorities have yet to clarify if they will pursue a plea agreement with the Terraform co-founder or whether they will proceed to a full criminal trial. Due to his fraud involvement, Kwon already had to pay a $4.5 billion settlement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in April 2024.

Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just exploring crypto, these three projects are hard to ignore. Web3Bay is transforming online shopping with its decentralized marketplace, removing high fees and middlemen. Its presale success has drawn significant attention. On the other side, XRP is showing strong potential after a stellar 2024. With regulatory wins and high price forecasts, the community is eager for 2025. Meanwhile, Cardano is bouncing back, with analysts suggesting it’s primed for a new rally after recent price corrections. Discover why these are the best crypto projects to watch. Web3Bay: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce with its transparent and decentralized marketplace. By cutting out middlemen it empowers both buyers and sellers to transact directly, reducing fees and ensuring users retain full control over their funds and data. Its unique payment system supports both cryptocurrencies and traditional methods like PayPal, making it accessible for crypto enthusiasts and regular shoppers. For merchants, especially in regions with limited banking access, Web3Bay offers a gateway to global markets without needing traditional financial institutions. Currently in presale stage 3 at $0.0039675, Web3Bay has raised over $420,000, selling more than 110 million 3BAY coins. With 28 stages and a 15% price hike per stage, it promises a potential ROI exceeding 6000%. This platform, with its secure smart contracts and low fees, is shaping the future of online shopping. XRP Price Trends Surge Predictions XRP ended 2024 on a high, surpassing $2 for the first time, achieving a 370% annual growth. Analysts predict 2025 could see it climb to $6.4, $13, or even $27, driven by favorable market momentum and regulatory clarity. The XRP community is optimistic, especially after the New York Department of Financial Services approved Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD. This approval solidifies Ripple’s involvement in central bank digital currencies and enhances its payment solutions, setting XRP up for wider adoption. However, some experts remain cautious. Pro-crypto lawyer John Deaton, for instance, has stated he’s uncertain about XRP’s future price, saying, “I have no idea.” Regardless, the potential for growth remains strong. Cardano (ADA) Analysis: Signs of a 2025 Rebound Cardano (ADA) has seen sharp price swings, including a 40% drop following a 300% rally from November lows. Market analysts like Michaël van de Poppe suggest the correction phase may be nearing its end, paving the way for a fresh upward move.
