Web3Bay is doing just that. As other projects shout about their potential, Web3Bay focuses on a steady build-up, positioning itself as a transformative force in online shopping. This underappreciated project is gearing up for significant impact, making now a prime time for discerning crypto enthusiasts to engage. How Web3Bay Is Reinventing E-Commerce Web3Bay is more than your typical blockchain initiative. It’s pioneering a new way of shopping online—without middlemen, reducing fees, enhancing data privacy, and ensuring secure, user-driven transactions. But why isn’t this making more noise? Web3Bay prefers real progress over flashy promotion. Its presale stages are designed to benefit early supporters discreetly, attracting genuine interest over fleeting speculation. Those looking for the best investments to watch right now see Web3Bay’s groundwork as especially compelling. The Value of Web3Bay Tokens Currently, Web3Bay tokens, named 3BAY, are available at the low price of $0.0039675 during the third presale stage. Early buyers stand to see significant gains, with token prices projected to reach $0.1959—a 6,430% increase by the end of the presale. So far, the presale has raised over $420,000 and sold 110 million tokens, signaling strong market trust. However, this valuation doesn’t yet match the platform’s full future potential. Why Web3Bay Is a Game-Changer in Online Shopping Web3Bay’s model is simple and globally applicable. It tackles issues like excessive fees, opacity, and privacy—problems that millions encounter online. By employing blockchain, the platform promises lower costs, transparency, and better security. Its dual payment system, supporting both cryptocurrencies and traditional methods like PayPal, bridges existing e-commerce with blockchain innovation, making it accessible to a broad audience. Why Join Web3Bay’s Presale Now In blockchain ventures, timing is crucial. Early involvement in Web3Bay could differentiate between modest earnings and substantial rewards. Each new presale stage increases token prices by 15%, rewarding proactive participants. Moreover, early investors can influence the platform’s direction through decentralized governance, offering a community-focused alternative to the centralized setups of current e-commerce leaders. This positions Web3Bay as a significant DeFi player and a bullish crypto to monitor. Web3Bay’s Bright Future in Blockchain Commerce Web3Bay has big plans, including introducing an NFT marketplace, DeFi staking options, and cross-chain features to enrich the user experience and extend utility. These steps will attract both blockchain enthusiasts and mainstream users, setting the stage for Web3Bay to become a well-known name in the Web3 arena. With its practical solutions and commitment to decentralization, Web3Bay is set to lead in the evolving e-commerce sector, making it a wise choice among the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Wrapping Up Web3Bay is set for a significant lift-off. Its current undervaluation reflects a market oversight, one that’s quickly adjusting as more recognize its potential. Joining now places you at the forefront of a transformative wave in how we shop online. Web3Bay isn’t just another blockchain project—it’s at the vanguard of redefining buying, selling, and connecting digitally. It stands out as a top DeFi crypto and is poised to dominate in a forthcoming bull market. Get ahead of the curve—join Web3Bay before it becomes mainstream.

Barr is resigning from his position as Vice Chair for Supervision. In a statement , Barr said he didn’t want a potential dispute over the position in the near future to distract from the Fed’s “mission.” “The position of vice chair for supervision was created after the Global Financial Crisis to create greater responsibility, transparency, and accountability for the Federal Reserve’s supervision and regulation of the financial system. The risk of a dispute over the position could be a distraction from our mission. In the current environment, I’ve determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor.” Barr’s resignation comes less than two weeks before pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. In 2023 during a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C., Barr warned about the “special risks associated with stablecoins,” advocating for stiffer regulations on the asset class. Said Barr, “Stablecoin issuers seek to have—but don’t—some of the same characteristics as federally insured bank deposits. Stablecoin issuers represent that their liabilities can be redeemed on demand at par, a dollar for a dollar. In fact, however, the assets backing the liability can fluctuate in value… The banks we regulate, in contrast, are well protected from bank runs through a robust array of supervisory requirements. Consider the consequences if a stablecoin not subject to appropriate supervision and regulation were to be adopted as a widespread means of payment, which some stablecoin developers state as a goal. Stablecoins have the potential to scale quickly because of network effects. An unregulated, unsupervised, deposit-like asset could create tremendous disruptions, not just for financial institutions but for people who might rely on the coin if it were to get wide adoption. We must learn from the past to ensure that we do not allow for new forms of unregulated private money subject to classic forms of run risk, and with the associated spillovers and systemic implications for households, businesses, and the broader economy.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This trial stemmed from the CFTC’s 2022 lawsuit, which accused Gemini of providing false or misleading information during the evaluation of its Bitcoin futures product. The CFTC alleged that between July 2017 and December 2017, Gemini made inaccurate claims about whether its proposed Bitcoin futures contract would be “readily susceptible to manipulation.” Additionally, the lawsuit highlighted that Gemini engaged in undisclosed fee arrangements with specific market participants, such as market makers. These arrangements, designed to boost trading in Gemini’s Auction, were not disclosed to all customers or made available on the company’s website. Under the terms of the settlement, Gemini agreed to pay a $5 million penalty and refrain from making false or misleading statements to the CFTC in the future.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Evaluating Ethereum, XRP, Rollblock, Solana, Pepe, and Shiba Inu as the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Table of Contents Rollblock gaining attention during presale Ethereum tipped to reclaim $4000 XRP slightly declines amid market downturn Shiba Inu suffers with most speculative crypto Solana demonstrates potential Pepe diminishes after a bullish Q4 Conclusion The recent cryptocurrency decline drew parallels to the market dynamics of December 2020. During that period, the dip in prices preceded a historic altcoin rally in Q1-Q2 of 2021, when several assets surged to unprecedented highs. If the 4-year cycle theory holds true, the recent downturn may be setting the stage for another explosive bull run. Ethereum, XRP, Shiba Inu, Solana, Pepe, and Rollblock are all positioned to benefit from this potential resurgence. Rollblock gaining attention during presale Rollblock aims to transform the play-to-earn iGaming sector with its state-of-the-art casino platform that combines strong fundamentals, attractive incentives, and unparalleled growth potential. The platform will have an extensive catalog of over 7,000 games, offering a diverse range of options, from classic favorites like blackjack and poker to cutting-edge blockchain-based titles. Recently, Rollblock expanded its offerings by introducing sports betting, solidifying its position as a leader in the rapidly growing GambleFi market. Security is a top priority for Rollblock, which leverages advanced encryption technologies and AI-powered safeguards to create a transparent and secure environment for both players and investors. The platform’s credibility is further bolstered by its recent SolidProof audit and licensing by Gaming Arjun, establishing its legitimacy as it approaches a highly anticipated bull run ahead of its official launch. One of Rollblock’s standout features is its revenue-sharing system. Up to 30% of weekly profits will be reinvested into token buybacks, with 60% of these tokens burned to reduce supply and drive scarcity. The remaining tokens will be distributed to investors as staking rewards, fostering a loyal community and enhancing RBLK’s long-term value. Ethereum tipped to reclaim $4000 Ethereum recently slipped below the critical $4,000 level during a broader market downturn, temporarily halting its December rally, which had been fueled by strong retail interest and record-breaking inflows into Ethereum ETFs. Despite this dip, optimism remains strong. December saw over $1 billion in ETH accumulation, with 104,000 ETH withdrawn from exchanges, signaling growing confidence among long-term holders. Whale wallets now hold 57% of Ethereum’s total supply — the highest concentration in the platform’s history — demonstrating substantial support from major players. Market analysts anticipate a swift recovery, with Ethereum poised to reclaim the $4,000 mark and potentially surpass its all-time high of $4,891 as early as Q1 2025. As the market stabilizes and the anticipated “alt season” begins in January, Ethereum is set to maintain its leadership position. Its dominance in DeFi, coupled with rising institutional interest and increased whale activity, reinforces Ethereum’s role as a cornerstone of the crypto market and a key player in the next bullish wave. You might also like: Here are the expected bull market top prices for XRP, Solana and Rollblock XRP slightly declines amid market downturn In Q4 of 2024, XRP became one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market, surging over 400%, fueled by speculation surrounding Gary Gensler’s rumored resignation and the pro-crypto sentiment anticipated from Donald Trump’s incoming administration. Adding to the bullish sentiment were whispers of an XRP ETF launch targeted for 2025-2026. However, the mid-December market correction put downward pressure on XRP, weakening its performance on both daily and weekly charts. Despite the short-term decline, XRP has demonstrated notable resilience compared to many altcoins. This relative strength is supported by Ripple’s strategic initiatives, including the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin, which enhances XRP’s utility within the ecosystem. Analysts predict that as Bitcoin dominance eventually cools off, XRP could see a significant influx of new capital, setting the stage for another rally and maintaining its optimistic long-term outlook. Shiba Inu suffers with most speculative crypto After reaching $0.000033 and sparking renewed investor interest earlier in Q4, Shiba Inu has faced a challenging period, declining by over 20% in the past month. This drop coincided with Bitcoin’s price correction below $90,000, which placed additional downward pressure on speculative assets. Despite these setbacks, Shiba Inu demonstrates resilience and ongoing community support. A recent 1,068% spike in the burn rate resulted in the destruction of over 51.7 million tokens, which highlights efforts to reduce supply. Additionally, Shibarium’s total value locked (TVL) has seen an explosive increase of 850% since September, reflecting the growing utility and adoption of Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 solution. At the time of writing, 64% of Shiba Inu holders were in profit, suggesting solid investor confidence even amidst broader market turbulence. As a leader in the meme coin sector, Shiba Inu retains its position as a dominant player, buoyed by its strong community and expanding ecosystem.

The blockchain’s unprecedented 66.9 million daily transactions underscore its dominance in the layer-1 ecosystem, outpacing the combined activity of major competitors. This performance reflects Solana’s speed, cost efficiency, and scalability, solidifying its reputation as an attractive alternative to Ethereum. Notably, Solana’s Brazilian transaction volumes recently surged to nearly $84 million, further showcasing its growing global adoption. Looking ahead, analysts have identified Solana, alongside XRP, as a leading candidate for spot ETF approval in 2025. While potential classification as securities poses regulatory hurdles, analysts anticipate that Solana ETFs could soon join Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as mainstream investment vehicles, presenting significant upside for the ecosystem and its native SOL token. Pepe diminishes after a bullish Q4 Pepe has firmly established itself as the third-largest meme coin, fueled by tier-1 exchange listings and renewed retail interest, which triggered a series of impressive rallies earlier in the cycle. Adding to this bullish momentum was notable whale activity, including a massive $52 million transfer from a wallet that had been dormant for 600 days, signaling renewed confidence in Pepe’s potential. However, mid-December market turbulence weighed heavily on Pepe, aligning with broader meme coin declines. On both daily and weekly charts, Pepe invalidated key bullish patterns, prompting “smart money” holders to reduce their positions. The tracked holdings of Pepe fell from 8 trillion to 7.5 trillion tokens, indicating a bearish sentiment in the short term. Despite these challenges, analysts believe Pepe’s long-term outlook remains optimistic, as meme coins are likely to rebound during the anticipated altcoin season in Q1-Q2 2025. Pepe’s strong community backing and established position in the meme coin sector suggest it could recover and maintain its relevance in the next market cycle. Conclusion The recent market correction aligns with historical patterns observed in previous cycles and is far from bearish when viewed in context. Corrections like this often set the stage for a robust recovery, especially for large-cap juggernauts such as Ethereum, XRP, Shiba Inu, Solana, and Pepe. Additionally, emerging projects like Rollblock are carving out their own space, offering investors a chance to capitalize on niche market opportunities.

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 23:10:00

With several ETFs lined up for launch in 2025, each firm is trying to put its best foot forward to appear on top of the chain. In submissions made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission towards the end of 2024, very lucrative offers would excite investors. One of the unique proposals was an ETF from ProShares that would denote the S&P 500’s return in Bitcoin. Besides, funds managed by Strive Asset Management and REX Shares will enable convertible bonds by companies to purchase Bitcoin. Volatility Shares, an ETF firm, hopes to trigger Solana funds with a vessel that tracks it using futures products. As more launches are anticipated, there are deliberate attempts to incorporate crypto strategies into ETFs . Most of these scenarios will be in play in 2025 because crypto is currently the hot thing, and issuers love to drop them when the theme is on fire. Crypto ETFs are gaining traction out of their one-year existence The US Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF were only approved and launched last year. If the SEC approves all the filed applications for crypto ETFs, there will be more than a dozen crypto ETFs in 2025. Cryptocurrency enjoyed a good ride in 2024, with Bitcoin growing more than 120% to trade above $100,000. The surge could be attributed to the US President-elect, Donald Trump, who has openly embraced cryptocurrency. The Trump administration is expected to loosen its regulatory stance regarding crypto, making digital assets grow accordingly. The excitement surrounding Trump’s election helped to push annual inflows for the biggest Bitcoin ETF . BlackRock rose above $37 billion for the year, ranking third among all funds. Corporates are using a mix of new equity and sales of convertible bonds to buy more crypto Some of the strategies that may dominate 2025 began last year. For instance, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor leveraged the surging crypto prices to double down on his Bitcoin purchase tactics, acquiring large tokens for its company reserve. The firm has used both new equity and sales of convertible bonds to help sponsor its crypto buying. Other entities have also laid down plans for their firms based on MicroStrategy’s style. Fillings from REX ETF indicate that the firm wants to invest most of its assets in convertible bonds from companies that deal in Bitcoin. Also, according to paperwork filed last week, Strive is proposing to launch a fund that invests in derivatives such as swaps and options to get exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy or other companies with similar investment strategies.

This makes the Southeast Asian giant the latest addition to the coalition of emerging economies, which now consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, alongside newer members like Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Indonesia had been eyeing the group for years, pushing to become part of its mission to challenge Western-dominated systems and amplify the voice of the Global South. The approval came in 2023 during the BRICS summit in Johannesburg, but Indonesia, waiting for political stability after its presidential elections, delayed formalizing its membership. Now, with President Prabowo Subianto in charge since October, the timing finally lined up. BRICS grows stronger with Indonesia on board BRICS has been on an expansion spree. Together, the countries represent 37.3% of global GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) and are home to over 3.3 billion people. With Indonesia in the fold, BRICS now boasts some of the fastest-growing economies on the planet, along with a ton of political and economic clout. Indonesia’s economy is valued at over $1 trillion, and its role in trade, manufacturing, and natural resources makes it a valuable player for the bloc. Adding to this, Indonesia has been vocal about its support for BRICS’ goals of reforming global governance systems. The statement from Brazil summed it up like this: “Indonesia contributes positively to the deepening of cooperation in the Global South.” The de-dollarization agenda BRICS has been working overtime on de-dollarization, to cut ties with the U.S. dollar in trade and financial transactions. One major piece of the puzzle is the “BRICS Bridge,” a blockchain-powered payment system in development. Think of it as an alternative to SWIFT, designed to allow member countries to settle trade using their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). For BRICS, blockchain is a weapon. You see, they’re considering creating a new reserve currency, the “Unit,” backed by a basket of member currencies and possibly gold. India has already been leading the charge in local currency trade agreements. The country has sealed deals with 22 nations, allowing trade in domestic currencies instead of the dollar. This strategy has picked up steam as sanctions on countries like Russia push them to look for financial workarounds. Still, there’s a long road ahead. Critics say the dollar’s dominance isn’t going to crumble overnight, no matter how hard BRICS tries. Internal issues like fluctuating currencies, economic disparities, and logistical challenges could slow the pace. But BRICS doesn’t seem to care. Putin, Trump, and BRICS Here’s where things get even messier. Vladimir Putin’s Russia has been one of the loudest voices in BRICS, pushing hard for de-dollarization. But now there’s a new wildcard on the table: Donald Trump. His return to the U.S. presidency is expected to shake things up, especially for Russia’s economic plans and BRICS’ overall strategy. Let’s break it down. Trump’s administration has always been unpredictable when it comes to Russia. While there’s speculation that Trump might seek to cool tensions with Moscow, many in his camp favor tougher sanctions. If Trump doubles down on economic warfare, it could isolate Russia from Western financial systems even more, making BRICS’ de-dollarization efforts even more critical. For Putin, BRICS is a lifeline. Russia’s economy has been battered by sanctions, with inflation soaring to nearly 30% last year and the ruble losing 33% of its value since August 2024. Oil revenues, once the backbone of Russia’s economy, have plummeted. Daily earnings from fossil fuels have halved since 2022, while Ukraine’s decision to cut off transit rights for Russian gas to Europe has cost Moscow another $5 billion annually. Despite these setbacks, Russia has been doubling down on BRICS. For the rest of BRICS, the dynamic between Trump and Putin matters. If Russia faces tighter sanctions, it could accelerate BRICS’ push for alternative financial systems. On the flip side, if Trump opens up new opportunities for Russia, it could give the bloc more breathing room to focus on its long-term goals.

The company announced earlier today that it has reached a $5 million settlement. This ends allegations that Gemini misled regulators during its bid to launch America’s first Bitcoin futures contract. This settlement is part of the ongoing conflict between the crypto industry and regulators. It reflects the changing policies influenced by shifting political climates. Gemini’s Regulatory Hurdles: A Case of Misrepresentation? The controversy dates back to 2017 when Gemini Trust submitted proposals to the CFTC to launch future contracts for Bitcoin. However ,the CFTC alleged that Gemini misrepresented critical safeguards to prevent price manipulation. These safeguards were supposed to form the backbone of a trusted financial product, yet the regulator argued Gemini fell short of expectations. Fast forward to January 2025, just weeks before a trial was set to unravel in Manhattan federal court , Gemini and the CFTC struck a deal. Gemini agreed to pay $5 million to settle the claims, neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. This settlement underscores the legal tightrope walked by crypto firms aiming to push boundaries while facing increasing scrutiny. Ripple Effects in the Crypto Landscape Gemini’s settlement coincides with broader regulatory movements, including the high-profile Ripple SEC case. Former SEC enforcement lawyer Marc Fagel recently predicted a possible settlement in the ongoing lawsuit against Ripple . He pointed to the incoming Trump administration, which is expected to take a more industry-friendly approach. As SEC Chair Paul Atkins prepares to take the reins, many expect regulatory leniency to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has already attributed a surge in U.S. business activity to what he dubbed the “ Trump effect .” In a recent X post, he shared that 75% of Ripple’s hiring is now U.S.-based. This shift is driven by a surge in domestic deals following Trump’s election victory. Ripple’s newly launched RLUSD stablecoin has also gained prominence, surpassing competitors like PYUSD and EURC in trading volume. Biden’s Legacy vs. Trump’s Crypto Promise The settlement is an important moment in the broader narrative of U.S. crypto regulation. Under President Biden, more actions were taken against crypto companies, showing a tougher approach to market rules. The Gemini case was one of many, as regulators worked to ensure fairness and prevent abuse in the growing crypto market. However, with President Trump returning to office, regulations may change. Known for supporting the industry, Trump’s administration is expected to be more lenient with crypto rules.

Why Are Pengu and Meme Coins Facing Fierce Competition,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/1fuel-or-dogecoin-why-are-pengu-and-meme-coins-facing-fierce-competition,"Meme coins have long been driven by internet hype, but now they are facing increasing competition from utility tokens like 1Fuel in the crypto space. Some top meme coins are Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), but they are now overshadowed by 1Fuel. 1Fuel is now in its presale stage, and allows investors to purchase the OFT token at a very low price before the value goes up by 100x in 2025. But why is 1Fuel a strong competitor to these meme coins? Continue reading to learn why 1Fuel is attracting the attention of savvy investors. Meme Coins Face Strong Competition in the Crypto Space Dogecoin, known as the largest meme coin by market cap, has seen an impressive growth. It is currently valued at $0.3877, which is a major 383.87% increase from 2024. Similarly, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has reached a value of $0.04211. The value skyrocketed by an impressive 742.40% in 2024 alone. There’s a lot of optimism around DOGE investors since analysts predict it would reach the $1 mark. As for PENGU, its predictions go between $0.086 and $0.1 by the end of the year. Both tokens are easily stored on well-known platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Despite their impressive growth potential, meme coins like DOGE and PENGU face strong competition from utility tokens in the crypto space. These meme coins rely heavily on social media trends and internet hype, which do not provide sustainable long-term growth. Due to this, smart investors consider utility tokens as top cryptocurrencies to invest in. Why 1Fuel Offers an Edge in DeFi Innovation 1Fuel OFT is one of the tokens challenging the dominance of meme coins in the crypto space. One of 1Fuel’s top features is its cross-chain transaction capability, which allows you to easily interact with different blockchain networks from a single wallet. This makes it stand out from other top platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. 1Fuel is highly committed to user privacy, as it features an inbuilt mixer that keeps all transactions confidential. This is unlike many platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, which offer limited privacy features. With these innovations, 1Fuel is quickly becoming one of the top utility tokens in the market, setting the stage for long-term growth. Investors Rush to Secure 1Fuel from its Presale As meme coins like DOGE and PENGU face increased competition, investors are turning their attention to 1Fuel . It is now in its presale stage and offering the token at its lowest-ever price of $0.012. With the presale already surpassing the $1 million mark and over 114 million tokens sold in record time, it’s clear that investors are highly confident in the token’s future. The presale’s rapid success speaks volume about investor enthusiasm, making it one of the top utility tokens. With its DEX wallet features standing out among platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, 1Fuel has become a standard tool for interacting with blockchains. The Crypto Space Leans Towards from 1Fuel As the 1Fuel live presale progresses, more and more investors are taking advantage of this opportunity to secure their stake before its public release. The crypto space is leaning towards 1Fuel, and investors can take advantage of this enticing opportunity before it's too late.

The swap will shift the stablecoin from other blockchains to Tron network to improve the communication between the supported chains. Details of the Tether USDT Chain Swap to Tron Network On January 6, Tether revealed via its X account that it is coordinating with a top third-party exchange to move $1 billion worth of USDT. The swap will involve transferring a portion of the stablecoin held in cold wallets to the Tron blockchain. Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, is currently available on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. The issuer clarified that the process will not alter the total USDT supply but will ensure that liquidity is optimized across various networks. This mechanism enables traders and users to leverage their assets on any blockchain supported by the crypto firm. Meanwhile, the stablecoin issuer recently joined the bandwagon of firms increasing their Bitcoin reserves, adding 7,629 BTC worth $705.25 million. The funds, transferred from Bitfinex after nine months of dormancy, bring Tether’s total Bitcoin holdings to 82,983 BTC. Acquired for $2.99 billion, these holdings are now valued at $7.68 billion, reflecting its growing Bitcoin strategy. USDT’s Dominance in the Stablecoin Market Furthermore, USDT remains on top of the list in the stablecoin market cap with a value of more than $137 billion. Its main application areas are in payment systems, trading, and cross-border transactions . The stablecoin has recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $107 billion, a 69% jump in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, the second popular stablecoin, the USDC, has a market cap of $45.8 billion and a daily trading volume of $7.7 billion. However, Tether’s stability pegged to the U.S. dollar has made it an essential tool for traders in the crypto market. Nonetheless, despite the growing dominance, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has accused Tether of market manipulation following its recent 7,629 BTC purchase. Schiff claimed that the stablecoin issuer mints USDT “out of thin air” to acquire Bitcoin, likening it to quantitative easing. While Tether backs USDT with reserves and conducts audits, Schiff continues to question its practices. Role of Chain Swaps in the Crypto Ecosystem Chain swaps play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by enabling seamless asset transfers between blockchains. This allows users to access liquidity and trading opportunities across multiple blockchains, enhancing market efficiency. The stablecoin issuer decision to facilitate a chain swap to Tron underscores its commitment to maintaining liquidity across supported networks. The Tron blockchain remains one of the primary platforms for USDT, driving substantial trading activity. However, despite its dominance, the stablecoin issuer has not been without some challenges. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, proposed in December last year, has impacted the stablecoin market directly.

Per the South Korean media outlet NoCut News , a branch of the Daegu District Court found the group guilty of violating the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information, the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act, and obstructing business. ‘Kimchi Premium’ Crypto Trading Gang Jailed None of the gang’s names were released for legal reasons. But a man referred to as “A” (age 43), was identified as the group’s ringleader. The court jailed him for three and a half years. The presiding judge sentenced another defendant to two years and two months in prison. Kimchi premium prices (Bitcoin) at the time of writing. (Source: Cryprice) The presiding judge jailed a third individual for two years. The group’s final member was given a suspended 18-month sentence and ordered to perform 160 hours of community service. The Daegu District Court also handed out fines, including an “approximately 3 billion won” (over $2 million) bill for A. The judge also ordered the group to pay legal and other “additional” fees. Prosecutors told the court that the group worked with “investors” in Japan. They took tokens from Japan-based vendors and resold them in South Korea to “make a profit.” They did this at a time when the “ kimchi premium ” was at a periodic high, prosecutors said. The kimchi premium is a phenomenon whereby high retail demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins leads to tokens trading on South Korean exchanges at much higher prices than on international platforms. At its highest point (circa 2020-2021), the premium rose above the 35% mark.

The court heard that the group “received approximately 27 billion won [$18.5 million] in return” for its services.

Recently, Cardano recorded 20 million transactions in just two days, highlighting its robust scalability. Predictions are also favorable for Stellar, with an expected 471% rise in a bullish market scenario. BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves with the buzz around its cinematic-style Keynote 3, rumored to be in collaboration with a notable Hollywood producer. As an emerging foundational blockchain project, BlockDAG has accumulated over $176 million from its presale, paving the way with significant technological leaps. As the year 2024 winds down, these cryptocurrencies are certainly ones to keep an eye on. Here’s a deeper look at what makes them stand out. What’s Behind Cardano’s 20M Transactions Surge? Ranked ninth globally by market cap, Cardano (ADA) has experienced substantial activity, recording over 20 million transactions in the past two days. Factors such as Cardano’s advances in decentralized governance, especially CIP-1694, may be influencing this surge. Notably, Intersect recently moved the Plomin hard fork governance proposal to the ratification stage, signaling a step forward in Cardano’s on-chain governance. As 2024 concludes, the spike in Cardano transactions signals a robust interest, potentially driving more accumulation as ADA’s price increases from $0.887 after a minor dip to $0.85. Stellar’s Market Outlook: Anticipating a 471% Jump Stellar’s (XLM) market trajectory looks promising, with analysts forecasting a significant 471% increase, based on Fibonacci Extension levels in optimistic market conditions. The growth is supported by Stellar’s expanding ecosystem, including strategic partnerships and enhancements in smart contracts. Despite a recent 10% downturn bringing Stellar close to oversold conditions, it maintains a trading price of $0.3532 with a market cap of $10 billion, keeping market watchers optimistic about its potential to reach $2.12, and even $8 in highly favorable conditions. Is BlockDAG Teaming Up with a Hollywood Producer for Keynote 3? BlockDAG is gearing up for its highly anticipated Keynote 3, slated for release in 2025. This presentation is expected to break new ground, rumored to feature a cinematic collaboration with a renowned Hollywood producer. This pioneering method aims to redefine the presentation of blockchain advancements by integrating engaging storytelling with the latest technological innovations. The centerpiece of the keynote will be BlockDAG’s Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture. This cutting-edge architecture tackles the longstanding scalability challenges faced by traditional blockchains. Unlike conventional linear blockchain systems, DAG allows for more efficient transaction processing, which leads to quicker confirmation times and lower energy consumption. Moreover, BlockDAG’s compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) increases its attractiveness, enabling developers to effortlessly migrate their decentralized applications to this more advanced platform. This compatibility not only expands the ecosystem’s functionality but also attracts a broader range of developers. These groundbreaking features have significantly fueled interest in BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, which has now amassed over $176 million and sold more than 17.7 billion BDAG coins. Priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, the presale has provided an astonishing 2380% return to early participants since its inception. With these compelling figures, BlockDAG is establishing itself as a formidable leader in the cryptocurrency arena. The Crypto Coins to Keep an Eye on as 2024 Ends! As 2024 draws to a close, the crypto landscape is marked by significant achievements and promising prospects. Cardano’s transaction surge underscores its leading position, while Stellar’s market potential continues to attract bullish forecasts. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s upcoming Keynote 3, merging cinematic storytelling with cutting-edge technology, is setting a new standard for crypto presentations. Spotlighting its innovative DAG architecture and EVM compatibility, BlockDAG remains a prominent cryptocurrency to watch into 2025.

The traffic on L2 is more than 4.5 times higher than Ethereum transactions, signaling a permanent shift to scalable chains. L2 chains, led by Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, invite more than 4.5 times the traffic of Ethereum (ETH). On the main L1 chain, transactions stabilized around 1.16M, shifting toward high-value stablecoin transfers, ETH movements, and fewer swaps or NFT activities. L2 activity growth was mostly due to the effect of Base, but other top chains provided a robust baseline of transactions. | Source: GrowThePie More of the complex transactions shifted to L2, where each chain holds a specific profile. DeFi activity and liquidity from stablecoins has accumulated to Arbitrum and a handful of top chains, drawing in users for easier DEX swaps. As a result, L2 activity has posted new records for months. On a weekly basis, L2 activity passed the 10M users milestone, with just 1.96M for Ethereum on a weekly basis. Users are active in the Ethereum Ecosystem – Last weeks stats: Over 10,000,000 Addresses interacted with 1 or more Layer 2. Over 1,960,000 Addresses interacted with Ethereum Layer 1. pic.twitter.com/eMXlz3Yyk2 — growthepie.xyz 🥧📏 (@growthepie_eth) January 6, 2025 While Base remains the leader with high-speed transactions, some of the traffic remains tied to organic DEX trading and DeFi lending on the other top L2 chains. Base also gets a boost from CbBTC traffic, while also accumulating $3.49B in value locked. Stablecoins are also one of the drivers of L2 adoption. In the first days of 2025, L2 held more than $11B in bridged or native stablecoins, where Arbitrum was the leader with $6.35B. Base was in second place, with $3.5B worth of stablecoins. The rising trend reflects the strong baseline from Arbitrum, but most of the expansion still comes from Base. The chain is among the top carriers of DeFi, through its version of Uniswap and the Aerodrome high-liquidity DEX. Arbitrum is close behind based on DeFi activity, reaching $33.6M on a daily time frame. Most L2 chains slowed down significantly after the end of their airdrop mining activity. Returning to organic traffic has been a struggle for multiple chains. Base is still not officially preparing for an airdrop, though there are still expectations for a native token in the future. L2 chains grow based on specialized activities Linea, while carrying smaller traffic, remains instrumental for L2 activity in NFT swaps and decentralized social media. Optimism serves as an all-purpose utility chain, while ZKSync Era has the biggest share of simple token transfers. Arbitrum is the biggest hub for cross-chain activity, with more than $15M on a daily basis. Overall, L2 do not communicate between chains, but rely on bridging and flows to and from Ethereum. Additionally, dozens of smaller networks aim for specialized tasks, such as gaming or a specific DEX. However, newer networks may lack liquidity, and older ones may be unwilling to become interoperable. Growing L2 traffic leads to fee and block space competition The growing traffic also makes L2 more expensive, with regular spikes in rent paid to Ethereum. While the rent is small compared to Ethereum’s block production incentives, there is a shift from the previous months of near-zero payments. To compare, Base at one point paid no more than $3,000 for its activity, while a recent spike led to $93,000 in daily rent paid to Ethereum. The increased on-chain activity means chain operators may choose how to post to Ethereum. Data shows Arbitrum switches between blobs and calldata, depending on which one is cheaper at the moment. However, this L2 activity actually takes up block space on Ethereum, making regular transactions more expensive. Ethereum transactions are still more expensive at $1.10, with regular price spikes for specialized tasks. Arbitrum retains $0.09 per transaction, though even L2 are not offering virtually free transfers. However, Arbitrum swaps can go as low as $0.27, while Ethereum DEX deals can cost $21.38 without special priority or additional block-builder payments. L2 chains retain real economic activity and the top ones show robust demand. However, the L2 narrative remained subdued. A total of 127 high-profile chains were launched, each competing for either niche or mass activity.

Here’s How High ADA Could Pump in 2025,https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-to-7-80-heres-how-high-ada-could-pump-in-2025/,"The Cardano (ADA) price looks poised to pump back to its December highs in the low $1.30s, with chart analysis painting a bullish picture for ADA’s near-term outlook. Could this be the start of a new pump that could take ADA as high as $7.80? ADA was last changing hands around $1.10, having pumped over $0.25 or over 30% since the start of the year. That pump saw the Cardano price break to the north of a downtrend in play since early December, as well as back above its 21 and 50DMAs, suggestive that the bulls have retaken control of the market. Over the last few days, the ADA rally has stalled, with the Cardano price forming a range in the $1.056-$1.118 area. But with Bitcoin (BTC) having broken back above $100,000 and seemingly carrying strong momentum, the mood in the broader crypto market looks set to remain positive ahead of the arrival of the incoming Trump administration in two weeks. Trump’s administration is the most pro-crypto in history, marking a full 180-degree reversal from the anti-crypto stance of the outgoing Biden administration. That, coupled with the start of a new pro-crypto Congressional session, means crypto markets are on the cusp of entering a new golden age. Trump’s crypto Czar, David Sacks, on Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/M6fi1Y3iiL — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) December 6, 2024 Perhaps Trump’s arrival in office might be a “sell-the-news” event. But that is still two weeks away, so its very likely altcoin markets and the Cardano price could continue to rally in the upcoming sessions. Strong Year for ADA Likely Coming Most signs suggest that this crypto bull market still has plenty of room to run. Firstly, Bitcoin only just recently entered the final and most explosive phase of its four-year cycle, which typically runs between 6-18 months of the halving (which took place last April). That, combined with rapidly rising institutional adoption and the possibility of the establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve this year, should keep the world’s largest crypto pumping in 2025. But there are also signs that altcoin season has yet to really get going this cycle, of which Cardano could be a major beneficiary. Bitcoin dominance has only just recently started to show signs that it is starting to break down after breaking below a long-term uptrend. During the 2021 bull cycle, a similar breakout was the precursor for a massive altcoin season that saw assets like Cardano post massive gains. Cardano also has a bunch of narratives that could help it pump hard if a new altcoin season is right around the corner. ADA is set to pivot to becoming a Bitcoin DeFi chain as soon as May. Meanwhile, the incoming SEC Chair may back off from the outgoing anti-crypto SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s position that ADA is an unregistered security. Moreover, it’s co-founder and biggest advocate Charles Hoskinson might secure a position in the White House as an advisor to incoming President Trump , which could help bolster Cardano’s adoption in the USA.

Looks like Cardano users see polymarket as a “nice poll” pic.twitter.com/ktjq0W60KP — 竜 SM₳UG (@SmaugPool) January 6, 2025 How High Can ADA Pump This Bull Market? Many signs thus point towards Cardano pumping hard in 2025. So how high might it go? Well, during its 2020/2021 bull run, Cardano rallied to the 2.618 Fibonacci extension beyond its 2017 record highs. If it can match the same feat during this bull run, that would imply an ADA price of around $7.80. That would mean gains of almost exactly 7x from current levels. As a result, Cardano could be great candidate for best crypto to buy now . Cardano Risks to Consider That said, potential investors need to be aware of risks to the Cardano outlook. The main one is that, despite its massive market cap of around $50 billion, Cardano has very little on-chain adoption to show for it. Its TVL of crypto in smart contracts is still yet to hit $1 billion, per DeFi Llama , and compared to its major rivals (like Ethereum or Solana), Cardano lags in terms of transaction activity and dApp activity in a big way. Crypto investors are advised not to put their eggs all in one basket (unless that basket is Bitcoin!) and should consider diversifying exposure across a few different high potential altcoin plays.

This mixed reaction highlights the uncertainty surrounding the XRP price’s ability to sustain an upward trajectory, leaving investors to weigh their options carefully. As XRP price momentum slows down, savvy investors are shifting focus to RCO Finance (RCOF), an AI altcoin emerging as a Ripple rival. With its advanced AI features and a potential of 20,000x ROI, RCO Finance is a game changer in the crypto market. XRP Price Trajectory Slows Down The XRP price is changing hands at $2.48, a 1.3% rise in the past 24 hours and a 15.8% rise in the past week. The XRP price just broke out of a falling wedge, a typical bullish signal, but the breakout closed red. The impact is that it signals the XRP price isn’t gaining momentum as expected. Analysts predict that the next key level for XRP price is $2.90, aligning with a projection of an upward spiral. But, the analysts feel that the breakout strength is still in question. If the XRP price doesn’t break out of this level, it could retract to $2.00 or even $1.47, which are the critical support levels before a stronger move. RCO Finance: Emerging AI Altcoin Targeting 20,000x ROI The XRP price movement has left investors at a crossroads, as its recent breakout for a falling wedge shows bullish momentum.

This anticipated market uptick presents an excellent opportunity for strategic investments in cryptocurrencies with significant potential. Amidst a crowded field of contenders, pinpointing top crypto coins for the 2025 bull run is vital for optimizing investment outcomes. These top cryptocurrencies are notable for their cutting-edge technologies and robust community support, positioning them to excel in the rapidly evolving blockchain environment. Notably, the Web3Bay presale is at the forefront, recognized for its potential to revolutionize decentralized ecosystems. 1. Web3Bay Presale: Pioneering Decentralization The Web3Bay presale is capturing attention with its innovative approach to blockchain-based solutions. By providing decentralized tools for both users and developers, Web3Bay aims to streamline interactions within the crypto ecosystem. The success of its presale underscores significant community engagement, and the token’s increasing use across various Web3 applications could lead to considerable gains by 2025. Currently in its third presale phase, priced at $0.0039675 with $420,000 raised, Web3Bay is projected to achieve a launch price of $0.1959, offering early investors a potential ROI of 6,430%. The token’s defined applications, from NFT integrations to decentralized finance platforms, coupled with early support from key industry influencers, position Web3Bay as one of the top crypto coins for high-growth opportunities. 2. Floki (FLOKI): Beyond a Meme Coin Floki stands out in the crypto market by melding the charm of meme coins with substantial utility. Its ecosystem spans NFT marketplaces, play-to-earn gaming platforms, and educational projects. Supported by a dynamic community and strategic promotional efforts, Floki combines entertainment with investment potential, set for further expansion in the upcoming bull run. 3. Fetch.ai (FET): Bridging AI with Blockchain Fetch.ai is a leader in merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its platform enables autonomous agents to enhance efficiency in various sectors, including supply chain, finance, and transportation.

Developments in Fetch.ai’s partnerships and ecosystem expansion are closely monitored by investors. 4. Immutable (IMX): Advancing NFT Gaming Immutable has become a significant player in NFT gaming and blockchain gaming infrastructure. Its Layer 2 scaling solution facilitates seamless NFT transactions, essential for both developers and gamers. As the gaming and metaverse sectors continue to grow, Immutable’s technology will likely play a vital role in their success. Its partnerships with prominent gaming studios and platforms further bolster its prospects for 2025. 5. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Evolving from Meme to Utility Shiba Inu has evolved from a mere meme coin to a utility-rich ecosystem supported by the Shibarium blockchain. It encompasses decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, and staking mechanisms, attracting a broad base of retail investors. Its accessible price point and active community base make it a popular choice for rapid gains during bullish periods. The 2025 bull run could propel SHIB to new heights as its ecosystem continues to mature.

33767162,[object Object],1736208038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,90% Of Bitcoin Supply In Profit – Could This Cycle Mirror The 2017 Bull Run?,https://bitcoinist.com/90-of-bitcoin-supply-in-profit-could-this-cycle-mirror-the-2017-bull-run/,"Bitcoin is on the verge of a historic breakout, consolidating just below the highly anticipated $100K mark. After surging over 8% since the start of the year, the leading cryptocurrency has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. While the market remains cautiously optimistic, all eyes are on BTC for confirmation of its next big move. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared insightful data on X, revealing that 90% of the total Bitcoin supply is currently in profit. This key metric highlights the strength of BTC’s recent rally and underscores the widespread optimism in the market. Adler notes that such high levels of profitability typically align with bullish market conditions, fueling expectations for a breakout above $100K. The psychological and technical significance of the $100K mark cannot be overstated. A decisive move above this level could signal the start of a new phase in BTC’s bull cycle, inviting fresh capital and sparking renewed enthusiasm across the crypto space. However, as the price consolidates, investors are cautiously awaiting confirmation. Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looking Strong Despite the uncertainty and negative sentiment surrounding Bitcoin’s failure to break above the $100K mark, the current market cycle remains robust and bullish. BTC continues to hold key demand levels, reinforcing its bullish structure. Sideways consolidations, often misunderstood as stagnation, are critical for setting up large-scale moves, allowing the market to build momentum. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insightful data on X , highlighting the market’s resilience. Currently, 90% of the total Bitcoin supply is in profit, a strong indicator of market health. According to Adler, if the current cycle avoids “black swan” events—unpredictable and disruptive occurrences—the market could follow a trajectory similar to the 2017 bull cycle. During that period (depicted as “blue square #1”), Bitcoin demonstrated a bullish trend with minimal pullbacks, maintaining a metric level of 80%. Adler also reflected on the 2021 cycle (blue square #2), suggesting it could have followed the same bullish path if not for the disruptive effects of the China mining ban. This event momentarily derailed the upward trend, emphasizing how external shocks can influence market dynamics. As Bitcoin consolidates below $100K, its current pattern reflects a healthy cycle poised for further growth. Investors are closely watching for a breakout above this psychological barrier, which could signal the start of the next bullish phase. With strong fundamentals and minimal disruptions, Bitcoin’s path forward looks increasingly promising. Technical Analysis: Key Liquidity Levels Bitcoin is trading at $99,100 after a robust rebound from the 4-hour 200 moving average at $98,299. The price also found support at the 4-hour 200 EMA, a key technical indicator that signals strength in the short term. This bounce has left investors optimistic about the potential for a bullish continuation in the coming days. If BTC manages to break decisively above the critical $100K mark, it would pave the way for a massive rally into uncharted territory. A confirmed breakout at this psychological and technical level is likely to attract significant buying pressure, further strengthening Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. However, risks remain. Should BTC fail to reclaim $100K in the near term, the market could enter a prolonged consolidation phase, testing investor patience and allowing for liquidity to accumulate. A failure to maintain the current bullish structure could also lead to a deeper correction, potentially revisiting lower support levels.

After announcing late last year that it had purchased ¥1 billion worth of Bitcoins, the Japanese company is making headlines again by announcing its plans to increase its holdings to 10,000 Bitcoins. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Hit $1? Expert Calls It A Realistic Goal For 2025 – Here’s Why Metaplanet’s decision to double down on the world’s top digital asset comes during favorable political and economic conditions, with analysts expecting that Bitcoin may hit $200k soon. Currently, Metaplanet boasts 1,762 Bitcoins, worth $173.4 million, and is one of the top companies following MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investing playbook. CEO Announces Target Of 10k Bitcoins CEO Simon Gerovich shared the company’s latest investment plan in a New Year post for shareholders. In a Twitter/X post last January 5th, Gerovick acknowledged the company’s exceptional performance, where it expanded its Bitcoin holdings and solidified its standing as the region’s biggest holder of digital assets. In the lengthy message, he reiterated the company’s commitment to the asset and boosting shareholder value. Happy New Year to Our Valued Shareholders! As we step into 2025, I couldn’t be more excited about what lies ahead for Metaplanet. Last year was transformational, as we broke records, expanded our Bitcoin treasury, and reinforced our position as Asia’s leading Bitcoin Treasury… pic.twitter.com/K2HsOS8TaZ — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) January 5, 2025 Gerovick announced at least four targets for Metaplanet this year. The company’s primary target is to expand its BTC holdings to 10k Bitcoin. In addition, Metaplanet also plans to boost transparency, leverage partnerships to promote Bitcoin adoption and explore other innovative opportunities that can grow the company’s influence in the Bitcoin and blockchain niche. Investing Plans Come At A Time Of Favorable Conditions The Japanese company’s aggressive moves into the crypto space come during favorable market conditions and better price prospects. Both Bitwise and VanEck predict that Bitcoin will trade anywhere from $180k to $200k this year. They believe that the top digital asset can trade at higher price points if the US government approves the plan to adopt the strategic digital asset reserve. Other analysts are offering bolder price predictions for Bitcoin and potentially better performance from altcoins thanks to a second Trump administration. According to Gerovich, if the US government pushes with the Bitcoin strategic reserves, then others can follow suit. Metaplanet’s CEO added that Japan is one of the first countries to follow, and other Asian countries will implement the same initiative.

He then teases his followers, saying that 2025 will be another breakout year for Metaplanet in terms of innovation, progress, and success. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings are currently the biggest in Asia and 15th among global public companies. The company first started investing in Bitcoin last year, as Bitcoin surged considerably due to increased institutional adoption.

The attackers reportedly targeted him, falsely believing he possessed an immense amount of Bitcoin. The incident has left the man and his family in a precarious situation as they move from one temporary residence to another, fearing for their safety. Crypto Forum Moderator Targeted in Bitcoin Kidnapping The alleged incident, which took place in November 2024, started when two masked people allegedly got close to the Crypto forum’s house. As per the statement , the suspects escaped from the scene after the man closed the door on them. A few days later, the victim saw the masked men in an unmarked vehicle near his house while he was taking his child to daycare. The suspects are said to have followed the man onto a main road. When the situation worsened, he was on the phone with the police when the suspect vehicle turned and three of its occupants escaped on foot. Shortly after, the driver of the vehicle reportedly came out and confronted the victim, and another suspect brandished a firearm. The man stated that he used bear spray as a way of protecting himself from the suspects until the police came in to arrest the duo. Claims of Torture Equipment Discovered In the report, the Crypto forum moderator stated that the suspects intended to kidnap and torture him in order to get his cryptocurrency. The police investigations suggested that the attackers thought he had 2.5 million Bitcoins worth billions of dollars because he was a moderator of a cryptocurrency Facebook group. ‘The guys had equipment to torture me,’ the man said to La Presse. They had a tarp with a hole in the middle and claws to cut off a limb and stop the bleeding. It’s incredibly violent.” The victim claimed that his actual BTC investment was $10,000 which is like 0.1 of a Bitcoin as per current price. Suspects Released on House Arrest Four suspects, two of which are adults and two are juveniles, were taken into custody in relation to the event. The adults are to be charged with conspiracy to kidnap and use of prohibited firearms. However, all these four suspects were released on house arrest to await their trial that is set to commence in March. The release of the suspects has been a matter of concern to the family of the Crypto forum moderator since there is a possibility of their attack. The family was told by the authorities that they should move away from the area saying that the suspects could be linked to organised crime. The family has since been transferring from one short term lease house to another in an effort to flee any danger. A representative of Quebec’s provincial police, Sûreté du Québec stated that although the police offer guidance to victims, they cannot offer round the clock protection. ”We do not advise people to change their address but it is one of the measures we are considering, the other ones are to change the locks or to install cameras and alarms,” the spokesperson said. Despite this, the victim has expressed frustration over the suspects’ release, stating it has forced his family into hiding. “The police told us they can’t ensure our safety,” he said, adding that his family has been burning through their savings to stay safe. The man also revealed that the Youth Protection Department (DPJ) became involved after rumors of the incident spread at his children’s school.

From quirky characters to wild community-driven hype, these coins are about fun, innovation, and serious profits. Today, we’re diving into three of the best new meme coins to join now: BTFD Coin , Dogs, and Pudgy Penguins. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or someone just getting your feet wet, these coins capture attention for all the right reasons. The rise of meme coins has been nothing short of spectacular. They started as jokes but have become legitimate investment opportunities with massive communities. Coins like Dogecoin paved the way, showing that humour and community spirit can have a real monetary value. Now, BTFD Coin is leading the next wave, combining meme magic with robust financial benefits like a 90% APY on staking . Let’s talk about BTFD Coin—it’s a game-changer. Its presale has already raised over $5 million and is only just starting. Meanwhile, Dogs and Pudgy Penguins are creating their own buzz, proving that the meme coin craze is far from over. Keep reading to find out why these coins are worth your attention. BTFD Coin: Staking Your Way to Unmatched Gains BTFD Coin is shaking up the meme coin market with a killer mix of humor and real financial perks. Forget about coins that only make you laugh; this one’s stacking up real gains. If you haven’t heard, the presale is in its 13th stage , with the coin priced at $0.000142. Over 62 billion BTFD coins have been sold to 7,700+ holders, and there’s no slowing down. The standout feature? That 90% APY on staking. Imagine earning nearly double your investment by simply staking your coins. Crypto enthusiasts are flocking to this project because it offers a rare way to blend the meme coin hype with serious long-term rewards. Analysts predict BTFD Coin could skyrocket once it hits major exchanges, and the current presale price might seem like peanuts compared to its future value. You put $1,000 into BTFD Coin during its current presale at $0.000142 per coin. That gives you roughly 7,042,254 coins. Imagine the price skyrocketing to $0.0006 after the presale—a totally realistic possibility considering the coin’s momentum and the buzz driving it. Dogs: Man’s Best Friend, Now Crypto’s Best Bet Dogs are stealing the spotlight in the meme coin universe. Whether you’re talking about loyalty, cuteness, or viral potential, this coin has all the elements to charm its way into your wallet. Dogs, inspired by our four-legged companions, combines heartwarming branding with community-driven momentum. Its recent social media campaigns have exploded, pushing the coin’s value higher. Recent developments have further solidified Dogs’ position in the crypto market. In August 2024, Dogs was listed on Binance’s Launchpool, significantly boosting its trading volume and market visibility. This listing allowed users to stake their Binance Coin (BNB) and other tokens to farm Dogs, increasing accessibility and driving adoption. Although its price reached an all-time high of $0.001633, it has since stabilised around $0.000565 as of January 2025, reflecting broader market trends. The Dogs project continues to focus on community engagement, leveraging social media platforms to build a loyal following. Its upcoming plans for NFT collaborations and charitable donations to animal shelters highlight its commitment to making an impact beyond just financial gains. This combination of utility and heartwarming branding sets Dogs apart in a crowded field. Imagine waking up one morning to see your Dogs investment doubling or tripling. It’s happened with other meme coins, and there’s no reason Dogs can’t follow suit. The buzz is real, and the community support is massive. If you’re a dog lover with a penchant for smart investments, Dogs might be your perfect match. Pudgy Penguins: The Coolest Meme Coin on Ice Pudgy Penguins has become a standout in the meme coin space, combining charm and bold strategy to capture the public’s imagination. The project’s native token, PENGU, has grown 13% on January 5 and marked a staggering 250% increase since its December 17 launch. Trading at $0.040 with a market cap of $2.5 billion, PENGU is a testament to the power of a well-executed meme coin. But it’s not just the numbers grabbing attention. Pudgy Penguins’ marketing strategies are breaking new ground. With over 1.1 billion GIF and sticker views in just the first five days of January, the project’s viral campaigns on Instagram and TikTok have helped propel it to new heights. The team’s approach—leveraging humour, nostalgia, and community spirit—has made Pudgy Penguins a household name in the crypto world. Despite the buzz, some large holders are cashing out, taking advantage of the rally. On January 4, a wallet withdrew 84 million PENGU tokens, worth $3.13 million, from Binance. Meanwhile, NFT sales have dipped by 52% in the past week, reflecting a broader cooling trend. Still, Pudgy Penguins remains the second-largest NFT collection by market cap at $721 million, trailing only CryptoPunks. Looking ahead, PENGU is poised for further growth. Operating on Solana, with plans to expand to Ethereum and Abstract, an Ethereum layer-2 solution, the token’s potential use cases include governance and access to exclusive ecosystem perks. With a total supply of 88.88 billion tokens, 25.9% of which are allocated to NFT holders via airdrops, Pudgy Penguins continues to innovate and capture attention. PENGU’s blend of utility and charm makes it one of the best new meme coins to join now. Whether you’re drawn by its viral marketing, NFT pedigree, or long-term potential, Pudgy Penguins is a project worth watching. Conclusion: The Time to Join is Now BTFD Coin, Dogs, and Pudgy Penguins are hands down the best new meme coins to join now.

The token’s delay, which at first was attributed to the fundraising, such as the $12 million venture capital round in April 2024 for the Layer-3 privacy blockchain, created some confusion. However, the Shiba Inu team has recently announced that the token will not be launched to the public before January 14. Despite the official confirmation, misinformation has been circulating. A user known as CryptoMumms posted that the TREAT token had already been launched in January of 2023. This claim and the fake TREAT token have led to a lot of confusion among the Shiba Inu community. Treat did not stealth launch years ago. This simply isn't true. — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) January 5, 2025 This fake token is currently operating on ShibaSwap through the wallet contract address “0xFBD…146B” and has been misleading people about its existence. DEXTools shows that its market capitalization is $2.86 million; however, the Shiba Inu team has confirmed that this is not the real TREAT token. Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous leader of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, also addressed these allegations in public. He pointed out that TREAT has not been launched and asked the community not to interact with this fake token. On X, Kusama posted a video that was quite comedic in nature and showed how pointless the entire thing was. He further backed up the message with a caution to avoid falling for such narratives. TREAT’s role in Shiba Inu’s ecosystem The TREAT token is essential for Shiba Inu’s vision of becoming fully decentralized. After its launch, it will enable governance, rewards, and real-world use within the ecosystem. Kusama said that the token is a “capstone and key” to Shiba Inu’s future and plans to explain the details in his weekly podcast. TREAT will also support WOOF Wars: Farming 2.0, a sophisticated yield farming system where users will be able to increase their profits. Using veTREAT (vote escrowed TREAT), holders will be able to participate in the governance process. While liquidity providers will get extra rewards. This system is meant to enhance the decentralization of the Shiba Inu network so that its holders can decide on the future of the coin. Besides governance, TREAT will be incorporated into SHIB Pay, an on-chain payment system. This will allow users to make payments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem without involving conventional processors and with the help of blockchain verification. The Shiba Inu team has revealed that TREAT will be instrumental in the future of the crypto-commerce revolution. As of the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002401, a 1% uptrend in the last 24 hours. The token has risen by nearly 10% since the beginning of the year. The Shiba Inu has four tokens in its ecosystem: SHIB, LEASH, BONE, and TREAT.

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 00:33:00

The report also shared that Bitcoin still dominated the crypto exchange-traded funds, accounting for about $573 million of the Bitcoin assets under management in global ETP s . Butterfield further noted in the report that global crypto ETPs recorded about $44.4 billion in net inflows in 2024. CoinShares explained that Bitcoin ETPs dominated the digital asset investment products markets in 2024, accounting for about 29% and $38 billion of all BTC assets under management in global ETPs. Ethereum ETPs came in second, accounting for about $4.5 billion of global crypto ETP inflows last year, accounting for about 26% of all Ethereum assets under management global ETPs. The value was also about 60x more than Ethereum inflows recorded in the ETPs in 2023 and 2.4x more than what was recorded in 2021. Other altcoins registered net inflows of $813 million in 2024, accounting for 18% of all non-ETH altcoin assets under management in crypto investment products. Solana was among the top coins among the other altcoins, recording a $69 million inflow in 2024 and 4% of its total assets under management. The total inflows recorded in 2024 increased above the all-time high experienced in the 2021 bull market. Global crypto investment products reached over $10 billion in net inflows in 2021. The 2024 statistics indicate an over 4x increase compared to the 2021 values. U.S. spot ETFs contribute to the 2024 surge 2024 saw US$44bn inflows in to crypto ETPs, 2025 off to a good start with US$585m inflows so far https://t.co/OczGDBUdph — James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) January 6, 2025 Butterfield attributed the surge in 2024’s global crypto investment products net inflows to the introduction of spot ETFs in the U.S. in January 2024. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 10 and 8 Ether spot ETFs on May 22. The Bitcoin ETFs have accounted for a greater percentage of the inflows recorded since their introduction in 2024. The report highlighted that inflows recorded by digital asset investment products were solely from U.S.-based spot ETFs. The CoinShares head of research explained that the surge in U.S. spot ETFs indicates the products’ impact on other crypto investment products. Butterfield also revealed that the ETFs would change the path crypto investment flows took in the future. The asset management firm’s executive also touched on the recent resurgence seen by Ethereum ETFs at the end of 2024. The ETFs had seen significant outflows before rebounding within the last days of the year. Butterfield suggested that the recovery indicated ETH’s evolution in the digital assets market. CoinShares’ statistics for this year’s net flows indicate that U.S. spot ETFs are still the top performers in the ETP industry. The report also showed that Australia and Switzerland are still showing promise, with about $1.1 million and $8.4 million in inflows, respectively. Galaxy Digital expects U.S. Bitcoin spot ETPs to hit $250 billion in 2025 A Galaxy Digital report from December 31, 2024, predicted the possible trajectory of U.S. spot ETPs in 2025. The report suggested that the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETPs would hit $250 billion in assets under management in 2025. Alex Thorne, Head of Firmwide Research, highlighted in the report that the ETPs were about 19% and $24 billion away from reaching the U.S. gold ETPs. Throne also predicted that Bitcoin would be among the top-performing assets this year. The head of Firmwide Research revealed that the coin remained one of the top 3 performers on a risk-adjusted basis. Thorne further mentioned that his predictions were based on 2024’s Bitcoin and BTC ETPs performances. Another analyst, Christine Kim, revealed that Ether spot ETPs would also likely surge in 2025. According to Kim, the ETPs might get the opportunity to stake some of their Ether for investors. The analyst suggested that the development would come due to possible regulatory changes under Donald Trump’s administration.
