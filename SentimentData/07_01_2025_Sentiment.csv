Web3Bay is doing just that. As other projects shout about their potential, Web3Bay focuses on a steady build-up, positioning itself as a transformative force in online shopping. This underappreciated project is gearing up for significant impact, making now a prime time for discerning crypto enthusiasts to engage. How Web3Bay Is Reinventing E-Commerce Web3Bay is more than your typical blockchain initiative. It’s pioneering a new way of shopping online—without middlemen, reducing fees, enhancing data privacy, and ensuring secure, user-driven transactions. But why isn’t this making more noise? Web3Bay prefers real progress over flashy promotion. Its presale stages are designed to benefit early supporters discreetly, attracting genuine interest over fleeting speculation. Those looking for the best investments to watch right now see Web3Bay’s groundwork as especially compelling. The Value of Web3Bay Tokens Currently, Web3Bay tokens, named 3BAY, are available at the low price of $0.0039675 during the third presale stage. Early buyers stand to see significant gains, with token prices projected to reach $0.1959—a 6,430% increase by the end of the presale. So far, the presale has raised over $420,000 and sold 110 million tokens, signaling strong market trust. However, this valuation doesn’t yet match the platform’s full future potential. Why Web3Bay Is a Game-Changer in Online Shopping Web3Bay’s model is simple and globally applicable. It tackles issues like excessive fees, opacity, and privacy—problems that millions encounter online. By employing blockchain, the platform promises lower costs, transparency, and better security. Its dual payment system, supporting both cryptocurrencies and traditional methods like PayPal, bridges existing e-commerce with blockchain innovation, making it accessible to a broad audience. Why Join Web3Bay’s Presale Now In blockchain ventures, timing is crucial. Early involvement in Web3Bay could differentiate between modest earnings and substantial rewards. Each new presale stage increases token prices by 15%, rewarding proactive participants. Moreover, early investors can influence the platform’s direction through decentralized governance, offering a community-focused alternative to the centralized setups of current e-commerce leaders. This positions Web3Bay as a significant DeFi player and a bullish crypto to monitor. Web3Bay’s Bright Future in Blockchain Commerce Web3Bay has big plans, including introducing an NFT marketplace, DeFi staking options, and cross-chain features to enrich the user experience and extend utility. These steps will attract both blockchain enthusiasts and mainstream users, setting the stage for Web3Bay to become a well-known name in the Web3 arena. With its practical solutions and commitment to decentralization, Web3Bay is set to lead in the evolving e-commerce sector, making it a wise choice among the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Wrapping Up Web3Bay is set for a significant lift-off. Its current undervaluation reflects a market oversight, one that’s quickly adjusting as more recognize its potential. Joining now places you at the forefront of a transformative wave in how we shop online. Web3Bay isn’t just another blockchain project—it’s at the vanguard of redefining buying, selling, and connecting digitally. It stands out as a top DeFi crypto and is poised to dominate in a forthcoming bull market. Get ahead of the curve—join Web3Bay before it becomes mainstream.

Barr is resigning from his position as Vice Chair for Supervision. In a statement , Barr said he didn’t want a potential dispute over the position in the near future to distract from the Fed’s “mission.” “The position of vice chair for supervision was created after the Global Financial Crisis to create greater responsibility, transparency, and accountability for the Federal Reserve’s supervision and regulation of the financial system. The risk of a dispute over the position could be a distraction from our mission. In the current environment, I’ve determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor.” Barr’s resignation comes less than two weeks before pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. In 2023 during a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C., Barr warned about the “special risks associated with stablecoins,” advocating for stiffer regulations on the asset class. Said Barr, “Stablecoin issuers seek to have—but don’t—some of the same characteristics as federally insured bank deposits. Stablecoin issuers represent that their liabilities can be redeemed on demand at par, a dollar for a dollar. In fact, however, the assets backing the liability can fluctuate in value… The banks we regulate, in contrast, are well protected from bank runs through a robust array of supervisory requirements. Consider the consequences if a stablecoin not subject to appropriate supervision and regulation were to be adopted as a widespread means of payment, which some stablecoin developers state as a goal. Stablecoins have the potential to scale quickly because of network effects. An unregulated, unsupervised, deposit-like asset could create tremendous disruptions, not just for financial institutions but for people who might rely on the coin if it were to get wide adoption. We must learn from the past to ensure that we do not allow for new forms of unregulated private money subject to classic forms of run risk, and with the associated spillovers and systemic implications for households, businesses, and the broader economy.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This trial stemmed from the CFTC’s 2022 lawsuit, which accused Gemini of providing false or misleading information during the evaluation of its Bitcoin futures product. The CFTC alleged that between July 2017 and December 2017, Gemini made inaccurate claims about whether its proposed Bitcoin futures contract would be “readily susceptible to manipulation.” Additionally, the lawsuit highlighted that Gemini engaged in undisclosed fee arrangements with specific market participants, such as market makers. These arrangements, designed to boost trading in Gemini’s Auction, were not disclosed to all customers or made available on the company’s website. Under the terms of the settlement, Gemini agreed to pay a $5 million penalty and refrain from making false or misleading statements to the CFTC in the future. While agreeing to the settlement, Gemini neither admitted nor denied the allegations.

Table of Contents Rollblock gaining attention during presale Ethereum tipped to reclaim $4000 XRP slightly declines amid market downturn Shiba Inu suffers with most speculative crypto Solana demonstrates potential Pepe diminishes after a bullish Q4 Conclusion The recent cryptocurrency decline drew parallels to the market dynamics of December 2020. During that period, the dip in prices preceded a historic altcoin rally in Q1-Q2 of 2021, when several assets surged to unprecedented highs. If the 4-year cycle theory holds true, the recent downturn may be setting the stage for another explosive bull run. Ethereum, XRP, Shiba Inu, Solana, Pepe, and Rollblock are all positioned to benefit from this potential resurgence. Rollblock gaining attention during presale Rollblock aims to transform the play-to-earn iGaming sector with its state-of-the-art casino platform that combines strong fundamentals, attractive incentives, and unparalleled growth potential. The platform will have an extensive catalog of over 7,000 games, offering a diverse range of options, from classic favorites like blackjack and poker to cutting-edge blockchain-based titles. Recently, Rollblock expanded its offerings by introducing sports betting, solidifying its position as a leader in the rapidly growing GambleFi market. Security is a top priority for Rollblock, which leverages advanced encryption technologies and AI-powered safeguards to create a transparent and secure environment for both players and investors. The platform’s credibility is further bolstered by its recent SolidProof audit and licensing by Gaming Arjun, establishing its legitimacy as it approaches a highly anticipated bull run ahead of its official launch. One of Rollblock’s standout features is its revenue-sharing system. Up to 30% of weekly profits will be reinvested into token buybacks, with 60% of these tokens burned to reduce supply and drive scarcity. The remaining tokens will be distributed to investors as staking rewards, fostering a loyal community and enhancing RBLK’s long-term value. Ethereum tipped to reclaim $4000 Ethereum recently slipped below the critical $4,000 level during a broader market downturn, temporarily halting its December rally, which had been fueled by strong retail interest and record-breaking inflows into Ethereum ETFs. Despite this dip, optimism remains strong. December saw over $1 billion in ETH accumulation, with 104,000 ETH withdrawn from exchanges, signaling growing confidence among long-term holders. Whale wallets now hold 57% of Ethereum’s total supply — the highest concentration in the platform’s history — demonstrating substantial support from major players. Market analysts anticipate a swift recovery, with Ethereum poised to reclaim the $4,000 mark and potentially surpass its all-time high of $4,891 as early as Q1 2025. As the market stabilizes and the anticipated “alt season” begins in January, Ethereum is set to maintain its leadership position. Its dominance in DeFi, coupled with rising institutional interest and increased whale activity, reinforces Ethereum’s role as a cornerstone of the crypto market and a key player in the next bullish wave. You might also like: Here are the expected bull market top prices for XRP, Solana and Rollblock XRP slightly declines amid market downturn In Q4 of 2024, XRP became one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market, surging over 400%, fueled by speculation surrounding Gary Gensler’s rumored resignation and the pro-crypto sentiment anticipated from Donald Trump’s incoming administration. Adding to the bullish sentiment were whispers of an XRP ETF launch targeted for 2025-2026. However, the mid-December market correction put downward pressure on XRP, weakening its performance on both daily and weekly charts. Despite the short-term decline, XRP has demonstrated notable resilience compared to many altcoins. This relative strength is supported by Ripple’s strategic initiatives, including the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin, which enhances XRP’s utility within the ecosystem. Analysts predict that as Bitcoin dominance eventually cools off, XRP could see a significant influx of new capital, setting the stage for another rally and maintaining its optimistic long-term outlook. Shiba Inu suffers with most speculative crypto After reaching $0.000033 and sparking renewed investor interest earlier in Q4, Shiba Inu has faced a challenging period, declining by over 20% in the past month. This drop coincided with Bitcoin’s price correction below $90,000, which placed additional downward pressure on speculative assets. Despite these setbacks, Shiba Inu demonstrates resilience and ongoing community support. A recent 1,068% spike in the burn rate resulted in the destruction of over 51.7 million tokens, which highlights efforts to reduce supply. Additionally, Shibarium’s total value locked (TVL) has seen an explosive increase of 850% since September, reflecting the growing utility and adoption of Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 solution. At the time of writing, 64% of Shiba Inu holders were in profit, suggesting solid investor confidence even amidst broader market turbulence. As a leader in the meme coin sector, Shiba Inu retains its position as a dominant player, buoyed by its strong community and expanding ecosystem.

The blockchain’s unprecedented 66.9 million daily transactions underscore its dominance in the layer-1 ecosystem, outpacing the combined activity of major competitors. This performance reflects Solana’s speed, cost efficiency, and scalability, solidifying its reputation as an attractive alternative to Ethereum. Notably, Solana’s Brazilian transaction volumes recently surged to nearly $84 million, further showcasing its growing global adoption. Looking ahead, analysts have identified Solana, alongside XRP, as a leading candidate for spot ETF approval in 2025. While potential classification as securities poses regulatory hurdles, analysts anticipate that Solana ETFs could soon join Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as mainstream investment vehicles, presenting significant upside for the ecosystem and its native SOL token. Pepe diminishes after a bullish Q4 Pepe has firmly established itself as the third-largest meme coin, fueled by tier-1 exchange listings and renewed retail interest, which triggered a series of impressive rallies earlier in the cycle. Adding to this bullish momentum was notable whale activity, including a massive $52 million transfer from a wallet that had been dormant for 600 days, signaling renewed confidence in Pepe’s potential. However, mid-December market turbulence weighed heavily on Pepe, aligning with broader meme coin declines. On both daily and weekly charts, Pepe invalidated key bullish patterns, prompting “smart money” holders to reduce their positions. The tracked holdings of Pepe fell from 8 trillion to 7.5 trillion tokens, indicating a bearish sentiment in the short term. Despite these challenges, analysts believe Pepe’s long-term outlook remains optimistic, as meme coins are likely to rebound during the anticipated altcoin season in Q1-Q2 2025. Pepe’s strong community backing and established position in the meme coin sector suggest it could recover and maintain its relevance in the next market cycle. Conclusion The recent market correction aligns with historical patterns observed in previous cycles and is far from bearish when viewed in context. Corrections like this often set the stage for a robust recovery, especially for large-cap juggernauts such as Ethereum, XRP, Shiba Inu, Solana, and Pepe. Additionally, emerging projects like Rollblock are carving out their own space, offering investors a chance to capitalize on niche market opportunities. Currently valued at $0.0445 in its ninth presale phase, RBLK stands out as a promising entry for those looking to invest in the evolving iGaming sector. Rollblock’s approach to decentralized gambling platforms, combined with its solid fundamentals and rapidly growing user base, positions it as a top contender for substantial growth.

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 23:10:00

With several ETFs lined up for launch in 2025, each firm is trying to put its best foot forward to appear on top of the chain. In submissions made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission towards the end of 2024, very lucrative offers would excite investors. One of the unique proposals was an ETF from ProShares that would denote the S&P 500’s return in Bitcoin. Besides, funds managed by Strive Asset Management and REX Shares will enable convertible bonds by companies to purchase Bitcoin. Volatility Shares, an ETF firm, hopes to trigger Solana funds with a vessel that tracks it using futures products. As more launches are anticipated, there are deliberate attempts to incorporate crypto strategies into ETFs . Most of these scenarios will be in play in 2025 because crypto is currently the hot thing, and issuers love to drop them when the theme is on fire. Crypto ETFs are gaining traction out of their one-year existence The US Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF were only approved and launched last year. If the SEC approves all the filed applications for crypto ETFs, there will be more than a dozen crypto ETFs in 2025. Cryptocurrency enjoyed a good ride in 2024, with Bitcoin growing more than 120% to trade above $100,000. The surge could be attributed to the US President-elect, Donald Trump, who has openly embraced cryptocurrency. The Trump administration is expected to loosen its regulatory stance regarding crypto, making digital assets grow accordingly. The excitement surrounding Trump’s election helped to push annual inflows for the biggest Bitcoin ETF . BlackRock rose above $37 billion for the year, ranking third among all funds. Corporates are using a mix of new equity and sales of convertible bonds to buy more crypto Some of the strategies that may dominate 2025 began last year. For instance, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor leveraged the surging crypto prices to double down on his Bitcoin purchase tactics, acquiring large tokens for its company reserve. The firm has used both new equity and sales of convertible bonds to help sponsor its crypto buying. Other entities have also laid down plans for their firms based on MicroStrategy’s style. Fillings from REX ETF indicate that the firm wants to invest most of its assets in convertible bonds from companies that deal in Bitcoin. Also, according to paperwork filed last week, Strive is proposing to launch a fund that invests in derivatives such as swaps and options to get exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy or other companies with similar investment strategies.

This makes the Southeast Asian giant the latest addition to the coalition of emerging economies, which now consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, alongside newer members like Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Indonesia had been eyeing the group for years, pushing to become part of its mission to challenge Western-dominated systems and amplify the voice of the Global South. The approval came in 2023 during the BRICS summit in Johannesburg, but Indonesia, waiting for political stability after its presidential elections, delayed formalizing its membership. Now, with President Prabowo Subianto in charge since October, the timing finally lined up. BRICS grows stronger with Indonesia on board BRICS has been on an expansion spree. Together, the countries represent 37.3% of global GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) and are home to over 3.3 billion people. With Indonesia in the fold, BRICS now boasts some of the fastest-growing economies on the planet, along with a ton of political and economic clout. Indonesia’s economy is valued at over $1 trillion, and its role in trade, manufacturing, and natural resources makes it a valuable player for the bloc. Adding to this, Indonesia has been vocal about its support for BRICS’ goals of reforming global governance systems. The statement from Brazil summed it up like this: “Indonesia contributes positively to the deepening of cooperation in the Global South.” The de-dollarization agenda BRICS has been working overtime on de-dollarization, to cut ties with the U.S. dollar in trade and financial transactions. One major piece of the puzzle is the “BRICS Bridge,” a blockchain-powered payment system in development. Think of it as an alternative to SWIFT, designed to allow member countries to settle trade using their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). For BRICS, blockchain is a weapon. You see, they’re considering creating a new reserve currency, the “Unit,” backed by a basket of member currencies and possibly gold. India has already been leading the charge in local currency trade agreements. The country has sealed deals with 22 nations, allowing trade in domestic currencies instead of the dollar. This strategy has picked up steam as sanctions on countries like Russia push them to look for financial workarounds. Still, there’s a long road ahead. Critics say the dollar’s dominance isn’t going to crumble overnight, no matter how hard BRICS tries. Internal issues like fluctuating currencies, economic disparities, and logistical challenges could slow the pace. But BRICS doesn’t seem to care. Putin, Trump, and BRICS Here’s where things get even messier. Vladimir Putin’s Russia has been one of the loudest voices in BRICS, pushing hard for de-dollarization. But now there’s a new wildcard on the table: Donald Trump. His return to the U.S. presidency is expected to shake things up, especially for Russia’s economic plans and BRICS’ overall strategy. Let’s break it down. Trump’s administration has always been unpredictable when it comes to Russia. While there’s speculation that Trump might seek to cool tensions with Moscow, many in his camp favor tougher sanctions. If Trump doubles down on economic warfare, it could isolate Russia from Western financial systems even more, making BRICS’ de-dollarization efforts even more critical. For Putin, BRICS is a lifeline. Russia’s economy has been battered by sanctions, with inflation soaring to nearly 30% last year and the ruble losing 33% of its value since August 2024. Oil revenues, once the backbone of Russia’s economy, have plummeted. Daily earnings from fossil fuels have halved since 2022, while Ukraine’s decision to cut off transit rights for Russian gas to Europe has cost Moscow another $5 billion annually. Despite these setbacks, Russia has been doubling down on BRICS. For the rest of BRICS, the dynamic between Trump and Putin matters. If Russia faces tighter sanctions, it could accelerate BRICS’ push for alternative financial systems. On the flip side, if Trump opens up new opportunities for Russia, it could give the bloc more breathing room to focus on its long-term goals.

The company announced earlier today that it has reached a $5 million settlement. This ends allegations that Gemini misled regulators during its bid to launch America’s first Bitcoin futures contract. This settlement is part of the ongoing conflict between the crypto industry and regulators. It reflects the changing policies influenced by shifting political climates. Gemini’s Regulatory Hurdles: A Case of Misrepresentation? The controversy dates back to 2017 when Gemini Trust submitted proposals to the CFTC to launch future contracts for Bitcoin. However ,the CFTC alleged that Gemini misrepresented critical safeguards to prevent price manipulation. These safeguards were supposed to form the backbone of a trusted financial product, yet the regulator argued Gemini fell short of expectations. Fast forward to January 2025, just weeks before a trial was set to unravel in Manhattan federal court , Gemini and the CFTC struck a deal. Gemini agreed to pay $5 million to settle the claims, neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. This settlement underscores the legal tightrope walked by crypto firms aiming to push boundaries while facing increasing scrutiny. Ripple Effects in the Crypto Landscape Gemini’s settlement coincides with broader regulatory movements, including the high-profile Ripple SEC case. Former SEC enforcement lawyer Marc Fagel recently predicted a possible settlement in the ongoing lawsuit against Ripple . He pointed to the incoming Trump administration, which is expected to take a more industry-friendly approach. As SEC Chair Paul Atkins prepares to take the reins, many expect regulatory leniency to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has already attributed a surge in U.S. business activity to what he dubbed the “ Trump effect .” In a recent X post, he shared that 75% of Ripple’s hiring is now U.S.-based. This shift is driven by a surge in domestic deals following Trump’s election victory. Ripple’s newly launched RLUSD stablecoin has also gained prominence, surpassing competitors like PYUSD and EURC in trading volume. Biden’s Legacy vs. Trump’s Crypto Promise The settlement is an important moment in the broader narrative of U.S. crypto regulation. Under President Biden, more actions were taken against crypto companies, showing a tougher approach to market rules. The Gemini case was one of many, as regulators worked to ensure fairness and prevent abuse in the growing crypto market. However, with President Trump returning to office, regulations may change. Known for supporting the industry, Trump’s administration is expected to be more lenient with crypto rules.

Why Are Pengu and Meme Coins Facing Fierce Competition,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/1fuel-or-dogecoin-why-are-pengu-and-meme-coins-facing-fierce-competition,"Meme coins have long been driven by internet hype, but now they are facing increasing competition from utility tokens like 1Fuel in the crypto space. Some top meme coins are Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), but they are now overshadowed by 1Fuel. 1Fuel is now in its presale stage, and allows investors to purchase the OFT token at a very low price before the value goes up by 100x in 2025. But why is 1Fuel a strong competitor to these meme coins? Continue reading to learn why 1Fuel is attracting the attention of savvy investors. Meme Coins Face Strong Competition in the Crypto Space Dogecoin, known as the largest meme coin by market cap, has seen an impressive growth. It is currently valued at $0.3877, which is a major 383.87% increase from 2024. Similarly, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has reached a value of $0.04211. The value skyrocketed by an impressive 742.40% in 2024 alone. There’s a lot of optimism around DOGE investors since analysts predict it would reach the $1 mark. As for PENGU, its predictions go between $0.086 and $0.1 by the end of the year. Both tokens are easily stored on well-known platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Despite their impressive growth potential, meme coins like DOGE and PENGU face strong competition from utility tokens in the crypto space. These meme coins rely heavily on social media trends and internet hype, which do not provide sustainable long-term growth. Due to this, smart investors consider utility tokens as top cryptocurrencies to invest in. Why 1Fuel Offers an Edge in DeFi Innovation 1Fuel OFT is one of the tokens challenging the dominance of meme coins in the crypto space. One of 1Fuel’s top features is its cross-chain transaction capability, which allows you to easily interact with different blockchain networks from a single wallet. This makes it stand out from other top platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. 1Fuel is highly committed to user privacy, as it features an inbuilt mixer that keeps all transactions confidential. This is unlike many platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, which offer limited privacy features. With these innovations, 1Fuel is quickly becoming one of the top utility tokens in the market, setting the stage for long-term growth. Investors Rush to Secure 1Fuel from its Presale As meme coins like DOGE and PENGU face increased competition, investors are turning their attention to 1Fuel . It is now in its presale stage and offering the token at its lowest-ever price of $0.012. With the presale already surpassing the $1 million mark and over 114 million tokens sold in record time, it’s clear that investors are highly confident in the token’s future. The presale’s rapid success speaks volume about investor enthusiasm, making it one of the top utility tokens. With its DEX wallet features standing out among platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, 1Fuel has become a standard tool for interacting with blockchains. The Crypto Space Leans Towards from 1Fuel As the 1Fuel live presale progresses, more and more investors are taking advantage of this opportunity to secure their stake before its public release. The crypto space is leaning towards 1Fuel, and investors can take advantage of this enticing opportunity before it's too late.

The swap will shift the stablecoin from other blockchains to Tron network to improve the communication between the supported chains. Details of the Tether USDT Chain Swap to Tron Network On January 6, Tether revealed via its X account that it is coordinating with a top third-party exchange to move $1 billion worth of USDT. The swap will involve transferring a portion of the stablecoin held in cold wallets to the Tron blockchain. Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, is currently available on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. The issuer clarified that the process will not alter the total USDT supply but will ensure that liquidity is optimized across various networks. This mechanism enables traders and users to leverage their assets on any blockchain supported by the crypto firm. Meanwhile, the stablecoin issuer recently joined the bandwagon of firms increasing their Bitcoin reserves, adding 7,629 BTC worth $705.25 million. The funds, transferred from Bitfinex after nine months of dormancy, bring Tether’s total Bitcoin holdings to 82,983 BTC. Acquired for $2.99 billion, these holdings are now valued at $7.68 billion, reflecting its growing Bitcoin strategy. USDT’s Dominance in the Stablecoin Market Furthermore, USDT remains on top of the list in the stablecoin market cap with a value of more than $137 billion. Its main application areas are in payment systems, trading, and cross-border transactions . The stablecoin has recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $107 billion, a 69% jump in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, the second popular stablecoin, the USDC, has a market cap of $45.8 billion and a daily trading volume of $7.7 billion. However, Tether’s stability pegged to the U.S. dollar has made it an essential tool for traders in the crypto market. Nonetheless, despite the growing dominance, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has accused Tether of market manipulation following its recent 7,629 BTC purchase. Schiff claimed that the stablecoin issuer mints USDT “out of thin air” to acquire Bitcoin, likening it to quantitative easing. While Tether backs USDT with reserves and conducts audits, Schiff continues to question its practices. Role of Chain Swaps in the Crypto Ecosystem Chain swaps play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by enabling seamless asset transfers between blockchains. This allows users to access liquidity and trading opportunities across multiple blockchains, enhancing market efficiency. The stablecoin issuer decision to facilitate a chain swap to Tron underscores its commitment to maintaining liquidity across supported networks. The Tron blockchain remains one of the primary platforms for USDT, driving substantial trading activity. However, despite its dominance, the stablecoin issuer has not been without some challenges. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, proposed in December last year, has impacted the stablecoin market directly.

But a man referred to as “A” (age 43), was identified as the group’s ringleader. The court jailed him for three and a half years. The presiding judge sentenced another defendant to two years and two months in prison. Kimchi premium prices (Bitcoin) at the time of writing. (Source: Cryprice) The presiding judge jailed a third individual for two years. The group’s final member was given a suspended 18-month sentence and ordered to perform 160 hours of community service. The Daegu District Court also handed out fines, including an “approximately 3 billion won” (over $2 million) bill for A. The judge also ordered the group to pay legal and other “additional” fees. Prosecutors told the court that the group worked with “investors” in Japan. They took tokens from Japan-based vendors and resold them in South Korea to “make a profit.” They did this at a time when the “ kimchi premium ” was at a periodic high, prosecutors said. The kimchi premium is a phenomenon whereby high retail demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins leads to tokens trading on South Korean exchanges at much higher prices than on international platforms. At its highest point (circa 2020-2021), the premium rose above the 35% mark. South Korea was spared a financial maelstrom even as it battles a political crisis, underscoring the extent to which its markets have matured, bolstered by swift efforts to reassure investors. https://t.co/0uRIQlEiV5 — Bloomberg (@business) January 6, 2025 Japanese ‘Crypto Investors’ Paid Group $18.5M Prosecutors explained that after “dumping” the coins on domestic platforms, the group “illegally smuggled approximately 400 billion won [$273,738,000] in foreign currency” back to the Japanese investors. The court heard that the group “received approximately 27 billion won [$18.5 million] in return” for its services.

Recently, Cardano recorded 20 million transactions in just two days, highlighting its robust scalability. Predictions are also favorable for Stellar, with an expected 471% rise in a bullish market scenario. BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves with the buzz around its cinematic-style Keynote 3, rumored to be in collaboration with a notable Hollywood producer. As an emerging foundational blockchain project, BlockDAG has accumulated over $176 million from its presale, paving the way with significant technological leaps. As the year 2024 winds down, these cryptocurrencies are certainly ones to keep an eye on. Here’s a deeper look at what makes them stand out. What’s Behind Cardano’s 20M Transactions Surge? Ranked ninth globally by market cap, Cardano (ADA) has experienced substantial activity, recording over 20 million transactions in the past two days. Factors such as Cardano’s advances in decentralized governance, especially CIP-1694, may be influencing this surge. Notably, Intersect recently moved the Plomin hard fork governance proposal to the ratification stage, signaling a step forward in Cardano’s on-chain governance. As 2024 concludes, the spike in Cardano transactions signals a robust interest, potentially driving more accumulation as ADA’s price increases from $0.887 after a minor dip to $0.85. Stellar’s Market Outlook: Anticipating a 471% Jump Stellar’s (XLM) market trajectory looks promising, with analysts forecasting a significant 471% increase, based on Fibonacci Extension levels in optimistic market conditions. The growth is supported by Stellar’s expanding ecosystem, including strategic partnerships and enhancements in smart contracts. Despite a recent 10% downturn bringing Stellar close to oversold conditions, it maintains a trading price of $0.3532 with a market cap of $10 billion, keeping market watchers optimistic about its potential to reach $2.12, and even $8 in highly favorable conditions. Is BlockDAG Teaming Up with a Hollywood Producer for Keynote 3? BlockDAG is gearing up for its highly anticipated Keynote 3, slated for release in 2025. This presentation is expected to break new ground, rumored to feature a cinematic collaboration with a renowned Hollywood producer. This pioneering method aims to redefine the presentation of blockchain advancements by integrating engaging storytelling with the latest technological innovations. The centerpiece of the keynote will be BlockDAG’s Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture. This cutting-edge architecture tackles the longstanding scalability challenges faced by traditional blockchains. Unlike conventional linear blockchain systems, DAG allows for more efficient transaction processing, which leads to quicker confirmation times and lower energy consumption. Moreover, BlockDAG’s compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) increases its attractiveness, enabling developers to effortlessly migrate their decentralized applications to this more advanced platform. This compatibility not only expands the ecosystem’s functionality but also attracts a broader range of developers. These groundbreaking features have significantly fueled interest in BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, which has now amassed over $176 million and sold more than 17.7 billion BDAG coins. Priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, the presale has provided an astonishing 2380% return to early participants since its inception. With these compelling figures, BlockDAG is establishing itself as a formidable leader in the cryptocurrency arena. The Crypto Coins to Keep an Eye on as 2024 Ends! As 2024 draws to a close, the crypto landscape is marked by significant achievements and promising prospects. Cardano’s transaction surge underscores its leading position, while Stellar’s market potential continues to attract bullish forecasts. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s upcoming Keynote 3, merging cinematic storytelling with cutting-edge technology, is setting a new standard for crypto presentations. Spotlighting its innovative DAG architecture and EVM compatibility, BlockDAG remains a prominent cryptocurrency to watch into 2025.

The traffic on L2 is more than 4.5 times higher than Ethereum transactions, signaling a permanent shift to scalable chains. L2 chains, led by Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, invite more than 4.5 times the traffic of Ethereum (ETH). On the main L1 chain, transactions stabilized around 1.16M, shifting toward high-value stablecoin transfers, ETH movements, and fewer swaps or NFT activities. L2 activity growth was mostly due to the effect of Base, but other top chains provided a robust baseline of transactions. | Source: GrowThePie More of the complex transactions shifted to L2, where each chain holds a specific profile. DeFi activity and liquidity from stablecoins has accumulated to Arbitrum and a handful of top chains, drawing in users for easier DEX swaps. As a result, L2 activity has posted new records for months. On a weekly basis, L2 activity passed the 10M users milestone, with just 1.96M for Ethereum on a weekly basis. Users are active in the Ethereum Ecosystem – Last weeks stats: Over 10,000,000 Addresses interacted with 1 or more Layer 2. Over 1,960,000 Addresses interacted with Ethereum Layer 1. pic.twitter.com/eMXlz3Yyk2 — growthepie.xyz 🥧📏 (@growthepie_eth) January 6, 2025 While Base remains the leader with high-speed transactions, some of the traffic remains tied to organic DEX trading and DeFi lending on the other top L2 chains. Base also gets a boost from CbBTC traffic, while also accumulating $3.49B in value locked. Stablecoins are also one of the drivers of L2 adoption. In the first days of 2025, L2 held more than $11B in bridged or native stablecoins, where Arbitrum was the leader with $6.35B. Base was in second place, with $3.5B worth of stablecoins. The rising trend reflects the strong baseline from Arbitrum, but most of the expansion still comes from Base. The chain is among the top carriers of DeFi, through its version of Uniswap and the Aerodrome high-liquidity DEX. Arbitrum is close behind based on DeFi activity, reaching $33.6M on a daily time frame. Most L2 chains slowed down significantly after the end of their airdrop mining activity. Returning to organic traffic has been a struggle for multiple chains. Base is still not officially preparing for an airdrop, though there are still expectations for a native token in the future. L2 chains grow based on specialized activities Linea, while carrying smaller traffic, remains instrumental for L2 activity in NFT swaps and decentralized social media. Optimism serves as an all-purpose utility chain, while ZKSync Era has the biggest share of simple token transfers. Arbitrum is the biggest hub for cross-chain activity, with more than $15M on a daily basis. Overall, L2 do not communicate between chains, but rely on bridging and flows to and from Ethereum. Additionally, dozens of smaller networks aim for specialized tasks, such as gaming or a specific DEX. However, newer networks may lack liquidity, and older ones may be unwilling to become interoperable. Growing L2 traffic leads to fee and block space competition The growing traffic also makes L2 more expensive, with regular spikes in rent paid to Ethereum. While the rent is small compared to Ethereum’s block production incentives, there is a shift from the previous months of near-zero payments. To compare, Base at one point paid no more than $3,000 for its activity, while a recent spike led to $93,000 in daily rent paid to Ethereum. The increased on-chain activity means chain operators may choose how to post to Ethereum. Data shows Arbitrum switches between blobs and calldata, depending on which one is cheaper at the moment. However, this L2 activity actually takes up block space on Ethereum, making regular transactions more expensive. Ethereum transactions are still more expensive at $1.10, with regular price spikes for specialized tasks. Arbitrum retains $0.09 per transaction, though even L2 are not offering virtually free transfers. However, Arbitrum swaps can go as low as $0.27, while Ethereum DEX deals can cost $21.38 without special priority or additional block-builder payments. L2 chains retain real economic activity and the top ones show robust demand. However, the L2 narrative remained subdued. A total of 127 high-profile chains were launched, each competing for either niche or mass activity.

Here’s How High ADA Could Pump in 2025,https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-to-7-80-heres-how-high-ada-could-pump-in-2025/,"The Cardano (ADA) price looks poised to pump back to its December highs in the low $1.30s, with chart analysis painting a bullish picture for ADA’s near-term outlook. Could this be the start of a new pump that could take ADA as high as $7.80? ADA was last changing hands around $1.10, having pumped over $0.25 or over 30% since the start of the year. That pump saw the Cardano price break to the north of a downtrend in play since early December, as well as back above its 21 and 50DMAs, suggestive that the bulls have retaken control of the market. Over the last few days, the ADA rally has stalled, with the Cardano price forming a range in the $1.056-$1.118 area. But with Bitcoin (BTC) having broken back above $100,000 and seemingly carrying strong momentum, the mood in the broader crypto market looks set to remain positive ahead of the arrival of the incoming Trump administration in two weeks. Trump’s administration is the most pro-crypto in history, marking a full 180-degree reversal from the anti-crypto stance of the outgoing Biden administration. That, coupled with the start of a new pro-crypto Congressional session, means crypto markets are on the cusp of entering a new golden age. Trump’s crypto Czar, David Sacks, on Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/M6fi1Y3iiL — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) December 6, 2024 Perhaps Trump’s arrival in office might be a “sell-the-news” event. But that is still two weeks away, so its very likely altcoin markets and the Cardano price could continue to rally in the upcoming sessions. Strong Year for ADA Likely Coming Most signs suggest that this crypto bull market still has plenty of room to run. Firstly, Bitcoin only just recently entered the final and most explosive phase of its four-year cycle, which typically runs between 6-18 months of the halving (which took place last April). That, combined with rapidly rising institutional adoption and the possibility of the establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve this year, should keep the world’s largest crypto pumping in 2025. But there are also signs that altcoin season has yet to really get going this cycle, of which Cardano could be a major beneficiary. Bitcoin dominance has only just recently started to show signs that it is starting to break down after breaking below a long-term uptrend. During the 2021 bull cycle, a similar breakout was the precursor for a massive altcoin season that saw assets like Cardano post massive gains. Cardano also has a bunch of narratives that could help it pump hard if a new altcoin season is right around the corner. ADA is set to pivot to becoming a Bitcoin DeFi chain as soon as May. Meanwhile, the incoming SEC Chair may back off from the outgoing anti-crypto SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s position that ADA is an unregistered security. Moreover, it’s co-founder and biggest advocate Charles Hoskinson might secure a position in the White House as an advisor to incoming President Trump , which could help bolster Cardano’s adoption in the USA.

Looks like Cardano users see polymarket as a “nice poll” pic.twitter.com/ktjq0W60KP — 竜 SM₳UG (@SmaugPool) January 6, 2025 How High Can ADA Pump This Bull Market? Many signs thus point towards Cardano pumping hard in 2025. So how high might it go? Well, during its 2020/2021 bull run, Cardano rallied to the 2.618 Fibonacci extension beyond its 2017 record highs. If it can match the same feat during this bull run, that would imply an ADA price of around $7.80. That would mean gains of almost exactly 7x from current levels. As a result, Cardano could be great candidate for best crypto to buy now . Cardano Risks to Consider That said, potential investors need to be aware of risks to the Cardano outlook. The main one is that, despite its massive market cap of around $50 billion, Cardano has very little on-chain adoption to show for it. Its TVL of crypto in smart contracts is still yet to hit $1 billion, per DeFi Llama , and compared to its major rivals (like Ethereum or Solana), Cardano lags in terms of transaction activity and dApp activity in a big way. Crypto investors are advised not to put their eggs all in one basket (unless that basket is Bitcoin!) and should consider diversifying exposure across a few different high potential altcoin plays.

With its advanced AI features and a potential of 20,000x ROI, RCO Finance is a game changer in the crypto market. XRP Price Trajectory Slows Down The XRP price is changing hands at $2.48, a 1.3% rise in the past 24 hours and a 15.8% rise in the past week. The XRP price just broke out of a falling wedge, a typical bullish signal, but the breakout closed red. The impact is that it signals the XRP price isn’t gaining momentum as expected. Analysts predict that the next key level for XRP price is $2.90, aligning with a projection of an upward spiral. But, the analysts feel that the breakout strength is still in question. If the XRP price doesn’t break out of this level, it could retract to $2.00 or even $1.47, which are the critical support levels before a stronger move.

Amidst a crowded field of contenders, pinpointing top crypto coins for the 2025 bull run is vital for optimizing investment outcomes. These top cryptocurrencies are notable for their cutting-edge technologies and robust community support, positioning them to excel in the rapidly evolving blockchain environment. Notably, the Web3Bay presale is at the forefront, recognized for its potential to revolutionize decentralized ecosystems. 1. Web3Bay Presale: Pioneering Decentralization The Web3Bay presale is capturing attention with its innovative approach to blockchain-based solutions. By providing decentralized tools for both users and developers, Web3Bay aims to streamline interactions within the crypto ecosystem. The success of its presale underscores significant community engagement, and the token’s increasing use across various Web3 applications could lead to considerable gains by 2025. Currently in its third presale phase, priced at $0.0039675 with $420,000 raised, Web3Bay is projected to achieve a launch price of $0.1959, offering early investors a potential ROI of 6,430%. The token’s defined applications, from NFT integrations to decentralized finance platforms, coupled with early support from key industry influencers, position Web3Bay as one of the top crypto coins for high-growth opportunities. 2. Floki (FLOKI): Beyond a Meme Coin Floki stands out in the crypto market by melding the charm of meme coins with substantial utility. Its ecosystem spans NFT marketplaces, play-to-earn gaming platforms, and educational projects. Supported by a dynamic community and strategic promotional efforts, Floki combines entertainment with investment potential, set for further expansion in the upcoming bull run. 3. Fetch.ai (FET): Bridging AI with Blockchain Fetch.ai is a leader in merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its platform enables autonomous agents to enhance efficiency in various sectors, including supply chain, finance, and transportation. With the global rise in AI adoption, Fetch.ai’s capacity to deliver scalable and efficient solutions makes it a prime candidate for the 2025 bull run. Developments in Fetch.ai’s partnerships and ecosystem expansion are closely monitored by investors. 4. Immutable (IMX): Advancing NFT Gaming Immutable has become a significant player in NFT gaming and blockchain gaming infrastructure. Its Layer 2 scaling solution facilitates seamless NFT transactions, essential for both developers and gamers. As the gaming and metaverse sectors continue to grow, Immutable’s technology will likely play a vital role in their success. Its partnerships with prominent gaming studios and platforms further bolster its prospects for 2025. 5. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Evolving from Meme to Utility Shiba Inu has evolved from a mere meme coin to a utility-rich ecosystem supported by the Shibarium blockchain. It encompasses decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, and staking mechanisms, attracting a broad base of retail investors. Its accessible price point and active community base make it a popular choice for rapid gains during bullish periods. The 2025 bull run could propel SHIB to new heights as its ecosystem continues to mature. Why These Cryptos Are Noteworthy Robust Use Cases: Each listed cryptocurrency delivers unique advantages through its use cases in AI, gaming, or decentralized finance. Community Engagement: Projects like Floki and Shiba Inu exemplify how a strong, active community can foster growth and adoption. Potential for Appreciation: The promising presale of Web3Bay and the AI-driven capabilities of Fetch.ai highlight their potential for substantial returns, making them top crypto coins for the bull run. Portfolio Preparation Strategies Sector Diversification: Incorporate tokens from diverse sectors like gaming (Immutable), AI (Fetch.ai), and meme coins (Floki, Shiba Inu). Early Investments: Engaging in presales such as Web3Bay’s can lead to significant rewards. Continuous Monitoring: Remain informed about the latest developments, partnerships, and market trends for each project. Key Insights The 2025 crypto bull run offers substantial opportunities for gains, yet careful asset selection remains essential. Investing in Web3Bay’s presale, Fetch.ai’s AI capabilities, Floki’s vibrant ecosystem, Immutable’s gaming innovations, and Shiba Inu’s utility-focused growth stand out as top crypto coins.

After announcing late last year that it had purchased ¥1 billion worth of Bitcoins, the Japanese company is making headlines again by announcing its plans to increase its holdings to 10,000 Bitcoins. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Hit $1? Expert Calls It A Realistic Goal For 2025 – Here’s Why Metaplanet’s decision to double down on the world’s top digital asset comes during favorable political and economic conditions, with analysts expecting that Bitcoin may hit $200k soon. Currently, Metaplanet boasts 1,762 Bitcoins, worth $173.4 million, and is one of the top companies following MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investing playbook. CEO Announces Target Of 10k Bitcoins CEO Simon Gerovich shared the company’s latest investment plan in a New Year post for shareholders. In a Twitter/X post last January 5th, Gerovick acknowledged the company’s exceptional performance, where it expanded its Bitcoin holdings and solidified its standing as the region’s biggest holder of digital assets. In the lengthy message, he reiterated the company’s commitment to the asset and boosting shareholder value. Happy New Year to Our Valued Shareholders! As we step into 2025, I couldn’t be more excited about what lies ahead for Metaplanet. Last year was transformational, as we broke records, expanded our Bitcoin treasury, and reinforced our position as Asia’s leading Bitcoin Treasury… pic.twitter.com/K2HsOS8TaZ — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) January 5, 2025 Gerovick announced at least four targets for Metaplanet this year. The company’s primary target is to expand its BTC holdings to 10k Bitcoin. In addition, Metaplanet also plans to boost transparency, leverage partnerships to promote Bitcoin adoption and explore other innovative opportunities that can grow the company’s influence in the Bitcoin and blockchain niche. Investing Plans Come At A Time Of Favorable Conditions The Japanese company’s aggressive moves into the crypto space come during favorable market conditions and better price prospects. Both Bitwise and VanEck predict that Bitcoin will trade anywhere from $180k to $200k this year. They believe that the top digital asset can trade at higher price points if the US government approves the plan to adopt the strategic digital asset reserve. Other analysts are offering bolder price predictions for Bitcoin and potentially better performance from altcoins thanks to a second Trump administration. According to Gerovich, if the US government pushes with the Bitcoin strategic reserves, then others can follow suit. Metaplanet’s CEO added that Japan is one of the first countries to follow, and other Asian countries will implement the same initiative.

He then teases his followers, saying that 2025 will be another breakout year for Metaplanet in terms of innovation, progress, and success. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings are currently the biggest in Asia and 15th among global public companies. The company first started investing in Bitcoin last year, as Bitcoin surged considerably due to increased institutional adoption.

The attackers reportedly targeted him, falsely believing he possessed an immense amount of Bitcoin. The incident has left the man and his family in a precarious situation as they move from one temporary residence to another, fearing for their safety. Crypto Forum Moderator Targeted in Bitcoin Kidnapping The alleged incident, which took place in November 2024, started when two masked people allegedly got close to the Crypto forum’s house. As per the statement , the suspects escaped from the scene after the man closed the door on them. A few days later, the victim saw the masked men in an unmarked vehicle near his house while he was taking his child to daycare. The suspects are said to have followed the man onto a main road. When the situation worsened, he was on the phone with the police when the suspect vehicle turned and three of its occupants escaped on foot. Shortly after, the driver of the vehicle reportedly came out and confronted the victim, and another suspect brandished a firearm. The man stated that he used bear spray as a way of protecting himself from the suspects until the police came in to arrest the duo. Claims of Torture Equipment Discovered In the report, the Crypto forum moderator stated that the suspects intended to kidnap and torture him in order to get his cryptocurrency. The police investigations suggested that the attackers thought he had 2.5 million Bitcoins worth billions of dollars because he was a moderator of a cryptocurrency Facebook group. ‘The guys had equipment to torture me,’ the man said to La Presse. They had a tarp with a hole in the middle and claws to cut off a limb and stop the bleeding. It’s incredibly violent.” The victim claimed that his actual BTC investment was $10,000 which is like 0.1 of a Bitcoin as per current price. Suspects Released on House Arrest Four suspects, two of which are adults and two are juveniles, were taken into custody in relation to the event. The adults are to be charged with conspiracy to kidnap and use of prohibited firearms. However, all these four suspects were released on house arrest to await their trial that is set to commence in March. The release of the suspects has been a matter of concern to the family of the Crypto forum moderator since there is a possibility of their attack. The family was told by the authorities that they should move away from the area saying that the suspects could be linked to organised crime. The family has since been transferring from one short term lease house to another in an effort to flee any danger. A representative of Quebec’s provincial police, Sûreté du Québec stated that although the police offer guidance to victims, they cannot offer round the clock protection. ”We do not advise people to change their address but it is one of the measures we are considering, the other ones are to change the locks or to install cameras and alarms,” the spokesperson said. Despite this, the victim has expressed frustration over the suspects’ release, stating it has forced his family into hiding. “The police told us they can’t ensure our safety,” he said, adding that his family has been burning through their savings to stay safe. The man also revealed that the Youth Protection Department (DPJ) became involved after rumors of the incident spread at his children’s school.

From quirky characters to wild community-driven hype, these coins are about fun, innovation, and serious profits. Today, we’re diving into three of the best new meme coins to join now: BTFD Coin , Dogs, and Pudgy Penguins. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or someone just getting your feet wet, these coins capture attention for all the right reasons. The rise of meme coins has been nothing short of spectacular. They started as jokes but have become legitimate investment opportunities with massive communities. Coins like Dogecoin paved the way, showing that humour and community spirit can have a real monetary value. Now, BTFD Coin is leading the next wave, combining meme magic with robust financial benefits like a 90% APY on staking . Let’s talk about BTFD Coin—it’s a game-changer. Its presale has already raised over $5 million and is only just starting. Meanwhile, Dogs and Pudgy Penguins are creating their own buzz, proving that the meme coin craze is far from over. Keep reading to find out why these coins are worth your attention. BTFD Coin: Staking Your Way to Unmatched Gains BTFD Coin is shaking up the meme coin market with a killer mix of humor and real financial perks. Forget about coins that only make you laugh; this one’s stacking up real gains. If you haven’t heard, the presale is in its 13th stage , with the coin priced at $0.000142. Over 62 billion BTFD coins have been sold to 7,700+ holders, and there’s no slowing down. The standout feature? That 90% APY on staking. Imagine earning nearly double your investment by simply staking your coins. Crypto enthusiasts are flocking to this project because it offers a rare way to blend the meme coin hype with serious long-term rewards. Analysts predict BTFD Coin could skyrocket once it hits major exchanges, and the current presale price might seem like peanuts compared to its future value. You put $1,000 into BTFD Coin during its current presale at $0.000142 per coin. That gives you roughly 7,042,254 coins. Imagine the price skyrocketing to $0.0006 after the presale—a totally realistic possibility considering the coin’s momentum and the buzz driving it. Dogs: Man’s Best Friend, Now Crypto’s Best Bet Dogs are stealing the spotlight in the meme coin universe. Whether you’re talking about loyalty, cuteness, or viral potential, this coin has all the elements to charm its way into your wallet. Dogs, inspired by our four-legged companions, combines heartwarming branding with community-driven momentum. Its recent social media campaigns have exploded, pushing the coin’s value higher. Recent developments have further solidified Dogs’ position in the crypto market. In August 2024, Dogs was listed on Binance’s Launchpool, significantly boosting its trading volume and market visibility. This listing allowed users to stake their Binance Coin (BNB) and other tokens to farm Dogs, increasing accessibility and driving adoption. Although its price reached an all-time high of $0.001633, it has since stabilised around $0.000565 as of January 2025, reflecting broader market trends. The Dogs project continues to focus on community engagement, leveraging social media platforms to build a loyal following. Its upcoming plans for NFT collaborations and charitable donations to animal shelters highlight its commitment to making an impact beyond just financial gains. This combination of utility and heartwarming branding sets Dogs apart in a crowded field. Imagine waking up one morning to see your Dogs investment doubling or tripling. It’s happened with other meme coins, and there’s no reason Dogs can’t follow suit. The buzz is real, and the community support is massive. If you’re a dog lover with a penchant for smart investments, Dogs might be your perfect match. Pudgy Penguins: The Coolest Meme Coin on Ice Pudgy Penguins has become a standout in the meme coin space, combining charm and bold strategy to capture the public’s imagination. The project’s native token, PENGU, has grown 13% on January 5 and marked a staggering 250% increase since its December 17 launch. Trading at $0.040 with a market cap of $2.5 billion, PENGU is a testament to the power of a well-executed meme coin. But it’s not just the numbers grabbing attention. Pudgy Penguins’ marketing strategies are breaking new ground. With over 1.1 billion GIF and sticker views in just the first five days of January, the project’s viral campaigns on Instagram and TikTok have helped propel it to new heights. The team’s approach—leveraging humour, nostalgia, and community spirit—has made Pudgy Penguins a household name in the crypto world. Despite the buzz, some large holders are cashing out, taking advantage of the rally. On January 4, a wallet withdrew 84 million PENGU tokens, worth $3.13 million, from Binance. Meanwhile, NFT sales have dipped by 52% in the past week, reflecting a broader cooling trend. Still, Pudgy Penguins remains the second-largest NFT collection by market cap at $721 million, trailing only CryptoPunks. Looking ahead, PENGU is poised for further growth. Operating on Solana, with plans to expand to Ethereum and Abstract, an Ethereum layer-2 solution, the token’s potential use cases include governance and access to exclusive ecosystem perks. With a total supply of 88.88 billion tokens, 25.9% of which are allocated to NFT holders via airdrops, Pudgy Penguins continues to innovate and capture attention. PENGU’s blend of utility and charm makes it one of the best new meme coins to join now. Whether you’re drawn by its viral marketing, NFT pedigree, or long-term potential, Pudgy Penguins is a project worth watching. Conclusion: The Time to Join is Now BTFD Coin, Dogs, and Pudgy Penguins are hands down the best new meme coins to join now. Each offers something unique—whether it’s BTFD’s incredible 90% APY on staking, Dogs’ charitable edge, or Pudgy Penguins’ metaverse dreams.

The token’s delay, which at first was attributed to the fundraising, such as the $12 million venture capital round in April 2024 for the Layer-3 privacy blockchain, created some confusion. However, the Shiba Inu team has recently announced that the token will not be launched to the public before January 14. Despite the official confirmation, misinformation has been circulating. A user known as CryptoMumms posted that the TREAT token had already been launched in January of 2023. This claim and the fake TREAT token have led to a lot of confusion among the Shiba Inu community. Treat did not stealth launch years ago. This simply isn't true. — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) January 5, 2025 This fake token is currently operating on ShibaSwap through the wallet contract address “0xFBD…146B” and has been misleading people about its existence. DEXTools shows that its market capitalization is $2.86 million; however, the Shiba Inu team has confirmed that this is not the real TREAT token. Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous leader of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, also addressed these allegations in public. He pointed out that TREAT has not been launched and asked the community not to interact with this fake token. On X, Kusama posted a video that was quite comedic in nature and showed how pointless the entire thing was. He further backed up the message with a caution to avoid falling for such narratives. TREAT’s role in Shiba Inu’s ecosystem The TREAT token is essential for Shiba Inu’s vision of becoming fully decentralized. After its launch, it will enable governance, rewards, and real-world use within the ecosystem. Kusama said that the token is a “capstone and key” to Shiba Inu’s future and plans to explain the details in his weekly podcast. TREAT will also support WOOF Wars: Farming 2.0, a sophisticated yield farming system where users will be able to increase their profits. Using veTREAT (vote escrowed TREAT), holders will be able to participate in the governance process. While liquidity providers will get extra rewards. This system is meant to enhance the decentralization of the Shiba Inu network so that its holders can decide on the future of the coin. Besides governance, TREAT will be incorporated into SHIB Pay, an on-chain payment system. This will allow users to make payments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem without involving conventional processors and with the help of blockchain verification. The Shiba Inu team has revealed that TREAT will be instrumental in the future of the crypto-commerce revolution. As of the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002401, a 1% uptrend in the last 24 hours. The token has risen by nearly 10% since the beginning of the year. The Shiba Inu has four tokens in its ecosystem: SHIB, LEASH, BONE, and TREAT.

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 00:33:00

The report also shared that Bitcoin still dominated the crypto exchange-traded funds, accounting for about $573 million of the Bitcoin assets under management in global ETP s . Butterfield further noted in the report that global crypto ETPs recorded about $44.4 billion in net inflows in 2024. CoinShares explained that Bitcoin ETPs dominated the digital asset investment products markets in 2024, accounting for about 29% and $38 billion of all BTC assets under management in global ETPs. Ethereum ETPs came in second, accounting for about $4.5 billion of global crypto ETP inflows last year, accounting for about 26% of all Ethereum assets under management global ETPs. The value was also about 60x more than Ethereum inflows recorded in the ETPs in 2023 and 2.4x more than what was recorded in 2021. Other altcoins registered net inflows of $813 million in 2024, accounting for 18% of all non-ETH altcoin assets under management in crypto investment products. Solana was among the top coins among the other altcoins, recording a $69 million inflow in 2024 and 4% of its total assets under management. The total inflows recorded in 2024 increased above the all-time high experienced in the 2021 bull market. Global crypto investment products reached over $10 billion in net inflows in 2021. The 2024 statistics indicate an over 4x increase compared to the 2021 values. U.S. spot ETFs contribute to the 2024 surge 2024 saw US$44bn inflows in to crypto ETPs, 2025 off to a good start with US$585m inflows so far https://t.co/OczGDBUdph — James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) January 6, 2025 Butterfield attributed the surge in 2024’s global crypto investment products net inflows to the introduction of spot ETFs in the U.S. in January 2024. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 10 and 8 Ether spot ETFs on May 22. The Bitcoin ETFs have accounted for a greater percentage of the inflows recorded since their introduction in 2024. The report highlighted that inflows recorded by digital asset investment products were solely from U.S.-based spot ETFs. The CoinShares head of research explained that the surge in U.S. spot ETFs indicates the products’ impact on other crypto investment products. Butterfield also revealed that the ETFs would change the path crypto investment flows took in the future. The asset management firm’s executive also touched on the recent resurgence seen by Ethereum ETFs at the end of 2024. The ETFs had seen significant outflows before rebounding within the last days of the year. Butterfield suggested that the recovery indicated ETH’s evolution in the digital assets market. CoinShares’ statistics for this year’s net flows indicate that U.S. spot ETFs are still the top performers in the ETP industry. The report also showed that Australia and Switzerland are still showing promise, with about $1.1 million and $8.4 million in inflows, respectively. Galaxy Digital expects U.S. Bitcoin spot ETPs to hit $250 billion in 2025 A Galaxy Digital report from December 31, 2024, predicted the possible trajectory of U.S. spot ETPs in 2025. The report suggested that the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETPs would hit $250 billion in assets under management in 2025. Alex Thorne, Head of Firmwide Research, highlighted in the report that the ETPs were about 19% and $24 billion away from reaching the U.S. gold ETPs. Throne also predicted that Bitcoin would be among the top-performing assets this year. The head of Firmwide Research revealed that the coin remained one of the top 3 performers on a risk-adjusted basis. Thorne further mentioned that his predictions were based on 2024’s Bitcoin and BTC ETPs performances. Another analyst, Christine Kim, revealed that Ether spot ETPs would also likely surge in 2025. According to Kim, the ETPs might get the opportunity to stake some of their Ether for investors. The analyst suggested that the development would come due to possible regulatory changes under Donald Trump’s administration.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 306,000 followers on the social media platform X that DOGE appears to be in the early stages of a new five-wave rally on the 12-hour chart. The trader follows Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave surge before entering an ABC-wave correction. Says Bluntz, “Monster DOGE move overnight, now looking undeniably impulsive again, in my opinion. The move back up to fresh highs above $0.50 is probably underway.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Dogecoin will hit prices above $0.60 before its fifth-wave rally comes to a close. The analyst is also keeping an eye on the Dogecoin versus Bitcoin (DOGE/ BTC ) trading pair. Bluntz says the chart tells him that DOGE will outperform BTC before the bull market expires. “DOGE/BTC ratio is basically still accumulating. There is not a snowball’s chance in hell this isn’t going significantly higher by the end of the cycle.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.379. As for Ethereum, Bluntz says ETH looks bullish on both the USD and BTC trading pairs. According to the analyst, Ethereum may be flashing signals suggesting that its relative underperformance is now a thing of the past. “Solid two-week range breakout on ETH here with a nice higher low being put in on ETH/BTC high timeframe. Clowning on ETH is easy and fun until it isn’t.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $3,618.

However, as XRP establishes itself in the crypto market, other projects like Stellar (XLM) and the nascent RCO Finance (RCOF) are beginning to mirror this success, offering potentially lucrative alternatives for those looking to diversify their investment portfolios beyond XRP. Stellar (XLM) Mirrors XRP Price Amid Shared Focus The trajectory of both XRP and Stellar (XLM) has been fascinating, especially in the context of their shared focus on facilitating fast, cost-effective cross-border payments. XRP, having navigated through regulatory challenges, saw a robust recovery in 2024, with its price climbing due to increased adoption and partnerships with financial institutions. This trend has not only solidified XRP’s position but has also paved the way for other blockchain solutions like Stellar to gain traction. Stellar, with its mission to democratize financial services globally, is showing similar patterns of growth. After a period of consolidation, Stellar’s XLM has started to see upward momentum, driven by strategic partnerships and the expansion of its network’s capabilities. Analysts suggest that this momentum could be a precursor to XLM catching up with XRP’s price performance, as both cater to similar use cases in the financial sector but with nuanced approaches towards inclusivity and transaction speed. RCO Finance Presale on the Brink of Completion RCO Finance (RCOF) , entering the crypto scene with its AI-powered financial platform, is currently in the fourth stage of its presale , with only one stage remaining before the token is listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. The presale has already seen the RCOF token price jump by 509% from its initial price to $0.07770, indicating strong investor interest and confidence in its future prospects. This surge reflects the market’s anticipation of RCO Finance’s potential to replicate the success of established projects like Ripple’s XRP. As the presale concludes, the token price is expected to rise by another 175% to $0.21420 in the bonus round, setting the stage for a listing price between $0.4 and $0.6. This trajectory suggests that early investors could see significant returns if the project delivers on its promises. The Innovative Features Poised to Send RCOF’s Value to the Moon The excitement around RCO Finance (RCOF) doesn’t just stem from its presale performance but is deeply rooted in the innovative features of its upcoming RCO Finance platform. RCO Finance aims to revolutionize investment by providing an AI-driven Robo Advisor that tailors investment strategies to individual user profiles, analyzing market data in real time to optimize portfolios. This level of personalization and automation is expected to drive the RCOF price upwards once the platform launches. Moreover, RCO Finance will offer access to over 120,000 assets across various classes, including tokenized real-world assets, which opens up investment opportunities previously inaccessible to many. In addition, the platform boosts a no-KYC policy, which further enhances user privacy, making it appealing to those prioritizing anonymity in financial dealings. Additionally, the security is bolstered by the fact that the smart contract has already been audited by SolidProof , ensuring that potential vulnerabilities are addressed before the platform’s full release. This blend of innovation, security, and user-centric features positions RCO Finance to potentially soar in value, offering a compelling alternative to XRP for those looking for the next big wave in cryptocurrency investments. In sum, while XRP continues to lead in the cross-border payment space, Stellar (XLM) and RCO Finance (RCOF) are not far behind, each carving out their niche with unique offerings that could very well mirror, if not exceed, the gains seen in Ripple’s 2024 rally.

This phase introduces an upgraded staking web app and focuses on testing new functionalities within the Babylon Proof-of-Stake chain. The testnet emphasizes interoperability and collaboration among key protocol participants. Key Features of The Babylon Phase-2 Testnet According to a recent blog post , the Babylon Phase-2 testnet will include a Proof-of-Stake chain secured by both Bitcoin PoS stakes and Signet Bitcoin stakes. This will incorporate both existing stakes from Phase-1 and newly created ones. Participants can register their Phase-1 stakes using the upgraded staking web app, which goes live at 10 AM UTC on January 8. The new testnet will allow developers, stakers, and other participants explore the registration of Phase-1 Signet Bitcoin stakes for Phase-2 operations. The testnet encourages collaboration among stakers, wallets, and developers by supporting the deployment of permissionless smart contracts. However, the tokens involved in this testnet are simulated and hold no monetary value. Moreover, it is important to note that BOB recently integrated with Babylon to leverage Bitcoin finality for securing transactions. This integration uses Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to enhance Bitcoin liquidity in DeFi while retaining the robust security of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Faucets and Testnet Participation To enable participation, the Bitcoin staking network has provided testnet faucets for acquiring the necessary funds. The faucets will distribute test Signet Bitcoin and tBABY tokens after the testnet launch. Signet Bitcoin, available through the Discord and OKX faucets, will be used for creating new stakes. Similarly, the Discord faucet will distribute 0.3 tBABY tokens per address weekly. Additionally, the staking app enables migration of Phase-1 stakes to the Phase-2 testnet. New stakes can also be created, and the app provides fast unbonding times of approximately 16-17 hours. Staking and Validation in The Bitcoin PoS Testnet Participants in the Babylon Phase-2 testnet include stakers, finality providers, CometBFT validators, and wallets. Stakers can register stakes through the staking app or CLI tools, while finality providers ensure network security by casting finality votes. CometBFT validators participate in block production, contributing to the consensus mechanism of the Bitcoin PoS chain. In addition, stake limits for Phase-2 have been established to prevent spam and manage stake flow. Transactions require a minimum stake of 0.0005 Signet Bitcoin, with a maximum stake of 350 Signet Bitcoin per transaction. The active set size for finality providers and CometBFT validators is capped at 100 slots each. Notably, participation in the Phase-2 testnet is restricted based on jurisdictional and regulatory considerations. Individuals and entities from sanctioned regions, including U.S. residents, are prohibited from participating. More so, last month, crypto exchange Binance revealed its plans to debut On-chain Yields, starting with Babylon BTC Staking.

Here’s why this could be good for the rally. Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment Has Remained Negative Recently As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment still has a red value. The “Weighted Sentiment” here refers to an indicator from the analytics firm Santiment that tells us about the dominant sentiment related to a given asset that’s present on the major social media platforms. This metric is based on two other indicators: Sentiment Balance and Social Volume. The first of these, the Sentiment Balance, calculates the net sentiment present on social media. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Make $1.08 Billion Net DOGE Purchase It works by putting the various posts/messages/threads through a machine-learning model to differentiate between positive and negative posts. Then, it takes the two counts and subtracts them to determine the net market situation. While the Sentiment Balance does provide a rough overview of social media, it may not always be the best representation of the majority of the users, as all it can do is take into account the data of the posts currently present. That is, it only says about the sentiment of the active users, regardless of whether they are actually a minority by count. To mitigate this problem and achieve more accuracy, the Weighted Sentiment incorporates the second element: the Social Volume. This indicator measures the total unique number of posts on social media that mention the cryptocurrency. Thus, by weighting the Sentiment Balance by this metric, the Weighted Sentiment ensures that its value only registers a spike (in either direction) when there is both a significant tendency towards one sentiment and a large number of users voicing said sentiment. Now, here is the chart for the Weighted Sentiment for Dogecoin shared by the analyst that shows the trend in its value over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment turned negative in December as the meme coin’s bull rally hit an obstacle, and its price reversed to the downside. The negative sentiment hasn’t changed in 2025 so far, but interestingly, the trend in the price has. Over the past week, the asset has seen a recovery rally of more than 20%. The continued bearish sentiment would imply this run hasn’t been enough to change the opinion of social media users yet. Historically, digital assets have tended to move in a way that’s opposite to the expectations of the majority. From the chart, it’s apparent that Dogecoin’s tops in November were accompanied by sharp positive spikes in the Weighted Sentiment.

Therefore, considering that the traders are pessimistic towards DOGE right now, chances may be that this latest rally could have further room to run before encountering a wall. DOGE Price Following its recovery during the last few days, Dogecoin has seen its value climb to the $387 mark.

Speaking during a recent interview, Garlinghouse cited the company’s substantial holdings of XRP, now valued at over $100 billion, as a key factor altering Ripple’s valuation outlook. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Calls $11B Valuation Outdated According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse the company now has more than $100 billion worth of XRP tokens. This development changes the valuation proposition of the blockchain infrastructure company dramatically. The CEO noted that Ripple’s trading in private markets has been much cheaper to the net asset value of the company than other companies that are linked to cryptocurrencies such as MicroStrategy. “The total value of the XRP we hold is now greater than $100 billion,” said Garlinghouse. He also compared Ripple’s valuation metrics with MicroStrategy noting that the latter trades at a premium to its assets. ”Ripple has been trading in the private markets at a discount while MicroStrategy has trading at 3x premium to its net asset value,” he said. Ripple was last valued at $11 billion in early 2024 when the company bought back $300 million worth of shares. Nevertheless, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that such an estimate is no longer relevant to the current financial position of Ripple, thanks to the increasing XRP price and institutional adoption. XRP Price Growth Attracts Attention Amid Market Trends XRP price has also seen a significant rise in value, it has risen five times its value before the election periods in late 2024. Ripple’s token has had increased liquidity and trading volume, sometimes even outperforming Bitcoin, as per data from FalconX. This upsurge is in line with other developments within the cryptocurrency market such as the high probability of a crypto ETF launch and debate on a U.S. based blockchain reserve. Crypto analyst Peter Brandt noted in his recent analysis of XRP’s technical chart that if the current bullish flag pattern would be fulfilled, XRP market cap may hit $500 billion. Furthermore, the SuperTrend indicator has just turned bullish on the XRP 12-hour chart for the first time in several months. Analyst Ali Charts pointed out that “The last time the SuperTrend indicator changed direction to the bullish side, XRP rose by 470%.” Ripple CEO Stance on Company Strategic Focus Although XRP is gaining popularity in the market, Ripple’s main business is still centered on offering blockchain technologies to financial companies. In the interview, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse restated his company’s focus on the B2B sector including banks, payment providers, and corporates, where Ripple is offering solutions like custody and cross-border payments. Recently, Ripple announced that it would launch its stablecoin called Ripple USD (RLUSD) with the license from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Garlinghouse stressed that the RLUSD will leverage XRP rather than replace it, increasing its liquidity, and opening more possibilities for the utilization of Ripple’s DEX and automated market maker (AMM) functionalities. The acquisition of Switzerland-based custody firm Metaco which was completed about 18 months ago has also put Ripple in a vantage position to offer its institutional products. The CEO was upbeat on the increased demand of the company’s custody services especially from Tier 1 banks. Changing Regulatory Environment Fuels Optimism Ripple’s growth has been supported by changing perceptions in the legal environment. Garlinghouse claimed that the previous several months marked a ‘turning point’ due to the exit of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and the chance for regulatory certainty under the new administration. As a result of the recent changes in the US government’s stance with regard to cryptocurrency innovation, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said, “The winds have changed.” Recently, he also stated that 95% of Ripple’s customers are outside the United States, but he expects the interest to return in the United States in the next few months.

The market’s buzzing with options, but picking the right project isn’t always easy. Qubetics ($TICS) , Kaspa, and Stacks are catching the attention of investors, each offering something fresh. Whether you’re drawn to blockchain development, fast transactions, or Bitcoin-powered smart contracts, there’s plenty to unpack. Qubetics is stepping in to tackle some of the pain points in Web3, creating smoother paths for developers and businesses. While many platforms offer blockchain tools, Qubetics’ approach brings everything under one roof, making development and integration less complicated. With its presale in full swing, $TICS might be worth keeping on your radar as the project moves closer to launch. Qubetics is Transforming Blockchain Development with QubeQode If you’ve been curious about blockchain but felt like the tech was too complex, Qubetics is the kind of project that flips that idea on its head. The QubeQode IDE makes it easier for anyone—whether you’re a developer or a business owner—to create blockchain applications without getting tangled up in code. Picture someone running a small online store. They could use QubeQode to add blockchain-based payment methods or authentication systems to their site without needing to hire an expert. This type of accessibility opens the door for more businesses to step into Web3, even if they don’t have the technical know-how. For larger companies, QubeQode offers ready-made tools to build advanced applications. Imagine a logistics firm wanting to use blockchain for tracking shipments. Instead of spending months developing custom software, they can leverage QubeQode’s drag-and-drop components to streamline the process. This platform isn’t just about coding—it’s about simplifying the way blockchain fits into real-world operations. On top of that, Qubetics recently announced its partnership with SWFT Blockchain to introduce a new wallet that could shake things up. This wallet will enable cross-chain transactions at lightning speed, letting users move assets seamlessly between different blockchains. Whether you’re a casual user trading crypto or a large organization managing multiple tokens, this kind of functionality could make a significant difference. Right now, Qubetics is in its 16th presale stage, and $TICS tokens are selling at $0.0455. Over 404 million tokens have already been purchased, pushing the tally beyond $8.9 million with more than 13,500 investors on board. The presale moves fast—every seven days, the price jumps by 10% as each stage ends. Analysts are projecting $TICS to hit $0.25 by the time the presale wraps up, which could lead to a 448.60% return. If $TICS hits $1, you’re looking at a 2094.42% ROI, and if things really heat up and it reaches $10 after the mainnet launch, the potential return could skyrocket to over 21844.27%. To break it down, if you invested $8.6 million today, the returns could multiply significantly depending on where $TICS lands. If you’re curious about what Qubetics brings to the table, check out the project video here . Kaspa is Winning Attention With its High-Speed, Scalable Blockchain Kaspa has been generating buzz lately for good reason. The project’s proof-of-work consensus, powered by the GHOSTDAG protocol, delivers high block rates and near-instant transaction confirmations. Unlike older blockchains that process one block at a time, Kaspa’s structure allows parallel blocks, making everything faster without compromising security. This scalability is turning heads among investors looking for tech that can keep up with growing demand. Analyst Alex Clay recently highlighted Kaspa’s strong performance, pointing out over a year of price accumulation and retracement, signaling potential growth. According to reports, whales are eyeing Kaspa as it continues to climb. This steady growth isn’t just hype—it’s backed by solid fundamentals that show Kaspa could be positioned for further gains. Kaspa’s fair launch model, with no pre-mining or early allocations, adds to its appeal for investors who prefer a level playing field. Right now, its circulating supply stands at about 25.48 billion KAS, with a cap set at 28.7 billion. This open, transparent approach has been key in building trust within the community. Kaspa’s developers frequently engage with their audience, keeping everyone in the loop on updates and improvements. Stacks is Bringing Smart Contracts to Bitcoin Stacks takes a different route by layering smart contracts on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. For years, Bitcoin has been the gold standard in crypto, but it lacked the flexibility of platforms like Ethereum that support decentralized applications. Stacks changes that by connecting directly to Bitcoin’s security, making it possible to build dApps while benefiting from Bitcoin’s robust network. The recent Nakamoto upgrade has made Stacks even faster and more secure. This upgrade enhances the platform’s speed, making it a more attractive option for developers. As a result, Stacks has been outperforming many cryptos on the market, reflecting the growing demand for Bitcoin layer-2 solutions. If you’ve been tracking STX, you’ve probably noticed its positive price movement, which speaks to increasing investor confidence. One thing developers love about Stacks is its Clarity programming language. Clarity prioritizes security and allows developers to write predictable, verifiable smart contracts—something that’s crucial in preventing bugs or vulnerabilities. This feature makes Stacks a go-to for projects that need bulletproof reliability while building within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Looking At Top Cryptos To Invest In This Year Whether you’re intrigued by Qubetics and its ambitious Web3 development platform, Kaspa’s lightning-fast blockchain, or Stacks’ innovative use of Bitcoin smart contracts, each of these projects offers a solid reason to pay attention. Qubetics is already capturing significant investment, Kaspa continues to gain traction with its high-speed performance, and Stacks is showing just how far Bitcoin can stretch with added functionality. If you’re serious about finding top cryptos to invest in this year , these three deserve a closer look.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 01:52:00

Today, on January 7, 2024, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (formerly Twitter) and made a bold prediction for XRP. Expert Says Buy Signal for XRP In a post, the expert noted that the last time a technical indicator named Supertrend flipped to bullish on the 12-hour time frame, XRP skyrocketed by 470%. Now, the altcoin has once again flipped bullish and flashing buy signal. This post on X is gaining widespread attention from crypto enthusiasts across the globe, as they are expecting a similar kind of rally this time as well.

At press time, XRP is trading near $2.41 and has experienced a modest price surge of 0.81% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped 10%, indicating a rise in participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. XRP Price Action and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP has been consolidating in a tight range between $2.37 and $2.46 for the last five days, following the breakout of a bullish pennant pattern on the daily time frame. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if XRP breaches this consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $2.48 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 85% to reach the $4.54 level in the future. Investors and Traders Rising Interest As of now, traders and long-term holders seem more interested in the altcoin, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Source: Coinglass Data from spot inflow/outflow revealed that during the same consolidation period, exchanges witnessed an outflow of a significant $38.02 million worth of XRP. This indicates that long-term holders continue to accumulate the altcoin despite the consolidation.

After examining technical indicators and historical trends, analysts are pointing to a possible surge in Cardano’s price to $4 in the near term. Meanwhile, the presale market is compelling as a promising Cardano rival, RCO FInance (RCOF) , is showing potential for an extraordinary leap from $0.077 to $5. This rising contender has captured investor attention, fueling anticipation for substantial returns as it continues its upward trajectory. Cardano Price Eyes $4 Amid Renewed Bullish Sentiment The Cardano price continues to outperform its peers, establishing itself as a leader in the DeFi market. Over the past year, ADA has surged 72.2%, with a notable 13.1% increase in daily charts and 21.8% weekly gains. Despite a minor pullback in December 2024, investor sentiment around the Cardano price has rebounded sharply. Analysts attribute the rally to favorable macroeconomic factors, including a shift in U.S. monetary policy and pro-crypto optimism linked to Donald Trump’s presidency. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests ADA replicates historical patterns from previous cycles, forecasting a potential surge to $4 in the coming weeks. If realized, this would mark a 280.95% rally from current levels, solidifying Cardano’s status as a major player in the blockchain ecosystem. With strong technical indicators and bullish market sentiment, a Cardano price rise signals broader confidence in crypto’s long-term potential. RCO Finance (RCOF) On Track to a $5 Breakthrough While the Cardano price potential surge is worth noting, RCO Finance (RCOF) has already demonstrated a bullish potential.

Each of these best crypto coins is not only a digital asset but a beacon of innovation in their respective domains—e-commerce, smart contracts, and blockchain scalability. Web3Bay is reimagining the e-commerce sector with a decentralized marketplace that promises a seamless, global shopping experience. Ethereum, the first mover in smart contracts, is on the cusp of a major breakthrough, poised for robust growth. Meanwhile, Solana continues to lead the charge in processing speed and efficiency, making it the platform of choice for DeFi and NFT initiatives. Web3Bay: Redefining E-Commerce with Decentralization Web3Bay is boldly stepping forward to reshape global e-commerce by creating a decentralized marketplace that fundamentally changes how buyers and sellers connect. Unlike conventional platforms burdened by intermediaries and high fees, Web3Bay removes these barriers, facilitating direct interactions with enhanced transparency and security, thanks to blockchain technology. What sets Web3Bay apart is its inclusive payment model that supports both crypto and traditional payment methods like PayPal. This innovative approach not only caters to crypto enthusiasts but also welcomes a wider audience, bridging the divide between conventional and digital commerce. For merchants in less accessible regions, this platform opens up a world of opportunity, providing them access to global markets without traditional constraints. In its second presale stage, Web3Bay has already raised over $420,000 and sold 110 million tokens at $0.0036975 each. With 28 stages planned and each stage increasing the price by 15%, the potential for a 6000% ROI is stirring significant investor interest. Ethereum: Gearing Up for a Breakout Year Ethereum continues to dominate the smart contract and decentralized application space, with signs strongly pointing to a breakout year in 2025. Currently, Ethereum’s price action is consolidating, indicating a potentially significant upcoming movement. With its price hovering around $3,519 and showing strong support, predictions suggest it could soar to $4,022 or higher. The anticipated surge in Ethereum’s market value is supported by its ongoing advancements, notably its shift to a Proof of Stake model, which enhances both scalability and energy efficiency. These improvements make Ethereum increasingly attractive to a broader range of institutional investors and secure its position as the foundational platform for numerous DeFi and NFT projects. Solana: Pioneering Speed in the Blockchain World Solana has set a new standard in the blockchain community for its incredible transaction speeds and minimal fees. Its distinct Proof of History consensus mechanism allows for processing thousands of transactions per second, making it an ideal solution for widespread adoption. Solana’s ability to handle immense transaction volumes effectively is evidenced by its recent achievement of processing over 72 million transactions in a single day. This capability, combined with a robust and active developer community, solidifies its position as a critical solution for developers seeking scalability without sacrificing speed. Summing Up Looking ahead to 2025, Web3Bay, Ethereum, and Solana each stand out with their unique capabilities to transform and dominate their sectors. Web3Bay is set to revolutionize the e-commerce landscape, providing a decentralized platform that offers unmatched control and opportunities to its users. Ethereum looks to continue leading the smart contract space with significant technological advancements, while Solana is poised to remain a top choice for developers needing high-speed and scalable blockchain solutions. These projects underscore the diverse and dynamic nature of blockchain technology, each offering unique opportunities for growth and innovation. For investors and tech enthusiasts alike, these best crypto coins present not just investment opportunities but a chance to be part of a transformative movement in the digital world.

According to crypto service provider Matrixport , these changes do not necessarily signal a bearish turn in the cryptocurrency market. In a recent X post , Matrixport emphasized the importance of stablecoin performance as a key market indicator. While such trends often correlate with market corrections, the firm suggests that Tether’s decline may simply reflect a seasonal downturn tied to the Christmas holidays , rather than a shift toward bearish sentiment. Stablecoins as Market Indicators Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) play a vital role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, often serving as a bridge between fiat currencies and digital assets. Key Metrics to Watch Market Capitalization Growth : Rising market cap typically indicates an influx of fiat money into crypto markets, supporting bullish momentum. Trading Volume : Increased volume suggests heightened market activity and strong demand for digital assets. When Trends Reverse Declines in these metrics can indicate reduced market activity and potential corrections, as investors withdraw funds or reduce exposure to risk. Matrixport’s Analysis of Tether’s Decline Current Trends Market Cap Drop : Tether’s market cap has seen a decline, raising concerns about potential market corrections. Volume Decline : Trading volumes have similarly dipped, a trend often associated with reduced investor activity. Matrixport’s Perspective Seasonal Factors : The firm attributes the decline to seasonal factors , particularly the slowdown during the Christmas and New Year holidays. Not Necessarily Bearish : Matrixport believes it is too early to conclude that the market has turned bearish based solely on Tether’s recent performance. Implications for the Crypto Market Potential Scenarios Seasonal Downturn : If Matrixport’s assessment holds, the market may rebound as trading activity picks up post-holiday season. Bearish Signal : A prolonged decline in Tether’s market cap and volume could eventually signal reduced liquidity and a shift toward a bearish trend. Role of Stablecoins in Market Sentiment Stablecoins often serve as a barometer for overall market health, making their performance critical to understanding broader trends. What Investors Should Watch 1. Tether’s Market Cap Recovery A rebound in Tether’s market cap would likely indicate renewed fiat inflows and bullish sentiment. 2. Stablecoin Trading Volume Increased trading volumes, especially for USDT, suggest heightened market activity and investor confidence. 3. Broader Market Indicators Key metrics such as Bitcoin’s price action , altcoin performance , and on-chain activity will provide additional context to Tether’s trends. FAQs What does Tether’s market cap decline indicate? A decline in Tether’s market cap could suggest reduced fiat inflows into the crypto market, often signaling potential corrections. However, Matrixport attributes this to seasonal factors rather than a bearish turn. Why is Tether important for the crypto market? Tether serves as a bridge between fiat currencies and digital assets, making its market cap and trading volume critical indicators of overall market sentiment. Is the crypto market turning bearish? Matrixport believes it is too early to conclude that the market is bearish based solely on Tether’s recent trends, attributing the changes to holiday seasonality. What should investors monitor in the coming weeks? Investors should track Tether’s market cap and trading volume for signs of recovery, along with broader crypto market trends like Bitcoin price movements. Conclusion Tether’s recent decline in market cap and trading volume has sparked concerns about potential market corrections. However, Matrixport suggests these changes are more likely tied to seasonal factors than a fundamental shift in market sentiment. As the holiday season concludes, all eyes will be on Tether’s performance and broader market indicators to determine whether the crypto market’s bullish momentum will continue.

Fantom is seeing a rise in both new and existing addresses, which points to an expanding ecosystem and hints at enduring value. Concurrently, Render whale activity is illustrating the impact of strategic moves that capitalize on price rebounds to realize substantial returns. As these established projects build steam, experts are eyeing a $20 target price for BlockDAG (BDAG) , following its announcement of WASM technology and an impressive presale that accumulated $176 million. BlockDAG is on track for rapid growth within the memecoin arena, attracting proactive traders looking to capitalize on what might be the major breakthrough of 2025. Growth Signals Emanate from Fantom Network The Fantom network is experiencing a boost in activity, suggesting a hopeful recovery. Recent figures indicate significant rises in new and active participants, underscoring the network’s increasing charm for developers and traders. Market insights currently set critical support for FTM at $0.7316, with a resistance level of $0.9671. The upswing in activity within the Fantom network corresponds with a bullish trend in liquidations, with long positions dominating shorts—showing trader optimism despite ongoing price variations. The network’s continued expansion shows its resilience and ability to pull interest in tough market conditions, spotlighting its potential for long-term trader growth. Render Whale Transactions Stir Market Dynamics Render whale activity is now a focal point, prompting notable market movements. Onchain Lens details that a whale has moved 908,259 RNDR tokens worth $6.47 million to Binance, priced on average at $7.13 each. This move resulted in a $466,000 gain, highlighting the effectiveness of seizing profits amid recent price improvements. This increase in Render whale activity coincides with a 10% rise in large transactions reported by IntoTheBlock. This surge indicates a solid interest, bolstering a positive outlook for Render. Despite recent hurdles, the ongoing recovery in prices and heightened whale activity suggest a sustained upward trajectory for Render in the market. Will BlockDAG Be the Breakout Crypto Star in 2025?

Latest Insights on TRX Price Prediction & ADA Market Analysis,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-stirs-excitement-with-usdt-rewards-up-to-10-latest-insights-on-trx-price-prediction-ada-market-analysis/,"Identifying the top crypto to buy in 2025 is increasingly crucial for those looking for substantial growth, with Cardano, Tron, and BlockDAG standing out as frontrunners. Recent Cardano price predictions signal a mix of hope and realism, with ADA’s future being molded by ongoing tech developments and market changes. In contrast, Tron market analysis shows a complex picture, with TRX poised on the brink of either significant gains or setbacks. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) captures attention with its Refer and Earn USDT program, which allows for instant cashback of 6% to 10% with no limit to earnings. This unique offer provides a compelling opportunity to benefit from BlockDAG’s unprecedented $176 million presale. TRON Market Outlook: Uncertainty Ahead for TRX The latest TRON market analysis paints a picture of uncertainty with TRX currently priced around $0.2587 as of December 30, 2024, experiencing a slight drop of 1.51% from the day before. Analysts are split, suggesting TRX could either drop to the $0.15 support in tough market conditions or climb to $0.40, supported by favorable economic trends such as potential Federal Reserve rate reductions. Despite high transaction volumes, these have not markedly impacted TRX’s pricing yet. The technical indicators are mixed, with some short-term averages indicating a ‘Strong Buy’ while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, advising a cautious approach. Cardano’s 2025 Prospects: Can ADA Reach New Heights? Cardano’s latest price forecasts show a balance between optimism and caution, with ADA currently around $0.87 after a recent dip. Analyst @LucidCiC on X enthusiastically states, “$ADA is about to go Interstellar!” while other experts suggest a potential climb to $2.42 or even $4.69, driven by market dynamics and technological advances. Noteworthy developments like the Chang hard fork and increased adoption efforts, particularly in Africa, reinforce this positive sentiment. Furthermore, the anticipated Bitcoin halving in 2025 could impact the wider crypto market, likely benefiting ADA. As one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025, ADA holds promise, though a careful review of Cardano’s market trends and price forecasts is advisable. BlockDAG Unleashes Unlimited USDT Cashback for Referrals and Purchases BlockDAG has taken the crypto market by storm with its groundbreaking presale, amassing over $176 million and registering an incredible 2380% increase in value since its initial batch. This impressive growth is propelled further by its interesting Refer & Earn USDT program, which provides immediate cashback rewards for both those who refer and those who buy, without any caps on earnings. This approach redefines reward systems in the crypto space, positioning BDAG as a standout choice. The referral mechanism is straightforward and highly beneficial. Referrers receive instant cashback between 6% and 10% in USDT (BEP-20) based on purchases made through their links, with the percentage increasing as transaction volume grows within a 24-hour cycle, resetting at 00:00 UTC. Purchasers benefit from a steady 6% cashback on every transaction, fostering a mutually advantageous environment that promotes ongoing engagement. The immediate nature of the cashback, coupled with no limits on potential earnings, positions this program as exceptionally rewarding in today’s market. As BDAG’s popularity continues to climb, analysts predict its price could hit $1 by 2025, potentially yielding a 4,200% ROI for holders from batch 27, and affirming its status as one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025. The ongoing presale presents a unique opportunity to purchase this cryptocurrency at just $0.0234 per coin, along with the benefit of immediate cashback rewards. With more than 17.7 billion BDAG sold, time is running out for those looking to buy this top crypto coin. Final Say As we edge closer to 2025, the Cardano price prediction indicates a bright future for ADA, supported by its technological innovations and expanding adoption, though a careful analysis of market trends is essential. Conversely, Tron market analysis suggests a volatile journey ahead, with TRX balancing on the cusp of potential upswings and downturns, influenced by broader economic indicators. Yet, BlockDAG stands out as the top crypto to buy in 2025 , thanks to its unparalleled referral program that offers 6% to 10% instant USDT cashback rewards. With its record-setting presale, remarkable growth trajectory, and forecasts predicting a significant rise in value, BlockDAG combines the allure of immediate financial incentives with substantial long-term growth prospects, making it an exciting prospect for proactive market participants.

33767162,[object Object],1736217045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,CFTC Charges Resolved: Crypto Exchange Gemini Strikes $5 Million Deal In Proposed Order,https://bitcoinist.com/cftc-charges-resolved-gemini-strikes-5-million-deal/,"In a major advancement for the cryptocurrency sector, Gemini Trust, headed by the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, has consented to pay $5 million to resolve allegations made by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Gemini Addresses CFTC Claims Of Deception In Bitcoin Futures Launch According to a Bloomberg report , the agreement seeks to address allegations that the exchange allegedly deceived the regulator while trying to launch the inaugural US-regulated Bitcoin futures contract. The suggested agreement was revealed in a combined court submission on Monday, preventing a trial that was scheduled to start on January 21, coinciding with Donald Trump’s second inauguration as US president. The CFTC first initiated its lawsuit in 2022, claiming that Gemini issued “false and misleading statements” about its actions to avert market manipulation in Bitcoin prices. These prices were meant to act as a benchmark for derivative agreements related to the cryptocurrency. The complaint states that from July to December 2017, Gemini, directly and via other means, supplied the CFTC with deceptive information while it assessed a possible self-certification for a Bitcoin futures contract. The suggested futures contract would be settled according to the spot Bitcoin price established by an auction held on Gemini’s trading platform for digital assets, referred to as the Gemini Bitcoin Auction. The CFTC asserted that several statements issued by Gemini were misleading or failed to include vital information necessary for grasping the vulnerability of the suggested contract to manipulation. Regulatory Oversight In Cryptocurrency Sector As stated in the complaint , Gemini staff allegedly knew or ought to have known that their remarks might deceive the CFTC, which depends on precise information from market participants to carry out its regulatory duties. This suggested Bitcoin futures contract was especially important as it was slated to be among the initial digital asset futures contracts offered on a specified contract market. The reliability of the information given was crucial for the CFTC to maintain the financial integrity of transactions and safeguard market participants from manipulation and other disturbances. This civil enforcement action involving Gemini was part of a larger effort by the Biden administration to create regulatory control over the cryptocurrency industry. The upcoming inauguration of Trump, seen by numerous crypto supporters as a possible ally for the sector, brings up queries regarding the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the US. In a similar vein, Gemini had earlier complied with subpoenas requesting laptops from two ex-executives during a criminal investigation that eventually ended without any charges being brought. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is trading at $102,130 for the first time in over two weeks, up more than 10% on a weekly basis.

This forecast, shared by The Block , attributes Bitcoin’s rise to increasing demand from institutional and corporate entities while excluding potential government purchases. If realized, this milestone would solidify Bitcoin’s position as a global store of value, further transforming the dynamics of ownership and adoption across markets. Key Drivers of Bitcoin’s $200K Prediction 1. Institutional and Corporate Demand Bernstein analysts highlight the growing role of institutions and corporations in driving Bitcoin’s value. Bitcoin ETFs : The increasing prevalence of Bitcoin ETFs is facilitating easier access to the asset for retail and institutional investors. Corporate Treasuries : Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have set a precedent by integrating Bitcoin into their treasuries, inspiring other firms to follow suit. 2. Ownership Shifts to Long-Term Holders Gautam Chhugani, Managing Director at Bernstein, notes a key trend: Price Consolidation Below $100K : Bitcoin’s price remaining under $100,000 is prompting a shift in ownership from short-term traders to long-term holders. Entities like MicroStrategy and Bitcoin ETF investors contribute to this “permanent” ownership model. The Potential Role of Governments While Bernstein’s projection excludes government demand, the report acknowledges the potential for a game-changing shift if nations begin to include Bitcoin in their national reserves . What Could Happen? Triggering Global Competition : A U.S. decision to hold Bitcoin could spark worldwide competition among nations to acquire the cryptocurrency. Impact on Supply : Government demand would create significant scarcity, accelerating Bitcoin’s price rise. Bitcoin’s Road to $200K: Milestones and Challenges Milestones to Watch Increased ETF Adoption : A higher number of Bitcoin ETFs could lead to substantial capital inflows. Corporate Adoption : More companies adding Bitcoin to their treasuries would enhance its credibility as a reserve asset. Challenges Regulatory Risks : Regulatory uncertainty remains a key hurdle for Bitcoin’s price growth. Market Volatility : Bitcoin’s historical price swings may deter cautious investors. Comparative Analysis: Institutional and Government Demand Factor Institutional Demand Government Demand Impact on Price Gradual and sustained Sharp and exponential Likelihood High Moderate (dependent on geopolitical shifts) Potential Catalysts ETFs, corporate treasuries U.S. or major economies adopting Bitcoin FAQs Why does Bernstein predict Bitcoin will reach $200K by 2025? Bernstein’s forecast is based on rising institutional and corporate demand for Bitcoin, excluding potential government purchases. What role do ETFs play in Bitcoin’s price prediction? Bitcoin ETFs provide a regulated and accessible way for institutions and retail investors to acquire Bitcoin, contributing to increased demand. How could government demand impact Bitcoin’s price? If governments begin including Bitcoin in their national reserves, it could trigger global competition for the asset, significantly driving up its price. What factors might delay Bitcoin’s rise to $200K? Regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and slower-than-expected institutional adoption could delay Bitcoin’s growth. Who are the long-term holders driving Bitcoin’s value? Companies like MicroStrategy and investors in Bitcoin ETFs represent a shift towards long-term ownership, stabilizing Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Conclusion Bernstein’s $200,000 Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 underscores the growing influence of institutional and corporate demand on the cryptocurrency market. While the forecast excludes government purchases, the potential for global competition among nations to acquire Bitcoin adds another layer of intrigue. As ETFs and corporate treasuries increasingly dominate Bitcoin ownership, the path to $200K seems plausible, provided the market navigates regulatory and adoption challenges effectively.

This claim was made before a New York City court on Jan. 6, 2025, where Kwon is facing nine counts of felony relating to fraud at Terraform Labs. In the document submitted by acting U.S. attorney Daniel Gitner , the government outlined its intent to notify victims regarding their rights under the Justice for All Act of 2004. Due to the immense scale and global extent of Terraform Lab’s dissolution, traditional methods of notifying victims were believed to be impractical. Rather, the government proposed to set up a public website for Kwon’s case proceedings. The filing stated: “While it is difficult to precisely quantify the number of Kwon’s victims in light of the sheer number of purchases and sales of Terraform’s cryptocurrencies and the manner of those transactions (with many transactions in those assets occurring on foreign exchanges and through digital asset wallet or crypto trading accounts without personal identifying information), the Government estimates that the number of victims, in this case, exceeds hundreds of thousands of individuals and entities, and potentially totals more than one million.” The Justice for All Act provides that the victim of a federal crime enjoys particular rights such as timely notification of public court proceedings, the opportunity to be heard during sentencing or plea agreements, and the right to restitution if applicable. The Act, however, gives room for the courts to put in place in cases where a large number of victims need to be considered; reasonable procedures are evident in this case.

Kwon was sent to the U.S. in Dec. 2024 after protracted negotiations involving many jurisdictions, including South Korea, following his arrest in Montenegro in 2023 for unrelated charges. On Jan. 2, 2025, Kwon appeared before a U.S. court for the first time and entered a not-guilty plea to the charges against him. He is still being held in custody. Kwon and Terraform Labs were also charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a civil case in April 2024. In this case, he and Terraform Labs were ordered to pay nearly $4.5 billion in disgorgement, civil penalties, and prejudgment interest. Moving forward in the case, the government’s victim notification website is expected to assume a significant role in ensuring compliance with the statutory rights of a victim without overburdening the court processes. For victims, this represents a real step toward transparency and acknowledgment of the harms suffered as a result of the collapse of Terraform Labs.

The data analytics platform further revealed the top 10 projects with the most significant token unlock value, including Aptos, Optimism, and Arbitrum. The platform’s token unlock data highlighted that the tokens released by projects since the beginning of the year have amounted to over $1.3 billion. CryptoRank data also revealed that the largest unlock value recorded was on January 1, valued at $910 million, while the lowest was on January 2, valued at $62 million. The week began with token unlocks worth $63 million, with more expected throughout the week. The research platform also confirmed that the third week of this month, from January 13 to 19, will record the highest unlock value, worth $4 billion. The January 6-12 week, the 20-26 week, and the January 27- February 2 week are expected to record $986 million, $509 million, and $1 billion in unlocks, respectively. CryptoRank confirmed that token unlocks involved releasing tokens locked up by different projects over a certain period, referred to as the vesting period. Token unlocks release the tokens to different project areas, including investors, the project’s team, governance nodes, development funding, marketing, and rewards.

The unlock will account for about 2% of Aptos’ market capitalization, which currently stands at about $5.67 billion at the time of publication. The Circular Protocol will conduct the second-largest token unlock this January, accounting for about 63% of its market cap. On January 12, the project will release 28 billion CIRX tokens worth $108.35 million. Arbitrum, Optimism, Ronin, Movement, UXLINK, Immutable, Jito Labs, and StarkNET are the remaining top 8 projects, meant to release $86,24 million, $67.29 million, $66.89 million, $53.35 million, $36,73 million, $35.59 million, $35.04 million, and $32.66 million in token unlock value, respectively. Keyrock speculates that token unlocks might negatively impact markets According to digital asset liquidity solutions service provider Keyrock, the January token unlocks might trigger negative market responses. After monitoring over 16,000 unlocks, the company researched token unlocks and their effects on crypto markets. The platform published its research findings in December 2024 as investors anticipated the possible effects of this year’s unlocks. The Keyrock research report highlighted that crypto projects unlock over $600 million in weekly tokens. The firm explained in its research that despite the predetermined actions taken before the token unlocks, the recipients, scale, anticipation, timing, and other factors dictate the negative outcomes experienced after. The research ascertained that the larger the token unlocks, the higher the chances for negative feedback in the market. The report further highlighted that large unlocks could lead to approximately 2.4x price declines and significantly increased volatility depending on all factors before and during a token unlock. Keyrock still explained that 90% of the token uncocks had higher chances of triggering negative price action despite the type and size of the release. However, the research also highlighted that token release to teams causes the most notable crashes that lead to panic sell-offs. Keyrock further shared that investor unlocks triggered more stable price action, while project development unlocks yielded the most positive results. The research identified different trends investors could expect from its study, explaining that linear unlocks positively impacted the markets more than cliff unlocks. The January unlocks are, however, mostly cliff unlocks, leading to the firm’s speculation of negative price action. Keyrock shared that retail investors would be more prone to reacting to negative market dynamics than institutional investors.

Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) has surpassed the $3.5 mark, reinforcing its position as a major player in the crypto landscape. This bullish environment has also sparked interest in Lightchain AI , a new project that has raised over $8.5 million in its presale, priced at $0.004875 per token. Ethereum’s Price Surge and the Growing Demand for ETH-Based Tokens Ethereum (ETH) has had a big jump in price lately, caused by a few main reasons. Interest from large groups has gone up a lot, with much money coming into Ethereum spot ETFs. For example, U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs got $428 million in net money on December 5, 2024 showing more trust among large investors. Also, Ethereum’s lead in the money without a middleman (DeFi) area keeps pushing up need. The system’s job in changing real-world items into tokens, a market worth about $100 trillion, makes it even more attractive. Ethereum now has a strong 81% share of the market͏ in tokening which shows its key part in the future of block chain tech. These changes have not just raised Ethereum’s market size but have also increased interest in ETH tokens, showing the platform’s growing power in the crypto world. Ripple Surpasses $3.5, Attracting Renewed Interest from Investors Ripple’s XRP has recently surpassed the $2.45 mark, attracting renewed interest from investors. This surge is partly due to significant accumulation by large holders, known as whales, who have purchased over 40 million XRP tokens, indicating strong confidence in the asset’s potential. Analysts suggest that if XRP maintains its current momentum, it could target the $3.5 price level, a significant resistance point near its all-time high. This optimism is further supported by increased network activity and positive developments in Ripple’s legal battles, which have historically influenced XRP’s price movements.

38637138,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=119113,1736218802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"XRP Price Analysts Highlight PropiChain as a Top Contender for Safer Returns With a 12,000x Edge",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/xrp-price-analysts-highlight-propichain-as-a-top-contender-for-safer-returns-with-a-12000x-edge/,"XRP price analysts have recently turned their attention to PropiChain (PCHAIN), an innovative and revolutionary blockchain-based real estate platform. These top-rated analysts see PCHAIN as a promising alternative for investors seeking safer returns in the volatile crypto market. While the XRP price movement continues to fluctuate, PCHAIN has emerged as a standout contender, offering a unique value proposition that appeals to both seasoned investors and newcomers. With its innovative approach to tokenized real estate, PropiChain is capturing the interest of XRP price analysts, who are impressed by its potential to deliver remarkable returns of up to 12,000X. According to the XRP price analysts, PCHAIN capitalized on the stability and growth of the $600 trillion global real estate market, combined with the efficiency of blockchain technology, to offer a compelling alternative to more traditional digital assets. PCHAIN’s appeal lies in its promise of long-term stability and exponential growth potential. The XRP Price Trajectory While the XRP price has surged recently, with the asset rising by 14.7% over the last 7 days, investors are still concerned about long-term sustainability. Ripple’s collaborations with financial institutions worldwide have strengthened its reputation as a reliable digital asset. However, the XRP price has faced its fair share of challenges, including regulatory hurdles and price volatility. Despite its resilience and ongoing use cases, the XRP price movement hasn’t convinced long-term holders. These investors are increasingly exploring diversification options, and PropiChain has presented an ideal opportunity. PropiChain: A Top Contender with 12,000X Growth Potential Ahead of The XRP Price PropiChain is a blockchain-powered real estate platform that uses new-generation technologies to power the future of the global real estate market. The platform is a relatively new entrant in the crypto space and has been gaining traction for its unique value proposition. Designed as a decentralized platform for real estate tokenization, PropiChain aims to bridge the gap between traditional property markets and blockchain technology. By enabling fractional ownership of real estate assets, the platform offers investors access to high-value properties without the substantial capital typically required. This innovative model democratizes real estate investment and introduces a layer of stability often absent in the crypto market. Real estate is historically considered a “safe-haven” asset, and PropiChain’s blockchain integration ensures transparency, security, and transaction efficiency. Top XRP price analysts have pointed out that PCHAIN’s dual focus on stability and innovation makes it a compelling choice for risk-averse investors. While XRP continues to offer utility in financial systems, its price remains subject to external factors like regulatory developments. PCHAIN, on the other hand, provides a hedge against such uncertainties through its asset-backed approach. Integrating blockchain with real estate has long been touted as the next big thing, but no platform has managed to execute it effectively like PCHAIN. The platform’s clear roadmap and tangible use cases give it an edge that’s hard to ignore The 12,000x Edge: What Sets PCHAIN Apart? The claim of a potential 12,000x edge stems from PCHAIN’s strategic positioning in two high-growth markets: blockchain technology and the $600 trillion real estate. Here’s a breakdown of the factors contributing to this significant potential: Real-World Asset Backing Unlike many crypto assets like XRP price that rely solely on market speculation, PCHAIN is backed by tangible real estate assets. This real-world backing provides a cushion against extreme price swings and enhances investor confidence in the asset. Fractional Ownership PropiChain’s fractional ownership model allows small and medium-sized investors to participate in lucrative real estate markets that were previously out of reach. This inclusivity expands the investor base and boosts demand for PCHAIN, the platform’s utility token. Global Accessibility The platform’s decentralized nature ensures accessibility for investors worldwide. With blockchain’s inherent transparency, PCHAIN eliminates geographical and bureaucratic barriers typically associated with real estate investments. PropiChain’s Technological Innovation to Power the Future of Real Estate PCHAIN uses cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), the Metaverse, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and smart contracts to transform the global real estate industry. With AI-powered tools such as virtual assistants and chatbots, the platform offers investors round-the-clock support, ensuring a seamless experience throughout their investment journey. Its AI-driven market analysis features deliver predictive insights into emerging market trends, empowering investors with the knowledge to make strategic investment decisions. PropiChain enables virtual property tours through state-of-the-art 3D visualization technology by incorporating the Metaverse. This approach eliminates physical visits, creating a borderless, global marketplace where buyers and sellers can connect, interact, and complete transactions effortlessly. PCHAIN’s RWA tokenization technology transforms real estate assets into digital tokens, paving the way for fractional ownership of premium properties. This innovation significantly lowers financial barriers, making real estate investment more accessible and inclusive for a broader audience. The platform’s smart contracts also streamline property management by automating property leasing and lease renewals. By cutting out intermediaries like brokers and leasing agents, real estate investors can manage their properties more efficiently while reducing operational costs. Conclusion For these XRP price analysts, PropiChain offers crypto enthusiasts a glimpse into the future of crypto investments. With its unique blend of blockchain technology and real estate, PCHAIN is well-positioned to deliver safer returns and achieve its touted 12,000x edge. According to the analysts, your $1000 investment in the ongoing PCHAIN presale would yield over $328,432 in profit before the end of Q1 2025. The project raised over $1.3 million during its first token presale and has crossed the $640,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round, which shows investor confidence in PCHAIN’s profit potential. After this presale round, the token price will rise by over 109% for the final presale round. Join the PCHAIN presale now for life-changing gains and a low entry price. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , a sign of the project’s mission to take the crypto space by storm.

38637174,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=671524,1736218806,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,MicroStrategy Strikes Again: $100 Million Bitcoin Purchase Signals Strong Market Confidence,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/microstrategy-strikes-again-100-million-bitcoin-purchase-signals-strong-market-confidence/,"MicroStrategy, the major enterprise software company that has evolved into a Bitcoin (BTC) investment platform, has captured attention once again with its latest purchase of $101 million in BTC. The company, led by chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor, has committed to utilizing perpetual preferred stock, common shares, and debt to fuel its ongoing Bitcoin purchasing strategy. MicroStrategy Eyes $42 Billion Capital Raise By 2027 In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MicroStrategy disclosed that it purchased 1,070 Bitcoin tokens at an average price of approximately $94,000 on December 30 and 31, 2024. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 447,470 BTC, acquired for around $27.97 billion at an average price of $62,503 per Bitcoin. Notably, Saylor highlighted in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), that the company achieved a Bitcoin yield of 48% for the fourth quarter of 2024 and 74.3% for the entire fiscal year. Related Reading: XRP Eyes $11 Breakout, But A Correction Might Come First—Analyst MicroStrategy’s ambitious plans extend beyond Bitcoin acquisitions. On Friday, the firm announced its intention to raise up to $2 billion through offerings of perpetual preferred stock, which will hold seniority over its Class A common stock. This move is part of a larger strategy to raise $42 billion in capital by 2027 through various means, including at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offerings. With more than two-thirds of its equity goals already met, the company is expected to pivot towards fixed-income markets in the near future. The demand for MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has notably increased among hedge funds, which are employing convertible arbitrage strategies that involve purchasing bonds and short-selling shares. This strategy capitalizes on the volatility of MicroStrategy’s stock, a characteristic that has become a cornerstone of its business model. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer remarked: That volatility itself is a key element of MicroStrategy’s approach because it enables the company to tap into the capital markets and particularly the convertible bond market more easily. MicroStrategy’s recent proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.3 billion has sparked fears of share dilution, leading to a significant drop in the company’s stock price. MicroStrategy’s Bold Bitcoin Strategy Faces Headwinds On the day of the proxy filing in December, shares fell by as much as 9.6%. Adam Kobeissi, founder of The Kobeissi Letter, noted the dilemma faced by investors, stating: It’s a lose-lose because on one hand you have people saying that it’s dilutive and they’re selling the stock… but on the other hand you have people saying if it doesn’t pass, then they can’t keep buying Bitcoin and the whole investment strategy is kind of broken. A vote on the share increase is scheduled for January 21, 2025, and with Saylor being a significant shareholder, the amendment is expected to pass. Should it be approved, the increase in shares could lead to further volatility in MicroStrategy’s stock price as the company becomes more leveraged. Although the company has typically outperformed Bitcoin, it has faced challenges in recent months, underlining that its performance is influenced by factors beyond just cryptocurrency prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Price on the Rise: Can Momentum Fuel Bigger Gains? Despite the recent fluctuations, Palmer maintains a “buy” rating on MicroStrategy’s stock. He believes the market’s reaction to the proposed share increase has been an overreaction. “The company’s strategy has been to issue shares to make accretive Bitcoin purchases which can accrue to the benefit of shareholders,” he commented. MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach to Bitcoin acquisitions has seen it make significant purchases exceeding $1 billion in late 2024, although recent weeks have seen a slowdown in these activities amidst fluctuating Bitcoin prices. Palmer reassured investors, stating, “We’ve seen a pull forward of the company’s strategy, which is not indicative of a slowdown… it’s more a reflection of the aggressive approach that the company has taken.” At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto is inching closer to the $100,000 milestone, trading at $99,340, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 03:23:00

Yep, you read that right. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a cheeky new player that’s not only crushing it with staking rewards but also raising eyebrows with its skyrocketing presale performance. The coin hit over $2.5 million in the first two weeks of its presale launch and hasn’t slowed down since, surpassing $5 million and counting. But it’s not just about numbers. BTFD has unique features that go beyond the usual meme coin hype. With plans to incorporate decentralised tools, community-led governance, and long-term utility, BTFD isn’t just a flash in the pan. It’s aiming to carve out a solid niche in the market. Oh, and did we mention over 62 billion coins have already been snapped up by 7,700 holders? The popularity of meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has rewritten the rules of crypto. They’ve proven that community-driven projects can skyrocket with the right mix of humour and heart. BTFD Coin , however, is upping the ante. It’s combining meme culture with tangible benefits, making it one of the best new meme coins to invest in this week . Let’s dive into how it compares to Simon’s Cat and Apu Apustaja. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Offering 90% APY on Staking BTFD is the new kid on the block, but it’s playing like a seasoned pro. Starting its presale at a humble $0.000004 per coin, it has already reached $0.0000142 in Stage 13. With 16 stages total and a listing price of $0.0006, early investors stand to gain massive returns. Imagine investing $35,000 at the current price. That would snag you 246.48 million BTFD coins . When the price hits $0.0006, you’re looking at a whopping $147,888 . That’s the kind of win most crypto enthusiasts dream about. BTFD Coin is making waves with its impressive 90% APY staking rewards , offering investors a lucrative way to grow their holdings passively. Unlike traditional meme coins, BTFD combines community-driven hype with real financial incentives, making it a standout in the crypto market. Staking BTFD is simple and rewarding, allowing users to lock their coins and earn substantial returns while supporting the coin’s ecosystem. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, this high APY rate ensures your money works harder for you. With BTFD’s growing popularity and presale momentum, the 90% staking reward is the cherry on top for investors. The buzz around BTFD isn’t just about the numbers, though. Its presale has become a talking point across Gen Z and Millennial communities in Australasia and beyond. People love a good underdog story, and BTFD is delivering just that with its 16-stage structure and ambitious roadmap. And the 90% APY on staking? It’s like the cherry on top of an already irresistible crypto sundae. Simon’s Cat (CAT): A Meow-tastic Memecoin Adventure Simon’s Cat entered the meme coin space with a purr and a promise. Inspired by the viral cartoon series, CAT has quickly become a favourite for animal lovers and crypto enthusiasts alike. The coin’s value surged last week, thanks to clever marketing campaigns and an impending airdrop. But it’s not all sunshine and catnip. While CAT’s price action has been impressive, critics argue that it lacks a clear use case. Most of its hype relies on the charm of its branding and its ability to generate social media buzz. Sure, it’s a fun investment, but is it sustainable? The good news is CAT isn’t resting on its laurels. The developers are actively exploring partnerships and community-driven initiatives. If you’re looking for a coin with personality and potential, Simon’s Cat might just be your pick. Still, if you’re after a more solid return, BTFD’s structured presale offers a clearer path to gains. Apu Apustaja (APU): From Meme to Market Let’s talk about Apu Apustaja, a meme coin inspired by the iconic internet character. This one’s for the die-hard meme lovers who thrive on nostalgia. APU launched with a bang, offering playful branding and a strong focus on community engagement. Its initial decentralised exchange (DEX) debut saw a gain, making waves in a crowded market. But APU isn’t just about its debut. The project aims to integrate Play2Earn gaming and NFT marketplaces into its ecosystem, giving it a potential edge over meme coins that rely solely on hype. That said, APU has its challenges. It’s competing with heavyweights like BTFD, which has already proven its worth through a meticulously planned presale. APU may have the memes, but BTFD’s blend of staking rewards and financial potential make it a standout choice for investors. How to Buy BTFD Coin Thinking of jumping on the BTFD bandwagon? Here’s how you can get in: Go to the presale page at BTFD.io . Connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet works best). Enter the amount of $BTFD you’d like to buy. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. It’s quick, easy, and could be one of the smartest moves you make this year. Conclusion: Why BTFD Coin Deserves Your Attention Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be a game-changer in the meme coin world. With its stellar presale performance, incredible staking rewards, and long-term growth potential, BTFD offers a unique opportunity to join a community that’s not just about memes but meaningful returns.

There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $2.385 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

If XRP fails to clear the $2.435 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.380 level. The next major support is near the $2.320 level.

Acting US Attorney Daniel Gitner claimed the government would establish a website to help inform victims of their rights, calling other notification methods “impracticable.” The US government prefers to use a website to communicate with victims of the Terra case The US government approximates the number of victims affected by the Terra ecosystem collapse to be over 1 million. Acting US Attorney Daniel Gitner submitted a motion to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on January 6 describing the procedures for notifying potential victims of Do Kwon’s public proceedings. The US attorney claimed the government would set up a website to inform victims of their rights, tagging other traditional methods “impracticable” due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency transactions, which often lack personal identifying information. Terra collapsed in May 2022, and Do Kwon is charged with nine fraud felonies In May 2022, Terra, once the third largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ether, crumbled, losing its $50 billion valuation in just 72 hours. When founder Do Kwon launched Terra, he claimed he wanted to build an ecosystem better than Bitcoin and Ethereum. He added that he needed a stablecoin to compete directly with fiat currencies. Sadly, his entire project lacked transparency. According to the US Department of Justice, Kwon misled investors by falsely claiming the company’s blockchain products and manipulated their markets to create the illusion of a functioning and decentralized financial system. Earlier this year, Kwon was extradited from Montenegro to the United States, where he now faces nine felony fraud charges. On January 2, he appeared before a US judge for the first time and pleaded not guilty. However, authorities have yet to clarify if they will pursue a plea agreement with the Terraform co-founder or whether they will proceed to a full criminal trial. Due to his fraud involvement, Kwon already had to pay a $4.5 billion settlement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in April 2024.

Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just exploring crypto, these three projects are hard to ignore. Web3Bay is transforming online shopping with its decentralized marketplace, removing high fees and middlemen. Its presale success has drawn significant attention. On the other side, XRP is showing strong potential after a stellar 2024. With regulatory wins and high price forecasts, the community is eager for 2025. Meanwhile, Cardano is bouncing back, with analysts suggesting it’s primed for a new rally after recent price corrections. Discover why these are the best crypto projects to watch. Web3Bay: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce with its transparent and decentralized marketplace. By cutting out middlemen it empowers both buyers and sellers to transact directly, reducing fees and ensuring users retain full control over their funds and data. Its unique payment system supports both cryptocurrencies and traditional methods like PayPal, making it accessible for crypto enthusiasts and regular shoppers. For merchants, especially in regions with limited banking access, Web3Bay offers a gateway to global markets without needing traditional financial institutions. Currently in presale stage 3 at $0.0039675, Web3Bay has raised over $420,000, selling more than 110 million 3BAY coins. With 28 stages and a 15% price hike per stage, it promises a potential ROI exceeding 6000%. This platform, with its secure smart contracts and low fees, is shaping the future of online shopping. XRP Price Trends Surge Predictions XRP ended 2024 on a high, surpassing $2 for the first time, achieving a 370% annual growth. Analysts predict 2025 could see it climb to $6.4, $13, or even $27, driven by favorable market momentum and regulatory clarity. The XRP community is optimistic, especially after the New York Department of Financial Services approved Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD. This approval solidifies Ripple’s involvement in central bank digital currencies and enhances its payment solutions, setting XRP up for wider adoption. However, some experts remain cautious. Pro-crypto lawyer John Deaton, for instance, has stated he’s uncertain about XRP’s future price, saying, “I have no idea.” Regardless, the potential for growth remains strong. Cardano (ADA) Analysis: Signs of a 2025 Rebound Cardano (ADA) has seen sharp price swings, including a 40% drop following a 300% rally from November lows. Market analysts like Michaël van de Poppe suggest the correction phase may be nearing its end, paving the way for a fresh upward move. This recent pullback is viewed as a natural adjustment, signaling possible long-term bullish momentum. ADA’s breakout into a new trading range between $0.96 and $1.25 indicates upward potential, with price targets between $2.50 and $3.00, provided favorable conditions persist. While some are optimistic about ADA’s recovery in 2025, others urge caution. It’s a delicate balance of considering both promising projections and potential risks.

However, the sector’s quick rise in popularity has received backlash from several community members and industry figures, who consider the tokens “worse” than the memecoin trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounces Back Above $100K – Is the Bull Run Resuming or a Correction Ahead? Crypto Traders Make Millions From AI-Related Tokens On January 6, on-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain shared that a smart Solana trader obtained massive returns from AI agent and memecoin ai16z (AI16Z). The investor turned $2 million into $21 million in less than two months amid the AI-related tokens rally. The AI-managed crypto fund is on the Solana blockchain and governed by the ai16zDAO. Its name is a wordplay originating from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, seemingly created to bring attention to the project. According to the post, the whale purchased 10.6 million ai16z, worth $2.27 million, between November 15 and November 22, 2024, at an average cost of $0.214. Since then, the cryptocurrency has seen a 965% surge to trade around $2.28. At the time of the report, the investor’s holdings were valued at around $21 million, making $19 million in unrealized profits. Earlier today, the whale sent 5.3 million ai16z, worth $10.68 million, into Jupiter to sell via limit order. Meanwhile, another trader turned $123,000 into $4.5 million after betting on ai16z when the token’s market capitalization was $22 million. The whale purchased 6.17 million ai16z and sold 4.67 million for around $1.78 million last month. The investor currently holds 2.65 million ai16z tokens, valued at $2.9 million, bringing the total profits to more than $4.5 million in two months. This whale also made another $13.4 million from other AI crypto tokens like GOAT, FARTCOIN, and ARC. Community Calls AI Agent Tokens ‘Overrated’ In late 2024, AI Agent tokens gained massive popularity among crypto investors, with several experts predicting that AI-related tokens, alongside memecoins, would be the largest narrative of this year. Meanwhile, AI memecoins stole the spotlight as the year ended, sending some of the tokens in the sector to the top 10 memecoins ranks in late December. Ai16z, the largest AI memecoin by market capitalization, has seen a 251% increase in the past month, hitting an all-time high (ATH) of $2.47 on January 2. The token is also the third-largest AI agent crypto and has seen a 25% surge in the last 24 hours, trading between $2.25 and $2.28 throughout Monday morning. Nonetheless, the sector has received heavy criticism recently from the crypto community. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT recently called AI agent tokens a scam. Responding to Justin Taylor, another industry member, the crypto detective stated that “99% of it is a scam” and suggested that “the AI agent wrapper grifts are probably worse than other past trends.” Related Reading: Litecoin Comeback: LTC Breaks Free And Guns For $400 Zach argued that memecoins “at least” promised nothing, “AI coins try to larp as much as possible to appear legit to unsuspecting buyers.” Similarly, Solana founders consider AI agent tokens to be overhyped. According to an anonymous poll of 42 Solana founders, several of the polled considered AI Agents, alongside Blinks, to be the “most overrated Solana sector.” Despite the criticism, the sector still registers a 5% increase in the last 24 hours, with a daily trading volume of $2.28 billion and a market capitalization of $17.5 billion, according to CoinGecko data.

Nvidia announced on Monday at CES in Las Vegas that these new GPUs are built on the same Blackwell architecture used in the chipmakers’ AI accelerators. The tech giant began as a maker of video game graphics cards, but its focus is now on data center chips. However, the AI chipmaker’s gaming GPUs are still popular, accounting for nearly $10 billion per year. Estimates of 2025 sales (Source: Bloomberg) Nvidia’s GPUs will use AI to predict the upcoming frames In the future, Blackwell’s AI elements will be utilized in the upcoming GeForce 50 series to ensure ultra-real gaming visuals. These new GPUs will calculate the shading of each pixel like old-fashioned graphics cards, but instead of remaking each frame, they’ll use AI to predict what’s coming next. “GeForce allowed AI to reach the masses, and now AI is coming home to GeForce,” said Huang in the presentation. Nvidia also pointed out improvements for laptops that promise longer battery life. PC gamers can now enjoy responsiveness and realism without compromise. The top-tier RTX 5090, which costs $1,999, will be out of the market this month, while the $549 RTX 5070, which outclasses the RTX 4090, will be available in February. Nvidia’s primary revenue stream, gaming, has been exceeded by its booming data center business, which is forecast to reach $100 billion this year.

The project, which features a clever blend of memetics and real utility, shows a strong market appeal. Analysts anticipate this will translate to price appreciation once it is listed on exchanges. Wall Street Pepe has the added advantage of listing on the open market as pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump takes his seat at the White House and crypto boogeyman Gary Gensler steps down from the SEC. With that, January and the remainder of 2025 are expected to yield big gains for the cryptocurrency market. The $WEPE presale is ongoing and currently available at a fixed price of $0.00036642. However, the price will rise throughout the presale, with the next increase in under one day. Wall Street Pepe is for crypto degens who “choose rich” Wall Street Pepe is grabbing the market’s attention in a unique way: it blends the hype of Pep the Frog and Jordan Belfort – and it adds utility. It’s a striking idea, merging Pepe the Frog’s easy-going persona with Jordan Belfort’s all-or-nothing business philosophy. This paradoxical interaction grasps the essence of Wall Street Pepe, which is to equip non-serious traders with serious trading tools and help them become profitable in the crypto market. Meme coin investors tend to be among newer market participants, often ill-equipped to navigate the volatile twists and turns of the crypto market. But with Wall Street Pepe, these crypto newbies will become smart money traders overnight. So what exactly does the Wall Street Pepe ecosystem entail? A utility-focused ecosystem geared around profits There are five key pillars inside the Wall Street Pepe ecosystem, each contributing to its community’s profitability. The first is its bread and butter: trading signals . Find out what to buy, when to buy it, and when to sell it based on Wall Street Pepe’s advanced data insights. Then there is meme coin picks , a tool that will give users the heads up on meme coins with the highest potential. It’s estimated that around 15,000 meme coins launch every day, and most fail. Meme coin picks will filter out the nonsense, saving users time and maximizing upside. Another feature is its trading insider group . If you want to be smart money, you can’t do it alone. The insider group allows the community to brainstorm, plan, and execute in unison. They’ll be beating whales at their own game. Beyond trading insights, holding $WEPE will also grant users access to staking , allowing them to compound their returns. Staking is live amidst the presale and currently provides a 30% APY. Lastly, there is trading rewards . Users will receive free $WEPE tokens for submitting good trade ideas to the Wall Street Pepe team. Wall Street Pepe doesn’t just help users trade more profitably; it makes them the project’s core focus, providing perks every step of the way. All of this is drawing significant attention, with netizens from everyday meme coin degens to top analysts taking notice. For instance, ClayBro recently speculated $WEPE could provide 10x gains in a video on his 134K subscriber YouTube channel. Secure the lowest $WEPE price today before the price increase As mentioned, the Wall Street Pepe price will increase as the ICO advances. Now is the time to act for investors seeking the most value for money. You can contribute to the presale by visiting the project’s website, connecting your wallet, and choosing the amount of $WEPE you want to buy and the crypto you want to pay with. The presale accepts payments using crypto and traditional payment methods. Alternatively, you can download the Best Wallet application and purchase $WEPE via its “Upcoming Tokens” feature. And prospective buyers can rest assured that the project is safe and secure. Smart contract security expert Coinsult audited Wall Street Pepe’s code and found no issues.

The price is trading above $1.00 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $1.075 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.1150 resistance zone. Cardano Price Starts Fresh Surge After forming a base above the $0.80 level, Cardano started a fresh increase, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA surged above the $0.90 and $1.00 levels. The bulls even pushed the price above $1.120. A high was formed at $1.1156 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below $1.1120, but the price remained above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.8373 swing low to the $1.1156 high. Cardano price is now trading above $1.00 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a short-term rising channel forming with support at $1.075 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.10 zone. The first resistance is near $1.1120. The next key resistance might be $1.1150. If there is a close above the $1.1150 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.20 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.250 in the near term. Downside Correction in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $1.1120 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $1.080 level. The next major support is near the $1.050 level. A downside break below the $1.050 level could open the doors for a test of $0.975 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.8373 swing low to the $1.1156 high.

While the other tokens failed to keep up the momentum, Dogecoin is trying hard to maintain a decent ascending trend. The price has been trying hard to rise above $0.4 since the beginning of 2025. While the recent whale movements suggest a big move is incoming, the technicals endorse a wider correction is on the horizon. What’s next for the Dogecoin (DOGE) price rally? Will it trigger a healthy run to $1 in 2025? Retail traders usually follow the whales, believing it is a major signal for the next price action. With the rise in their accumulation rate, the optimism around the token surges further, positively impacting the DOGE price . The whales accumulated DOGE constantly throughout 2024 and halted in November; meanwhile, they have resumed and surpassed the levels of the 2021 bull run. Currently, more than 5000 wallets hold above 1 million DOGE, which are flashing major bullish signals. On the other hand, retail traders refrain from jumping in as the active address count remains within the average range. Mainly because the technicals do not support the bullish narrative. The TD sequential indicator, which points out the exact time of the trend reversal, remains bearish, anticipating a price correction. Secondly, the weighted social sentiment is at around 0.60, meaning that the crowd remains pessimistic about Dogecoin’s upside potential. What’s next for the DOGE price rally? The DOGE price chart suggests the bulls are trying hard to keep up the bullish trend as the rally has been struggling hard to defend the 50-day MA. These levels are offering a strong base while the price is failing to trigger a strong rebound to the higher ranges. This could be due to the drop in volume that has hindered the progress of the rally. Meanwhile, incremental RSI seems to have halted the trend, substantiating a bearish claim. Regardless of all the bearish claims, the Dogecoin price may still squash the narrative if a rise above 0.786 FIB at $0.4 is validated in the next few hours.

Starting in the second half of 2025, the self-governing province plans to roll out NFT-based digital visitor cards, offering discounts, travel subsidies, and special membership perks at popular attractions. NFT Visitor Cards Reports from local outlets indicate that the initiative targets Millennials and Generation Z travelers in a bid to boost the island’s tourism industry by providing a tech-driven experience. The NFT cards will leverage blockchain technology to store visitor data, such as travel history, photos, and videos, on a secure and tamper-proof platform. While details about the blockchain platform and card pricing are not yet available, a trial phase will precede the full rollout to test the program’s viability. This initiative builds on Jeju Island’s history of exploring blockchain technology. For instance, back in 2019, the island launched a government-backed research project to position itself as a global blockchain hub. Subsequent projects included a COVID-19 contact tracing app in 2021 and an energy usage tracking platform in 2022, both powered by blockchain. South Korea’s Web 3 Focus The move also aligns with South Korea’s broader focus on Web 3 and digital innovation. South Korea first started exploring NFTs in 2021 to examine the integration of this sector into its tax system. The following year, NFTs were used to raise funds for presidential campaigns in Seoul. More recently, the country’s financial watchdog, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), issued guidelines on NFTs wherein it outlined cases in which these tokens should be considered crypto assets. In addition, South Korea has committed significant resources to the metaverse. It had previously announced plans to invest more than $187 million to foster job creation and technological growth. Last month, South Korea’s trading volume saw a massive spike amid political tension. As a result, the country experienced a dramatic surge in crypto adoption. By the end of 2024, the country’s crypto user base had exceeded 15.5 million.

Staticcoin has surpassed PayPal USD (PYUSD) and EURC in 24-hour trading volume, marking a notable achievement in the stablecoin market. According to data shared on X by the Paul Barron Network (@paulbarrontv), RLUSD recorded a daily trading volume of $34.7 million, eclipsing PYUSD’s $19.7 million and EURC’s $12.4 million. This surge in volume reflects the strong reception of RLUSD in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and banking sectors. BREAKING! Ripple USD stablecoin has flipped both PayPal and Euro stable in 24hr Volume only two weeks after its launch. #XRP @xpmarket @UpholdInc pic.twitter.com/DDOGs9dXpc — Paul Barron Network (@paulbarrontv) January 4, 2025 RLUSD’s Significance Ripple launched RLUSD as part of its broader strategy to expand into the DeFi space and strengthen its position in the banking ecosystem. According to Adam Cochran, Managing Partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, RLUSD acts as a Trojan Horse for Ripple, enabling it to bridge traditional finance with decentralized solutions. The stablecoin is fully backed and designed to operate seamlessly on the XRP Ledger, offering users fast and low-cost transactions. It is also available on the Ethereum network, allowing a broad range of users to enjoy its benefits, and introducing them to the XRP ecosystem. This achievement comes as Ripple continues to solidify its presence in the financial industry. RLUSD represents a critical component of Ripple’s expansion, serving as a gateway for financial institutions and retail users seeking efficient cross-border payment solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next for RLUSD? The rapid adoption of RLUSD has drawn attention from the crypto community and industry experts alike. Popular crypto influencer Ben “BitBoy” Armstrong recently emphasized the importance of RLUSD in Ripple’s ecosystem, describing stablecoins as the backbone of the crypto industry . The stablecoin market has become increasingly competitive. RLUSD’s ability to outperform established players like PYUSD in daily volume shows the strength of Ripple’s stablecoin. While PYUSD benefits from PayPal’s extensive user base, RLUSD’s integration with the XRP Ledger and its focus on cross-border payments provide unique value propositions. At press time, RLUSD had far surpassed PYUSD and EURC. It is now ranked 4th by trading volume with a 24-hour volume of $417.8 million. It sits behind FDUSD, USDC, and USDT. With RLUSD growing rapidly, many new investors are entering the XRP ecosystem, creating a big opportunity for XRP as both assets are complementary . Many in the community believe RLUSD is coming for USDT’s top position, and if it keeps showing at this rate, it might dominate the stablecoin market sooner than many expect.

Companies like MicroStrategy and CleanSpark also recently expanded their Bitcoin holdings, with CleanSpark even surpassing Tesla as the fifth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Meanwhile, JPMorgan recently pointed out Bitcoin's growing role as a hedge against inflation, and predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum reaching record highs are boosted by the optimism around regulatory advancements and corporate treasury strategies. Market Tops in Sight and Experts Weigh In The cryptocurrency market seems to be entering the latter stages of its current bull cycle, according to CryptoQuant . In a recent post by Crypto Dan, it was suggested that the bull market, which started in January of 2023, could reach its cyclical peak as early as the first quarter of 2025, or by the second quarter at the latest. The post also pointed to a big influx of new investments and additional contributions from existing investors as evidence of the cycle nearing its climax. Crypto Dan post (Source: CryptoQuant ) In the final quarter of 2024, Bitcoin saw 36% of its supply traded for less than a month, which is a pattern that is often associated with market tops in previous cycles. CryptoQuant noted that this ratio might increase two to four times before a corrective bear cycle begins. While there is still potential for gains in Bitcoin and altcoins, the firm urged investors to approach the market with caution and prioritize risk management. This cautious outlook is very different from the predictions of other analysts who expect the bull market to extend through the end of 2025. Steno Research projects 2025 to be a record-breaking year for the crypto market, with Bitcoin and Ethereum expected to surpass all-time highs alongside other major advancements. Similarly, VanEck forecasts a medium-term peak for the market in early 2025, which could be followed by a surge to unprecedented highs later in the year. VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, envisions Bitcoin reaching $180,000 and Ethereum surpassing $6,000 by the cycle’s apex. VanEck’s top 10 crypto predictions for 2025 (Source: VanEck ) Market sentiment on platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi also reflects optimism, with traders betting on record highs for Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2025 as well. These projections align with expectations of regulatory progress, including the approval of new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. JPMorgan Sees Lasting Shift to Bitcoin and Gold The ”debasement trade” into gold and Bitcoin is becoming a lasting trend as investors navigate the persistent geopolitical uncertainty and inflation concerns, according to a recent research note by JPMorgan. Due to the record capital inflows into crypto markets in 2024, the bank stated that gold and Bitcoin are increasingly seen as essential components of investors' portfolios. This demand stems from various factors, including heightened geopolitical risks since 2022, ongoing concerns about long-term inflation, and fears of debt debasement due to persistently high government deficits in major economies. Institutional investors and well known people like Paul Tudor Jones are actively betting on Bitcoin and commodities, and see them as effective hedges against inflationary pressures in the United States. Similarly, US state governments are incorporating Bitcoin into their fiscal strategies to mitigate fiscal uncertainties, according to asset manager VanEck . JPMorgan also pointed to the sharp increase in open interest on Bitcoin futures as an indicator that institutional funds are equating Bitcoin with gold as a strategic asset. Open interest on BTC futures surged from $18 billion in January to over $55 billion by December of 2024, according to CoinGlass data . (Source: CoinGlass ) Retail interest in Bitcoin has also shown some renewed strength, with Bitcoin ETFs experiencing inflows starting in September 2024 after a temporary outflow in August. By November, the total net assets of US Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $100 billion for the first time, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Crypto ETFs are considered a critical metric for gauging new market participants, as they are more likely to represent fresh inflows than other trading activities, according to Citi. The growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, fueled by these surging inflows, could lead to big demand shocks that may drive prices higher. Sygnum Bank suggested that this trend might propel Bitcoin’s price to new heights in 2025. MicroStrategy Acquires More BTC in 2025 MicroStrategy also sees great potential in Bitcoin, and announced its latest acquisition of 1,070 BTC that was made during the final two days of 2025. According to a Jan. 6 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company spent approximately $101 million in cash between Dec. 30 and Dec. 31 to buy Bitcoin at an average price of $94,004 per coin. This purchase brings MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings to 447,470 BTC, which is valued at around $27.97 billion, with an average acquisition price of $62,503 per Bitcoin. The company now holds 2.1% of all Bitcoin that will ever be mined. The acquisition was funded by using proceeds from the issuance and sale of shares under a convertible notes sales agreement, consistent with MicroStrategy’s purchasing strategy. The buy happened after a hint from MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, who posted a Bitcoin chart from the SaylorTracker website on Jan. 5. Despite this addition, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying activity has shown some signs of slowing. In December of 2024, the company purchased a total of 45,370 BTC, representing only 30% of its acquisitions during the previous month-long period from Oct. 31 to Dec. 1. Some of MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin purchases (Source: Lookonchain ) This reduced activity was likely due to market caution, with people like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes warning people about potential market volatility ahead of the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump. Reports also suggest that MicroStrategy could enter a blackout period in January 2025 that could potentially halt any further Bitcoin purchases through share and convertible bond issuances. The latest purchase also follows MicroStrategy’s announcement of plans to raise $2 billion through a perpetual preferred stock offering to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions. However, the decision to proceed with the offering is still at the company’s discretion and depends on market conditions. CleanSpark Surpasses Tesla in Bitcoin Holdings CleanSpark, a United States crypto mining company, expanded its own Bitcoin holdings a lot in December of 2024. The company pointed to efficiency gains and rapid hashrate growth as drivers of its success. According to a Jan. 6 report, CleanSpark mined 668 BTC in December, contributing to a total of 7,024 BTC mined for the year. The company’s hashrate increased by 287.9% year-over-year, reaching 39.1 exahashes per second by year-end. Efficiency also improved by 33.3% compared to 2023. In December, CleanSpark sold 12.65 BTC at an average price of $101,246, generating $1.28 million in proceeds. This sale represented just 58% of its daily production for the month. The company’s mining capacity received a nice boost in 2024 with the acquisition of seven facilities in Knoxville , Tennessee, which increased its hashrate by 22%. CleanSpark’s stock, which is trading under the symbol CLSK, also rallied on Jan. 6. By the end of 2024, CleanSpark accumulated 9,952 BTC, valued at approximately $1.01 billion, making it the fifth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder and surpassing Tesla. Only MicroStrategy and three other mining companies hold more Bitcoin. Publicly traded companies now collectively hold 593,152 BTC, accounting for around 20% of institutional Bitcoin treasuries, though this figure includes government-held confiscated Bitcoin. Top corporate bitcoin holders (Source: Bitcoin Treasuries ) The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is still picking up steam. In December, space technology company KULR converted $21 million in cash into Bitcoin, while Canadian firms Matador Technologies and Quantum BioPharma made similar moves as part of their treasury strategies. Bitwise CRO Hunter Horsley predicts that 2025 will start the rise of ”Bitcoin Standard” corporations as more companies embrace Bitcoin as a strategic asset.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-07 05:21:46

Simultaneously, prosecutors overseeing Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon’s criminal case have estimated that over one million individuals worldwide may have been affected by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Do Kwon's Criminal Case: Over a Million Victims Estimated After Terra Ecosystem Collapse In a landmark criminal case that sheds light on the far-reaching impact of the Terra ecosystem's collapse, US prosecutors estimate that more than one million victims worldwide may have been affected by the fallout. The case against Terraform Labs' co-founder, Do Kwon, has drawn global attention and has demonstrated the devastating consequences of the crypto platform's failure. On Jan. 6, Acting US Attorney Daniel Gitner filed a notice in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York detailing the procedures to inform Kwon's victims of their rights. The scale and nature of the case have made traditional victim notification methods infeasible, prompting prosecutors to propose a dedicated website to keep victims informed of public proceedings. Gitner emphasized the enormity of the task, citing the vast number of transactions involving Terraform's cryptocurrencies, many of which were conducted through foreign exchanges or anonymous digital wallets. ”The Government estimates that the number of victims in this case exceeds hundreds of thousands of individuals and entities, and potentially totals more than one million,” he said. This approach aligns with efforts to ensure transparency and accessibility in a case of unprecedented magnitude within the cryptocurrency sector. Kwon’s appearance before a US judge on Jan. 2 marked the beginning of a new chapter in his legal battles. Extradited from Montenegro after a prolonged detention, Kwon pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges, including fraud at Terraform Labs. He has agreed to remain in detention while proceedings unfold. The charges against Kwon stem from the catastrophic collapse of the Terra ecosystem in 2022, which sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market. The implosion of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and its companion token, LUNA, wiped out billions of dollars in value and contributed to a broader market downturn that saw numerous firms declare bankruptcy. Kwon’s legal troubles are not confined to the United States. In 2023, Montenegrin authorities arrested him on unrelated charges, further complicating his legal status. Both the US and South Korea sought his extradition, but it was only in December 2024 that Montenegrin authorities handed him over to US custody. Kwon’s case joins a growing list of high-profile criminal proceedings against cryptocurrency executives in the Southern District of New York, a jurisdiction that has become a focal point for crypto-related crimes. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky are among those facing similar scrutiny, while former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently pleaded guilty to a felony charge in a separate jurisdiction. The scale of Kwon’s alleged fraud sets his case apart. In April 2024, a US judge ruled that Kwon and Terraform Labs were liable for fraud in a civil case brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of the settlement, Kwon and the company agreed to pay approximately $4.5 billion in disgorgement, civil penalties, and prejudgment interest. This ruling is likely to play a pivotal role in the criminal trial. Challenges in Quantifying Victim Impact One of the complexities in Kwon’s criminal case lies in identifying and quantifying the victims. Unlike traditional financial crimes, where transactions are often traceable to individuals, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency complicates these efforts. Many victims may have conducted transactions anonymously or through foreign exchanges, leaving little personal identifying information. The collapse of Terra’s ecosystem has left a lasting imprint on the cryptocurrency market. Beyond the financial losses suffered by individual investors, the incident undermined trust in algorithmic stablecoins and prompted regulators worldwide to reevaluate their approach to cryptocurrency oversight. Kwon’s arrest and subsequent extradition mark a turning point in the global response to crypto fraud. The case brings attention to the need for robust international cooperation in addressing crimes that transcend borders and affect millions of people. As Kwon faces his criminal trial, questions remain about whether US authorities will offer a plea deal or proceed with a full trial. The outcome will likely set a precedent for how legal systems address large-scale fraud in the cryptocurrency industry. For the millions of victims, the case represents a chance to seek justice and recover some of their losses. However, the road ahead is fraught with legal and logistical challenges, as prosecutors navigate the complexities of holding a key figure accountable in one of the most significant cryptocurrency collapses to date. CFTC and Gemini Reach Proposed Settlement: $5M Penalty and Admission of Misconduct In other crypto legal news, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has reached a proposed settlement with Gemini Trust Company, potentially bringing an end to a contentious civil case. The agreement, if approved by a federal judge, would require Gemini to pay a $5-million civil monetary penalty and admit to certain regulatory failings, potentially sparing the company from a prolonged trial. According to a filing submitted on Jan. 6 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, the proposed consent order would resolve all outstanding claims against Gemini. The case, initiated by the CFTC in June 2022, alleged that Gemini provided false or misleading statements in connection with its 2017 application to offer Bitcoin futures contracts. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, Gemini would acknowledge that it ”reasonably should have known” its statements to the CFTC were misleading. Specifically, the filing highlighted that Gemini had entered into bespoke fee arrangements with certain market participants—arrangements that were not disclosed on its website and were more favorable than the publicly advertised terms. These undisclosed agreements, according to the CFTC, were designed to promote trading in Gemini's auction platform. If approved, the settlement would also enjoin Gemini from making false or misleading statements to the CFTC in the future. The case stems from Gemini’s 2017 bid to list Bitcoin futures contracts, a move that required the firm to provide accurate and transparent information to the CFTC. The regulator alleged that Gemini’s failure to disclose key fee arrangements undermined the integrity of its application process. Gemini has consistently denied intentional wrongdoing but has faced mounting pressure as the trial date approached. Initially scheduled for Jan. 21, the trial’s delay came after a federal judge warned that no further adjournments would be granted. Despite the proposed settlement, Gemini has not issued a public statement regarding the agreement or its implications. This comes after the CFTC disclosed that it had recovered more than $17 billion in civil monetary penalties, disgorgement, and restitution from enforcement actions, including those against crypto firms In its 2024 fiscal year report. Gemini’s case also brings renewed attention to the challenges crypto firms encounter when navigating the regulatory landscape. The acknowledgment of misconduct in the proposed settlement could serve as a cautionary tale for other companies seeking to operate within the bounds of US law. Leadership Changes at the CFTC The timing of the proposed settlement coincides with significant political developments in the US. President-elect Donald Trump, set to be inaugurated on Jan. 20, has reportedly considered replacing current CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam.

BlockDAG’s incredible ascent and PEPE’s control of the meme market caused portfolios to expand as these top assets surpassed expectations. Looking ahead to 2025, these cryptocurrencies are ready to leverage their past successes, promising substantial returns for traders. BlockDAG, PEPE, SUI, Dogecoin, and XRP have risen as the best crypto coins for 2025, each presenting distinct advantages to meet varied buyer interests. Whether traders are drawn to the excitement of meme coins, the practicality of utility-driven adoption, or robust financial alternatives, these digital currencies are poised to shape portfolio triumphs in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: A Leading Crypto in 2025 BlockDAG (BDAG) tops our list of the best crypto coins for 2025 for several compelling reasons. It broke records in its 2024 presale, generating over $176 million and distributing over 17.7 billion coins. Early supporters have enjoyed a remarkable 2,380% return, underscoring its strong potential for enduring success. Currently priced at $0.0248 per coin in its latest presale phase, experts predict BlockDAG could reach $20 by 2027, supported by its swift adoption and continuous progress. BlockDAG’s advances in scalability and developer-friendly innovations have established it as a blockchain pioneer. Key achievements, like its new WebAssembly compatibility and the scheduled 2025 mainnet launch, underscore the high confidence in its future. For traders searching for the best crypto coins for 2025, BlockDAG provides an excellent mix of solid historical performance and bold growth prospects. 2. PEPE: Meme Coin Phenomenon with 1,492% Growth PEPE made waves in 2024 with an impressive 1,492% increase, claiming its spot as a premier meme coin. Inspired by the viral “Pepe the Frog,” this coin merged pop culture impact with substantial market presence. By year-end, PEPE’s market capitalization had surged, emphasizing its popularity. While its core strength is its community-based strategy, its dependence on meme culture could challenge its continued expansion. However, PEPE’s achievements in 2024 have laid the groundwork for what could be another strong year in 2025, making it a compelling option for traders who believe in the ongoing allure of meme coins. 3. SUI: Emerging Altcoin with a Robust DeFi Ecosystem In 2024, SUI showcased its value with a 1,193% boost in market value. Its streamlined architecture has drawn both developers and users, fostering a vibrant DeFi ecosystem. By December, SUI’s market cap neared $12 billion, marking it as a leading altcoin. While focusing on scalability and user-friendly features, SUI has encouraged widespread adoption. However, it could face hurdles from more established networks. Despite this, SUI’s solid performance and foundational strength place it among the best crypto coins for 2025 for those interested in DeFi trends. 4. Dogecoin: Iconic Meme Coin with High-Profile Support Dogecoin continues to be a standout choice among the best crypto coins for 2025, particularly within the meme coin niche, maintaining resilience in 2024. Its market value jumped by 342%, reaching $45.9 billion, partly driven by support from Elon Musk and potential uses on his platform, X (previously Twitter). Recognized for its vibrant community and cultural significance, Dogecoin attracts attention. However, its dependency on Musk’s backing and limited utility beyond the meme industry could challenge its ongoing growth. 5. XRP: Stable and Strong with a 286% Market Uplift XRP experienced a significant year in 2024, with its market value increasing by 286% to $131.2 billion. This rise was bolstered by a favorable legal decision against the SEC, where it was determined that automated XRP sales to individual users are not securities. Though XRP’s centralized nature and regulatory scrutiny continue to pose risks, its consistent performance and role in global payments establish it as one of the best crypto coins for 2025. Unveiling the Best Crypto Coins for 2025 As traders aim to optimize returns in 2025, this selection of the best crypto coins for 2025 offers varied options to match different strategic needs. PEPE and Dogecoin are highlighted in the meme coin category, while SUI and XRP excel in utility and adoption. BlockDAG stands out as the unexpected leader, with an impressive 2,380% return for early participants, anticipating further substantial growth. Whether your focus is on community, innovation, or utility, these digital currencies promise impressive prospects for 2025, grounded in their achievements this past year.

Such a golden cross usually indicates an incoming breakout, as Pepe’s price has yet to bounce strongly from its last-month price movement. The rise in Pepe coin RSI also signals a bullish short-term phase for the token, signaling rising demand. This move comes as Pepe is looking to outshine its old rival, Shiba Inu, within the crypto market. Moreover, the Remittix (RTX) presale has seen massive gains in Q1 of 2025, with another rally pushing the RTX price to $0.0185. Remittix has also hit another milestone in its presale funding with over $1.7M raised and 111 million tokens sold showcasing its popularity amongst smart investors. Pepe Price Prediction: Is $5 Possible In 2025? The price of Pepe has been showing impressive uptrend momentum, with a weekly gain of over 9%, hovering above the $0.000020 region . This upward momentum suggests a promising trajectory, with feature performance heavily relying on the project’s continued evolution and market dynamics as it looks to outshine Shiba Inu in the first half of 2025. If investor sentiment persists, Pepe might potentially hit the $5 region. Moreover, if the price of Pepe manages to surpass its current ATH of $0.00002825, it could establish a new ATH, solidifying its position on the market. Innovations and upgrades within the Pepe ecosystem will also play a vital role in boosting the PEPE token utility and adoption. Technical indicators support the ongoing bullish outlook, with the RSI at 52 pointing to building buying momentum. However, while its bullish potential is compelling, market volatility remains a significant factor. If unfavorable sentiment dominates, Pepe’s price movement could record a dip to the $0.00000704 region in 2025. Why Remittix Has Been Gaining Massive Attention Remittix (RTX) is a new project seeking to revolutionize cross-border payments with its unique PayFi protocol. Sending money globally has become quite expensive and difficult for many people. Remittix aims to fix this by allowing people to send money across any bank account using their crypto wallets. This will make international transfers cheap, fast, and reliable with no extra currency exchange fees, allowing Remittix to capitalize on the ever-growing $180 trillion global money transfer market. Moreover, security is a major concern for many crypto platforms, and Remittix will solve this by allowing users to retain complete control of their assets. The project has also been audited by BlockSAFU and SolidProof, which showcases its seriousness regarding security. This gives investors and users confidence, especially in an industry that is often affected by weaknesses and hacks. Remittix isn’t just for individual crypto traders. The RTX token is built for businesses looking to capitalize on cross-border payments. Companies can send multiple transactions to employees using Remittix, making it an attractive option for big investors. The RTX token’s long-term growth potential also makes it stand out. With a fixed supply and a deflationary system, the RTX price is set to increase over time. Its ongoing presale has already seen Remittix price surge to $0.0185, having raised over $1.7M in presale funding. Moreover, this price will also surge to $0.0193 in the coming days, offering investors a better chance to join now. Remittix and Pepe Record Impressive Gains Like most cryptos in the market, Pepe’s price continues to enjoy a weekly bullish outlook. If this momentum is sustained, it could lead to more gains in Pepe’s price movement as the token seeks to mirror and outshine Shiba Inu. Similarly, Remittix has also recorded a major milestone as it eyes another surge to $0.0193, with a presale funding of over $1.7M making now the best time to acquire RTX before its price increases again.

He predicts that the market will peak in mid to late March, which equates to a removal of $180 billion worth of liquidity due to quantitative tightening from January to March. “Sasa” is an essay where I explain y I think #crypto tops out in mid-Mar and then severely corrects. Until then is time to dance. https://t.co/Apt124sOjp pic.twitter.com/LKQ24GMtpq — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) January 6, 2025 The businessman believes that the Fed is exhausting all its tools to bolster demand for US Treasury debt issuance before resorting to stopping quantitative tightening. He argued that the Fed grants a leverage ratio exemption for U.S. commercial banks to resume quantitative easing. Arthur Hayes believes the markets will peak in mid-march Arthur Hayes revealed that Bitcoin bottomed in Q3 2022 after the Fed’s Reserve Repo Facility (RRP) peaked. He argued that it’s because the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, had issued fewer longer-dated coupon bonds and more shorter-dated zero-coupon bills, emptying over $2 trillion from the RRP. He claimed that it resulted in liquidity injection into the global financial market and caused crypto and U.S.-listed big tech stocks to rise as a result. Arthur Hayes also stated that the Fed cut the RRP rate by 0.30% at its December 18th, 2024 meeting, which was 0.50% more than the cut to the policy rate. He argued that it was to tether the RRP rate to the Fed Funds Rate (FFR) lower bound. Hayes disclosed that two pools of money will help keep bond yields in check. He argued that the Fed’s 10-year US Treasury yield cannot be allowed to go over 5% because it is a level where bond market volatility explodes (MOVE Index). He also argued that as long as there is liquidity in the RRP and Treasury general account (TGA), the Fed does not have to change its monetary policy and admit that fiscal policy is in play. The co-founder of BitMEX believes that the RRP will go from ~$237 billion to zero in the first quarter as money market funds (MMF) maximize their yield by withdrawing funds and purchasing higher-yielding Treasury bills (T-bill). He stated that it represents an injection of $237 billion of dollar liquidity in the first quarter. Arthur Hayes also argued that the Fed will remove $180 billion of liquidity due to QT and encourage an additional $237 billion due to the reduction in RRP balances. He believes it will total a net injection of $57 billion in liquidity. Arthur Hayes believes the Treasury will affect crypto market developments The CEO of BitMex also highlighted that Yellen said that she expects the Treasury to begin “ extraordinary measures ” to fund the USG between January 14th and 23rd. He claimed that the Treasury can either issue debt (dollar liquidity negative) or spend money from its checking account at the Fed (dollar liquidity positive). Arthur Hayes argued that the Treasury can only spend funds from its checking account ($722 billion balance) because the aggregate amount of debt cannot rise until the US Congress increases the debt ceiling. The American businessman believes that raising the debt ceiling becomes necessary. At the same time, failure to do so would result in a technical default of maturing Treasury debt or a complete government shutdown. He referred to 2024’s receipts and outlays published by the Treasury and determined that such a situation would occur between May and June of this year when the TGA balance would be completely exhausted. The crypto enthusiast maintained that it’s helpful to visualize the pace and intensity of TGA usage to fund the government and predict when drawdowns will have their maximum effect. He argued that the forward-looking nature of the markets will make the market look for a new source to score a hit of dollar liquidity. Hayes believes that at 76% depletion, March appears to be a time when the market will ask, “What’s next?”. He disclosed that the sum of the dollar liquidity amounts from the Fed and Treasury until the end of the first quarter is $612 billion. The chief investment officer of Maelstrom stated that a last-minute deal will be reached once default and shutdown become imminent and the debt ceiling is raised. At this point, he is confident that the Treasury will be free to borrow on a net basis again and must refill the TGA, resulting in negative dollar liquidity. Arthur Hayes also revealed that the other major date in the second quarter is April 15th, when tax payments are due. He referred to the TGA table and concluded that the government’s finances improved in April, which is dollar liquidity negative. He compared Bitcoin, which hit a local high of ~$73,000 in mid-March last year, then traded sideways and began its multi-month decline on April 11th, right before the 15th tax payment deadline. Arthur Hayes said that as the chief investment officer of Maelstrom, he will turn the risk dial to DEGEN mode and decide to bet on shitcoin in the rapidly developing decentralized science (DeSci) field, purchasing BIO, VITA, ATH, GROW, PSY, CRYO and NEURON.

However, this performance falls short in comparison to Pythagoras Investment Management’s Alpha Long Biased Strategy, which pushed the envelope even further. The fund, which combines a BTC base position with two uncorrelated strategies, achieved an impressive return of 204% in 2024, Pythagoras said in an email to CoinDesk. That equates to a 3x gain, significantly outpacing the 2x return a typical buy-and-hold bitcoin investor would have realized. The fund charges incentive fee only when it beats bitcoin's performance. The fund's base position in bitcoin provides direct exposure to long-term appreciation, and the two uncorrelated strategies – a momentum market timing strategy and a long-short market selection strategy – generate alpha. The momentum strategy employs machine learning and pattern recognition to adjust and optimize exposure dynamically, allowing it to capture short-term market fluctuations. Meanwhile, the long-short strategy utilizes a proprietary AI-based forecasting model to create a dollar-neutral portfolio, making long investments in tokens expected to yield superior returns while shorting those anticipated to underperform. The allocation to the three components is calibrated to maximize returns relative to bitcoin. Despite its performance, the Alpha Long Biased Strategy was Pythagoras' smallest fund, boasting assets under management (AUM) of $7 million. It suffered a 2% drawdown in December as the year-end saw BTC climb down from record highs above $108,000 to $93,000. Meanwhile, Pythagoras' Arbitrage strategy delivered a 3% return in December, ending the year with an 18% gain and $45 million in AUM. The Quant Long Short Fund generated a return of 30% in 2024, with $23 million in AUM and the Absolute Return Strategy generated a 41.7% return, gathering $158 million in client funds. Pythagoras said that the top asset gatherer of 2024 will be closed for new investors from Feb. 1. The combined AUM of the four funds grew to over $230 million from $80 million in 2023 as the bull market revved up investor confidence. Bullish outlook Pythagoras expects the bull market to continue this year, driven by positive regulatory developments in the U.S. and corporate sovereign demand for bitcoin. ""The incoming Trump administration, with its proposal on creating a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and appointing individuals favorable to our industry in key Executive Branch positions, is expected to be a major catalyst. With over 290 members of Congress who are pro-crypto, we anticipate that supportive legislation for the cryptocurrency industry will gain momentum,"" Mitchell Dong, CEO of Pythagoras, said in a note to CoinDesk. ""As the U.S. Congress explores the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, we expect some countries to attempt to front-run the U.S. in accumulating Bitcoin, should this initiative come to fruition,"" Dong added, mentioning the possibility of listed companies following MicroStrategy's lead in adopting BTC.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Trading,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 05:39:07

In anticipation of a network update, Binance has announced that it will temporarily suspend token deposits and withdrawals on the aelf ( ELF ) network on Jan. 15, 2025, at 17:00 (UTC+8). The purpose of this planned update is to enhance the overall user experience on the ELF blockchain. The upgrade is scheduled to occur at block height 252,256,057, and the process is expected to commence at approximately 18:00 UTC+8 on the same day. Block height refers to the position of a specific block within the blockchain, and the network upgrade will occur once the blockchain reaches this point. You might also like: Binance will support DASH network upgrade and hard fork Users will still be able to trade ELF tokens normally on the Binance platform during the network upgrade. However, deposit and withdrawal services will be temporarily unavailable while the upgrade is in progress. To avoid any potential interruptions, Binance strongly advises users to deposit their ELF tokens in advance. Once the upgrade is complete and the network is stable, deposits and withdrawals will resume automatically without further notice. ELF is a decentralized blockchain for cloud computing that aims to provide a scalable ecosystem. Its primary goal is to create a flexible blockchain capable of supporting various industries and applications. At the time of writing, ELF is priced at $0.5016 with a market valuation of $369.18 million. The token’s $28.57 million in trading volume demonstrates a 34.36% drop in the past 24 hours. Token upgrades refer to modifications made to a blockchain network’s core protocol or structure to improve its usability, security, or overall functionality. In this case, it is expected that the ELF network upgrade is expected to boost both performance and scalability, which are essential for the continued growth and success of the ecosystem. Throughout 2024, Binance has actively supported network upgrades for several prominent tokens. In April 2024, Binance supported the Ethereum ( ETH ) Shanghai upgrade, a critical step in ETH’s transition to a more scalable and sustainable network, which allowed staked ETH to be withdrawn. Binance also supported the Dash network upgrade and hard fork , which took place on January 7, 2025. This upgrade aimed to enhance the network’s security and performance. Additionally, Binance has announced its support for the Optimism network update, scheduled for January 10, 2025, which focuses on improving scalability and efficiency within the Optimism ecosystem.

But then he pulled a classic Trump move, accusing China of “ripping off” the United States. It’s the same tune he’s been singing since 2018 when he started what might go down as one of the most aggressive economic standoffs in modern history. But then Trump also called Xi “strong” and “powerful,” adding that he’s “revered in China.” Flattery, maybe. But this isn’t just about who gets along. It’s about the two biggest economies in the world. How it started: Tariffs, deals, and broken promises The US-China trade war has been years in the making, starting when Trump hit China with tariffs on $34 billion worth of goods the last time he was in office. He accused Beijing of intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices. China retaliated almost instantly, matching the US tariffs dollar for dollar. And just like that, a trade war was on. The two sides escalated quickly. By 2019, the US had tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. China targeted $110 billion in US goods. But it wasn’t all fire and fury. In January 2020, both countries hit pause—kind of. They signed the Phase One trade deal, which was supposed to ease tensions. And it sounded like a win on paper. China promised to buy $200 billion more in American goods, and the US agreed to lower tariffs on $120 billion worth of Chinese imports. But there was a catch. Tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods stayed. Spoiler alert—those numbers didn’t stick, and the underlying issues never got fixed. Fast forward to the Biden administration. If anyone thought Joe Biden would go soft on China, they were wrong. In fact, that guy doubled down. His administration kept the Trump-era tariffs and added new ones on strategic sectors like electric vehicles and medical supplies. By December 2021, tariffs on over $300 billion worth of Chinese goods were still alive and kicking. What’s happening now: Trump’s back, and so is the tension Then came 2024. A new round of tariffs hit $18 billion in Chinese imports. Clean energy and semiconductors, two areas critical to US interests, were the main targets. Now, it’s January 2025, and Trump is less than 2 weeks away from being back in the Oval Office. During his campaign, he promised tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods. He also made it clear that Chinese investments in the US would face increased scrutiny. Though just days into the new year, Beijing announced export restrictions on 28 US companies. Big names like Lockheed Martin and Boeing Defense are on that list. Economists have been warning us for months. If Trump’s proposed tariffs become reality, the US could see inflation rise even higher. Supply chains, still fragile from years of disruptions, might buckle under the pressure, putting the entire global economy is in danger.

The asset is up 10% in the past week, retaking the $102,000 level late Monday and reversing nearly all losses from early December. It fell from a peak of nearly $109,000 on Dec.17 to a local low of just below $92,000 on Dec.30, which momentarily sparked fears of a deeper downturn. The surge comes as U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) raked in $987 million on Monday, their highest since Nov.21, data from SoSoValue shows. Fidelity’s FBTC led inflows with $370 million pouring in, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $209 million and Ark Invest’s ARKB with $71 million. Nine of the twelve ETFs recorded inflows, with none showing outflows in a standout day for the cohort. Trump’s expected crypto policies and broader economic plans have brought back positive sentiment among traders — bumping up BTC prices in a usual precursor to an altcoin rally. “We believe that the demand for bitcoin is manifesting itself after a downbeat Fed outlook in late December put the brakes on a Santa Claus rally,” Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message Tuesday. “Now that traders have wrapped up their vacations and are back to work, they've resumed purchases of Bitcoin, crypto, and stocks in a bullish trend as we approach Donald Trump's inauguration,” Mei added. Some traders are targeting the $109,000 level in the short term before a bullish trend is confirmed, setting the stage for even higher prices. “So far, the technical picture looks like a classic correction completion with a resumption of the growth from the Fibonacci retracement level of 61.8% of the rally since the beginning of November,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, in an email. “This scenario will be confirmed if the historical highs of around $109,000 are confidently breached. At the same time, we expect Bitcoin's growth to accelerate after the $100,000 mark.” Fibonacci levels are a technical analysis tool to identify potential support and resistance points where price movements might pause or reverse. Some traders believe that tracking Fibonacci levels can offer predictive value in identifying key price levels — which may become a self-fulfilling prophecy that causes price reactions in the market. As such, market volatility is expected to stay low until the U.S. Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report on Friday, which some believe will kick-start the new trading year with “decision-makers fully back at work,” per Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA. Strong NFP data could strengthens the U.S. dollar, potentially leading to higher interest rates, which can negatively affect risk assets like stocks and bitcoin. “However, the highest volatility event for the month is priced to be FOMC at the end of the month as the economic stats are priced to show 'soft landing' signs soon,” Fan added. BTC trades just above $101,600 in Asian morning hours Tuesday, up 2% in the past 24 hours.

As these whales abandon their positions in established tokens, they are flocking to DTX’s record-breaking presale, which has already raised an impressive $11.3 million. As for the future of these alternate currencies and whether the integration of DTX may result in the creation of promising entrants in the cryptocurrency world, what would happen next is highly speculative. The Current Market Dynamics of Avalanche (AVAX) and Solana (SOL) Avalanche (AVAX), currently priced at $44 with a market cap of $18 billion, has been experiencing a period of consolidation. Many investors are careful due to recent fluctuations even though analysts believe its future holds promise. Similarly, in terms of market resilience, despite the recent volatility, Solana (SOL) is at $214, and its market capitalization is $103 billion. While both cryptocurrencies played a significant role in molding the DeFi ecosystem, they are encountering difficulties that have compelled some investors to look elsewhere. DTX Exchange is appealing because of the original trading techniques it employs. As the first crypto-native platform to offer stocks, forex, ETF trading, and over 100,000 currency pairs, DTX is positioned to attract diverse traders. With its presale currently in the seventh stage and a token price of $0.14, set to rise to $0.16 in the next stage, investors are eager to capitalize on this unique opportunity. DTX Exchange Is About to Transform the DeFi Landscape DTX Exchange is not just a different trading platform but assures to revolutionize how traders interface with the financial sector. With features such as up to 1000x leverage, users can magnify their trading power significantly, turning a mere $100 into access to $100,000 in liquidity. Such leverage becomes appropriate for achieving high returns in a turbulent market. Moreover, DTX holders enjoy governance rights and can participate in profit-sharing through the Rebate Program. This structure encourages people with more tokens created through the blockchain to take an interest in the system. In doing so, it fosters a community-based atmosphere that makes the service more satisfying, hence promoting loyalty among the users. The DTX Exchange has already garnered over 300,000 wallet addresses and demonstrated impressive transaction speeds of 100,000 TPS during its testnet phase. Such metrics indicate robust infrastructure capable of handling high volumes of trading activity without compromising performance. DTX Is the Future Prospect That Is Aiming for $5 As more investors pivot from Avalanche and Solana towards DTX Exchange , the potential for explosive growth becomes increasingly tangible. Analysts predict that the price of DTX could go up by 3,000% in 2025 – a fantastic number that catches the interest of all kinds of investors. The upcoming debut of tokenized ETFs on the DTX platform further boosts growth, those in restricted jurisdictions can easily access these investment vehicles through this feature. As regulatory landscapes evolve and more traditional financial products integrate with cryptocurrencies, platforms like DTX are poised to benefit immensely. Additionally, with major players like Grayscale and VanEck actively pursuing approval for Solana ETFs, there’s a growing sentiment that Solana (SOL) could experience significant price movements if such products gain traction. However, this potential upside does not overshadow the immediate excitement surrounding DTX. Conclusion Therefore, in the face of the market pressures and uncertainties affecting Avalanche (AVAX) and Solana (SOL), the movement of investors towards DTX Exchange can represent a broader direction of the whole cryptocurrency sector, which values creativity and flexibility rather than the accustomed stability. Another aspect that draws investors to DTX is the available high-leverage opportunities, governance rights given to token holders, and limitless types of traded assets. Given that its presale is almost ending, with price targets being projected at this striking price of $5 within the short run, prudent investors should consider including it in their baskets today. In 2025, everyone will be keen to know if DTX can live up to its expectations and redefine trading.

Bitcoin’s Trump-Fuelled Rally At Risk Ahead Of FOMC Meeting Since pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump secured victory in the November presidential election, Bitcoin has climbed an impressive 47%, rising from approximately $67,500 on November 4 to around $99,700 as of January 6. Related Reading: Metaplanet Bitcoin Reserves Grow With Fresh $61 Million Purchase While further gains are anticipated during the so-called “Trump rally” leading up to the January 20 inauguration, the momentum might stall ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later in January, says 10x Research’s Markus Thielen. Thielen predicts a “positive start” to January for BTC, followed by a slight dip before the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data release on January 15. A favorable CPI report could reignite optimism, potentially fueling another rally before Trump’s inauguration. However, Thielen cautions that bullish momentum may wane ahead of the FOMC meeting on January 29. Latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows that interest rates are likely to remain unchanged following the upcoming FOMC meeting. The tool currently predicts a 90.9% chance of interest rates remaining 425 and 450 basis points (BPS). Bitcoin’s decline of approximately 15% to $92,900 following the December 18 FOMC meeting underscores the Fed’s significant influence. This drop came after the Fed signaled only two rate cuts for 2025 instead of five, reinforcing Thielen’s view that the Fed’s decisions are the “primary risk” to BTC’s current bullish trajectory. Thielen stated: We anticipate lower inflation this year, though it may take some time for the Federal Reserve to recognize and respond to this shift formally. Thielen also cited institutional participation as a key factor influencing Bitcoin’s short-term price action, with metrics like stablecoin minting rates and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows serving as indicators of institutional interest. Institutional Interest In Bitcoin Continues To Rise Although US spot Bitcoin ETFs faced significant outflows at the end of December, fresh inflows have sparked optimism about rising institutional interest in the premier cryptocurrency. Data from SoSoValue notes that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $908 million in inflows on January 3. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Face ‘Demand Shocks’ In 2025 Due To Growing Institutional Interest: Report In addition, several major BTC mining firms such as MARA and Hut 8 are bolstering their BTC reserves. Technology firms such as Canada-based video-sharing platform Rumble also recently unveiled a $20 million BTC treasury strategy. A separate report by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex predicts Bitcoin could surge to $200,000 by mid-2025, despite minor price pullbacks. At press time, BTC trades at $101,555, up 3.7% in the last 24 hours.

Meanwhile, the rejection at $4.2 caused the rally to shed off over 50% of its gains, bringing the token back to its initial levels. However, the WLD price has begun to rise and is about to undergo a parabolic recovery, keeping the bullish hopes alive. The change in market dynamics appears to have kept the whales more vigilant over the price action. Data from Santiment indicates millions of WLD have been transferred to Binance and Okex, which has raised some eyebrows as it fuels a bearish trajectory. The tokens moving back into exchanges is not good for the healthy rally as it could promote a potential sell or swap action. Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the WLD price rally that is heading towards the pivotal resistance zone. The WLD price found a support base at $2 and, after accumulating gains around the range, triggered a notable rebound. Although the volume remains above the average range, favouring the bulls, the bearish possibility looms over the rally. The Gaussian channel that helps to identify the trend patterns has just flipped bearish, which raises concerns over the next price action. Besides, the RSI, which is undergoing a parabolic recovery, also shows a possibility of a breakdown. Therefore, the Worldcoin price is expected to face bearish pressure, which may marginally drag the levels below $2.5. Meanwhile, support at $2.417 seems to be extremely strong, which may help the price trigger a strong rebound shortly elevating the levels to the resistance zone between $2.9 and $3.05. Beyond this range, the WLD price may not face strong resistance, which may be equivalent to a discovery phase. Hence, the bulls are required to manifest acute strength at these levels and secure the levels above $4. Meanwhile, a rise above the 2024 highs at $4.16 may pave the way for the Worldcoin (WLD) price to achieve levels above $5, which is significant to reclaim a double-digit figure.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|WLD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-07 06:05:40

Giants like Mara Holdings, Riot Platforms, and CleanSpark are leading the charge, raising $3.7 billion since November. The timing is no coincidence. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $100,000 last month, giving miners a golden chance to convert hype into hard cash. With Donald Trump now officially back in the White House, promising that BTC will be “mined, minted, and made in the USA,” the stakes have never been higher. High costs amid slashed rewards Last year’s halving cut mining rewards from 900 coins a day to just 450. This is built into Bitcoin’s code to make the asset scarcer and, theoretically, more valuable. But for miners, it’s like being asked to do twice the work for half the pay. CoinShares, the investment company, dropped some hard truths in their recent data. The average cost to produce one Bitcoin for US-listed miners jumped 13% last quarter to $55,950. But that’s just the base cost. Throw in depreciation and stock-based compensation, and you’re looking at $106,000 per coin. Here’s the thing: Bitcoin is currently trading around $102,000. “If the price didn’t rise, then we would have started to see quite a few start to turn rigs off or go bust,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. So why aren’t they folding? Because they’ve got a secret weapon: the soaring hash price. This key metric for mining profitability has jumped 32% since Trump’s election win, giving miners just enough breathing room to keep their rigs humming. Trump’s Bitcoin boost Trump’s victory has electrified the crypto market, especially in the mining sector. His commitment to making BTC a fully American enterprise is giving miners a reason to double down on their investments. Mara Holdings CEO Fred Thiel said the company’s entire business model is now about “accumulating as much BTC as [we] can.” Right now, the company holds nearly 45,000 Bitcoin, worth over $4.4 billion. Riot Platforms and others are also following a new playbook, taking inspiration from MicroStrategy’s strategy of issuing long-term convertible bonds to buy BTC. These miners are flipping their treasuries into Bitcoin reserves, keeping every new coin they mine. But while Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance has miners cheering, it hasn’t solved their biggest problem: energy. Mining operations eat up massive amounts of power. The US Energy Information Agency estimates that BTC mining already uses 2.3% of the country’s electricity grid. And in Texas, the top state for mining, regulators are stepping in. Any data center using over 75 megawatts of power annually must now provide detailed energy usage reports. That’s no small feat in a state where energy demand from large users is expected to jump 60% by 2025. AI vs. Bitcoin miners: The new battleground Miners aren’t just competing with each other anymore. They’re up against artificial intelligence developers, and these tech giants are bringing bigger budgets and even more aggressive strategies. AI and Bitcoin mining both rely on high-powered GPUs, and right now, AI is winning the battle for resources. Analysts predict that much of Bitcoin’s computational power could move overseas in the coming years. It’s basic economics: is the grid’s best use as a BTC mining facility or as an AI data center? Realistically speaking, AI is looking like the smarter bet. Faced with this uphill battle, some miners are going global. Mara is planning to move half its operations offshore by 2028, targeting countries with surplus energy like Kenya, the UAE, and Paraguay. These regions offer cheaper power and fewer regulations, making them ideal for miners looking to stay competitive. Other companies are taking a different approach, pivoting into AI themselves. Hut 8, Core Scientific, and Hive are leasing their data centers to AI hyperscalers, turning what used to be mining hubs into profitable AI facilities. It’s a risky move, but one that could pay off big if the AI boom continues. Even with Bitcoin trading at $100,000, miners are feeling the heat. The collective hash rate—essentially the total computing power securing the Bitcoin network—hit an all-time high last Friday. That’s great for network security, but terrible for miners, as it means even more competition.

That’s some serious momentum for a meme coin, especially in such a short amount of time. But why has BTFD Coin caught the attention of so many crypto enthusiasts? One of the key drivers of its success is the 90% APY offered on staking. For investors looking to hold onto their BTFD coins for the long term , staking offers an excellent opportunity to earn passive income.

Some of the top-tier altcoins – led by Chainlink (LINK), XRP, Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Dogecoin (DOGE) – have already formed a macro bullish trend in preparation for a parabolic rally in the near term. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Some analysts claim that Intel Markets is replicating the SOL price trajectory and is ready to become the next Solana of this bull run as a 50x altcoin rally approaches. Table of Contents SOL analysis: Solana’s trajectory and future predictions Intel Markets: The new frontier of crypto trading INTL to mirror SOL price charts of 2021 The cryptocurrency market is positioned for an extraordinary surge, with analysts forecasting the altcoin sector could achieve a $7 trillion market capitalization by 2025. This projection indicates a fivefold increase from current valuations, driven by technical indicators resembling patterns observed before the historic 2021 bull run. If the pattern plays out, a historic alt season could be around the corner. Experts claim that the impending altcoin rally is going to push Intel Markets (INTL) to new highs with the INTL coin replicating the previous highs projected by the SOL price in 2021. The emerging platform is ready to become the next Solana of this bull run with an altcoin rally. SOL analysis: Solana’s trajectory and future predictions As of January 2025, Solana (SOL) , a high-performance blockchain known for its speed and low transaction costs, has maintained its position as a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market. Despite facing setbacks, including network outages and a significant drop in market value, SOL price has made a remarkable recovery, driven by innovation and increasing adoption across decentralized finance and NFT sectors. In recent months, SOL price has been bolstered by key partnerships and technological improvements, including the launch of “Project Ironclad,” a scaling solution to enhance transaction throughput. These efforts have contributed to a more stable and resilient network, gaining attention from both developers and investors. Additionally, the Solana Foundation has been working on fostering ecosystem growth, particularly in areas like decentralized applications (dApps) and enterprise adoption. The recent uptrend is attributed to the broader market recovery and Solana’s strengthened fundamentals. Despite the positive momentum, Solana faces ongoing competition from Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain, and new entrants like Intel Markets. With continuous upgrades and a thriving developer community, Solana remains a promising project for the future of blockchain technolog, but the current session witnesses INTL becoming the next Solana of this bull run. Intel Markets: The new frontier of crypto trading One popular altcoin that has delivered 700% gains is Intel Markets . This solid project is designed to address real-world challenges in crypto trading, combining AI, blockchain, and DeFi. INTL is positioned to reshape the $264 billion market. The platform will use advanced AI algorithms to create self-learning trading robots, enabling precise, high-speed trades across multiple markets. With its intuitive platform, retail traders will access sophisticated trading strategies without needing advanced technical knowledge. At $0.07 per token, INTL offers a low entry point with a high ceiling for growth. In its presale stages, Intel Markets has already raised over $5 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. Analysts project a 13,000% rally for INTL, mirroring SHIB’s historical rise but supported by solid fundamentals and utility. INTL to mirror SOL price charts of 2021 During its peak in 2021, SOL prices hit an all-time high, creating overnight millionaires. Looking at the price increase of Intel Markets, it’s evident that INTL shares many similarities to Solana’s 2021 rally. Increasing from $0.009 to $0.073, the value of Intel Markets has grown massively in the last couple of months. With an announced listing price of $0.11, early backers stand to gain from the launch of INTL tokens on tier-1 exchanges. Market experts have compared SOL price’s pre-rally consolidation phase and Intel Market’s current chart patterns. Both assets demonstrate rising interest from investors. While the SOL price breakout was driven by community hype, INTL’s trajectory is supported by tangible use cases and a growing demand for more innovative trading tools. This combination of market sentiment and real-world utility positions Intel Markets for explosive growth. To learn more about Intel Markets, visit the presale website , Telegram , and Twitter .

In contrast, 1Fuel (OFT) has emerged as a beacon of optimism in the crypto market. Its innovative peer-to-peer exchange has captured the attention of the crypto community. Coupled with bullish growth predictions and a presale that presents a unique opportunity to invest at the lowest price, it’s no wonder analysts expect a 100x growth for 1Fuel in 2025. Read on to uncover why 1Fuel is a rising star in the DeFi landscape. SHIB’s Internet Hype Dies Down Shiba Inu (SHIB), which was once a crowd favorite, has seen its hype fade recently. Over the past month, the token dropped by 20%, as investors are surrounded by a bearish sentiment. SHIB has experienced a major decrease in its burn rate, which contributes to its decline. Following a rejection at its range high, SHIB’s price correction seems poised to continue in the short-term. The long-term outlook remains optimistic with the possibility of breaking out from its range in 2025, positioning it as a token to watch in 2025. But, SHIB’s reliance on internet buzz makes its growth trajectory unpredictable. Wallets like Core Wallet and Trust Wallet are essential for securing tokens like SHIB, but investors are turning their attention to 1Fuel which is in its presale. Investors Turn to 1Fuel From The Presale Stage 1Fuel (OFT) is currently in its presale stage and has been drawing increasing interest from investors, including SHIB whales seeking higher returns. With over 114 million tokens sold and surpassing the $1 million mark, 1Fuel’s presale has gained significant momentum. At its current price of $0.012, this is the lowest price investors will ever see for 1Fuel. The anticipation surrounding OFT’s potential 100x growth has positioned it a token to watch in 2025. 1Fuel stands out with its advanced features, including seamless cross-chain one-click transactions, which are not possible in known platforms like Core Wallet and Trust Wallet. It is also fitted with AI-driven tools that improve portfolio management and an integrated crypto card for using digital assets in everyday transactions. Another feature is 1Fuel’s privacy mixer for enhanced anonymity. This, plus the disposable wallets and cold storage, makes 1Fuel suitable for security-conscious investors and gives it an edge over Core Wallet and Trust Wallet. 1Fuel OFT has also established itself as a top P2P exchange crypto, capturing attention in the DeFi space. 1Fuel’s P2P Exchange Captures Attention in the Crypto Space The P2P exchange within 1Fuel is powered by smart contracts and a decentralized order-matching engine, enabling a robust platform for users to trade assets. By supporting cross-chain trading through the use of atomic swaps and cross-chain bridges, the P2P exchange allows for seamless asset exchanges across blockchain networks. This gives it an edge over Core Wallet and Trust Wallet, allowing fluid transactions within the crypto space. 1Fuel’s P2P exchange offers key benefits to users, like eliminating intermediaries to lower fees. Users retain full control of their assets during trades, reducing the risks of hacks, fraud or exchange failures. All of these benefits drive growth in 1Fuel’s value as a top P2P exchange crypto. Analysts Predict Sky-High Growth for 1Fuel in 2025 As a leader in the DeFi space, 1Fuel OFT is fueling excitement among SHIB whales. With the exciting ongoing presale, you can secure 1Fuel OFT tokens at the lowest price. Join the presale today and be a part of the future of cryptocurrencies.

This formation suggests a significant breakout is imminent, with January 16, 2025, marked as the latest date for a decisive move. The direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for XRP’s performance in the first quarter of 2025, and the analyst has expressed confidence in an upward breakout. #XRP – Perfect Symmetrical Triangle: What Comes Next? Here’s the scoop, #XRPFamily : 1⃣Timing the Move : By no later than 16th January 2025, we’re set for a decisive breakout. This move will set the tone for Q1 2025. Scenario 1 – Break to the Upside : If we… pic.twitter.com/OJCYLxsd7x — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 5, 2025 Symmetrical Triangle Formation The symmetrical triangle is a common chart pattern in technical analysis. It represents a period of consolidation. During this phase, the price oscillates between converging trendlines, indicating that buyers and sellers are evenly matched. As the triangle narrows, market pressure builds, culminating in a breakout. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the current formation is a perfect symmetrical triangle, with both trendlines converging evenly. He also identifies key levels for this potential move. Key Scenarios for Q1 2025 XRP is currently trading at $2.38, and two primary scenarios emerge from EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis: Upside Breakout: If XRP breaches the upper resistance of the triangle, it could trigger a strong bullish rally. EGRAG notes that this scenario would likely lead to what the analyst described as “fireworks,” signaling robust upward momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A breakout could propel XRP to $2.60, a crucial resistance level recently identified by another analyst. Following this run, the asset could climb to extended targets as high as $3.77. Downside Breakout: Conversely, if XRP falls below the lower support line, it could signal bearish dominance, resulting in a challenging start to 2025. EGRAG warns that this outcome might dampen investor sentiment for the quarter. This bearish scenario might see XRP decline to $2.00 or lower, potentially testing support at $1.64 and $1.37. When Will XRP Make This Important Move? According to EGRAG CRYPTO, the breakout is expected no later than January 16. Whether the price moves upward or downward, the result is anticipated to influence XRP’s trajectory well into Q1 2025. However, with Donald Trump’s inauguration around the corner, a bearish breakout might not last long, as investors and analysts expect a massive rally after the inauguration. If the asset experiences a bullish breakout, the excitement following the inauguration could also give it a massive boost, potentially sending it to a new all-time high.

38645356,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=671693,1736235001,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Altcoins Future Unveiled: Will The Market Ascend To New Heights Or Hit A Roadblock?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altcoins-future-unveiled-will-the-market-ascend-to-new-heights-or-hit-a-roadblock/,"As the cryptocurrency market experiences a notable resurgence, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to lead the charge, while altcoins—especially Cardano (ADA)—are making significant gains. Altcoins Market On The Cusp Of Change: Will Bullish Momentum Prevail? Market expert Patrick H recently shared insights on social media, stating, “The altcoins market is attempting to build a new bullish structure. Are we heading for higher levels, or is another rejection more likely?” This query shared among market players signifies the careful optimism present in the altcoin realm as it contemplates the possibilities of a trend reversal. Related Reading: XRP Eyes $11 Breakout, But A Correction Might Come First—Analyst On this matter, the expert unveiled in a recent analysis that the daily chart of the total altcoin market cap (excluding the top 10 cryptocurrencies) reveals important developments. After enduring a prolonged bearish phase characterized by a descending channel—marked by lower highs (LH) and lower lows (LL)—the market appears to be on the verge of a significant shift. In addition, recent activity indicates a breakout from this descending channel, suggesting that bearish momentum may be waning. Importantly, a higher low (HL) has formed around the $330 billion mark, establishing a critical support level, serving as the first indication of a possible bullish shift in the market’s trajectory. Currently, the altcoin market is facing resistance at the $375 billion level, where it is consolidating following the breakout. For a full confirmation of a bullish market structure shift, the market must achieve a clear higher high (HH) at approximately $400 billion. Successfully breaking this level would solidify the reversal and could lead to a rally targeting $600 billion as the next local stop. Conversely, if the market experiences a failed breakout—failing to reclaim the $400 billion mark and subsequently reversing—investors should closely monitor key support levels at $330 billion and $317 billion. A retest of the descending channel breakout could occur, and a breakdown below $317 billion would invalidate the bullish setup, signaling a potential return to the downtrend. Can Cardano Continue Its Impressive Price Climb? Over the past week, Cardano has emerged as a standout performer, experiencing a substantial price increase of 31%. This surge has enabled the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to regain the critical $1.11 level. In stark contrast, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, recently achieved a new all-time high of $108,000. Despite this, Cardano’s current price remains over 64% below its all-time high of $3.09, which was reached in September 2021. However, with the bullish scenarios outlined by market expert Patrick H. indicating a potential rally in the altcoin market in the coming months, Cardano and other altcoins may continue to experience upward price momentum. Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? All around, the altcoins market stands at a crucial juncture. The recent breakout and formation of a higher low are promising signs, yet the path forward remains uncertain. A successful push above the $400 billion threshold is essential to confirm a bullish reversal and unlock further upside potential.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) are reclaiming some of their previous positions after a recent slump. Moreover, market analysts like Whales HQ and Posty have made some bold price predictions for them. However, DTX Exchange (DTX) is buzzing with its revolutionary online trading platform. It recently launched the test version of this hybrid exchange, which could become a fan favorite among millions. It has already onboarded over 300K users while giving early investors a 600% return. Some experts hint that this phase seven presale star could be the next 5x crypto coin in 2025. DTX Exchange (DTX) Seen as a Revolutionary Force Amid 600% Price Surge While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) are making comebacks, DTX Exchange (DTX) is also turning some heads. Recently, CoinMarketCap listed the DTX native token, which will bring countless new traders to this project. Demand is already high, with DTX Exchange raising over $11M in its presale so far. Projections indicate this number may reach $20M before this month ends. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange announced it has launched its hybrid trading platform that combines the best of CEX and DEX. Although still a work in progress, users will experience trading over 120K asset classes like bonds, crypto coins, and stocks in total privacy. Plus, users will get to use up to 1000x leverage on assets. This means a $100 investment could open up access to liquidity of up to $100K. The DTX token is another big part of its ecosystem. Those who hold this crypto coin will get governance voting rights and a portion of the trading fee revenue. As a result, millions of DTX tokens have been sold so far. Currently, it costs just $0.14 in phase seven of its presale, a 600% surge from its starting price of $0.02. However, a top-tier crypto exchange like Uniswap listing is expected to trigger a rally to $0.20. This could make DTX one of the altcoins to watch. Whales HQ: The Price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) Will Reach $0.01 Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the meme coin titans showing green price charts recently. According to CoinMarketCap, its value has jumped nearly 10% in the past week alone. During that time, the Shiba Inu price moved between around $0.000021 and over $0.000023. Crypto analyst Whales HQ also excited traders with his Shiba Inu price prediction. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this meme coin will soar to $0.01 soon. This price target has put more eyes on Shiba Inu (SHIB). But, some traders are still cautious about the Shiba Inu coin. Its value has already soared nearly 150% on the YTD chart. This could mean that this meme coin has seen its highest upswing. Therefore, many of them are turning to DTX for faster returns instead. Ethereum (ETH) Price Movement Is Setting Up Perfectly, Analyst Claims Ethereum (ETH) is another altcoin riding a bullish wave. On the one-week chart, the price of Ethereum moved between nearly $3,400 and over $3,600. In other words, CoinMarketCap shows over a 5% surge in just a few short days. Market expert Posty says that the trading plan for Ethereum (ETH) is clear this week. According to his X post, its daily structure is set up perfectly. As an Ethereum price prediction, he said this token may soar over $4,000 soon. Although the Ethereum coin could see a price jump soon, its high market cap may slow it down. It now sits at nearly $440B, which means ETH will need a lot of new money for its price to skyrocket. But DTX will not face this issue. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Outshine Shiba Inu (SHIB) & Ethereum (ETH)? Crypto coins are in for a big year as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) regain their stability. However, the radical transformative power of DTX Exchange (DTX) may make it stand out. It will introduce groundbreaking technology, a fair launch model that benefits both whales and retail investors, and a low market cap, which means faster price growth. Therefore, market analysts consider DTX the next possible 5x altcoin in 2025.

Moreover, its recent partnership with Hyundai and KIA to handle their carbon management system has acted as a catalyst in the price surge. Considering the present market sentiments, will the Hedera price smash its ATH of $0.5701 and achieve a new high this altcoin season? This article consists of the short-term market sentiments, price analysis, and possible price targets of the 17th largest cryptocurrency. HBAR Price Forms A Triangle Pattern, Tests Breakout! With an intraday trading volume of $760.30 million, the Hedera price has maintained its positive price action by adding 6.67%. Notably, this altcoin has soared 20.76% this year, making it one of the best-performing altcoins of 2025. TradingView: HBAR/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) supports the HBAR coin price chart in the 1D time frame since the year started. This highlights a strong bullish outlook for the altcoin this week. Further, the MACD indicator records a constant decline in its red histogram. Moreover, its averages successfully display a positive crossover in the price chart. This indicates that the price of Hedera may continue gaining value in the upcoming time. Will Hedera Price Hit $0.50 This Month? Suppose, a bullish breakout occurs, under such a situation, the HBAR coin price could retest its important resistance level of $0.3370. Maintaining the value above that level could set the price for this altcoin to head toward its upper high of $0.393 this month. On the flip side, if the bulls fail to breach the resistance level of the triangle pattern, this altcoin could retest its low of $0.278. Furthermore, if the bearish influence intensifies, this could pull the price of Hedera token toward its $0.25 mark. Curious to find out if the Hedera price will achieve the $1 mark? Read CoinPedia’s HBAR Price Prediction to uncover the possible mysteries until 2030! FAQs How much will Hedera be worth in 2025? If the bullish sentiment sustains, this altcoin could reach a maximum trading price of $0.80 during this year. How much is HBAR worth? With a market capitalization of $12.131 billion, the Hedera token is currently exchanging hands at $0.31740. Can Hedera reach 5 dollars? For the HBAR crypto token to achieve this milestone, it will require a surge of 1,475.3% in its present valuation.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-07 07:34:30

Price discovery occurs when an asset enters new territory and makes consecutive new all-time highs. At the time of writing, BTC was just 6% away from its Dec. 17 peak price of $108,135, according to CoinGecko. It has gained more than 10% in a week and broke above the $100,000 level again during late trading on Jan. 6. BTC hit an intraday high of $102,500 during early trading in Asia on Tuesday before falling back slightly. Most Bullish Year of The Cycle “We’re now in the first full week of the post-halving year, which is historically the most bullish year of the cycle,” the analyst added. $BTC Has only just started its price discovery phase.

Exciting times. pic.twitter.com/1s10e5JS54 — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) January 6, 2025 CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju was also bullish, commenting on this bull market on X on Jan. 7. “This Bitcoin bull cycle might turn out to be the longest ever. New liquidity sources are steadily fueling the market, and more are waiting to be unlocked.” However, some analysts at the firm didn’t agree , predicting that the bull market may end in the first half of this year. ITC founder Benjamin Cowen observed that Bitcoin would need to reclaim a short-term trendline, which could put its price at $120,000 by the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.

He also said that 2025 will be the year of the bull market peak, 2026 will be the year of the bear market, and “2027 will be the bottoming out year to precede an entirely brand new future bull market.” Even Bitcoin educator and investor Tone Vays said he was back in the market at current levels after selling in November. “Now that the year is over, I am now back to fully long in Bitcoin as of this afternoon at a price of around 100k!” Elsewhere on Crypto Markets Crypto market capitalization is up marginally at $3.74 trillion at the time of writing, mostly due to Bitcoin’s 2.7% daily gain into six-figure territory again. Ethereum hasn’t mirrored the momentum with a short spike above $3,700, only to fall back again on Tuesday morning. The altcoins were mostly flat, with minor gains for Tron (TRX), Avalanche (AVAX), and Hyperliquid (HYPE).

Table of Contents Understanding the evolving crypto market in 2025 Sui and Floki: Analyzing their market position and potential Lightchain AI rising: Why it could outperform Sui and Floki in 2025 As the cryptocurrency landscape progresses, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a formidable contender for 2025, with the potential to eclipse the prominence of projects like Sui and Floki. While Sui and Floki have garnered attention through their avant-garde ecosystems and meme-driven allure, Lightchain AI distinguishes itself by synergizing blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, delivering pragmatic, real-world applications. Currently in its presale phase, Lightchain AI has amassed over $8.5 million, with tokens priced at $0.0048, signaling robust investor enthusiasm. With an unwavering emphasis on scalability and smart solutions, Lightchain AI is set to emerge as a pivotal force in the forthcoming cryptocurrency bull market, appealing to both veteran investors and novices seeking transformative opportunities. Understanding the evolving crypto market in 2025 The changing crypto market in 2025 is likely to have more new ideas, with more big companies using it and clear rules helping its shape. Blockchai͏n answers that aim on growing, being good for the earth, and real use will get more attention, with projects such as Ethereum 2.0 and Lightchain AI showing the path. DeFi places will keep changing old money systems, while AI use in blockchain will push more growth. As more people join in, a wider mix of investors will take part, moving the market towards steadiness and lasting rise. Sui and Floki: Analyzing their market position and potential Sui and Floki have carved unique positions in the crypto market, each attracting distinct investor interest. Sui, known for its high-performance blockchain and scalability, aims to enhance decentralized applications with faster transactions and greater efficiency, making it a contender in the race for blockchain dominance. In contrast, Floki, a meme coin inspired by Elon Musk’s dog, has leveraged community-driven enthusiasm, gaining attention through its ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) products and NFTs. While Sui’s utility-driven focus positions it for long-term growth, Floki’s viral appeal continues to attract speculative investments, fueling both market excitement and potential risks. Lightchain AI rising: Why it could outperform Sui and Floki in 2025 Lightchain AI is quickly gaining attention as a promising project that could outperform Sui and Floki in 2025. Unlike Sui, which focuses on high-speed transactions, and Floki, which relies on community-driven hype, Lightchain AI provides a clear roadmap with tangible use cases. Its integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence is smart, offering scalable, decentralized solutions for AI-powered applications. The platform’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) set it apart, ensuring real utility and long-term growth. With a strong presale, solid tokenomics, and a dedicated team, Lightchain AI is poised to capture investor interest. As the project progresses towards its mainnet launch in 2025, its practical value and sustainable growth make it a strong contender to surpass both Sui and Floki in the evolving crypto market. Investors shouldn’t miss this opportunity to get involved in this promising project and be a part of its journey towards reshaping the future of blockchain technology.

Currently, the price action doesn’t seem impulsive enough to confirm a strong upward trend, but this could change as the market develops. There are two main scenarios to consider moving forward. Scenario 1: Corrective Rally (B-Wave Correction) The first scenario involves a broader B-wave correction . The downward movement from December 6th to December 20th is seen as an ABC structure (Wave A), and the current move upwards could be part of Wave B, forming either as an ABC or WXY structure. A WXY formation is particularly common in the crypto market. Once the B-wave tops out and a break below key support levels occurs, a C-wave down could begin, signaling the start of a bearish phase. Key Resistance and Support Levels The initial key resistance was marked by the previous swing high at $3550. With Ethereum reaching its blue target zone, the move up may be technically complete. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean a top has formed yet. The price would need to break below the most recent swing low at $3593 and support at $3515 for further confirmation that the rally has ended. Scenario 2: Bullish Scenario (New All-Time Highs) The second scenario presents a more bullish outlook. This involves a potential wave two bottom around December 20th, with Ethereum aiming for higher prices, possibly reaching new all-time highs. However, the current upward move lacks the clear impulsive characteristics typical of a third wave in Elliott Wave theory. A break above the $3800-$3880 zone could provide more evidence for this bullish outlook, but a correction could follow before Ethereum pushes higher. Key Levels to Watch Support Levels : $3593 and $3515–$3575 (Micro Support Zone). Resistance Levels : $3808 and $3880 (Potential Resistance Zone). Trend Confirmation : A break below the trend channel and the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $2400 would signal a shift to a more bearish outlook.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-07 07:45:08

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows of $987.06 million on Monday, marking their second straight day of inflows. Over these two days, the ETFs saw over $900 million in inflows each day, totaling nearly $1.89 billion. The recent jump in inflows nearly offset the streak of low demand observed in the latter half of December, during which the ETFs experienced approximately $1.9 billion in net outflows between Dec. 19 and Jan. 2. Meanwhile, the inflows seen on Monday, Jan. 6 were led by Fidelity’s FBTC which saw $370.24 million entering the fund followed by BlackRock ’s IBIT and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB which attracted $209.08 million and $152.92 million of investors’ money respectively. Biwise’s BITB, Grayscale’s spot BTC ETFs with the tickers GBTC and BTC also contributed to the positive momentum as they recorded $75.23 million, $73.79 million and $71.19 million respectively.

The remaining three BTC ETFs remained neutral. The total daily trading volume for these investment products stood at $3.96 billion on Jan. 6 much higher than the $2.59 billion recorded the previous day. The strong inflows experienced on Monday came as Bitcoin continued its upward climb, managing to surge past the $102,000 level which drove fresh enthusiasm and heightened institutional interest in Bitcoin ETF products once again. Meanwhile, last December was a standout month for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, with funds accumulating around 51,500 BTC—approximately 272% more than the 13,850 new coins that entered circulation during the month. Momentum was fueled by strong spot market activity, driving Bitcoin to an all-time high of $108,135 on Dec. 17, according to data from crypto.news.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL.

The sting was executed by Tran Minh Quang, 41, and three others who were apprehended in Dong Nai Province south of Ho Chi Minh City. Bitminer: An Overview of a Crypto Mining Scam The suspects are said to have adopted a website that they named BitMiner having registered it under the Singapore domain for the express purpose of defying investors. Investors were lured into the BitMiner cloud mining service based in Dubai and offered such mining contracts as Red Diamond, Blue Diamond, Diamond Gold, Black Diamond, and Green Diamond. With the help of fake advertising and fake trading accounts the group enrolled accomplices that used various tricks to attract potential victims and then promised them high yields. This attracted investors through forums where they were introduced to various interesting educational materials touching on mining technologies underpinned by AI. However the fact was that everything went to wallets owned by Quang and his team only. The Arrest and Investigation The Vietnamese police caught the group after investigating their well-planned con. According to the police, two suspects and one still at large used BitMiner to swindle the public by marketing a fake currency known as ‘Bincoin’ and the money of the victims. The probe is still ongoing, and authorities are in the process of naming other people involved in the crime and seeking the money that was embezzled. Fraudsters abuse the irreversible characteristic of the blockchain transaction, having the victims deposit the cash they were given in fake schemes. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hack Report of 2024: $2.3 Billion Stolen, Phishing Remains Top Threat , In the same way, new techniques relying on covering AI and deepfake technologies are also being used in investment scams and this makes it very challenging for investors to protect themselves. Thus, the case of BitMiner should be a rather loud signal, and individuals should pay more attention to what is happening in the sphere of cryptocurrencies . To Avoid Falling Victim to Scams Like Bitminer, Investors Should: Detect fake decentralized platforms and companies that deal with cryptocurrencies. Reduce overreliance on high return promises without substantiation. Invest through official means and never put money directly on wallets that have not been confirmed. Be aware of new threats in the context of the crypto industry. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to the local newspaper Khaosod, a 31-year-old Russian national was assaulted and robbed of $20,000 in a hotel in Karon, Phuket. The two suspects, who were known associates of the victim, allegedly confronted him over an unsettled cryptocurrency debt stemming from previous business dealings in Russia. A complaint with local police alleges that the mastermind, identified as Andrei, reportedly demanded the victim repay $120,000 and attempted to force the victim into unlocking his crypto wallet, even threatening to kill him if he refused. When the victim resisted unlocking the wallet, he was repeatedly punched and kicked, eventually losing consciousness after being struck on the back of the head. The assailants then fled the scene after stealing cash and left the victim restrained in the bathroom. One suspect, Andrei, remains in Thailand, while the second, Dmitri, fled to Dubai shortly after the incident. Arrest warrants have been issued, and Thai authorities continue to track the suspects with the assistance of immigration and local police units.

In July, four men were arrested for abducting and murdering a 29-year-old tourist in Kyiv, which police said was a premeditated incident over plans to steal 3 Bitcoin. After discovering the victim owned BTC, the suspects followed and assaulted the tourist, attempting to force a Bitcoin transfer before the situation turned deadly.

In early December, its price rose to $2.86, its highest since 2018. This bolstered the community’s bullish sentiment. However, it has spent the weeks since then consolidating, failing to come close to this level. Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7), a prominent cryptocurrency expert, addressed this development on X, stating, “This is called a consolidation flush. Designed to shake out the limp weak-handed and prepare our true believers for the next brutal ascent.” According to him, this phase is a natural part of XRP’s growth cycle and is to strengthen the market by filtering out less committed investors. This is called a consolidation flush $XRP – Designed to shake out the limp weak handed and prepare our true believers for the next brutal ascent. This is what you wished for. So embrace the fire. And be ready now. — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) January 5, 2025 XRP’s Recent Consolidation Following XRP’s rapid ascent in November and early December, analysts anticipate a new all-time high by early January. However, the digital asset’s momentum seems to have stalled, as it has yet to experience another notable breakout. It has held its position above $2 but has failed to regain $2.86 or show any notable signs that it will surpass it soon. The consolidation period has sparked mixed reactions in the community, but Crypto Bitlord believes this is a strategic pause before XRP’s next significant upward movement. His post emphasized that this is an opportunity for long-term investors to remain steadfast, adding, “This is what you wished for. So embrace the fire.

January 20, 2025, is shaping up to be a pivotal date for the cryptocurrency. President-elect Donald Trump will take office, and Gary Gensler, the outgoing SEC Chair, will officially resign the same day. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins , a known advocate for cryptocurrency innovation, as Gensler’s successor. Atkins’ crypto-friendly stance has raised hopes within the industry that regulatory pressures on digital assets, including XRP, will ease. There is also speculation that the new administration will end the lawsuit against Ripple. This would positively impact XRP’s price and future adoption in the U.S. Despite the current consolidation, all signs point toward a bright future for XRP, and that explains the optimism shown by Crypto Bitlord and many others in the community. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has expressed optimism for the new year, and the XRP community shares his excitement for where XRP can go in 2025.

In his latest essay on Jan. 7, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin ( BTC ) will hit its peak by late March, pointing out the Fed’s challenges in keeping the market stable while pulling $180 billion out through quantitative tightening from January to March. At the same time, a change to the Reverse Repo Program rate will add $237 billion of liquidity, Hayes notes, explaining that money will flow into higher-yielding Treasury bills, resulting in a net liquidity injection of $57 billion in Q1. You might also like: Once again, Bitcoin beat the S&P 500 in yearly growth. Is it time to trade the index for crypto? The Treasury’s General Account will also play a role. “Bad Gurl Yellen” (Hayes’ nickname for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen) has begun “extraordinary measures” to fund the government while waiting for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. Until then, the Treasury can only spend from the TGA, which Hayes estimates will be depleted by May or June. This spending adds liquidity to the market, but once the ceiling is raised, the Treasury will need to refill its account, pulling liquidity out. Hayes believes the market will react to these liquidity shifts. He predicts Bitcoin and the whole market to peak “in mid to late March,” similar to March 2024, when Bitcoin peaked around $73,000. After that, the market might face headwinds from tax deadlines and TGA replenishment. The BitMEX co-founder believes that the Fed is “exhausting all tools at its disposal,” adding that future moves could include stopping QT or even restarting quantitative easing. For now, Hayes says liquidity conditions in Q1 suggest a temporary boost for risk assets like Bitcoin.

FTX EU, which held a MiFID II-license under the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), cost Backpack $32.7 million, the exchange said. Backpack’s new European arm will offer a full suite of crypto derivatives throughout the EU, starting out by capitalizing on its position as the only regulated perpetual futures provider across Europe, according to Armani Ferrante, CEO of Backpack Exchange. A number of crypto trading firms have applied for a MiFID license, which allows firms to also offer crypto-asset services under Europe’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regime, once a notification has been provided to the relevant competent national authority. Currently, Bitstamp and Coinbase have received their MiFID II licenses, while D2X , based in the Netherlands, has also received a license and plans to deliver USD-denominated futures and options early this year. Other new entrants also aim to shift the crypto derivatives market dominance away from the likes of Panama-based centralized exchange Deribit. Backpack’s Ferrante said the firm’s MiCA notification has been submitted and he expects to go live in the first quarter of 2025. “Even though a few firms have been able to acquire approval for a limited form of a derivatives license, we’re not aware of any players that currently offer perpetuals and are live in the EU, including Coinbase and Bitstamp,” Ferrante said via email. “Once we return FTX EU customers' funds, we’re excited to begin serving a regulated perpetual futures product as a priority.” A full suite of products is being worked on, Ferrante added, although some of these may not roll out in Q1.

As per the court timeline SEC needs to file its appeal-related brief by January 15. Based on the current US political scenario, Prominent attorney and XRP advocate John E. Deaton has outlined his predictions for Ripple’s future, suggesting the company may launch an IPO by late 2025 or early 2026. The timeline depends on how quickly Paul Atkins is confirmed as SEC Chairman. Deaton believes the SEC will withdraw its appeal, resolving the legal battle and allowing Ripple to focus on growth and an IPO. Possible outcome if SEC Appeal Deaton outlines several reasons why the SEC’s appeal is a losing battle. First, the ruling isn’t binding for other cases and doesn’t broadly apply to all cryptocurrency sales. Judge Torres only ruled that the SEC didn’t prove XRP sales in the secondary market were securities under the Howey Test. Even if the SEC won the appeal, the case would likely return to Judge Torres, who could still rule against the SEC on other grounds. If the SEC takes the case to the Supreme Court, it risks a bigger loss. The Court could set a precedent that favors cryptocurrencies , which the SEC likely wants to avoid. Deaton believes that under Paul Atkins , the SEC would recognize this risk and withdraw the appeal. Ripple would likely pay a fine, and the case would end. Moreover, with the positive outcome, XRP can attain new heights currently XRP is waiting to break its 2021 ATH of $3 target. The analyst even predicts that XRP can go even $19 if the SEC withdraws the case. The Weaknesses in the SEC’s Appeal Deaton highlights several reasons why the SEC’s appeal lacks merit. First, Judge Torres’ decision is not a binding precedent and has already been criticized by legal scholars and other judges, including Judge Rakoff in the same district. Second, the ruling’s narrow scope means it doesn’t broadly exonerate all secondary market sales of digital assets but focuses on the SEC’s failure to meet the Howey Test’s criteria in Ripple’s case. Even if the SEC were to win on appeal, the case would likely be remanded to Judge Torres, who could apply other Howey factors and potentially arrive at the same conclusion. Furthermore, Deaton notes that if the case escalates to the Supreme Court, the SEC risks a significant loss. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction for January 7 , Ripple’s IPO and Regulatory Clarity With the legal battle behind them, Ripple could focus on launching its IPO . Deaton sees this as a big step for the company and the crypto industry. Going public would give Ripple more resources and credibility while showcasing how regulatory clarity can help crypto companies grow. Deaton predicts Ripple’s SEC battle could end positively, paving the way for the company to lead crypto innovation and highlight the benefits of clear regulations. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Daily Bitcoin production also declined from 20 BTC in December 2023 to 16.5 BTC in December 2024. The company’s expansion efforts focused on its Corsicana facility in Texas, where the initial 400 MW development phase was completed. Riot CEO Jason Les highlighted a cautious approach to bringing the facility fully online, ensuring grid stability. This methodical process has temporarily delayed the full deployment of hash rate capacity. In 2024, Riot’s Bitcoin holdings surged by 141%, reaching 17,722 BTC by year’s end. This increase stemmed largely from strategic purchases, including 5,117 BTC for $510 million on December 12 and another 667 BTC for $69 million later that month. The average price of these acquisitions was $101,135 per Bitcoin. Additionally, the company announced plans to raise $500 million through convertible senior notes due in 2030 to fund further Bitcoin purchases. Riot shares climbed nearly 5%, trading at $12.88 after the updates. Earlier in 2024, Riot acquired a 9.25% stake in Canadian mining firm Bitfarms, aiming to bolster economic resilience post-Bitcoin halving. The company also experienced a significant 155% increase in its hash rate during the year, surpassing the overall network hash rate growth of 52%. Riot mined 4,828 Bitcoin in 2024 at an average net power cost of 3.4 cents per kWh. This efficiency was a key driver of its strong performance. Riot’s actions align with broader industry trends, as other firms like Marathon Digital and MicroStrategy have also expanded their Bitcoin holdings. With a focus on strategic growth and operational efficiency, Riot Platforms solidified its position as a leading player in the Bitcoin mining sector.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-07 08:13:58
