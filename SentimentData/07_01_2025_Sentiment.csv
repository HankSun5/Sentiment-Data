Web3Bay is doing just that. As other projects shout about their potential, Web3Bay focuses on a steady build-up, positioning itself as a transformative force in online shopping. This underappreciated project is gearing up for significant impact, making now a prime time for discerning crypto enthusiasts to engage. How Web3Bay Is Reinventing E-Commerce Web3Bay is more than your typical blockchain initiative. It’s pioneering a new way of shopping online—without middlemen, reducing fees, enhancing data privacy, and ensuring secure, user-driven transactions. But why isn’t this making more noise? Web3Bay prefers real progress over flashy promotion. Its presale stages are designed to benefit early supporters discreetly, attracting genuine interest over fleeting speculation. Those looking for the best investments to watch right now see Web3Bay’s groundwork as especially compelling. The Value of Web3Bay Tokens Currently, Web3Bay tokens, named 3BAY, are available at the low price of $0.0039675 during the third presale stage. Early buyers stand to see significant gains, with token prices projected to reach $0.1959—a 6,430% increase by the end of the presale. So far, the presale has raised over $420,000 and sold 110 million tokens, signaling strong market trust. However, this valuation doesn’t yet match the platform’s full future potential. Why Web3Bay Is a Game-Changer in Online Shopping Web3Bay’s model is simple and globally applicable. It tackles issues like excessive fees, opacity, and privacy—problems that millions encounter online. By employing blockchain, the platform promises lower costs, transparency, and better security. Its dual payment system, supporting both cryptocurrencies and traditional methods like PayPal, bridges existing e-commerce with blockchain innovation, making it accessible to a broad audience. Why Join Web3Bay’s Presale Now In blockchain ventures, timing is crucial. Early involvement in Web3Bay could differentiate between modest earnings and substantial rewards. Each new presale stage increases token prices by 15%, rewarding proactive participants. Moreover, early investors can influence the platform’s direction through decentralized governance, offering a community-focused alternative to the centralized setups of current e-commerce leaders. This positions Web3Bay as a significant DeFi player and a bullish crypto to monitor. Web3Bay’s Bright Future in Blockchain Commerce Web3Bay has big plans, including introducing an NFT marketplace, DeFi staking options, and cross-chain features to enrich the user experience and extend utility. These steps will attract both blockchain enthusiasts and mainstream users, setting the stage for Web3Bay to become a well-known name in the Web3 arena. With its practical solutions and commitment to decentralization, Web3Bay is set to lead in the evolving e-commerce sector, making it a wise choice among the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Wrapping Up Web3Bay is set for a significant lift-off. Its current undervaluation reflects a market oversight, one that’s quickly adjusting as more recognize its potential. Joining now places you at the forefront of a transformative wave in how we shop online. Web3Bay isn’t just another blockchain project—it’s at the vanguard of redefining buying, selling, and connecting digitally. It stands out as a top DeFi crypto and is poised to dominate in a forthcoming bull market. Get ahead of the curve—join Web3Bay before it becomes mainstream.

Barr is resigning from his position as Vice Chair for Supervision. In a statement , Barr said he didn’t want a potential dispute over the position in the near future to distract from the Fed’s “mission.” “The position of vice chair for supervision was created after the Global Financial Crisis to create greater responsibility, transparency, and accountability for the Federal Reserve’s supervision and regulation of the financial system. The risk of a dispute over the position could be a distraction from our mission. In the current environment, I’ve determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor.” Barr’s resignation comes less than two weeks before pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. In 2023 during a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C., Barr warned about the “special risks associated with stablecoins,” advocating for stiffer regulations on the asset class. Said Barr, “Stablecoin issuers seek to have—but don’t—some of the same characteristics as federally insured bank deposits. Stablecoin issuers represent that their liabilities can be redeemed on demand at par, a dollar for a dollar. In fact, however, the assets backing the liability can fluctuate in value… The banks we regulate, in contrast, are well protected from bank runs through a robust array of supervisory requirements. Consider the consequences if a stablecoin not subject to appropriate supervision and regulation were to be adopted as a widespread means of payment, which some stablecoin developers state as a goal. Stablecoins have the potential to scale quickly because of network effects. An unregulated, unsupervised, deposit-like asset could create tremendous disruptions, not just for financial institutions but for people who might rely on the coin if it were to get wide adoption. We must learn from the past to ensure that we do not allow for new forms of unregulated private money subject to classic forms of run risk, and with the associated spillovers and systemic implications for households, businesses, and the broader economy.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This trial stemmed from the CFTC’s 2022 lawsuit, which accused Gemini of providing false or misleading information during the evaluation of its Bitcoin futures product. The CFTC alleged that between July 2017 and December 2017, Gemini made inaccurate claims about whether its proposed Bitcoin futures contract would be “readily susceptible to manipulation.” Additionally, the lawsuit highlighted that Gemini engaged in undisclosed fee arrangements with specific market participants, such as market makers. These arrangements, designed to boost trading in Gemini’s Auction, were not disclosed to all customers or made available on the company’s website. Under the terms of the settlement, Gemini agreed to pay a $5 million penalty and refrain from making false or misleading statements to the CFTC in the future.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Evaluating Ethereum, XRP, Rollblock, Solana, Pepe, and Shiba Inu as the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Table of Contents Rollblock gaining attention during presale Ethereum tipped to reclaim $4000 XRP slightly declines amid market downturn Shiba Inu suffers with most speculative crypto Solana demonstrates potential Pepe diminishes after a bullish Q4 Conclusion The recent cryptocurrency decline drew parallels to the market dynamics of December 2020. During that period, the dip in prices preceded a historic altcoin rally in Q1-Q2 of 2021, when several assets surged to unprecedented highs. If the 4-year cycle theory holds true, the recent downturn may be setting the stage for another explosive bull run. Ethereum, XRP, Shiba Inu, Solana, Pepe, and Rollblock are all positioned to benefit from this potential resurgence. Rollblock gaining attention during presale Rollblock aims to transform the play-to-earn iGaming sector with its state-of-the-art casino platform that combines strong fundamentals, attractive incentives, and unparalleled growth potential. The platform will have an extensive catalog of over 7,000 games, offering a diverse range of options, from classic favorites like blackjack and poker to cutting-edge blockchain-based titles. Recently, Rollblock expanded its offerings by introducing sports betting, solidifying its position as a leader in the rapidly growing GambleFi market. Security is a top priority for Rollblock, which leverages advanced encryption technologies and AI-powered safeguards to create a transparent and secure environment for both players and investors. The platform’s credibility is further bolstered by its recent SolidProof audit and licensing by Gaming Arjun, establishing its legitimacy as it approaches a highly anticipated bull run ahead of its official launch. One of Rollblock’s standout features is its revenue-sharing system. Up to 30% of weekly profits will be reinvested into token buybacks, with 60% of these tokens burned to reduce supply and drive scarcity. The remaining tokens will be distributed to investors as staking rewards, fostering a loyal community and enhancing RBLK’s long-term value. Ethereum tipped to reclaim $4000 Ethereum recently slipped below the critical $4,000 level during a broader market downturn, temporarily halting its December rally, which had been fueled by strong retail interest and record-breaking inflows into Ethereum ETFs. Despite this dip, optimism remains strong. December saw over $1 billion in ETH accumulation, with 104,000 ETH withdrawn from exchanges, signaling growing confidence among long-term holders. Whale wallets now hold 57% of Ethereum’s total supply — the highest concentration in the platform’s history — demonstrating substantial support from major players. Market analysts anticipate a swift recovery, with Ethereum poised to reclaim the $4,000 mark and potentially surpass its all-time high of $4,891 as early as Q1 2025. As the market stabilizes and the anticipated “alt season” begins in January, Ethereum is set to maintain its leadership position. Its dominance in DeFi, coupled with rising institutional interest and increased whale activity, reinforces Ethereum’s role as a cornerstone of the crypto market and a key player in the next bullish wave. You might also like: Here are the expected bull market top prices for XRP, Solana and Rollblock XRP slightly declines amid market downturn In Q4 of 2024, XRP became one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market, surging over 400%, fueled by speculation surrounding Gary Gensler’s rumored resignation and the pro-crypto sentiment anticipated from Donald Trump’s incoming administration. Adding to the bullish sentiment were whispers of an XRP ETF launch targeted for 2025-2026. However, the mid-December market correction put downward pressure on XRP, weakening its performance on both daily and weekly charts. Despite the short-term decline, XRP has demonstrated notable resilience compared to many altcoins. This relative strength is supported by Ripple’s strategic initiatives, including the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin, which enhances XRP’s utility within the ecosystem. Analysts predict that as Bitcoin dominance eventually cools off, XRP could see a significant influx of new capital, setting the stage for another rally and maintaining its optimistic long-term outlook. Shiba Inu suffers with most speculative crypto After reaching $0.000033 and sparking renewed investor interest earlier in Q4, Shiba Inu has faced a challenging period, declining by over 20% in the past month. This drop coincided with Bitcoin’s price correction below $90,000, which placed additional downward pressure on speculative assets. Despite these setbacks, Shiba Inu demonstrates resilience and ongoing community support. A recent 1,068% spike in the burn rate resulted in the destruction of over 51.7 million tokens, which highlights efforts to reduce supply. Additionally, Shibarium’s total value locked (TVL) has seen an explosive increase of 850% since September, reflecting the growing utility and adoption of Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 solution. At the time of writing, 64% of Shiba Inu holders were in profit, suggesting solid investor confidence even amidst broader market turbulence. As a leader in the meme coin sector, Shiba Inu retains its position as a dominant player, buoyed by its strong community and expanding ecosystem.

The blockchain’s unprecedented 66.9 million daily transactions underscore its dominance in the layer-1 ecosystem, outpacing the combined activity of major competitors. This performance reflects Solana’s speed, cost efficiency, and scalability, solidifying its reputation as an attractive alternative to Ethereum. Notably, Solana’s Brazilian transaction volumes recently surged to nearly $84 million, further showcasing its growing global adoption. Looking ahead, analysts have identified Solana, alongside XRP, as a leading candidate for spot ETF approval in 2025. While potential classification as securities poses regulatory hurdles, analysts anticipate that Solana ETFs could soon join Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as mainstream investment vehicles, presenting significant upside for the ecosystem and its native SOL token. Pepe diminishes after a bullish Q4 Pepe has firmly established itself as the third-largest meme coin, fueled by tier-1 exchange listings and renewed retail interest, which triggered a series of impressive rallies earlier in the cycle. Adding to this bullish momentum was notable whale activity, including a massive $52 million transfer from a wallet that had been dormant for 600 days, signaling renewed confidence in Pepe’s potential. However, mid-December market turbulence weighed heavily on Pepe, aligning with broader meme coin declines. On both daily and weekly charts, Pepe invalidated key bullish patterns, prompting “smart money” holders to reduce their positions. The tracked holdings of Pepe fell from 8 trillion to 7.5 trillion tokens, indicating a bearish sentiment in the short term. Despite these challenges, analysts believe Pepe’s long-term outlook remains optimistic, as meme coins are likely to rebound during the anticipated altcoin season in Q1-Q2 2025. Pepe’s strong community backing and established position in the meme coin sector suggest it could recover and maintain its relevance in the next market cycle. Conclusion The recent market correction aligns with historical patterns observed in previous cycles and is far from bearish when viewed in context. Corrections like this often set the stage for a robust recovery, especially for large-cap juggernauts such as Ethereum, XRP, Shiba Inu, Solana, and Pepe. Additionally, emerging projects like Rollblock are carving out their own space, offering investors a chance to capitalize on niche market opportunities.

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-06 23:10:00

With several ETFs lined up for launch in 2025, each firm is trying to put its best foot forward to appear on top of the chain. In submissions made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission towards the end of 2024, very lucrative offers would excite investors. One of the unique proposals was an ETF from ProShares that would denote the S&P 500’s return in Bitcoin. Besides, funds managed by Strive Asset Management and REX Shares will enable convertible bonds by companies to purchase Bitcoin. Volatility Shares, an ETF firm, hopes to trigger Solana funds with a vessel that tracks it using futures products. As more launches are anticipated, there are deliberate attempts to incorporate crypto strategies into ETFs . Most of these scenarios will be in play in 2025 because crypto is currently the hot thing, and issuers love to drop them when the theme is on fire. Crypto ETFs are gaining traction out of their one-year existence The US Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF were only approved and launched last year. If the SEC approves all the filed applications for crypto ETFs, there will be more than a dozen crypto ETFs in 2025. Cryptocurrency enjoyed a good ride in 2024, with Bitcoin growing more than 120% to trade above $100,000. The surge could be attributed to the US President-elect, Donald Trump, who has openly embraced cryptocurrency. The Trump administration is expected to loosen its regulatory stance regarding crypto, making digital assets grow accordingly. The excitement surrounding Trump’s election helped to push annual inflows for the biggest Bitcoin ETF . BlackRock rose above $37 billion for the year, ranking third among all funds. Corporates are using a mix of new equity and sales of convertible bonds to buy more crypto Some of the strategies that may dominate 2025 began last year. For instance, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor leveraged the surging crypto prices to double down on his Bitcoin purchase tactics, acquiring large tokens for its company reserve. The firm has used both new equity and sales of convertible bonds to help sponsor its crypto buying. Other entities have also laid down plans for their firms based on MicroStrategy’s style. Fillings from REX ETF indicate that the firm wants to invest most of its assets in convertible bonds from companies that deal in Bitcoin. Also, according to paperwork filed last week, Strive is proposing to launch a fund that invests in derivatives such as swaps and options to get exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy or other companies with similar investment strategies.

This makes the Southeast Asian giant the latest addition to the coalition of emerging economies, which now consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, alongside newer members like Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Indonesia had been eyeing the group for years, pushing to become part of its mission to challenge Western-dominated systems and amplify the voice of the Global South. The approval came in 2023 during the BRICS summit in Johannesburg, but Indonesia, waiting for political stability after its presidential elections, delayed formalizing its membership. Now, with President Prabowo Subianto in charge since October, the timing finally lined up. BRICS grows stronger with Indonesia on board BRICS has been on an expansion spree. Together, the countries represent 37.3% of global GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) and are home to over 3.3 billion people. With Indonesia in the fold, BRICS now boasts some of the fastest-growing economies on the planet, along with a ton of political and economic clout. Indonesia’s economy is valued at over $1 trillion, and its role in trade, manufacturing, and natural resources makes it a valuable player for the bloc. Adding to this, Indonesia has been vocal about its support for BRICS’ goals of reforming global governance systems. The statement from Brazil summed it up like this: “Indonesia contributes positively to the deepening of cooperation in the Global South.” The de-dollarization agenda BRICS has been working overtime on de-dollarization, to cut ties with the U.S. dollar in trade and financial transactions. One major piece of the puzzle is the “BRICS Bridge,” a blockchain-powered payment system in development. Think of it as an alternative to SWIFT, designed to allow member countries to settle trade using their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). For BRICS, blockchain is a weapon. You see, they’re considering creating a new reserve currency, the “Unit,” backed by a basket of member currencies and possibly gold. India has already been leading the charge in local currency trade agreements. The country has sealed deals with 22 nations, allowing trade in domestic currencies instead of the dollar. This strategy has picked up steam as sanctions on countries like Russia push them to look for financial workarounds. Still, there’s a long road ahead. Critics say the dollar’s dominance isn’t going to crumble overnight, no matter how hard BRICS tries. Internal issues like fluctuating currencies, economic disparities, and logistical challenges could slow the pace. But BRICS doesn’t seem to care. Putin, Trump, and BRICS Here’s where things get even messier. Vladimir Putin’s Russia has been one of the loudest voices in BRICS, pushing hard for de-dollarization. But now there’s a new wildcard on the table: Donald Trump. His return to the U.S. presidency is expected to shake things up, especially for Russia’s economic plans and BRICS’ overall strategy. Let’s break it down. Trump’s administration has always been unpredictable when it comes to Russia. While there’s speculation that Trump might seek to cool tensions with Moscow, many in his camp favor tougher sanctions. If Trump doubles down on economic warfare, it could isolate Russia from Western financial systems even more, making BRICS’ de-dollarization efforts even more critical. For Putin, BRICS is a lifeline. Russia’s economy has been battered by sanctions, with inflation soaring to nearly 30% last year and the ruble losing 33% of its value since August 2024. Oil revenues, once the backbone of Russia’s economy, have plummeted. Daily earnings from fossil fuels have halved since 2022, while Ukraine’s decision to cut off transit rights for Russian gas to Europe has cost Moscow another $5 billion annually. Despite these setbacks, Russia has been doubling down on BRICS. For the rest of BRICS, the dynamic between Trump and Putin matters. If Russia faces tighter sanctions, it could accelerate BRICS’ push for alternative financial systems. On the flip side, if Trump opens up new opportunities for Russia, it could give the bloc more breathing room to focus on its long-term goals.

The company announced earlier today that it has reached a $5 million settlement. This ends allegations that Gemini misled regulators during its bid to launch America’s first Bitcoin futures contract. This settlement is part of the ongoing conflict between the crypto industry and regulators. It reflects the changing policies influenced by shifting political climates. Gemini’s Regulatory Hurdles: A Case of Misrepresentation? The controversy dates back to 2017 when Gemini Trust submitted proposals to the CFTC to launch future contracts for Bitcoin. However ,the CFTC alleged that Gemini misrepresented critical safeguards to prevent price manipulation. These safeguards were supposed to form the backbone of a trusted financial product, yet the regulator argued Gemini fell short of expectations. Fast forward to January 2025, just weeks before a trial was set to unravel in Manhattan federal court , Gemini and the CFTC struck a deal. Gemini agreed to pay $5 million to settle the claims, neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. This settlement underscores the legal tightrope walked by crypto firms aiming to push boundaries while facing increasing scrutiny. Ripple Effects in the Crypto Landscape Gemini’s settlement coincides with broader regulatory movements, including the high-profile Ripple SEC case. Former SEC enforcement lawyer Marc Fagel recently predicted a possible settlement in the ongoing lawsuit against Ripple . He pointed to the incoming Trump administration, which is expected to take a more industry-friendly approach. As SEC Chair Paul Atkins prepares to take the reins, many expect regulatory leniency to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has already attributed a surge in U.S. business activity to what he dubbed the “ Trump effect .” In a recent X post, he shared that 75% of Ripple’s hiring is now U.S.-based. This shift is driven by a surge in domestic deals following Trump’s election victory. Ripple’s newly launched RLUSD stablecoin has also gained prominence, surpassing competitors like PYUSD and EURC in trading volume. Biden’s Legacy vs. Trump’s Crypto Promise The settlement is an important moment in the broader narrative of U.S. crypto regulation. Under President Biden, more actions were taken against crypto companies, showing a tougher approach to market rules. The Gemini case was one of many, as regulators worked to ensure fairness and prevent abuse in the growing crypto market. However, with President Trump returning to office, regulations may change. Known for supporting the industry, Trump’s administration is expected to be more lenient with crypto rules.

Why Are Pengu and Meme Coins Facing Fierce Competition,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/1fuel-or-dogecoin-why-are-pengu-and-meme-coins-facing-fierce-competition,"Meme coins have long been driven by internet hype, but now they are facing increasing competition from utility tokens like 1Fuel in the crypto space. Some top meme coins are Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), but they are now overshadowed by 1Fuel. 1Fuel is now in its presale stage, and allows investors to purchase the OFT token at a very low price before the value goes up by 100x in 2025. But why is 1Fuel a strong competitor to these meme coins? Continue reading to learn why 1Fuel is attracting the attention of savvy investors. Meme Coins Face Strong Competition in the Crypto Space Dogecoin, known as the largest meme coin by market cap, has seen an impressive growth. It is currently valued at $0.3877, which is a major 383.87% increase from 2024. Similarly, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has reached a value of $0.04211. The value skyrocketed by an impressive 742.40% in 2024 alone. There’s a lot of optimism around DOGE investors since analysts predict it would reach the $1 mark. As for PENGU, its predictions go between $0.086 and $0.1 by the end of the year. Both tokens are easily stored on well-known platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Despite their impressive growth potential, meme coins like DOGE and PENGU face strong competition from utility tokens in the crypto space. These meme coins rely heavily on social media trends and internet hype, which do not provide sustainable long-term growth. Due to this, smart investors consider utility tokens as top cryptocurrencies to invest in. Why 1Fuel Offers an Edge in DeFi Innovation 1Fuel OFT is one of the tokens challenging the dominance of meme coins in the crypto space. One of 1Fuel’s top features is its cross-chain transaction capability, which allows you to easily interact with different blockchain networks from a single wallet. This makes it stand out from other top platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. 1Fuel is highly committed to user privacy, as it features an inbuilt mixer that keeps all transactions confidential. This is unlike many platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, which offer limited privacy features. With these innovations, 1Fuel is quickly becoming one of the top utility tokens in the market, setting the stage for long-term growth. Investors Rush to Secure 1Fuel from its Presale As meme coins like DOGE and PENGU face increased competition, investors are turning their attention to 1Fuel . It is now in its presale stage and offering the token at its lowest-ever price of $0.012. With the presale already surpassing the $1 million mark and over 114 million tokens sold in record time, it’s clear that investors are highly confident in the token’s future. The presale’s rapid success speaks volume about investor enthusiasm, making it one of the top utility tokens. With its DEX wallet features standing out among platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, 1Fuel has become a standard tool for interacting with blockchains. The Crypto Space Leans Towards from 1Fuel As the 1Fuel live presale progresses, more and more investors are taking advantage of this opportunity to secure their stake before its public release. The crypto space is leaning towards 1Fuel, and investors can take advantage of this enticing opportunity before it's too late.

The swap will shift the stablecoin from other blockchains to Tron network to improve the communication between the supported chains. Details of the Tether USDT Chain Swap to Tron Network On January 6, Tether revealed via its X account that it is coordinating with a top third-party exchange to move $1 billion worth of USDT. The swap will involve transferring a portion of the stablecoin held in cold wallets to the Tron blockchain. Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, is currently available on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. The issuer clarified that the process will not alter the total USDT supply but will ensure that liquidity is optimized across various networks. This mechanism enables traders and users to leverage their assets on any blockchain supported by the crypto firm. Meanwhile, the stablecoin issuer recently joined the bandwagon of firms increasing their Bitcoin reserves, adding 7,629 BTC worth $705.25 million. The funds, transferred from Bitfinex after nine months of dormancy, bring Tether’s total Bitcoin holdings to 82,983 BTC. Acquired for $2.99 billion, these holdings are now valued at $7.68 billion, reflecting its growing Bitcoin strategy. USDT’s Dominance in the Stablecoin Market Furthermore, USDT remains on top of the list in the stablecoin market cap with a value of more than $137 billion. Its main application areas are in payment systems, trading, and cross-border transactions . The stablecoin has recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $107 billion, a 69% jump in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, the second popular stablecoin, the USDC, has a market cap of $45.8 billion and a daily trading volume of $7.7 billion. However, Tether’s stability pegged to the U.S. dollar has made it an essential tool for traders in the crypto market. Nonetheless, despite the growing dominance, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has accused Tether of market manipulation following its recent 7,629 BTC purchase. Schiff claimed that the stablecoin issuer mints USDT “out of thin air” to acquire Bitcoin, likening it to quantitative easing. While Tether backs USDT with reserves and conducts audits, Schiff continues to question its practices. Role of Chain Swaps in the Crypto Ecosystem Chain swaps play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by enabling seamless asset transfers between blockchains. This allows users to access liquidity and trading opportunities across multiple blockchains, enhancing market efficiency. The stablecoin issuer decision to facilitate a chain swap to Tron underscores its commitment to maintaining liquidity across supported networks. The Tron blockchain remains one of the primary platforms for USDT, driving substantial trading activity. However, despite its dominance, the stablecoin issuer has not been without some challenges. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, proposed in December last year, has impacted the stablecoin market directly.

Per the South Korean media outlet NoCut News , a branch of the Daegu District Court found the group guilty of violating the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information, the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act, and obstructing business. ‘Kimchi Premium’ Crypto Trading Gang Jailed None of the gang’s names were released for legal reasons. But a man referred to as “A” (age 43), was identified as the group’s ringleader. The court jailed him for three and a half years. The presiding judge sentenced another defendant to two years and two months in prison. Kimchi premium prices (Bitcoin) at the time of writing. (Source: Cryprice) The presiding judge jailed a third individual for two years. The group’s final member was given a suspended 18-month sentence and ordered to perform 160 hours of community service. The Daegu District Court also handed out fines, including an “approximately 3 billion won” (over $2 million) bill for A. The judge also ordered the group to pay legal and other “additional” fees. Prosecutors told the court that the group worked with “investors” in Japan. They took tokens from Japan-based vendors and resold them in South Korea to “make a profit.” They did this at a time when the “ kimchi premium ” was at a periodic high, prosecutors said. The kimchi premium is a phenomenon whereby high retail demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins leads to tokens trading on South Korean exchanges at much higher prices than on international platforms. At its highest point (circa 2020-2021), the premium rose above the 35% mark.

The court heard that the group “received approximately 27 billion won [$18.5 million] in return” for its services.

Recently, Cardano recorded 20 million transactions in just two days, highlighting its robust scalability. Predictions are also favorable for Stellar, with an expected 471% rise in a bullish market scenario. BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves with the buzz around its cinematic-style Keynote 3, rumored to be in collaboration with a notable Hollywood producer. As an emerging foundational blockchain project, BlockDAG has accumulated over $176 million from its presale, paving the way with significant technological leaps. As the year 2024 winds down, these cryptocurrencies are certainly ones to keep an eye on. Here’s a deeper look at what makes them stand out. What’s Behind Cardano’s 20M Transactions Surge? Ranked ninth globally by market cap, Cardano (ADA) has experienced substantial activity, recording over 20 million transactions in the past two days. Factors such as Cardano’s advances in decentralized governance, especially CIP-1694, may be influencing this surge. Notably, Intersect recently moved the Plomin hard fork governance proposal to the ratification stage, signaling a step forward in Cardano’s on-chain governance. As 2024 concludes, the spike in Cardano transactions signals a robust interest, potentially driving more accumulation as ADA’s price increases from $0.887 after a minor dip to $0.85. Stellar’s Market Outlook: Anticipating a 471% Jump Stellar’s (XLM) market trajectory looks promising, with analysts forecasting a significant 471% increase, based on Fibonacci Extension levels in optimistic market conditions. The growth is supported by Stellar’s expanding ecosystem, including strategic partnerships and enhancements in smart contracts. Despite a recent 10% downturn bringing Stellar close to oversold conditions, it maintains a trading price of $0.3532 with a market cap of $10 billion, keeping market watchers optimistic about its potential to reach $2.12, and even $8 in highly favorable conditions. Is BlockDAG Teaming Up with a Hollywood Producer for Keynote 3? BlockDAG is gearing up for its highly anticipated Keynote 3, slated for release in 2025. This presentation is expected to break new ground, rumored to feature a cinematic collaboration with a renowned Hollywood producer. This pioneering method aims to redefine the presentation of blockchain advancements by integrating engaging storytelling with the latest technological innovations. The centerpiece of the keynote will be BlockDAG’s Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture. This cutting-edge architecture tackles the longstanding scalability challenges faced by traditional blockchains. Unlike conventional linear blockchain systems, DAG allows for more efficient transaction processing, which leads to quicker confirmation times and lower energy consumption. Moreover, BlockDAG’s compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) increases its attractiveness, enabling developers to effortlessly migrate their decentralized applications to this more advanced platform. This compatibility not only expands the ecosystem’s functionality but also attracts a broader range of developers. These groundbreaking features have significantly fueled interest in BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, which has now amassed over $176 million and sold more than 17.7 billion BDAG coins. Priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, the presale has provided an astonishing 2380% return to early participants since its inception. With these compelling figures, BlockDAG is establishing itself as a formidable leader in the cryptocurrency arena. The Crypto Coins to Keep an Eye on as 2024 Ends! As 2024 draws to a close, the crypto landscape is marked by significant achievements and promising prospects. Cardano’s transaction surge underscores its leading position, while Stellar’s market potential continues to attract bullish forecasts. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s upcoming Keynote 3, merging cinematic storytelling with cutting-edge technology, is setting a new standard for crypto presentations. Spotlighting its innovative DAG architecture and EVM compatibility, BlockDAG remains a prominent cryptocurrency to watch into 2025.

The traffic on L2 is more than 4.5 times higher than Ethereum transactions, signaling a permanent shift to scalable chains. L2 chains, led by Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, invite more than 4.5 times the traffic of Ethereum (ETH). On the main L1 chain, transactions stabilized around 1.16M, shifting toward high-value stablecoin transfers, ETH movements, and fewer swaps or NFT activities. L2 activity growth was mostly due to the effect of Base, but other top chains provided a robust baseline of transactions. | Source: GrowThePie More of the complex transactions shifted to L2, where each chain holds a specific profile. DeFi activity and liquidity from stablecoins has accumulated to Arbitrum and a handful of top chains, drawing in users for easier DEX swaps. As a result, L2 activity has posted new records for months. On a weekly basis, L2 activity passed the 10M users milestone, with just 1.96M for Ethereum on a weekly basis. Users are active in the Ethereum Ecosystem – Last weeks stats: Over 10,000,000 Addresses interacted with 1 or more Layer 2. Over 1,960,000 Addresses interacted with Ethereum Layer 1. pic.twitter.com/eMXlz3Yyk2 — growthepie.xyz 🥧📏 (@growthepie_eth) January 6, 2025 While Base remains the leader with high-speed transactions, some of the traffic remains tied to organic DEX trading and DeFi lending on the other top L2 chains. Base also gets a boost from CbBTC traffic, while also accumulating $3.49B in value locked. Stablecoins are also one of the drivers of L2 adoption. In the first days of 2025, L2 held more than $11B in bridged or native stablecoins, where Arbitrum was the leader with $6.35B. Base was in second place, with $3.5B worth of stablecoins. The rising trend reflects the strong baseline from Arbitrum, but most of the expansion still comes from Base. The chain is among the top carriers of DeFi, through its version of Uniswap and the Aerodrome high-liquidity DEX. Arbitrum is close behind based on DeFi activity, reaching $33.6M on a daily time frame. Most L2 chains slowed down significantly after the end of their airdrop mining activity. Returning to organic traffic has been a struggle for multiple chains. Base is still not officially preparing for an airdrop, though there are still expectations for a native token in the future. L2 chains grow based on specialized activities Linea, while carrying smaller traffic, remains instrumental for L2 activity in NFT swaps and decentralized social media. Optimism serves as an all-purpose utility chain, while ZKSync Era has the biggest share of simple token transfers. Arbitrum is the biggest hub for cross-chain activity, with more than $15M on a daily basis. Overall, L2 do not communicate between chains, but rely on bridging and flows to and from Ethereum. Additionally, dozens of smaller networks aim for specialized tasks, such as gaming or a specific DEX. However, newer networks may lack liquidity, and older ones may be unwilling to become interoperable. Growing L2 traffic leads to fee and block space competition The growing traffic also makes L2 more expensive, with regular spikes in rent paid to Ethereum. While the rent is small compared to Ethereum’s block production incentives, there is a shift from the previous months of near-zero payments. To compare, Base at one point paid no more than $3,000 for its activity, while a recent spike led to $93,000 in daily rent paid to Ethereum. The increased on-chain activity means chain operators may choose how to post to Ethereum. Data shows Arbitrum switches between blobs and calldata, depending on which one is cheaper at the moment. However, this L2 activity actually takes up block space on Ethereum, making regular transactions more expensive. Ethereum transactions are still more expensive at $1.10, with regular price spikes for specialized tasks. Arbitrum retains $0.09 per transaction, though even L2 are not offering virtually free transfers. However, Arbitrum swaps can go as low as $0.27, while Ethereum DEX deals can cost $21.38 without special priority or additional block-builder payments. L2 chains retain real economic activity and the top ones show robust demand. However, the L2 narrative remained subdued. A total of 127 high-profile chains were launched, each competing for either niche or mass activity.

Here’s How High ADA Could Pump in 2025,https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-to-7-80-heres-how-high-ada-could-pump-in-2025/,"The Cardano (ADA) price looks poised to pump back to its December highs in the low $1.30s, with chart analysis painting a bullish picture for ADA’s near-term outlook. Could this be the start of a new pump that could take ADA as high as $7.80? ADA was last changing hands around $1.10, having pumped over $0.25 or over 30% since the start of the year. That pump saw the Cardano price break to the north of a downtrend in play since early December, as well as back above its 21 and 50DMAs, suggestive that the bulls have retaken control of the market. Over the last few days, the ADA rally has stalled, with the Cardano price forming a range in the $1.056-$1.118 area. But with Bitcoin (BTC) having broken back above $100,000 and seemingly carrying strong momentum, the mood in the broader crypto market looks set to remain positive ahead of the arrival of the incoming Trump administration in two weeks. Trump’s administration is the most pro-crypto in history, marking a full 180-degree reversal from the anti-crypto stance of the outgoing Biden administration. That, coupled with the start of a new pro-crypto Congressional session, means crypto markets are on the cusp of entering a new golden age. Trump’s crypto Czar, David Sacks, on Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/M6fi1Y3iiL — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) December 6, 2024 Perhaps Trump’s arrival in office might be a “sell-the-news” event. But that is still two weeks away, so its very likely altcoin markets and the Cardano price could continue to rally in the upcoming sessions. Strong Year for ADA Likely Coming Most signs suggest that this crypto bull market still has plenty of room to run. Firstly, Bitcoin only just recently entered the final and most explosive phase of its four-year cycle, which typically runs between 6-18 months of the halving (which took place last April). That, combined with rapidly rising institutional adoption and the possibility of the establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve this year, should keep the world’s largest crypto pumping in 2025. But there are also signs that altcoin season has yet to really get going this cycle, of which Cardano could be a major beneficiary. Bitcoin dominance has only just recently started to show signs that it is starting to break down after breaking below a long-term uptrend. During the 2021 bull cycle, a similar breakout was the precursor for a massive altcoin season that saw assets like Cardano post massive gains. Cardano also has a bunch of narratives that could help it pump hard if a new altcoin season is right around the corner. ADA is set to pivot to becoming a Bitcoin DeFi chain as soon as May. Meanwhile, the incoming SEC Chair may back off from the outgoing anti-crypto SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s position that ADA is an unregistered security. Moreover, it’s co-founder and biggest advocate Charles Hoskinson might secure a position in the White House as an advisor to incoming President Trump , which could help bolster Cardano’s adoption in the USA.

Looks like Cardano users see polymarket as a “nice poll” pic.twitter.com/ktjq0W60KP — 竜 SM₳UG (@SmaugPool) January 6, 2025 How High Can ADA Pump This Bull Market? Many signs thus point towards Cardano pumping hard in 2025. So how high might it go? Well, during its 2020/2021 bull run, Cardano rallied to the 2.618 Fibonacci extension beyond its 2017 record highs. If it can match the same feat during this bull run, that would imply an ADA price of around $7.80. That would mean gains of almost exactly 7x from current levels. As a result, Cardano could be great candidate for best crypto to buy now . Cardano Risks to Consider That said, potential investors need to be aware of risks to the Cardano outlook. The main one is that, despite its massive market cap of around $50 billion, Cardano has very little on-chain adoption to show for it. Its TVL of crypto in smart contracts is still yet to hit $1 billion, per DeFi Llama , and compared to its major rivals (like Ethereum or Solana), Cardano lags in terms of transaction activity and dApp activity in a big way. Crypto investors are advised not to put their eggs all in one basket (unless that basket is Bitcoin!) and should consider diversifying exposure across a few different high potential altcoin plays.

This mixed reaction highlights the uncertainty surrounding the XRP price’s ability to sustain an upward trajectory, leaving investors to weigh their options carefully. As XRP price momentum slows down, savvy investors are shifting focus to RCO Finance (RCOF), an AI altcoin emerging as a Ripple rival. With its advanced AI features and a potential of 20,000x ROI, RCO Finance is a game changer in the crypto market. XRP Price Trajectory Slows Down The XRP price is changing hands at $2.48, a 1.3% rise in the past 24 hours and a 15.8% rise in the past week. The XRP price just broke out of a falling wedge, a typical bullish signal, but the breakout closed red. The impact is that it signals the XRP price isn’t gaining momentum as expected. Analysts predict that the next key level for XRP price is $2.90, aligning with a projection of an upward spiral. But, the analysts feel that the breakout strength is still in question. If the XRP price doesn’t break out of this level, it could retract to $2.00 or even $1.47, which are the critical support levels before a stronger move. RCO Finance: Emerging AI Altcoin Targeting 20,000x ROI The XRP price movement has left investors at a crossroads, as its recent breakout for a falling wedge shows bullish momentum.

This anticipated market uptick presents an excellent opportunity for strategic investments in cryptocurrencies with significant potential. Amidst a crowded field of contenders, pinpointing top crypto coins for the 2025 bull run is vital for optimizing investment outcomes. These top cryptocurrencies are notable for their cutting-edge technologies and robust community support, positioning them to excel in the rapidly evolving blockchain environment. Notably, the Web3Bay presale is at the forefront, recognized for its potential to revolutionize decentralized ecosystems. 1. Web3Bay Presale: Pioneering Decentralization The Web3Bay presale is capturing attention with its innovative approach to blockchain-based solutions. By providing decentralized tools for both users and developers, Web3Bay aims to streamline interactions within the crypto ecosystem. The success of its presale underscores significant community engagement, and the token’s increasing use across various Web3 applications could lead to considerable gains by 2025. Currently in its third presale phase, priced at $0.0039675 with $420,000 raised, Web3Bay is projected to achieve a launch price of $0.1959, offering early investors a potential ROI of 6,430%. The token’s defined applications, from NFT integrations to decentralized finance platforms, coupled with early support from key industry influencers, position Web3Bay as one of the top crypto coins for high-growth opportunities. 2. Floki (FLOKI): Beyond a Meme Coin Floki stands out in the crypto market by melding the charm of meme coins with substantial utility. Its ecosystem spans NFT marketplaces, play-to-earn gaming platforms, and educational projects. Supported by a dynamic community and strategic promotional efforts, Floki combines entertainment with investment potential, set for further expansion in the upcoming bull run. 3. Fetch.ai (FET): Bridging AI with Blockchain Fetch.ai is a leader in merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its platform enables autonomous agents to enhance efficiency in various sectors, including supply chain, finance, and transportation. With the global rise in AI adoption, Fetch.ai’s capacity to deliver scalable and efficient solutions makes it a prime candidate for the 2025 bull run. Developments in Fetch.ai’s partnerships and ecosystem expansion are closely monitored by investors. 4. Immutable (IMX): Advancing NFT Gaming Immutable has become a significant player in NFT gaming and blockchain gaming infrastructure. Its Layer 2 scaling solution facilitates seamless NFT transactions, essential for both developers and gamers. As the gaming and metaverse sectors continue to grow, Immutable’s technology will likely play a vital role in their success. Its partnerships with prominent gaming studios and platforms further bolster its prospects for 2025. 5. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Evolving from Meme to Utility Shiba Inu has evolved from a mere meme coin to a utility-rich ecosystem supported by the Shibarium blockchain. It encompasses decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, and staking mechanisms, attracting a broad base of retail investors. Its accessible price point and active community base make it a popular choice for rapid gains during bullish periods. The 2025 bull run could propel SHIB to new heights as its ecosystem continues to mature. Why These Cryptos Are Noteworthy Robust Use Cases: Each listed cryptocurrency delivers unique advantages through its use cases in AI, gaming, or decentralized finance. Community Engagement: Projects like Floki and Shiba Inu exemplify how a strong, active community can foster growth and adoption. Potential for Appreciation: The promising presale of Web3Bay and the AI-driven capabilities of Fetch.ai highlight their potential for substantial returns, making them top crypto coins for the bull run. Portfolio Preparation Strategies Sector Diversification: Incorporate tokens from diverse sectors like gaming (Immutable), AI (Fetch.ai), and meme coins (Floki, Shiba Inu). Early Investments: Engaging in presales such as Web3Bay’s can lead to significant rewards. Continuous Monitoring: Remain informed about the latest developments, partnerships, and market trends for each project. Key Insights The 2025 crypto bull run offers substantial opportunities for gains, yet careful asset selection remains essential. Investing in Web3Bay’s presale, Fetch.ai’s AI capabilities, Floki’s vibrant ecosystem, Immutable’s gaming innovations, and Shiba Inu’s utility-focused growth stand out as top crypto coins.

After announcing late last year that it had purchased ¥1 billion worth of Bitcoins, the Japanese company is making headlines again by announcing its plans to increase its holdings to 10,000 Bitcoins. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Hit $1? Expert Calls It A Realistic Goal For 2025 – Here’s Why Metaplanet’s decision to double down on the world’s top digital asset comes during favorable political and economic conditions, with analysts expecting that Bitcoin may hit $200k soon. Currently, Metaplanet boasts 1,762 Bitcoins, worth $173.4 million, and is one of the top companies following MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investing playbook. CEO Announces Target Of 10k Bitcoins CEO Simon Gerovich shared the company’s latest investment plan in a New Year post for shareholders. In a Twitter/X post last January 5th, Gerovick acknowledged the company’s exceptional performance, where it expanded its Bitcoin holdings and solidified its standing as the region’s biggest holder of digital assets. In the lengthy message, he reiterated the company’s commitment to the asset and boosting shareholder value. Happy New Year to Our Valued Shareholders! As we step into 2025, I couldn’t be more excited about what lies ahead for Metaplanet. Last year was transformational, as we broke records, expanded our Bitcoin treasury, and reinforced our position as Asia’s leading Bitcoin Treasury… pic.twitter.com/K2HsOS8TaZ — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) January 5, 2025 Gerovick announced at least four targets for Metaplanet this year. The company’s primary target is to expand its BTC holdings to 10k Bitcoin. In addition, Metaplanet also plans to boost transparency, leverage partnerships to promote Bitcoin adoption and explore other innovative opportunities that can grow the company’s influence in the Bitcoin and blockchain niche. Investing Plans Come At A Time Of Favorable Conditions The Japanese company’s aggressive moves into the crypto space come during favorable market conditions and better price prospects. Both Bitwise and VanEck predict that Bitcoin will trade anywhere from $180k to $200k this year. They believe that the top digital asset can trade at higher price points if the US government approves the plan to adopt the strategic digital asset reserve. Other analysts are offering bolder price predictions for Bitcoin and potentially better performance from altcoins thanks to a second Trump administration. According to Gerovich, if the US government pushes with the Bitcoin strategic reserves, then others can follow suit. Metaplanet’s CEO added that Japan is one of the first countries to follow, and other Asian countries will implement the same initiative. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Reveals Bold Dogecoin Price Prediction For 2025 Starting A Movement In the same post, Gerovich describes the company’s initiative as a “movement” anchored on its commitment to excellence. He then teases his followers, saying that 2025 will be another breakout year for Metaplanet in terms of innovation, progress, and success. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings are currently the biggest in Asia and 15th among global public companies. The company first started investing in Bitcoin last year, as Bitcoin surged considerably due to increased institutional adoption.

The attackers reportedly targeted him, falsely believing he possessed an immense amount of Bitcoin. The incident has left the man and his family in a precarious situation as they move from one temporary residence to another, fearing for their safety. Crypto Forum Moderator Targeted in Bitcoin Kidnapping The alleged incident, which took place in November 2024, started when two masked people allegedly got close to the Crypto forum’s house. As per the statement , the suspects escaped from the scene after the man closed the door on them. A few days later, the victim saw the masked men in an unmarked vehicle near his house while he was taking his child to daycare. The suspects are said to have followed the man onto a main road. When the situation worsened, he was on the phone with the police when the suspect vehicle turned and three of its occupants escaped on foot. Shortly after, the driver of the vehicle reportedly came out and confronted the victim, and another suspect brandished a firearm. The man stated that he used bear spray as a way of protecting himself from the suspects until the police came in to arrest the duo. Claims of Torture Equipment Discovered In the report, the Crypto forum moderator stated that the suspects intended to kidnap and torture him in order to get his cryptocurrency. The police investigations suggested that the attackers thought he had 2.5 million Bitcoins worth billions of dollars because he was a moderator of a cryptocurrency Facebook group. ‘The guys had equipment to torture me,’ the man said to La Presse. They had a tarp with a hole in the middle and claws to cut off a limb and stop the bleeding. It’s incredibly violent.” The victim claimed that his actual BTC investment was $10,000 which is like 0.1 of a Bitcoin as per current price. Suspects Released on House Arrest Four suspects, two of which are adults and two are juveniles, were taken into custody in relation to the event. The adults are to be charged with conspiracy to kidnap and use of prohibited firearms. However, all these four suspects were released on house arrest to await their trial that is set to commence in March. The release of the suspects has been a matter of concern to the family of the Crypto forum moderator since there is a possibility of their attack. The family was told by the authorities that they should move away from the area saying that the suspects could be linked to organised crime. The family has since been transferring from one short term lease house to another in an effort to flee any danger. A representative of Quebec’s provincial police, Sûreté du Québec stated that although the police offer guidance to victims, they cannot offer round the clock protection. ”We do not advise people to change their address but it is one of the measures we are considering, the other ones are to change the locks or to install cameras and alarms,” the spokesperson said. Despite this, the victim has expressed frustration over the suspects’ release, stating it has forced his family into hiding. “The police told us they can’t ensure our safety,” he said, adding that his family has been burning through their savings to stay safe. The man also revealed that the Youth Protection Department (DPJ) became involved after rumors of the incident spread at his children’s school.

From quirky characters to wild community-driven hype, these coins are about fun, innovation, and serious profits. Today, we’re diving into three of the best new meme coins to join now: BTFD Coin , Dogs, and Pudgy Penguins. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or someone just getting your feet wet, these coins capture attention for all the right reasons. The rise of meme coins has been nothing short of spectacular. They started as jokes but have become legitimate investment opportunities with massive communities. Coins like Dogecoin paved the way, showing that humour and community spirit can have a real monetary value. Now, BTFD Coin is leading the next wave, combining meme magic with robust financial benefits like a 90% APY on staking . Let’s talk about BTFD Coin—it’s a game-changer. Its presale has already raised over $5 million and is only just starting. Meanwhile, Dogs and Pudgy Penguins are creating their own buzz, proving that the meme coin craze is far from over. Keep reading to find out why these coins are worth your attention. BTFD Coin: Staking Your Way to Unmatched Gains BTFD Coin is shaking up the meme coin market with a killer mix of humor and real financial perks. Forget about coins that only make you laugh; this one’s stacking up real gains. If you haven’t heard, the presale is in its 13th stage , with the coin priced at $0.000142. Over 62 billion BTFD coins have been sold to 7,700+ holders, and there’s no slowing down. The standout feature? That 90% APY on staking. Imagine earning nearly double your investment by simply staking your coins. Crypto enthusiasts are flocking to this project because it offers a rare way to blend the meme coin hype with serious long-term rewards. Analysts predict BTFD Coin could skyrocket once it hits major exchanges, and the current presale price might seem like peanuts compared to its future value. You put $1,000 into BTFD Coin during its current presale at $0.000142 per coin. That gives you roughly 7,042,254 coins. Imagine the price skyrocketing to $0.0006 after the presale—a totally realistic possibility considering the coin’s momentum and the buzz driving it. Dogs: Man’s Best Friend, Now Crypto’s Best Bet Dogs are stealing the spotlight in the meme coin universe. Whether you’re talking about loyalty, cuteness, or viral potential, this coin has all the elements to charm its way into your wallet. Dogs, inspired by our four-legged companions, combines heartwarming branding with community-driven momentum. Its recent social media campaigns have exploded, pushing the coin’s value higher. Recent developments have further solidified Dogs’ position in the crypto market. In August 2024, Dogs was listed on Binance’s Launchpool, significantly boosting its trading volume and market visibility. This listing allowed users to stake their Binance Coin (BNB) and other tokens to farm Dogs, increasing accessibility and driving adoption. Although its price reached an all-time high of $0.001633, it has since stabilised around $0.000565 as of January 2025, reflecting broader market trends. The Dogs project continues to focus on community engagement, leveraging social media platforms to build a loyal following. Its upcoming plans for NFT collaborations and charitable donations to animal shelters highlight its commitment to making an impact beyond just financial gains. This combination of utility and heartwarming branding sets Dogs apart in a crowded field. Imagine waking up one morning to see your Dogs investment doubling or tripling. It’s happened with other meme coins, and there’s no reason Dogs can’t follow suit. The buzz is real, and the community support is massive. If you’re a dog lover with a penchant for smart investments, Dogs might be your perfect match. Pudgy Penguins: The Coolest Meme Coin on Ice Pudgy Penguins has become a standout in the meme coin space, combining charm and bold strategy to capture the public’s imagination. The project’s native token, PENGU, has grown 13% on January 5 and marked a staggering 250% increase since its December 17 launch. Trading at $0.040 with a market cap of $2.5 billion, PENGU is a testament to the power of a well-executed meme coin. But it’s not just the numbers grabbing attention. Pudgy Penguins’ marketing strategies are breaking new ground. With over 1.1 billion GIF and sticker views in just the first five days of January, the project’s viral campaigns on Instagram and TikTok have helped propel it to new heights. The team’s approach—leveraging humour, nostalgia, and community spirit—has made Pudgy Penguins a household name in the crypto world. Despite the buzz, some large holders are cashing out, taking advantage of the rally. On January 4, a wallet withdrew 84 million PENGU tokens, worth $3.13 million, from Binance. Meanwhile, NFT sales have dipped by 52% in the past week, reflecting a broader cooling trend. Still, Pudgy Penguins remains the second-largest NFT collection by market cap at $721 million, trailing only CryptoPunks. Looking ahead, PENGU is poised for further growth. Operating on Solana, with plans to expand to Ethereum and Abstract, an Ethereum layer-2 solution, the token’s potential use cases include governance and access to exclusive ecosystem perks. With a total supply of 88.88 billion tokens, 25.9% of which are allocated to NFT holders via airdrops, Pudgy Penguins continues to innovate and capture attention. PENGU’s blend of utility and charm makes it one of the best new meme coins to join now. Whether you’re drawn by its viral marketing, NFT pedigree, or long-term potential, Pudgy Penguins is a project worth watching. Conclusion: The Time to Join is Now BTFD Coin, Dogs, and Pudgy Penguins are hands down the best new meme coins to join now. Each offers something unique—whether it’s BTFD’s incredible 90% APY on staking, Dogs’ charitable edge, or Pudgy Penguins’ metaverse dreams.

The token’s delay, which at first was attributed to the fundraising, such as the $12 million venture capital round in April 2024 for the Layer-3 privacy blockchain, created some confusion. However, the Shiba Inu team has recently announced that the token will not be launched to the public before January 14. Despite the official confirmation, misinformation has been circulating. A user known as CryptoMumms posted that the TREAT token had already been launched in January of 2023. This claim and the fake TREAT token have led to a lot of confusion among the Shiba Inu community. Treat did not stealth launch years ago. This simply isn't true. — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) January 5, 2025 This fake token is currently operating on ShibaSwap through the wallet contract address “0xFBD…146B” and has been misleading people about its existence. DEXTools shows that its market capitalization is $2.86 million; however, the Shiba Inu team has confirmed that this is not the real TREAT token. Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous leader of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, also addressed these allegations in public. He pointed out that TREAT has not been launched and asked the community not to interact with this fake token. On X, Kusama posted a video that was quite comedic in nature and showed how pointless the entire thing was. He further backed up the message with a caution to avoid falling for such narratives. TREAT’s role in Shiba Inu’s ecosystem The TREAT token is essential for Shiba Inu’s vision of becoming fully decentralized. After its launch, it will enable governance, rewards, and real-world use within the ecosystem. Kusama said that the token is a “capstone and key” to Shiba Inu’s future and plans to explain the details in his weekly podcast. TREAT will also support WOOF Wars: Farming 2.0, a sophisticated yield farming system where users will be able to increase their profits. Using veTREAT (vote escrowed TREAT), holders will be able to participate in the governance process. While liquidity providers will get extra rewards. This system is meant to enhance the decentralization of the Shiba Inu network so that its holders can decide on the future of the coin. Besides governance, TREAT will be incorporated into SHIB Pay, an on-chain payment system. This will allow users to make payments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem without involving conventional processors and with the help of blockchain verification. The Shiba Inu team has revealed that TREAT will be instrumental in the future of the crypto-commerce revolution. As of the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002401, a 1% uptrend in the last 24 hours. The token has risen by nearly 10% since the beginning of the year. The Shiba Inu has four tokens in its ecosystem: SHIB, LEASH, BONE, and TREAT.

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 00:33:00

The report also shared that Bitcoin still dominated the crypto exchange-traded funds, accounting for about $573 million of the Bitcoin assets under management in global ETP s . Butterfield further noted in the report that global crypto ETPs recorded about $44.4 billion in net inflows in 2024. CoinShares explained that Bitcoin ETPs dominated the digital asset investment products markets in 2024, accounting for about 29% and $38 billion of all BTC assets under management in global ETPs. Ethereum ETPs came in second, accounting for about $4.5 billion of global crypto ETP inflows last year, accounting for about 26% of all Ethereum assets under management global ETPs. The value was also about 60x more than Ethereum inflows recorded in the ETPs in 2023 and 2.4x more than what was recorded in 2021. Other altcoins registered net inflows of $813 million in 2024, accounting for 18% of all non-ETH altcoin assets under management in crypto investment products. Solana was among the top coins among the other altcoins, recording a $69 million inflow in 2024 and 4% of its total assets under management. The total inflows recorded in 2024 increased above the all-time high experienced in the 2021 bull market. Global crypto investment products reached over $10 billion in net inflows in 2021. The 2024 statistics indicate an over 4x increase compared to the 2021 values. U.S. spot ETFs contribute to the 2024 surge 2024 saw US$44bn inflows in to crypto ETPs, 2025 off to a good start with US$585m inflows so far https://t.co/OczGDBUdph — James Butterfill (@jbutterfill) January 6, 2025 Butterfield attributed the surge in 2024’s global crypto investment products net inflows to the introduction of spot ETFs in the U.S. in January 2024. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 10 and 8 Ether spot ETFs on May 22. The Bitcoin ETFs have accounted for a greater percentage of the inflows recorded since their introduction in 2024. The report highlighted that inflows recorded by digital asset investment products were solely from U.S.-based spot ETFs. The CoinShares head of research explained that the surge in U.S. spot ETFs indicates the products’ impact on other crypto investment products. Butterfield also revealed that the ETFs would change the path crypto investment flows took in the future. The asset management firm’s executive also touched on the recent resurgence seen by Ethereum ETFs at the end of 2024. The ETFs had seen significant outflows before rebounding within the last days of the year. Butterfield suggested that the recovery indicated ETH’s evolution in the digital assets market. CoinShares’ statistics for this year’s net flows indicate that U.S. spot ETFs are still the top performers in the ETP industry. The report also showed that Australia and Switzerland are still showing promise, with about $1.1 million and $8.4 million in inflows, respectively. Galaxy Digital expects U.S. Bitcoin spot ETPs to hit $250 billion in 2025 A Galaxy Digital report from December 31, 2024, predicted the possible trajectory of U.S. spot ETPs in 2025. The report suggested that the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETPs would hit $250 billion in assets under management in 2025. Alex Thorne, Head of Firmwide Research, highlighted in the report that the ETPs were about 19% and $24 billion away from reaching the U.S. gold ETPs. Throne also predicted that Bitcoin would be among the top-performing assets this year. The head of Firmwide Research revealed that the coin remained one of the top 3 performers on a risk-adjusted basis. Thorne further mentioned that his predictions were based on 2024’s Bitcoin and BTC ETPs performances. Another analyst, Christine Kim, revealed that Ether spot ETPs would also likely surge in 2025. According to Kim, the ETPs might get the opportunity to stake some of their Ether for investors. The analyst suggested that the development would come due to possible regulatory changes under Donald Trump’s administration.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 306,000 followers on the social media platform X that DOGE appears to be in the early stages of a new five-wave rally on the 12-hour chart. The trader follows Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave surge before entering an ABC-wave correction. Says Bluntz, “Monster DOGE move overnight, now looking undeniably impulsive again, in my opinion. The move back up to fresh highs above $0.50 is probably underway.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Dogecoin will hit prices above $0.60 before its fifth-wave rally comes to a close. The analyst is also keeping an eye on the Dogecoin versus Bitcoin (DOGE/ BTC ) trading pair. Bluntz says the chart tells him that DOGE will outperform BTC before the bull market expires. “DOGE/BTC ratio is basically still accumulating. There is not a snowball’s chance in hell this isn’t going significantly higher by the end of the cycle.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.379. As for Ethereum, Bluntz says ETH looks bullish on both the USD and BTC trading pairs. According to the analyst, Ethereum may be flashing signals suggesting that its relative underperformance is now a thing of the past. “Solid two-week range breakout on ETH here with a nice higher low being put in on ETH/BTC high timeframe. Clowning on ETH is easy and fun until it isn’t.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $3,618.

However, as XRP establishes itself in the crypto market, other projects like Stellar (XLM) and the nascent RCO Finance (RCOF) are beginning to mirror this success, offering potentially lucrative alternatives for those looking to diversify their investment portfolios beyond XRP. Stellar (XLM) Mirrors XRP Price Amid Shared Focus The trajectory of both XRP and Stellar (XLM) has been fascinating, especially in the context of their shared focus on facilitating fast, cost-effective cross-border payments. XRP, having navigated through regulatory challenges, saw a robust recovery in 2024, with its price climbing due to increased adoption and partnerships with financial institutions. This trend has not only solidified XRP’s position but has also paved the way for other blockchain solutions like Stellar to gain traction. Stellar, with its mission to democratize financial services globally, is showing similar patterns of growth. After a period of consolidation, Stellar’s XLM has started to see upward momentum, driven by strategic partnerships and the expansion of its network’s capabilities. Analysts suggest that this momentum could be a precursor to XLM catching up with XRP’s price performance, as both cater to similar use cases in the financial sector but with nuanced approaches towards inclusivity and transaction speed. RCO Finance Presale on the Brink of Completion RCO Finance (RCOF) , entering the crypto scene with its AI-powered financial platform, is currently in the fourth stage of its presale , with only one stage remaining before the token is listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. The presale has already seen the RCOF token price jump by 509% from its initial price to $0.07770, indicating strong investor interest and confidence in its future prospects. This surge reflects the market’s anticipation of RCO Finance’s potential to replicate the success of established projects like Ripple’s XRP. As the presale concludes, the token price is expected to rise by another 175% to $0.21420 in the bonus round, setting the stage for a listing price between $0.4 and $0.6. This trajectory suggests that early investors could see significant returns if the project delivers on its promises. The Innovative Features Poised to Send RCOF’s Value to the Moon The excitement around RCO Finance (RCOF) doesn’t just stem from its presale performance but is deeply rooted in the innovative features of its upcoming RCO Finance platform. RCO Finance aims to revolutionize investment by providing an AI-driven Robo Advisor that tailors investment strategies to individual user profiles, analyzing market data in real time to optimize portfolios. This level of personalization and automation is expected to drive the RCOF price upwards once the platform launches. Moreover, RCO Finance will offer access to over 120,000 assets across various classes, including tokenized real-world assets, which opens up investment opportunities previously inaccessible to many. In addition, the platform boosts a no-KYC policy, which further enhances user privacy, making it appealing to those prioritizing anonymity in financial dealings. Additionally, the security is bolstered by the fact that the smart contract has already been audited by SolidProof , ensuring that potential vulnerabilities are addressed before the platform’s full release. This blend of innovation, security, and user-centric features positions RCO Finance to potentially soar in value, offering a compelling alternative to XRP for those looking for the next big wave in cryptocurrency investments. In sum, while XRP continues to lead in the cross-border payment space, Stellar (XLM) and RCO Finance (RCOF) are not far behind, each carving out their niche with unique offerings that could very well mirror, if not exceed, the gains seen in Ripple’s 2024 rally.

This phase introduces an upgraded staking web app and focuses on testing new functionalities within the Babylon Proof-of-Stake chain. The testnet emphasizes interoperability and collaboration among key protocol participants. Key Features of The Babylon Phase-2 Testnet According to a recent blog post , the Babylon Phase-2 testnet will include a Proof-of-Stake chain secured by both Bitcoin PoS stakes and Signet Bitcoin stakes. This will incorporate both existing stakes from Phase-1 and newly created ones. Participants can register their Phase-1 stakes using the upgraded staking web app, which goes live at 10 AM UTC on January 8. The new testnet will allow developers, stakers, and other participants explore the registration of Phase-1 Signet Bitcoin stakes for Phase-2 operations. The testnet encourages collaboration among stakers, wallets, and developers by supporting the deployment of permissionless smart contracts. However, the tokens involved in this testnet are simulated and hold no monetary value. Moreover, it is important to note that BOB recently integrated with Babylon to leverage Bitcoin finality for securing transactions. This integration uses Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to enhance Bitcoin liquidity in DeFi while retaining the robust security of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Faucets and Testnet Participation To enable participation, the Bitcoin staking network has provided testnet faucets for acquiring the necessary funds. The faucets will distribute test Signet Bitcoin and tBABY tokens after the testnet launch. Signet Bitcoin, available through the Discord and OKX faucets, will be used for creating new stakes. Similarly, the Discord faucet will distribute 0.3 tBABY tokens per address weekly. Additionally, the staking app enables migration of Phase-1 stakes to the Phase-2 testnet. New stakes can also be created, and the app provides fast unbonding times of approximately 16-17 hours. Staking and Validation in The Bitcoin PoS Testnet Participants in the Babylon Phase-2 testnet include stakers, finality providers, CometBFT validators, and wallets. Stakers can register stakes through the staking app or CLI tools, while finality providers ensure network security by casting finality votes. CometBFT validators participate in block production, contributing to the consensus mechanism of the Bitcoin PoS chain. In addition, stake limits for Phase-2 have been established to prevent spam and manage stake flow. Transactions require a minimum stake of 0.0005 Signet Bitcoin, with a maximum stake of 350 Signet Bitcoin per transaction. The active set size for finality providers and CometBFT validators is capped at 100 slots each.

Here’s why this could be good for the rally. Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment Has Remained Negative Recently As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment still has a red value. The “Weighted Sentiment” here refers to an indicator from the analytics firm Santiment that tells us about the dominant sentiment related to a given asset that’s present on the major social media platforms. This metric is based on two other indicators: Sentiment Balance and Social Volume. The first of these, the Sentiment Balance, calculates the net sentiment present on social media. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Make $1.08 Billion Net DOGE Purchase It works by putting the various posts/messages/threads through a machine-learning model to differentiate between positive and negative posts. Then, it takes the two counts and subtracts them to determine the net market situation. While the Sentiment Balance does provide a rough overview of social media, it may not always be the best representation of the majority of the users, as all it can do is take into account the data of the posts currently present. That is, it only says about the sentiment of the active users, regardless of whether they are actually a minority by count. To mitigate this problem and achieve more accuracy, the Weighted Sentiment incorporates the second element: the Social Volume. This indicator measures the total unique number of posts on social media that mention the cryptocurrency. Thus, by weighting the Sentiment Balance by this metric, the Weighted Sentiment ensures that its value only registers a spike (in either direction) when there is both a significant tendency towards one sentiment and a large number of users voicing said sentiment. Now, here is the chart for the Weighted Sentiment for Dogecoin shared by the analyst that shows the trend in its value over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment turned negative in December as the meme coin’s bull rally hit an obstacle, and its price reversed to the downside. The negative sentiment hasn’t changed in 2025 so far, but interestingly, the trend in the price has. Over the past week, the asset has seen a recovery rally of more than 20%. The continued bearish sentiment would imply this run hasn’t been enough to change the opinion of social media users yet. Historically, digital assets have tended to move in a way that’s opposite to the expectations of the majority. From the chart, it’s apparent that Dogecoin’s tops in November were accompanied by sharp positive spikes in the Weighted Sentiment.

Therefore, considering that the traders are pessimistic towards DOGE right now, chances may be that this latest rally could have further room to run before encountering a wall. DOGE Price Following its recovery during the last few days, Dogecoin has seen its value climb to the $387 mark.

Speaking during a recent interview, Garlinghouse cited the company’s substantial holdings of XRP, now valued at over $100 billion, as a key factor altering Ripple’s valuation outlook. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Calls $11B Valuation Outdated According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse the company now has more than $100 billion worth of XRP tokens. This development changes the valuation proposition of the blockchain infrastructure company dramatically. The CEO noted that Ripple’s trading in private markets has been much cheaper to the net asset value of the company than other companies that are linked to cryptocurrencies such as MicroStrategy. “The total value of the XRP we hold is now greater than $100 billion,” said Garlinghouse. He also compared Ripple’s valuation metrics with MicroStrategy noting that the latter trades at a premium to its assets. ”Ripple has been trading in the private markets at a discount while MicroStrategy has trading at 3x premium to its net asset value,” he said. Ripple was last valued at $11 billion in early 2024 when the company bought back $300 million worth of shares. Nevertheless, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that such an estimate is no longer relevant to the current financial position of Ripple, thanks to the increasing XRP price and institutional adoption. XRP Price Growth Attracts Attention Amid Market Trends XRP price has also seen a significant rise in value, it has risen five times its value before the election periods in late 2024. Ripple’s token has had increased liquidity and trading volume, sometimes even outperforming Bitcoin, as per data from FalconX. This upsurge is in line with other developments within the cryptocurrency market such as the high probability of a crypto ETF launch and debate on a U.S. based blockchain reserve. Crypto analyst Peter Brandt noted in his recent analysis of XRP’s technical chart that if the current bullish flag pattern would be fulfilled, XRP market cap may hit $500 billion. Furthermore, the SuperTrend indicator has just turned bullish on the XRP 12-hour chart for the first time in several months. Analyst Ali Charts pointed out that “The last time the SuperTrend indicator changed direction to the bullish side, XRP rose by 470%.” Ripple CEO Stance on Company Strategic Focus Although XRP is gaining popularity in the market, Ripple’s main business is still centered on offering blockchain technologies to financial companies. In the interview, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse restated his company’s focus on the B2B sector including banks, payment providers, and corporates, where Ripple is offering solutions like custody and cross-border payments. Recently, Ripple announced that it would launch its stablecoin called Ripple USD (RLUSD) with the license from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Garlinghouse stressed that the RLUSD will leverage XRP rather than replace it, increasing its liquidity, and opening more possibilities for the utilization of Ripple’s DEX and automated market maker (AMM) functionalities. The acquisition of Switzerland-based custody firm Metaco which was completed about 18 months ago has also put Ripple in a vantage position to offer its institutional products. The CEO was upbeat on the increased demand of the company’s custody services especially from Tier 1 banks. Changing Regulatory Environment Fuels Optimism Ripple’s growth has been supported by changing perceptions in the legal environment. Garlinghouse claimed that the previous several months marked a ‘turning point’ due to the exit of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and the chance for regulatory certainty under the new administration. As a result of the recent changes in the US government’s stance with regard to cryptocurrency innovation, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said, “The winds have changed.” Recently, he also stated that 95% of Ripple’s customers are outside the United States, but he expects the interest to return in the United States in the next few months.

The market’s buzzing with options, but picking the right project isn’t always easy. Qubetics ($TICS) , Kaspa, and Stacks are catching the attention of investors, each offering something fresh. Whether you’re drawn to blockchain development, fast transactions, or Bitcoin-powered smart contracts, there’s plenty to unpack. Qubetics is stepping in to tackle some of the pain points in Web3, creating smoother paths for developers and businesses. While many platforms offer blockchain tools, Qubetics’ approach brings everything under one roof, making development and integration less complicated. With its presale in full swing, $TICS might be worth keeping on your radar as the project moves closer to launch. Qubetics is Transforming Blockchain Development with QubeQode If you’ve been curious about blockchain but felt like the tech was too complex, Qubetics is the kind of project that flips that idea on its head. The QubeQode IDE makes it easier for anyone—whether you’re a developer or a business owner—to create blockchain applications without getting tangled up in code. Picture someone running a small online store. They could use QubeQode to add blockchain-based payment methods or authentication systems to their site without needing to hire an expert. This type of accessibility opens the door for more businesses to step into Web3, even if they don’t have the technical know-how. For larger companies, QubeQode offers ready-made tools to build advanced applications. Imagine a logistics firm wanting to use blockchain for tracking shipments. Instead of spending months developing custom software, they can leverage QubeQode’s drag-and-drop components to streamline the process. This platform isn’t just about coding—it’s about simplifying the way blockchain fits into real-world operations. On top of that, Qubetics recently announced its partnership with SWFT Blockchain to introduce a new wallet that could shake things up. This wallet will enable cross-chain transactions at lightning speed, letting users move assets seamlessly between different blockchains. Whether you’re a casual user trading crypto or a large organization managing multiple tokens, this kind of functionality could make a significant difference. Right now, Qubetics is in its 16th presale stage, and $TICS tokens are selling at $0.0455. Over 404 million tokens have already been purchased, pushing the tally beyond $8.9 million with more than 13,500 investors on board. The presale moves fast—every seven days, the price jumps by 10% as each stage ends. Analysts are projecting $TICS to hit $0.25 by the time the presale wraps up, which could lead to a 448.60% return. If $TICS hits $1, you’re looking at a 2094.42% ROI, and if things really heat up and it reaches $10 after the mainnet launch, the potential return could skyrocket to over 21844.27%. To break it down, if you invested $8.6 million today, the returns could multiply significantly depending on where $TICS lands. If you’re curious about what Qubetics brings to the table, check out the project video here . Kaspa is Winning Attention With its High-Speed, Scalable Blockchain Kaspa has been generating buzz lately for good reason. The project’s proof-of-work consensus, powered by the GHOSTDAG protocol, delivers high block rates and near-instant transaction confirmations. Unlike older blockchains that process one block at a time, Kaspa’s structure allows parallel blocks, making everything faster without compromising security. This scalability is turning heads among investors looking for tech that can keep up with growing demand. Analyst Alex Clay recently highlighted Kaspa’s strong performance, pointing out over a year of price accumulation and retracement, signaling potential growth. According to reports, whales are eyeing Kaspa as it continues to climb. This steady growth isn’t just hype—it’s backed by solid fundamentals that show Kaspa could be positioned for further gains. Kaspa’s fair launch model, with no pre-mining or early allocations, adds to its appeal for investors who prefer a level playing field. Right now, its circulating supply stands at about 25.48 billion KAS, with a cap set at 28.7 billion. This open, transparent approach has been key in building trust within the community. Kaspa’s developers frequently engage with their audience, keeping everyone in the loop on updates and improvements. Stacks is Bringing Smart Contracts to Bitcoin Stacks takes a different route by layering smart contracts on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. For years, Bitcoin has been the gold standard in crypto, but it lacked the flexibility of platforms like Ethereum that support decentralized applications. Stacks changes that by connecting directly to Bitcoin’s security, making it possible to build dApps while benefiting from Bitcoin’s robust network. The recent Nakamoto upgrade has made Stacks even faster and more secure. This upgrade enhances the platform’s speed, making it a more attractive option for developers. As a result, Stacks has been outperforming many cryptos on the market, reflecting the growing demand for Bitcoin layer-2 solutions. If you’ve been tracking STX, you’ve probably noticed its positive price movement, which speaks to increasing investor confidence. One thing developers love about Stacks is its Clarity programming language. Clarity prioritizes security and allows developers to write predictable, verifiable smart contracts—something that’s crucial in preventing bugs or vulnerabilities. This feature makes Stacks a go-to for projects that need bulletproof reliability while building within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Looking At Top Cryptos To Invest In This Year Whether you’re intrigued by Qubetics and its ambitious Web3 development platform, Kaspa’s lightning-fast blockchain, or Stacks’ innovative use of Bitcoin smart contracts, each of these projects offers a solid reason to pay attention. Qubetics is already capturing significant investment, Kaspa continues to gain traction with its high-speed performance, and Stacks is showing just how far Bitcoin can stretch with added functionality. If you’re serious about finding top cryptos to invest in this year , these three deserve a closer look.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 01:52:00

Today, on January 7, 2024, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (formerly Twitter) and made a bold prediction for XRP. Expert Says Buy Signal for XRP In a post, the expert noted that the last time a technical indicator named Supertrend flipped to bullish on the 12-hour time frame, XRP skyrocketed by 470%. Now, the altcoin has once again flipped bullish and flashing buy signal. This post on X is gaining widespread attention from crypto enthusiasts across the globe, as they are expecting a similar kind of rally this time as well.

At press time, XRP is trading near $2.41 and has experienced a modest price surge of 0.81% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped 10%, indicating a rise in participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. XRP Price Action and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP has been consolidating in a tight range between $2.37 and $2.46 for the last five days, following the breakout of a bullish pennant pattern on the daily time frame. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if XRP breaches this consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $2.48 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 85% to reach the $4.54 level in the future. Investors and Traders Rising Interest As of now, traders and long-term holders seem more interested in the altcoin, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Source: Coinglass Data from spot inflow/outflow revealed that during the same consolidation period, exchanges witnessed an outflow of a significant $38.02 million worth of XRP.

After examining technical indicators and historical trends, analysts are pointing to a possible surge in Cardano’s price to $4 in the near term. Meanwhile, the presale market is compelling as a promising Cardano rival, RCO FInance (RCOF) , is showing potential for an extraordinary leap from $0.077 to $5. This rising contender has captured investor attention, fueling anticipation for substantial returns as it continues its upward trajectory. Cardano Price Eyes $4 Amid Renewed Bullish Sentiment The Cardano price continues to outperform its peers, establishing itself as a leader in the DeFi market. Over the past year, ADA has surged 72.2%, with a notable 13.1% increase in daily charts and 21.8% weekly gains. Despite a minor pullback in December 2024, investor sentiment around the Cardano price has rebounded sharply.

Meanwhile, Solana continues to lead the charge in processing speed and efficiency, making it the platform of choice for DeFi and NFT initiatives. Web3Bay: Redefining E-Commerce with Decentralization Web3Bay is boldly stepping forward to reshape global e-commerce by creating a decentralized marketplace that fundamentally changes how buyers and sellers connect. Unlike conventional platforms burdened by intermediaries and high fees, Web3Bay removes these barriers, facilitating direct interactions with enhanced transparency and security, thanks to blockchain technology. What sets Web3Bay apart is its inclusive payment model that supports both crypto and traditional payment methods like PayPal. This innovative approach not only caters to crypto enthusiasts but also welcomes a wider audience, bridging the divide between conventional and digital commerce. For merchants in less accessible regions, this platform opens up a world of opportunity, providing them access to global markets without traditional constraints. In its second presale stage, Web3Bay has already raised over $420,000 and sold 110 million tokens at $0.0036975 each.

Ethereum: Gearing Up for a Breakout Year Ethereum continues to dominate the smart contract and decentralized application space, with signs strongly pointing to a breakout year in 2025. Currently, Ethereum’s price action is consolidating, indicating a potentially significant upcoming movement. With its price hovering around $3,519 and showing strong support, predictions suggest it could soar to $4,022 or higher. The anticipated surge in Ethereum’s market value is supported by its ongoing advancements, notably its shift to a Proof of Stake model, which enhances both scalability and energy efficiency. These improvements make Ethereum increasingly attractive to a broader range of institutional investors and secure its position as the foundational platform for numerous DeFi and NFT projects. Solana: Pioneering Speed in the Blockchain World Solana has set a new standard in the blockchain community for its incredible transaction speeds and minimal fees. Its distinct Proof of History consensus mechanism allows for processing thousands of transactions per second, making it an ideal solution for widespread adoption. Solana’s ability to handle immense transaction volumes effectively is evidenced by its recent achievement of processing over 72 million transactions in a single day. This capability, combined with a robust and active developer community, solidifies its position as a critical solution for developers seeking scalability without sacrificing speed. Summing Up Looking ahead to 2025, Web3Bay, Ethereum, and Solana each stand out with their unique capabilities to transform and dominate their sectors. Web3Bay is set to revolutionize the e-commerce landscape, providing a decentralized platform that offers unmatched control and opportunities to its users. Ethereum looks to continue leading the smart contract space with significant technological advancements, while Solana is poised to remain a top choice for developers needing high-speed and scalable blockchain solutions. These projects underscore the diverse and dynamic nature of blockchain technology, each offering unique opportunities for growth and innovation. For investors and tech enthusiasts alike, these best crypto coins present not just investment opportunities but a chance to be part of a transformative movement in the digital world.

According to crypto service provider Matrixport , these changes do not necessarily signal a bearish turn in the cryptocurrency market. In a recent X post , Matrixport emphasized the importance of stablecoin performance as a key market indicator. While such trends often correlate with market corrections, the firm suggests that Tether’s decline may simply reflect a seasonal downturn tied to the Christmas holidays , rather than a shift toward bearish sentiment. Stablecoins as Market Indicators Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) play a vital role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, often serving as a bridge between fiat currencies and digital assets. Key Metrics to Watch Market Capitalization Growth : Rising market cap typically indicates an influx of fiat money into crypto markets, supporting bullish momentum. Trading Volume : Increased volume suggests heightened market activity and strong demand for digital assets. When Trends Reverse Declines in these metrics can indicate reduced market activity and potential corrections, as investors withdraw funds or reduce exposure to risk. Matrixport’s Analysis of Tether’s Decline Current Trends Market Cap Drop : Tether’s market cap has seen a decline, raising concerns about potential market corrections. Volume Decline : Trading volumes have similarly dipped, a trend often associated with reduced investor activity. Matrixport’s Perspective Seasonal Factors : The firm attributes the decline to seasonal factors , particularly the slowdown during the Christmas and New Year holidays. Not Necessarily Bearish : Matrixport believes it is too early to conclude that the market has turned bearish based solely on Tether’s recent performance. Implications for the Crypto Market Potential Scenarios Seasonal Downturn : If Matrixport’s assessment holds, the market may rebound as trading activity picks up post-holiday season. Bearish Signal : A prolonged decline in Tether’s market cap and volume could eventually signal reduced liquidity and a shift toward a bearish trend. Role of Stablecoins in Market Sentiment Stablecoins often serve as a barometer for overall market health, making their performance critical to understanding broader trends. What Investors Should Watch 1. Tether’s Market Cap Recovery A rebound in Tether’s market cap would likely indicate renewed fiat inflows and bullish sentiment. 2. Stablecoin Trading Volume Increased trading volumes, especially for USDT, suggest heightened market activity and investor confidence. 3. Broader Market Indicators Key metrics such as Bitcoin’s price action , altcoin performance , and on-chain activity will provide additional context to Tether’s trends. FAQs What does Tether’s market cap decline indicate? A decline in Tether’s market cap could suggest reduced fiat inflows into the crypto market, often signaling potential corrections. However, Matrixport attributes this to seasonal factors rather than a bearish turn. Why is Tether important for the crypto market? Tether serves as a bridge between fiat currencies and digital assets, making its market cap and trading volume critical indicators of overall market sentiment. Is the crypto market turning bearish? Matrixport believes it is too early to conclude that the market is bearish based solely on Tether’s recent trends, attributing the changes to holiday seasonality. What should investors monitor in the coming weeks? Investors should track Tether’s market cap and trading volume for signs of recovery, along with broader crypto market trends like Bitcoin price movements. Conclusion Tether’s recent decline in market cap and trading volume has sparked concerns about potential market corrections. However, Matrixport suggests these changes are more likely tied to seasonal factors than a fundamental shift in market sentiment. As the holiday season concludes, all eyes will be on Tether’s performance and broader market indicators to determine whether the crypto market’s bullish momentum will continue.

BlockDAG is on track for rapid growth within the memecoin arena, attracting proactive traders looking to capitalize on what might be the major breakthrough of 2025. Growth Signals Emanate from Fantom Network The Fantom network is experiencing a boost in activity, suggesting a hopeful recovery.

Latest Insights on TRX Price Prediction & ADA Market Analysis,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-stirs-excitement-with-usdt-rewards-up-to-10-latest-insights-on-trx-price-prediction-ada-market-analysis/,"Identifying the top crypto to buy in 2025 is increasingly crucial for those looking for substantial growth, with Cardano, Tron, and BlockDAG standing out as frontrunners. Recent Cardano price predictions signal a mix of hope and realism, with ADA’s future being molded by ongoing tech developments and market changes. In contrast, Tron market analysis shows a complex picture, with TRX poised on the brink of either significant gains or setbacks. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) captures attention with its Refer and Earn USDT program, which allows for instant cashback of 6% to 10% with no limit to earnings. This unique offer provides a compelling opportunity to benefit from BlockDAG’s unprecedented $176 million presale. TRON Market Outlook: Uncertainty Ahead for TRX The latest TRON market analysis paints a picture of uncertainty with TRX currently priced around $0.2587 as of December 30, 2024, experiencing a slight drop of 1.51% from the day before. Analysts are split, suggesting TRX could either drop to the $0.15 support in tough market conditions or climb to $0.40, supported by favorable economic trends such as potential Federal Reserve rate reductions. Despite high transaction volumes, these have not markedly impacted TRX’s pricing yet. The technical indicators are mixed, with some short-term averages indicating a ‘Strong Buy’ while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, advising a cautious approach. Cardano’s 2025 Prospects: Can ADA Reach New Heights? Cardano’s latest price forecasts show a balance between optimism and caution, with ADA currently around $0.87 after a recent dip. Analyst @LucidCiC on X enthusiastically states, “$ADA is about to go Interstellar!” while other experts suggest a potential climb to $2.42 or even $4.69, driven by market dynamics and technological advances. Noteworthy developments like the Chang hard fork and increased adoption efforts, particularly in Africa, reinforce this positive sentiment. Furthermore, the anticipated Bitcoin halving in 2025 could impact the wider crypto market, likely benefiting ADA. As one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025, ADA holds promise, though a careful review of Cardano’s market trends and price forecasts is advisable. BlockDAG Unleashes Unlimited USDT Cashback for Referrals and Purchases BlockDAG has taken the crypto market by storm with its groundbreaking presale, amassing over $176 million and registering an incredible 2380% increase in value since its initial batch. This impressive growth is propelled further by its interesting Refer & Earn USDT program, which provides immediate cashback rewards for both those who refer and those who buy, without any caps on earnings. This approach redefines reward systems in the crypto space, positioning BDAG as a standout choice. The referral mechanism is straightforward and highly beneficial. Referrers receive instant cashback between 6% and 10% in USDT (BEP-20) based on purchases made through their links, with the percentage increasing as transaction volume grows within a 24-hour cycle, resetting at 00:00 UTC. Purchasers benefit from a steady 6% cashback on every transaction, fostering a mutually advantageous environment that promotes ongoing engagement. The immediate nature of the cashback, coupled with no limits on potential earnings, positions this program as exceptionally rewarding in today’s market. As BDAG’s popularity continues to climb, analysts predict its price could hit $1 by 2025, potentially yielding a 4,200% ROI for holders from batch 27, and affirming its status as one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025. The ongoing presale presents a unique opportunity to purchase this cryptocurrency at just $0.0234 per coin, along with the benefit of immediate cashback rewards. With more than 17.7 billion BDAG sold, time is running out for those looking to buy this top crypto coin. Final Say As we edge closer to 2025, the Cardano price prediction indicates a bright future for ADA, supported by its technological innovations and expanding adoption, though a careful analysis of market trends is essential. Conversely, Tron market analysis suggests a volatile journey ahead, with TRX balancing on the cusp of potential upswings and downturns, influenced by broader economic indicators. Yet, BlockDAG stands out as the top crypto to buy in 2025 , thanks to its unparalleled referral program that offers 6% to 10% instant USDT cashback rewards. With its record-setting presale, remarkable growth trajectory, and forecasts predicting a significant rise in value, BlockDAG combines the allure of immediate financial incentives with substantial long-term growth prospects, making it an exciting prospect for proactive market participants.

This forecast, shared by The Block , attributes Bitcoin’s rise to increasing demand from institutional and corporate entities while excluding potential government purchases. If realized, this milestone would solidify Bitcoin’s position as a global store of value, further transforming the dynamics of ownership and adoption across markets. Key Drivers of Bitcoin’s $200K Prediction 1. Institutional and Corporate Demand Bernstein analysts highlight the growing role of institutions and corporations in driving Bitcoin’s value. Bitcoin ETFs : The increasing prevalence of Bitcoin ETFs is facilitating easier access to the asset for retail and institutional investors. Corporate Treasuries : Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have set a precedent by integrating Bitcoin into their treasuries, inspiring other firms to follow suit. 2. Ownership Shifts to Long-Term Holders Gautam Chhugani, Managing Director at Bernstein, notes a key trend: Price Consolidation Below $100K : Bitcoin’s price remaining under $100,000 is prompting a shift in ownership from short-term traders to long-term holders. Entities like MicroStrategy and Bitcoin ETF investors contribute to this “permanent” ownership model. The Potential Role of Governments While Bernstein’s projection excludes government demand, the report acknowledges the potential for a game-changing shift if nations begin to include Bitcoin in their national reserves . What Could Happen? Triggering Global Competition : A U.S. decision to hold Bitcoin could spark worldwide competition among nations to acquire the cryptocurrency. Impact on Supply : Government demand would create significant scarcity, accelerating Bitcoin’s price rise. Bitcoin’s Road to $200K: Milestones and Challenges Milestones to Watch Increased ETF Adoption : A higher number of Bitcoin ETFs could lead to substantial capital inflows. Corporate Adoption : More companies adding Bitcoin to their treasuries would enhance its credibility as a reserve asset. Challenges Regulatory Risks : Regulatory uncertainty remains a key hurdle for Bitcoin’s price growth. Market Volatility : Bitcoin’s historical price swings may deter cautious investors. Comparative Analysis: Institutional and Government Demand Factor Institutional Demand Government Demand Impact on Price Gradual and sustained Sharp and exponential Likelihood High Moderate (dependent on geopolitical shifts) Potential Catalysts ETFs, corporate treasuries U.S. or major economies adopting Bitcoin FAQs Why does Bernstein predict Bitcoin will reach $200K by 2025? Bernstein’s forecast is based on rising institutional and corporate demand for Bitcoin, excluding potential government purchases. What role do ETFs play in Bitcoin’s price prediction? Bitcoin ETFs provide a regulated and accessible way for institutions and retail investors to acquire Bitcoin, contributing to increased demand. How could government demand impact Bitcoin’s price? If governments begin including Bitcoin in their national reserves, it could trigger global competition for the asset, significantly driving up its price. What factors might delay Bitcoin’s rise to $200K? Regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and slower-than-expected institutional adoption could delay Bitcoin’s growth. Who are the long-term holders driving Bitcoin’s value? Companies like MicroStrategy and investors in Bitcoin ETFs represent a shift towards long-term ownership, stabilizing Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Conclusion Bernstein’s $200,000 Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 underscores the growing influence of institutional and corporate demand on the cryptocurrency market. While the forecast excludes government purchases, the potential for global competition among nations to acquire Bitcoin adds another layer of intrigue. As ETFs and corporate treasuries increasingly dominate Bitcoin ownership, the path to $200K seems plausible, provided the market navigates regulatory and adoption challenges effectively.

This claim was made before a New York City court on Jan. 6, 2025, where Kwon is facing nine counts of felony relating to fraud at Terraform Labs. In the document submitted by acting U.S. attorney Daniel Gitner , the government outlined its intent to notify victims regarding their rights under the Justice for All Act of 2004. Due to the immense scale and global extent of Terraform Lab’s dissolution, traditional methods of notifying victims were believed to be impractical. Rather, the government proposed to set up a public website for Kwon’s case proceedings. The filing stated: “While it is difficult to precisely quantify the number of Kwon’s victims in light of the sheer number of purchases and sales of Terraform’s cryptocurrencies and the manner of those transactions (with many transactions in those assets occurring on foreign exchanges and through digital asset wallet or crypto trading accounts without personal identifying information), the Government estimates that the number of victims, in this case, exceeds hundreds of thousands of individuals and entities, and potentially totals more than one million.” The Justice for All Act provides that the victim of a federal crime enjoys particular rights such as timely notification of public court proceedings, the opportunity to be heard during sentencing or plea agreements, and the right to restitution if applicable. The Act, however, gives room for the courts to put in place in cases where a large number of victims need to be considered; reasonable procedures are evident in this case.

Kwon was sent to the U.S. in Dec. 2024 after protracted negotiations involving many jurisdictions, including South Korea, following his arrest in Montenegro in 2023 for unrelated charges. On Jan. 2, 2025, Kwon appeared before a U.S. court for the first time and entered a not-guilty plea to the charges against him. He is still being held in custody. Kwon and Terraform Labs were also charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a civil case in April 2024. In this case, he and Terraform Labs were ordered to pay nearly $4.5 billion in disgorgement, civil penalties, and prejudgment interest. Moving forward in the case, the government’s victim notification website is expected to assume a significant role in ensuring compliance with the statutory rights of a victim without overburdening the court processes. For victims, this represents a real step toward transparency and acknowledgment of the harms suffered as a result of the collapse of Terraform Labs.

The data analytics platform further revealed the top 10 projects with the most significant token unlock value, including Aptos, Optimism, and Arbitrum. The platform’s token unlock data highlighted that the tokens released by projects since the beginning of the year have amounted to over $1.3 billion. CryptoRank data also revealed that the largest unlock value recorded was on January 1, valued at $910 million, while the lowest was on January 2, valued at $62 million. The week began with token unlocks worth $63 million, with more expected throughout the week. The research platform also confirmed that the third week of this month, from January 13 to 19, will record the highest unlock value, worth $4 billion. The January 6-12 week, the 20-26 week, and the January 27- February 2 week are expected to record $986 million, $509 million, and $1 billion in unlocks, respectively. CryptoRank confirmed that token unlocks involved releasing tokens locked up by different projects over a certain period, referred to as the vesting period. Token unlocks release the tokens to different project areas, including investors, the project’s team, governance nodes, development funding, marketing, and rewards. Aptos tops the list of token unlocks in January $7.2 Billion Worth of Tokens To Be Unlocked in January 🔓 The following notable token unlocks will happen in January: $APT $111.41M $CIRX $108.35M $ARB $86.42M $OP $67.29M $RON $66.89M $MOVE $53.35M $UXLINK $36.73M $IMX $35.59M $JTO $35.04M $STRK $32.66M pic.twitter.com/POLP3wI3bq — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) January 6, 2025 CryptoRank revealed that Aptos would be the greatest contributor to the January token unlocks. The project plans to release about 11.11 million APT tokens worth a little over $111 million on January 12. The unlock will account for about 2% of Aptos’ market capitalization, which currently stands at about $5.67 billion at the time of publication. The Circular Protocol will conduct the second-largest token unlock this January, accounting for about 63% of its market cap. On January 12, the project will release 28 billion CIRX tokens worth $108.35 million. Arbitrum, Optimism, Ronin, Movement, UXLINK, Immutable, Jito Labs, and StarkNET are the remaining top 8 projects, meant to release $86,24 million, $67.29 million, $66.89 million, $53.35 million, $36,73 million, $35.59 million, $35.04 million, and $32.66 million in token unlock value, respectively. Keyrock speculates that token unlocks might negatively impact markets According to digital asset liquidity solutions service provider Keyrock, the January token unlocks might trigger negative market responses. After monitoring over 16,000 unlocks, the company researched token unlocks and their effects on crypto markets. The platform published its research findings in December 2024 as investors anticipated the possible effects of this year’s unlocks. The Keyrock research report highlighted that crypto projects unlock over $600 million in weekly tokens. The firm explained in its research that despite the predetermined actions taken before the token unlocks, the recipients, scale, anticipation, timing, and other factors dictate the negative outcomes experienced after. The research ascertained that the larger the token unlocks, the higher the chances for negative feedback in the market. The report further highlighted that large unlocks could lead to approximately 2.4x price declines and significantly increased volatility depending on all factors before and during a token unlock. Keyrock still explained that 90% of the token uncocks had higher chances of triggering negative price action despite the type and size of the release. However, the research also highlighted that token release to teams causes the most notable crashes that lead to panic sell-offs. Keyrock further shared that investor unlocks triggered more stable price action, while project development unlocks yielded the most positive results. The research identified different trends investors could expect from its study, explaining that linear unlocks positively impacted the markets more than cliff unlocks. The January unlocks are, however, mostly cliff unlocks, leading to the firm’s speculation of negative price action. Keyrock shared that retail investors would be more prone to reacting to negative market dynamics than institutional investors.

Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) has surpassed the $3.5 mark, reinforcing its position as a major player in the crypto landscape. This bullish environment has also sparked interest in Lightchain AI , a new project that has raised over $8.5 million in its presale, priced at $0.004875 per token. Ethereum’s Price Surge and the Growing Demand for ETH-Based Tokens Ethereum (ETH) has had a big jump in price lately, caused by a few main reasons. Interest from large groups has gone up a lot, with much money coming into Ethereum spot ETFs. For example, U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs got $428 million in net money on December 5, 2024 showing more trust among large investors. Also, Ethereum’s lead in the money without a middleman (DeFi) area keeps pushing up need. The system’s job in changing real-world items into tokens, a market worth about $100 trillion, makes it even more attractive. Ethereum now has a strong 81% share of the market͏ in tokening which shows its key part in the future of block chain tech. These changes have not just raised Ethereum’s market size but have also increased interest in ETH tokens, showing the platform’s growing power in the crypto world. Ripple Surpasses $3.5, Attracting Renewed Interest from Investors Ripple’s XRP has recently surpassed the $2.45 mark, attracting renewed interest from investors. This surge is partly due to significant accumulation by large holders, known as whales, who have purchased over 40 million XRP tokens, indicating strong confidence in the asset’s potential. Analysts suggest that if XRP maintains its current momentum, it could target the $3.5 price level, a significant resistance point near its all-time high. This optimism is further supported by increased network activity and positive developments in Ripple’s legal battles, which have historically influenced XRP’s price movements. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, XRP’s recent performance underscores its resilience and the growing investor confidence in its future prospects.

This innovative model democratizes real estate investment and introduces a layer of stability often absent in the crypto market. Real estate is historically considered a “safe-haven” asset, and PropiChain’s blockchain integration ensures transparency, security, and transaction efficiency. Top XRP price analysts have pointed out that PCHAIN’s dual focus on stability and innovation makes it a compelling choice for risk-averse investors. While XRP continues to offer utility in financial systems, its price remains subject to external factors like regulatory developments. PCHAIN, on the other hand, provides a hedge against such uncertainties through its asset-backed approach. Integrating blockchain with real estate has long been touted as the next big thing, but no platform has managed to execute it effectively like PCHAIN. The platform’s clear roadmap and tangible use cases give it an edge that’s hard to ignore The 12,000x Edge: What Sets PCHAIN Apart? The claim of a potential 12,000x edge stems from PCHAIN’s strategic positioning in two high-growth markets: blockchain technology and the $600 trillion real estate. Here’s a breakdown of the factors contributing to this significant potential: Real-World Asset Backing Unlike many crypto assets like XRP price that rely solely on market speculation, PCHAIN is backed by tangible real estate assets. This real-world backing provides a cushion against extreme price swings and enhances investor confidence in the asset. Fractional Ownership PropiChain’s fractional ownership model allows small and medium-sized investors to participate in lucrative real estate markets that were previously out of reach. This inclusivity expands the investor base and boosts demand for PCHAIN, the platform’s utility token. Global Accessibility The platform’s decentralized nature ensures accessibility for investors worldwide. With blockchain’s inherent transparency, PCHAIN eliminates geographical and bureaucratic barriers typically associated with real estate investments. PropiChain’s Technological Innovation to Power the Future of Real Estate PCHAIN uses cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), the Metaverse, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and smart contracts to transform the global real estate industry. With AI-powered tools such as virtual assistants and chatbots, the platform offers investors round-the-clock support, ensuring a seamless experience throughout their investment journey. Its AI-driven market analysis features deliver predictive insights into emerging market trends, empowering investors with the knowledge to make strategic investment decisions. PropiChain enables virtual property tours through state-of-the-art 3D visualization technology by incorporating the Metaverse. This approach eliminates physical visits, creating a borderless, global marketplace where buyers and sellers can connect, interact, and complete transactions effortlessly. PCHAIN’s RWA tokenization technology transforms real estate assets into digital tokens, paving the way for fractional ownership of premium properties. This innovation significantly lowers financial barriers, making real estate investment more accessible and inclusive for a broader audience. The platform’s smart contracts also streamline property management by automating property leasing and lease renewals. By cutting out intermediaries like brokers and leasing agents, real estate investors can manage their properties more efficiently while reducing operational costs. Conclusion For these XRP price analysts, PropiChain offers crypto enthusiasts a glimpse into the future of crypto investments. With its unique blend of blockchain technology and real estate, PCHAIN is well-positioned to deliver safer returns and achieve its touted 12,000x edge. According to the analysts, your $1000 investment in the ongoing PCHAIN presale would yield over $328,432 in profit before the end of Q1 2025. The project raised over $1.3 million during its first token presale and has crossed the $640,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round, which shows investor confidence in PCHAIN’s profit potential.

38637174,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=671524,1736218806,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,MicroStrategy Strikes Again: $100 Million Bitcoin Purchase Signals Strong Market Confidence,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/microstrategy-strikes-again-100-million-bitcoin-purchase-signals-strong-market-confidence/,"MicroStrategy, the major enterprise software company that has evolved into a Bitcoin (BTC) investment platform, has captured attention once again with its latest purchase of $101 million in BTC. The company, led by chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor, has committed to utilizing perpetual preferred stock, common shares, and debt to fuel its ongoing Bitcoin purchasing strategy. MicroStrategy Eyes $42 Billion Capital Raise By 2027 In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MicroStrategy disclosed that it purchased 1,070 Bitcoin tokens at an average price of approximately $94,000 on December 30 and 31, 2024. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 447,470 BTC, acquired for around $27.97 billion at an average price of $62,503 per Bitcoin. Notably, Saylor highlighted in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), that the company achieved a Bitcoin yield of 48% for the fourth quarter of 2024 and 74.3% for the entire fiscal year. Related Reading: XRP Eyes $11 Breakout, But A Correction Might Come First—Analyst MicroStrategy’s ambitious plans extend beyond Bitcoin acquisitions. On Friday, the firm announced its intention to raise up to $2 billion through offerings of perpetual preferred stock, which will hold seniority over its Class A common stock. This move is part of a larger strategy to raise $42 billion in capital by 2027 through various means, including at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offerings. With more than two-thirds of its equity goals already met, the company is expected to pivot towards fixed-income markets in the near future. The demand for MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has notably increased among hedge funds, which are employing convertible arbitrage strategies that involve purchasing bonds and short-selling shares. This strategy capitalizes on the volatility of MicroStrategy’s stock, a characteristic that has become a cornerstone of its business model. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer remarked: That volatility itself is a key element of MicroStrategy’s approach because it enables the company to tap into the capital markets and particularly the convertible bond market more easily. MicroStrategy’s recent proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.3 billion has sparked fears of share dilution, leading to a significant drop in the company’s stock price. MicroStrategy’s Bold Bitcoin Strategy Faces Headwinds On the day of the proxy filing in December, shares fell by as much as 9.6%. Adam Kobeissi, founder of The Kobeissi Letter, noted the dilemma faced by investors, stating: It’s a lose-lose because on one hand you have people saying that it’s dilutive and they’re selling the stock… but on the other hand you have people saying if it doesn’t pass, then they can’t keep buying Bitcoin and the whole investment strategy is kind of broken. A vote on the share increase is scheduled for January 21, 2025, and with Saylor being a significant shareholder, the amendment is expected to pass. Should it be approved, the increase in shares could lead to further volatility in MicroStrategy’s stock price as the company becomes more leveraged. Although the company has typically outperformed Bitcoin, it has faced challenges in recent months, underlining that its performance is influenced by factors beyond just cryptocurrency prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Price on the Rise: Can Momentum Fuel Bigger Gains? Despite the recent fluctuations, Palmer maintains a “buy” rating on MicroStrategy’s stock. He believes the market’s reaction to the proposed share increase has been an overreaction. “The company’s strategy has been to issue shares to make accretive Bitcoin purchases which can accrue to the benefit of shareholders,” he commented. MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach to Bitcoin acquisitions has seen it make significant purchases exceeding $1 billion in late 2024, although recent weeks have seen a slowdown in these activities amidst fluctuating Bitcoin prices. Palmer reassured investors, stating, “We’ve seen a pull forward of the company’s strategy, which is not indicative of a slowdown… it’s more a reflection of the aggressive approach that the company has taken.” At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto is inching closer to the $100,000 milestone, trading at $99,340, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

The price is trading above $3,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,660 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,750 resistance level. Ethereum Price Climbs Above $3,700 Ethereum price remained stable above the $3,550 level and extended its upward move like Bitcoin . ETH gained pace for a move above the $3,620 and $3,650 resistance levels. The bulls were able to surpass the $3,700 resistance level. It opened the doors for a move toward the $3,750 level.

Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,750 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,660 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,620. A clear move below the $3,620 support might push the price toward the $3,550 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,500 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,420.

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 03:23:00

Yep, you read that right. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a cheeky new player that’s not only crushing it with staking rewards but also raising eyebrows with its skyrocketing presale performance. The coin hit over $2.5 million in the first two weeks of its presale launch and hasn’t slowed down since, surpassing $5 million and counting. But it’s not just about numbers. BTFD has unique features that go beyond the usual meme coin hype. With plans to incorporate decentralised tools, community-led governance, and long-term utility, BTFD isn’t just a flash in the pan. It’s aiming to carve out a solid niche in the market. Oh, and did we mention over 62 billion coins have already been snapped up by 7,700 holders? The popularity of meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has rewritten the rules of crypto. They’ve proven that community-driven projects can skyrocket with the right mix of humour and heart. BTFD Coin , however, is upping the ante. It’s combining meme culture with tangible benefits, making it one of the best new meme coins to invest in this week . Let’s dive into how it compares to Simon’s Cat and Apu Apustaja. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Offering 90% APY on Staking BTFD is the new kid on the block, but it’s playing like a seasoned pro. Starting its presale at a humble $0.000004 per coin, it has already reached $0.0000142 in Stage 13. With 16 stages total and a listing price of $0.0006, early investors stand to gain massive returns. Imagine investing $35,000 at the current price. That would snag you 246.48 million BTFD coins . When the price hits $0.0006, you’re looking at a whopping $147,888 . That’s the kind of win most crypto enthusiasts dream about. BTFD Coin is making waves with its impressive 90% APY staking rewards , offering investors a lucrative way to grow their holdings passively. Unlike traditional meme coins, BTFD combines community-driven hype with real financial incentives, making it a standout in the crypto market. Staking BTFD is simple and rewarding, allowing users to lock their coins and earn substantial returns while supporting the coin’s ecosystem. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, this high APY rate ensures your money works harder for you. With BTFD’s growing popularity and presale momentum, the 90% staking reward is the cherry on top for investors. The buzz around BTFD isn’t just about the numbers, though. Its presale has become a talking point across Gen Z and Millennial communities in Australasia and beyond. People love a good underdog story, and BTFD is delivering just that with its 16-stage structure and ambitious roadmap. And the 90% APY on staking? It’s like the cherry on top of an already irresistible crypto sundae. Simon’s Cat (CAT): A Meow-tastic Memecoin Adventure Simon’s Cat entered the meme coin space with a purr and a promise. Inspired by the viral cartoon series, CAT has quickly become a favourite for animal lovers and crypto enthusiasts alike. The coin’s value surged last week, thanks to clever marketing campaigns and an impending airdrop. But it’s not all sunshine and catnip. While CAT’s price action has been impressive, critics argue that it lacks a clear use case. Most of its hype relies on the charm of its branding and its ability to generate social media buzz. Sure, it’s a fun investment, but is it sustainable? The good news is CAT isn’t resting on its laurels. The developers are actively exploring partnerships and community-driven initiatives. If you’re looking for a coin with personality and potential, Simon’s Cat might just be your pick. Still, if you’re after a more solid return, BTFD’s structured presale offers a clearer path to gains. Apu Apustaja (APU): From Meme to Market Let’s talk about Apu Apustaja, a meme coin inspired by the iconic internet character. This one’s for the die-hard meme lovers who thrive on nostalgia. APU launched with a bang, offering playful branding and a strong focus on community engagement. Its initial decentralised exchange (DEX) debut saw a gain, making waves in a crowded market. But APU isn’t just about its debut. The project aims to integrate Play2Earn gaming and NFT marketplaces into its ecosystem, giving it a potential edge over meme coins that rely solely on hype. That said, APU has its challenges. It’s competing with heavyweights like BTFD, which has already proven its worth through a meticulously planned presale. APU may have the memes, but BTFD’s blend of staking rewards and financial potential make it a standout choice for investors. How to Buy BTFD Coin Thinking of jumping on the BTFD bandwagon? Here’s how you can get in: Go to the presale page at BTFD.io . Connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet works best). Enter the amount of $BTFD you’d like to buy. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. It’s quick, easy, and could be one of the smartest moves you make this year. Conclusion: Why BTFD Coin Deserves Your Attention Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be a game-changer in the meme coin world. With its stellar presale performance, incredible staking rewards, and long-term growth potential, BTFD offers a unique opportunity to join a community that’s not just about memes but meaningful returns.

The price is showing positive signs and might aim for a fresh increase above $2.4650. XRP price is struggling to gain pace for a move above the $2.50 zone. The price is now trading below $2.435 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $2.385 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level. The next resistance is $2.55. A clear move above the $2.55 resistance might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance or even $2.750 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.880. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.435 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.380 level. The next major support is near the $2.320 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.320 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.20 support. The next major support sits near the $2.120 zone.

Acting US Attorney Daniel Gitner claimed the government would establish a website to help inform victims of their rights, calling other notification methods “impracticable.” The US government prefers to use a website to communicate with victims of the Terra case The US government approximates the number of victims affected by the Terra ecosystem collapse to be over 1 million. Acting US Attorney Daniel Gitner submitted a motion to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on January 6 describing the procedures for notifying potential victims of Do Kwon’s public proceedings. The US attorney claimed the government would set up a website to inform victims of their rights, tagging other traditional methods “impracticable” due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency transactions, which often lack personal identifying information. Terra collapsed in May 2022, and Do Kwon is charged with nine fraud felonies In May 2022, Terra, once the third largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ether, crumbled, losing its $50 billion valuation in just 72 hours. When founder Do Kwon launched Terra, he claimed he wanted to build an ecosystem better than Bitcoin and Ethereum. He added that he needed a stablecoin to compete directly with fiat currencies. Sadly, his entire project lacked transparency. According to the US Department of Justice, Kwon misled investors by falsely claiming the company’s blockchain products and manipulated their markets to create the illusion of a functioning and decentralized financial system. Earlier this year, Kwon was extradited from Montenegro to the United States, where he now faces nine felony fraud charges. On January 2, he appeared before a US judge for the first time and pleaded not guilty. However, authorities have yet to clarify if they will pursue a plea agreement with the Terraform co-founder or whether they will proceed to a full criminal trial. Due to his fraud involvement, Kwon already had to pay a $4.5 billion settlement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in April 2024.

Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just exploring crypto, these three projects are hard to ignore. Web3Bay is transforming online shopping with its decentralized marketplace, removing high fees and middlemen. Its presale success has drawn significant attention. On the other side, XRP is showing strong potential after a stellar 2024. With regulatory wins and high price forecasts, the community is eager for 2025. Meanwhile, Cardano is bouncing back, with analysts suggesting it’s primed for a new rally after recent price corrections. Discover why these are the best crypto projects to watch. Web3Bay: Redefining Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce with its transparent and decentralized marketplace. By cutting out middlemen it empowers both buyers and sellers to transact directly, reducing fees and ensuring users retain full control over their funds and data. Its unique payment system supports both cryptocurrencies and traditional methods like PayPal, making it accessible for crypto enthusiasts and regular shoppers. For merchants, especially in regions with limited banking access, Web3Bay offers a gateway to global markets without needing traditional financial institutions. Currently in presale stage 3 at $0.0039675, Web3Bay has raised over $420,000, selling more than 110 million 3BAY coins. With 28 stages and a 15% price hike per stage, it promises a potential ROI exceeding 6000%. This platform, with its secure smart contracts and low fees, is shaping the future of online shopping. XRP Price Trends Surge Predictions XRP ended 2024 on a high, surpassing $2 for the first time, achieving a 370% annual growth. Analysts predict 2025 could see it climb to $6.4, $13, or even $27, driven by favorable market momentum and regulatory clarity. The XRP community is optimistic, especially after the New York Department of Financial Services approved Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD. This approval solidifies Ripple’s involvement in central bank digital currencies and enhances its payment solutions, setting XRP up for wider adoption. However, some experts remain cautious. Pro-crypto lawyer John Deaton, for instance, has stated he’s uncertain about XRP’s future price, saying, “I have no idea.” Regardless, the potential for growth remains strong. Cardano (ADA) Analysis: Signs of a 2025 Rebound Cardano (ADA) has seen sharp price swings, including a 40% drop following a 300% rally from November lows. Market analysts like Michaël van de Poppe suggest the correction phase may be nearing its end, paving the way for a fresh upward move. This recent pullback is viewed as a natural adjustment, signaling possible long-term bullish momentum. ADA’s breakout into a new trading range between $0.96 and $1.25 indicates upward potential, with price targets between $2.50 and $3.00, provided favorable conditions persist. While some are optimistic about ADA’s recovery in 2025, others urge caution. It’s a delicate balance of considering both promising projections and potential risks. Best Crypto Projects to Buy Now for 2025 As the crypto market gears up for an eventful year, Web3Bay, XRP, and Cardano stand out for their transformative potential. Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace could reshape global e-commerce, XRP’s regulatory wins promise a brighter future, and Cardano’s price correction hints at a strong comeback. From global trade to secure payments and decentralized ecosystems, these projects offer unique opportunities. Timing and planning are critical—don’t miss the chance to ride crypto’s next big wave .

However, the sector’s quick rise in popularity has received backlash from several community members and industry figures, who consider the tokens “worse” than the memecoin trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounces Back Above $100K – Is the Bull Run Resuming or a Correction Ahead? Crypto Traders Make Millions From AI-Related Tokens On January 6, on-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain shared that a smart Solana trader obtained massive returns from AI agent and memecoin ai16z (AI16Z). The investor turned $2 million into $21 million in less than two months amid the AI-related tokens rally. The AI-managed crypto fund is on the Solana blockchain and governed by the ai16zDAO. Its name is a wordplay originating from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, seemingly created to bring attention to the project. According to the post, the whale purchased 10.6 million ai16z, worth $2.27 million, between November 15 and November 22, 2024, at an average cost of $0.214. Since then, the cryptocurrency has seen a 965% surge to trade around $2.28. At the time of the report, the investor’s holdings were valued at around $21 million, making $19 million in unrealized profits. Earlier today, the whale sent 5.3 million ai16z, worth $10.68 million, into Jupiter to sell via limit order. Meanwhile, another trader turned $123,000 into $4.5 million after betting on ai16z when the token’s market capitalization was $22 million. The whale purchased 6.17 million ai16z and sold 4.67 million for around $1.78 million last month. The investor currently holds 2.65 million ai16z tokens, valued at $2.9 million, bringing the total profits to more than $4.5 million in two months. This whale also made another $13.4 million from other AI crypto tokens like GOAT, FARTCOIN, and ARC. Community Calls AI Agent Tokens ‘Overrated’ In late 2024, AI Agent tokens gained massive popularity among crypto investors, with several experts predicting that AI-related tokens, alongside memecoins, would be the largest narrative of this year. Meanwhile, AI memecoins stole the spotlight as the year ended, sending some of the tokens in the sector to the top 10 memecoins ranks in late December. Ai16z, the largest AI memecoin by market capitalization, has seen a 251% increase in the past month, hitting an all-time high (ATH) of $2.47 on January 2. The token is also the third-largest AI agent crypto and has seen a 25% surge in the last 24 hours, trading between $2.25 and $2.28 throughout Monday morning. Nonetheless, the sector has received heavy criticism recently from the crypto community. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT recently called AI agent tokens a scam. Responding to Justin Taylor, another industry member, the crypto detective stated that “99% of it is a scam” and suggested that “the AI agent wrapper grifts are probably worse than other past trends.” Related Reading: Litecoin Comeback: LTC Breaks Free And Guns For $400 Zach argued that memecoins “at least” promised nothing, “AI coins try to larp as much as possible to appear legit to unsuspecting buyers.” Similarly, Solana founders consider AI agent tokens to be overhyped. According to an anonymous poll of 42 Solana founders, several of the polled considered AI Agents, alongside Blinks, to be the “most overrated Solana sector.” Despite the criticism, the sector still registers a 5% increase in the last 24 hours, with a daily trading volume of $2.28 billion and a market capitalization of $17.5 billion, according to CoinGecko data.

Nvidia announced on Monday at CES in Las Vegas that these new GPUs are built on the same Blackwell architecture used in the chipmakers’ AI accelerators. The tech giant began as a maker of video game graphics cards, but its focus is now on data center chips. However, the AI chipmaker’s gaming GPUs are still popular, accounting for nearly $10 billion per year. Estimates of 2025 sales (Source: Bloomberg) Nvidia’s GPUs will use AI to predict the upcoming frames In the future, Blackwell’s AI elements will be utilized in the upcoming GeForce 50 series to ensure ultra-real gaming visuals. These new GPUs will calculate the shading of each pixel like old-fashioned graphics cards, but instead of remaking each frame, they’ll use AI to predict what’s coming next. “GeForce allowed AI to reach the masses, and now AI is coming home to GeForce,” said Huang in the presentation. Nvidia also pointed out improvements for laptops that promise longer battery life. PC gamers can now enjoy responsiveness and realism without compromise. The top-tier RTX 5090, which costs $1,999, will be out of the market this month, while the $549 RTX 5070, which outclasses the RTX 4090, will be available in February. Nvidia’s primary revenue stream, gaming, has been exceeded by its booming data center business, which is forecast to reach $100 billion this year.

The project, which features a clever blend of memetics and real utility, shows a strong market appeal. Analysts anticipate this will translate to price appreciation once it is listed on exchanges. Wall Street Pepe has the added advantage of listing on the open market as pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump takes his seat at the White House and crypto boogeyman Gary Gensler steps down from the SEC. With that, January and the remainder of 2025 are expected to yield big gains for the cryptocurrency market. The $WEPE presale is ongoing and currently available at a fixed price of $0.00036642. However, the price will rise throughout the presale, with the next increase in under one day. Wall Street Pepe is for crypto degens who “choose rich” Wall Street Pepe is grabbing the market’s attention in a unique way: it blends the hype of Pep the Frog and Jordan Belfort – and it adds utility. It’s a striking idea, merging Pepe the Frog’s easy-going persona with Jordan Belfort’s all-or-nothing business philosophy. This paradoxical interaction grasps the essence of Wall Street Pepe, which is to equip non-serious traders with serious trading tools and help them become profitable in the crypto market. Meme coin investors tend to be among newer market participants, often ill-equipped to navigate the volatile twists and turns of the crypto market. But with Wall Street Pepe, these crypto newbies will become smart money traders overnight. So what exactly does the Wall Street Pepe ecosystem entail? A utility-focused ecosystem geared around profits There are five key pillars inside the Wall Street Pepe ecosystem, each contributing to its community’s profitability. The first is its bread and butter: trading signals . Find out what to buy, when to buy it, and when to sell it based on Wall Street Pepe’s advanced data insights. Then there is meme coin picks , a tool that will give users the heads up on meme coins with the highest potential. It’s estimated that around 15,000 meme coins launch every day, and most fail. Meme coin picks will filter out the nonsense, saving users time and maximizing upside. Another feature is its trading insider group . If you want to be smart money, you can’t do it alone. The insider group allows the community to brainstorm, plan, and execute in unison. They’ll be beating whales at their own game. Beyond trading insights, holding $WEPE will also grant users access to staking , allowing them to compound their returns. Staking is live amidst the presale and currently provides a 30% APY. Lastly, there is trading rewards . Users will receive free $WEPE tokens for submitting good trade ideas to the Wall Street Pepe team. Wall Street Pepe doesn’t just help users trade more profitably; it makes them the project’s core focus, providing perks every step of the way. All of this is drawing significant attention, with netizens from everyday meme coin degens to top analysts taking notice. For instance, ClayBro recently speculated $WEPE could provide 10x gains in a video on his 134K subscriber YouTube channel. Secure the lowest $WEPE price today before the price increase As mentioned, the Wall Street Pepe price will increase as the ICO advances. Now is the time to act for investors seeking the most value for money. You can contribute to the presale by visiting the project’s website, connecting your wallet, and choosing the amount of $WEPE you want to buy and the crypto you want to pay with. The presale accepts payments using crypto and traditional payment methods. Alternatively, you can download the Best Wallet application and purchase $WEPE via its “Upcoming Tokens” feature. And prospective buyers can rest assured that the project is safe and secure. Smart contract security expert Coinsult audited Wall Street Pepe’s code and found no issues.

There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $1.075 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.1150 resistance zone. Cardano Price Starts Fresh Surge After forming a base above the $0.80 level, Cardano started a fresh increase, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA surged above the $0.90 and $1.00 levels. The bulls even pushed the price above $1.120. A high was formed at $1.1156 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below $1.1120, but the price remained above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.8373 swing low to the $1.1156 high. Cardano price is now trading above $1.00 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a short-term rising channel forming with support at $1.075 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.10 zone. The first resistance is near $1.1120. The next key resistance might be $1.1150. If there is a close above the $1.1150 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.20 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.250 in the near term. Downside Correction in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $1.1120 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $1.080 level. The next major support is near the $1.050 level. A downside break below the $1.050 level could open the doors for a test of $0.975 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.8373 swing low to the $1.1156 high.

While the other tokens failed to keep up the momentum, Dogecoin is trying hard to maintain a decent ascending trend. The price has been trying hard to rise above $0.4 since the beginning of 2025. While the recent whale movements suggest a big move is incoming, the technicals endorse a wider correction is on the horizon. What’s next for the Dogecoin (DOGE) price rally? Will it trigger a healthy run to $1 in 2025? Retail traders usually follow the whales, believing it is a major signal for the next price action. With the rise in their accumulation rate, the optimism around the token surges further, positively impacting the DOGE price . The whales accumulated DOGE constantly throughout 2024 and halted in November; meanwhile, they have resumed and surpassed the levels of the 2021 bull run. Currently, more than 5000 wallets hold above 1 million DOGE, which are flashing major bullish signals. On the other hand, retail traders refrain from jumping in as the active address count remains within the average range. Mainly because the technicals do not support the bullish narrative. The TD sequential indicator, which points out the exact time of the trend reversal, remains bearish, anticipating a price correction. Secondly, the weighted social sentiment is at around 0.60, meaning that the crowd remains pessimistic about Dogecoin’s upside potential. What’s next for the DOGE price rally? The DOGE price chart suggests the bulls are trying hard to keep up the bullish trend as the rally has been struggling hard to defend the 50-day MA. These levels are offering a strong base while the price is failing to trigger a strong rebound to the higher ranges. This could be due to the drop in volume that has hindered the progress of the rally. Meanwhile, incremental RSI seems to have halted the trend, substantiating a bearish claim. Regardless of all the bearish claims, the Dogecoin price may still squash the narrative if a rise above 0.786 FIB at $0.4 is validated in the next few hours. This move may pave the way for a healthy ascending trend, probably reaching the 2024 highs at $0.55 while a new ATH at $1 remains pretty distinct.",Price Analysis|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-07 05:14:00

Starting in the second half of 2025, the self-governing province plans to roll out NFT-based digital visitor cards, offering discounts, travel subsidies, and special membership perks at popular attractions. NFT Visitor Cards Reports from local outlets indicate that the initiative targets Millennials and Generation Z travelers in a bid to boost the island’s tourism industry by providing a tech-driven experience. The NFT cards will leverage blockchain technology to store visitor data, such as travel history, photos, and videos, on a secure and tamper-proof platform. While details about the blockchain platform and card pricing are not yet available, a trial phase will precede the full rollout to test the program’s viability. This initiative builds on Jeju Island’s history of exploring blockchain technology. For instance, back in 2019, the island launched a government-backed research project to position itself as a global blockchain hub. Subsequent projects included a COVID-19 contact tracing app in 2021 and an energy usage tracking platform in 2022, both powered by blockchain. South Korea’s Web 3 Focus The move also aligns with South Korea’s broader focus on Web 3 and digital innovation. South Korea first started exploring NFTs in 2021 to examine the integration of this sector into its tax system. The following year, NFTs were used to raise funds for presidential campaigns in Seoul. More recently, the country’s financial watchdog, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), issued guidelines on NFTs wherein it outlined cases in which these tokens should be considered crypto assets. In addition, South Korea has committed significant resources to the metaverse. It had previously announced plans to invest more than $187 million to foster job creation and technological growth. Last month, South Korea’s trading volume saw a massive spike amid political tension. As a result, the country experienced a dramatic surge in crypto adoption. By the end of 2024, the country’s crypto user base had exceeded 15.5 million.

Staticcoin has surpassed PayPal USD (PYUSD) and EURC in 24-hour trading volume, marking a notable achievement in the stablecoin market. According to data shared on X by the Paul Barron Network (@paulbarrontv), RLUSD recorded a daily trading volume of $34.7 million, eclipsing PYUSD’s $19.7 million and EURC’s $12.4 million. This surge in volume reflects the strong reception of RLUSD in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and banking sectors. BREAKING! Ripple USD stablecoin has flipped both PayPal and Euro stable in 24hr Volume only two weeks after its launch. #XRP @xpmarket @UpholdInc pic.twitter.com/DDOGs9dXpc — Paul Barron Network (@paulbarrontv) January 4, 2025 RLUSD’s Significance Ripple launched RLUSD as part of its broader strategy to expand into the DeFi space and strengthen its position in the banking ecosystem. According to Adam Cochran, Managing Partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, RLUSD acts as a Trojan Horse for Ripple, enabling it to bridge traditional finance with decentralized solutions. The stablecoin is fully backed and designed to operate seamlessly on the XRP Ledger, offering users fast and low-cost transactions. It is also available on the Ethereum network, allowing a broad range of users to enjoy its benefits, and introducing them to the XRP ecosystem. This achievement comes as Ripple continues to solidify its presence in the financial industry. RLUSD represents a critical component of Ripple’s expansion, serving as a gateway for financial institutions and retail users seeking efficient cross-border payment solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next for RLUSD? The rapid adoption of RLUSD has drawn attention from the crypto community and industry experts alike. Popular crypto influencer Ben “BitBoy” Armstrong recently emphasized the importance of RLUSD in Ripple’s ecosystem, describing stablecoins as the backbone of the crypto industry . The stablecoin market has become increasingly competitive. RLUSD’s ability to outperform established players like PYUSD in daily volume shows the strength of Ripple’s stablecoin. While PYUSD benefits from PayPal’s extensive user base, RLUSD’s integration with the XRP Ledger and its focus on cross-border payments provide unique value propositions. At press time, RLUSD had far surpassed PYUSD and EURC. It is now ranked 4th by trading volume with a 24-hour volume of $417.8 million. It sits behind FDUSD, USDC, and USDT. With RLUSD growing rapidly, many new investors are entering the XRP ecosystem, creating a big opportunity for XRP as both assets are complementary . Many in the community believe RLUSD is coming for USDT’s top position, and if it keeps showing at this rate, it might dominate the stablecoin market sooner than many expect.

Companies like MicroStrategy and CleanSpark also recently expanded their Bitcoin holdings, with CleanSpark even surpassing Tesla as the fifth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Meanwhile, JPMorgan recently pointed out Bitcoin's growing role as a hedge against inflation, and predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum reaching record highs are boosted by the optimism around regulatory advancements and corporate treasury strategies. Market Tops in Sight and Experts Weigh In The cryptocurrency market seems to be entering the latter stages of its current bull cycle, according to CryptoQuant . In a recent post by Crypto Dan, it was suggested that the bull market, which started in January of 2023, could reach its cyclical peak as early as the first quarter of 2025, or by the second quarter at the latest. The post also pointed to a big influx of new investments and additional contributions from existing investors as evidence of the cycle nearing its climax. Crypto Dan post (Source: CryptoQuant ) In the final quarter of 2024, Bitcoin saw 36% of its supply traded for less than a month, which is a pattern that is often associated with market tops in previous cycles. CryptoQuant noted that this ratio might increase two to four times before a corrective bear cycle begins. While there is still potential for gains in Bitcoin and altcoins, the firm urged investors to approach the market with caution and prioritize risk management. This cautious outlook is very different from the predictions of other analysts who expect the bull market to extend through the end of 2025. Steno Research projects 2025 to be a record-breaking year for the crypto market, with Bitcoin and Ethereum expected to surpass all-time highs alongside other major advancements. Similarly, VanEck forecasts a medium-term peak for the market in early 2025, which could be followed by a surge to unprecedented highs later in the year. VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, envisions Bitcoin reaching $180,000 and Ethereum surpassing $6,000 by the cycle’s apex. VanEck’s top 10 crypto predictions for 2025 (Source: VanEck ) Market sentiment on platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi also reflects optimism, with traders betting on record highs for Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2025 as well. These projections align with expectations of regulatory progress, including the approval of new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. JPMorgan Sees Lasting Shift to Bitcoin and Gold The ”debasement trade” into gold and Bitcoin is becoming a lasting trend as investors navigate the persistent geopolitical uncertainty and inflation concerns, according to a recent research note by JPMorgan. Due to the record capital inflows into crypto markets in 2024, the bank stated that gold and Bitcoin are increasingly seen as essential components of investors' portfolios. This demand stems from various factors, including heightened geopolitical risks since 2022, ongoing concerns about long-term inflation, and fears of debt debasement due to persistently high government deficits in major economies. Institutional investors and well known people like Paul Tudor Jones are actively betting on Bitcoin and commodities, and see them as effective hedges against inflationary pressures in the United States. Similarly, US state governments are incorporating Bitcoin into their fiscal strategies to mitigate fiscal uncertainties, according to asset manager VanEck . JPMorgan also pointed to the sharp increase in open interest on Bitcoin futures as an indicator that institutional funds are equating Bitcoin with gold as a strategic asset. Open interest on BTC futures surged from $18 billion in January to over $55 billion by December of 2024, according to CoinGlass data . (Source: CoinGlass ) Retail interest in Bitcoin has also shown some renewed strength, with Bitcoin ETFs experiencing inflows starting in September 2024 after a temporary outflow in August. By November, the total net assets of US Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $100 billion for the first time, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Crypto ETFs are considered a critical metric for gauging new market participants, as they are more likely to represent fresh inflows than other trading activities, according to Citi. The growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, fueled by these surging inflows, could lead to big demand shocks that may drive prices higher. Sygnum Bank suggested that this trend might propel Bitcoin’s price to new heights in 2025. MicroStrategy Acquires More BTC in 2025 MicroStrategy also sees great potential in Bitcoin, and announced its latest acquisition of 1,070 BTC that was made during the final two days of 2025. According to a Jan. 6 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company spent approximately $101 million in cash between Dec. 30 and Dec. 31 to buy Bitcoin at an average price of $94,004 per coin. This purchase brings MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings to 447,470 BTC, which is valued at around $27.97 billion, with an average acquisition price of $62,503 per Bitcoin. The company now holds 2.1% of all Bitcoin that will ever be mined. The acquisition was funded by using proceeds from the issuance and sale of shares under a convertible notes sales agreement, consistent with MicroStrategy’s purchasing strategy. The buy happened after a hint from MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, who posted a Bitcoin chart from the SaylorTracker website on Jan. 5. Despite this addition, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying activity has shown some signs of slowing. In December of 2024, the company purchased a total of 45,370 BTC, representing only 30% of its acquisitions during the previous month-long period from Oct. 31 to Dec. 1. Some of MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin purchases (Source: Lookonchain ) This reduced activity was likely due to market caution, with people like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes warning people about potential market volatility ahead of the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump. Reports also suggest that MicroStrategy could enter a blackout period in January 2025 that could potentially halt any further Bitcoin purchases through share and convertible bond issuances. The latest purchase also follows MicroStrategy’s announcement of plans to raise $2 billion through a perpetual preferred stock offering to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions. However, the decision to proceed with the offering is still at the company’s discretion and depends on market conditions. CleanSpark Surpasses Tesla in Bitcoin Holdings CleanSpark, a United States crypto mining company, expanded its own Bitcoin holdings a lot in December of 2024. The company pointed to efficiency gains and rapid hashrate growth as drivers of its success. According to a Jan. 6 report, CleanSpark mined 668 BTC in December, contributing to a total of 7,024 BTC mined for the year. The company’s hashrate increased by 287.9% year-over-year, reaching 39.1 exahashes per second by year-end. Efficiency also improved by 33.3% compared to 2023. In December, CleanSpark sold 12.65 BTC at an average price of $101,246, generating $1.28 million in proceeds. This sale represented just 58% of its daily production for the month. The company’s mining capacity received a nice boost in 2024 with the acquisition of seven facilities in Knoxville , Tennessee, which increased its hashrate by 22%. CleanSpark’s stock, which is trading under the symbol CLSK, also rallied on Jan. 6. By the end of 2024, CleanSpark accumulated 9,952 BTC, valued at approximately $1.01 billion, making it the fifth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder and surpassing Tesla. Only MicroStrategy and three other mining companies hold more Bitcoin. Publicly traded companies now collectively hold 593,152 BTC, accounting for around 20% of institutional Bitcoin treasuries, though this figure includes government-held confiscated Bitcoin. Top corporate bitcoin holders (Source: Bitcoin Treasuries ) The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is still picking up steam. In December, space technology company KULR converted $21 million in cash into Bitcoin, while Canadian firms Matador Technologies and Quantum BioPharma made similar moves as part of their treasury strategies. Bitwise CRO Hunter Horsley predicts that 2025 will start the rise of ”Bitcoin Standard” corporations as more companies embrace Bitcoin as a strategic asset.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-07 05:21:46

Simultaneously, prosecutors overseeing Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon’s criminal case have estimated that over one million individuals worldwide may have been affected by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Do Kwon's Criminal Case: Over a Million Victims Estimated After Terra Ecosystem Collapse In a landmark criminal case that sheds light on the far-reaching impact of the Terra ecosystem's collapse, US prosecutors estimate that more than one million victims worldwide may have been affected by the fallout. The case against Terraform Labs' co-founder, Do Kwon, has drawn global attention and has demonstrated the devastating consequences of the crypto platform's failure. On Jan. 6, Acting US Attorney Daniel Gitner filed a notice in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York detailing the procedures to inform Kwon's victims of their rights. The scale and nature of the case have made traditional victim notification methods infeasible, prompting prosecutors to propose a dedicated website to keep victims informed of public proceedings. Gitner emphasized the enormity of the task, citing the vast number of transactions involving Terraform's cryptocurrencies, many of which were conducted through foreign exchanges or anonymous digital wallets. ”The Government estimates that the number of victims in this case exceeds hundreds of thousands of individuals and entities, and potentially totals more than one million,” he said. This approach aligns with efforts to ensure transparency and accessibility in a case of unprecedented magnitude within the cryptocurrency sector. Kwon’s appearance before a US judge on Jan. 2 marked the beginning of a new chapter in his legal battles. Extradited from Montenegro after a prolonged detention, Kwon pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges, including fraud at Terraform Labs. He has agreed to remain in detention while proceedings unfold. The charges against Kwon stem from the catastrophic collapse of the Terra ecosystem in 2022, which sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market. The implosion of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and its companion token, LUNA, wiped out billions of dollars in value and contributed to a broader market downturn that saw numerous firms declare bankruptcy. Kwon’s legal troubles are not confined to the United States. In 2023, Montenegrin authorities arrested him on unrelated charges, further complicating his legal status. Both the US and South Korea sought his extradition, but it was only in December 2024 that Montenegrin authorities handed him over to US custody. Kwon’s case joins a growing list of high-profile criminal proceedings against cryptocurrency executives in the Southern District of New York, a jurisdiction that has become a focal point for crypto-related crimes. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky are among those facing similar scrutiny, while former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently pleaded guilty to a felony charge in a separate jurisdiction. The scale of Kwon’s alleged fraud sets his case apart. In April 2024, a US judge ruled that Kwon and Terraform Labs were liable for fraud in a civil case brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of the settlement, Kwon and the company agreed to pay approximately $4.5 billion in disgorgement, civil penalties, and prejudgment interest. This ruling is likely to play a pivotal role in the criminal trial. Challenges in Quantifying Victim Impact One of the complexities in Kwon’s criminal case lies in identifying and quantifying the victims. Unlike traditional financial crimes, where transactions are often traceable to individuals, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency complicates these efforts. Many victims may have conducted transactions anonymously or through foreign exchanges, leaving little personal identifying information. The collapse of Terra’s ecosystem has left a lasting imprint on the cryptocurrency market. Beyond the financial losses suffered by individual investors, the incident undermined trust in algorithmic stablecoins and prompted regulators worldwide to reevaluate their approach to cryptocurrency oversight. Kwon’s arrest and subsequent extradition mark a turning point in the global response to crypto fraud. The case brings attention to the need for robust international cooperation in addressing crimes that transcend borders and affect millions of people. As Kwon faces his criminal trial, questions remain about whether US authorities will offer a plea deal or proceed with a full trial. The outcome will likely set a precedent for how legal systems address large-scale fraud in the cryptocurrency industry. For the millions of victims, the case represents a chance to seek justice and recover some of their losses. However, the road ahead is fraught with legal and logistical challenges, as prosecutors navigate the complexities of holding a key figure accountable in one of the most significant cryptocurrency collapses to date. CFTC and Gemini Reach Proposed Settlement: $5M Penalty and Admission of Misconduct In other crypto legal news, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has reached a proposed settlement with Gemini Trust Company, potentially bringing an end to a contentious civil case. The agreement, if approved by a federal judge, would require Gemini to pay a $5-million civil monetary penalty and admit to certain regulatory failings, potentially sparing the company from a prolonged trial. According to a filing submitted on Jan. 6 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, the proposed consent order would resolve all outstanding claims against Gemini. The case, initiated by the CFTC in June 2022, alleged that Gemini provided false or misleading statements in connection with its 2017 application to offer Bitcoin futures contracts. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, Gemini would acknowledge that it ”reasonably should have known” its statements to the CFTC were misleading. Specifically, the filing highlighted that Gemini had entered into bespoke fee arrangements with certain market participants—arrangements that were not disclosed on its website and were more favorable than the publicly advertised terms. These undisclosed agreements, according to the CFTC, were designed to promote trading in Gemini's auction platform. If approved, the settlement would also enjoin Gemini from making false or misleading statements to the CFTC in the future. The case stems from Gemini’s 2017 bid to list Bitcoin futures contracts, a move that required the firm to provide accurate and transparent information to the CFTC. The regulator alleged that Gemini’s failure to disclose key fee arrangements undermined the integrity of its application process. Gemini has consistently denied intentional wrongdoing but has faced mounting pressure as the trial date approached. Initially scheduled for Jan. 21, the trial’s delay came after a federal judge warned that no further adjournments would be granted. Despite the proposed settlement, Gemini has not issued a public statement regarding the agreement or its implications. This comes after the CFTC disclosed that it had recovered more than $17 billion in civil monetary penalties, disgorgement, and restitution from enforcement actions, including those against crypto firms In its 2024 fiscal year report. Gemini’s case also brings renewed attention to the challenges crypto firms encounter when navigating the regulatory landscape. The acknowledgment of misconduct in the proposed settlement could serve as a cautionary tale for other companies seeking to operate within the bounds of US law. Leadership Changes at the CFTC The timing of the proposed settlement coincides with significant political developments in the US. President-elect Donald Trump, set to be inaugurated on Jan. 20, has reportedly considered replacing current CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam. However, unlike the US Securities and Exchange Commission, where leadership changes have often followed shifts in administration, no CFTC commissioners have publicly indicated plans to resign ahead of Trump’s term. A change in leadership at the CFTC could influence the agency’s future enforcement priorities, including its approach to cryptocurrency regulation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|LUNA|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-07 05:30:00

BlockDAG’s incredible ascent and PEPE’s control of the meme market caused portfolios to expand as these top assets surpassed expectations. Looking ahead to 2025, these cryptocurrencies are ready to leverage their past successes, promising substantial returns for traders. BlockDAG, PEPE, SUI, Dogecoin, and XRP have risen as the best crypto coins for 2025, each presenting distinct advantages to meet varied buyer interests. Whether traders are drawn to the excitement of meme coins, the practicality of utility-driven adoption, or robust financial alternatives, these digital currencies are poised to shape portfolio triumphs in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: A Leading Crypto in 2025 BlockDAG (BDAG) tops our list of the best crypto coins for 2025 for several compelling reasons. It broke records in its 2024 presale, generating over $176 million and distributing over 17.7 billion coins. Early supporters have enjoyed a remarkable 2,380% return, underscoring its strong potential for enduring success. Currently priced at $0.0248 per coin in its latest presale phase, experts predict BlockDAG could reach $20 by 2027, supported by its swift adoption and continuous progress. BlockDAG’s advances in scalability and developer-friendly innovations have established it as a blockchain pioneer. Key achievements, like its new WebAssembly compatibility and the scheduled 2025 mainnet launch, underscore the high confidence in its future. For traders searching for the best crypto coins for 2025, BlockDAG provides an excellent mix of solid historical performance and bold growth prospects. 2. PEPE: Meme Coin Phenomenon with 1,492% Growth PEPE made waves in 2024 with an impressive 1,492% increase, claiming its spot as a premier meme coin. Inspired by the viral “Pepe the Frog,” this coin merged pop culture impact with substantial market presence. By year-end, PEPE’s market capitalization had surged, emphasizing its popularity. While its core strength is its community-based strategy, its dependence on meme culture could challenge its continued expansion. However, PEPE’s achievements in 2024 have laid the groundwork for what could be another strong year in 2025, making it a compelling option for traders who believe in the ongoing allure of meme coins. 3. SUI: Emerging Altcoin with a Robust DeFi Ecosystem In 2024, SUI showcased its value with a 1,193% boost in market value. Its streamlined architecture has drawn both developers and users, fostering a vibrant DeFi ecosystem. By December, SUI’s market cap neared $12 billion, marking it as a leading altcoin. While focusing on scalability and user-friendly features, SUI has encouraged widespread adoption. However, it could face hurdles from more established networks. Despite this, SUI’s solid performance and foundational strength place it among the best crypto coins for 2025 for those interested in DeFi trends. 4. Dogecoin: Iconic Meme Coin with High-Profile Support Dogecoin continues to be a standout choice among the best crypto coins for 2025, particularly within the meme coin niche, maintaining resilience in 2024. Its market value jumped by 342%, reaching $45.9 billion, partly driven by support from Elon Musk and potential uses on his platform, X (previously Twitter). Recognized for its vibrant community and cultural significance, Dogecoin attracts attention. However, its dependency on Musk’s backing and limited utility beyond the meme industry could challenge its ongoing growth. 5. XRP: Stable and Strong with a 286% Market Uplift XRP experienced a significant year in 2024, with its market value increasing by 286% to $131.2 billion. This rise was bolstered by a favorable legal decision against the SEC, where it was determined that automated XRP sales to individual users are not securities. Though XRP’s centralized nature and regulatory scrutiny continue to pose risks, its consistent performance and role in global payments establish it as one of the best crypto coins for 2025. Unveiling the Best Crypto Coins for 2025 As traders aim to optimize returns in 2025, this selection of the best crypto coins for 2025 offers varied options to match different strategic needs. PEPE and Dogecoin are highlighted in the meme coin category, while SUI and XRP excel in utility and adoption. BlockDAG stands out as the unexpected leader, with an impressive 2,380% return for early participants, anticipating further substantial growth. Whether your focus is on community, innovation, or utility, these digital currencies promise impressive prospects for 2025, grounded in their achievements this past year.

38643091,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53946,1736227843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,What Are The Chances Of Pepe Overtaking Shiba Inu In The First Half Of 2025,https://timestabloid.com/what-are-the-chances-of-pepe-overtaking-shiba-inu-in-the-first-half/,"Pepe’s technical indicators are signaling rising momentum, with the 30-period moving average surging over the 200-period average. Such a golden cross usually indicates an incoming breakout, as Pepe’s price has yet to bounce strongly from its last-month price movement. The rise in Pepe coin RSI also signals a bullish short-term phase for the token, signaling rising demand. This move comes as Pepe is looking to outshine its old rival, Shiba Inu, within the crypto market. Moreover, the Remittix (RTX) presale has seen massive gains in Q1 of 2025, with another rally pushing the RTX price to $0.0185. Remittix has also hit another milestone in its presale funding with over $1.7M raised and 111 million tokens sold showcasing its popularity amongst smart investors. Pepe Price Prediction: Is $5 Possible In 2025? The price of Pepe has been showing impressive uptrend momentum, with a weekly gain of over 9%, hovering above the $0.000020 region . This upward momentum suggests a promising trajectory, with feature performance heavily relying on the project’s continued evolution and market dynamics as it looks to outshine Shiba Inu in the first half of 2025. If investor sentiment persists, Pepe might potentially hit the $5 region. Moreover, if the price of Pepe manages to surpass its current ATH of $0.00002825, it could establish a new ATH, solidifying its position on the market. Innovations and upgrades within the Pepe ecosystem will also play a vital role in boosting the PEPE token utility and adoption. Technical indicators support the ongoing bullish outlook, with the RSI at 52 pointing to building buying momentum. However, while its bullish potential is compelling, market volatility remains a significant factor. If unfavorable sentiment dominates, Pepe’s price movement could record a dip to the $0.00000704 region in 2025. Why Remittix Has Been Gaining Massive Attention Remittix (RTX) is a new project seeking to revolutionize cross-border payments with its unique PayFi protocol. Sending money globally has become quite expensive and difficult for many people. Remittix aims to fix this by allowing people to send money across any bank account using their crypto wallets. This will make international transfers cheap, fast, and reliable with no extra currency exchange fees, allowing Remittix to capitalize on the ever-growing $180 trillion global money transfer market. Moreover, security is a major concern for many crypto platforms, and Remittix will solve this by allowing users to retain complete control of their assets. The project has also been audited by BlockSAFU and SolidProof, which showcases its seriousness regarding security. This gives investors and users confidence, especially in an industry that is often affected by weaknesses and hacks. Remittix isn’t just for individual crypto traders. The RTX token is built for businesses looking to capitalize on cross-border payments. Companies can send multiple transactions to employees using Remittix, making it an attractive option for big investors. The RTX token’s long-term growth potential also makes it stand out. With a fixed supply and a deflationary system, the RTX price is set to increase over time. Its ongoing presale has already seen Remittix price surge to $0.0185, having raised over $1.7M in presale funding. Moreover, this price will also surge to $0.0193 in the coming days, offering investors a better chance to join now. Remittix and Pepe Record Impressive Gains Like most cryptos in the market, Pepe’s price continues to enjoy a weekly bullish outlook. If this momentum is sustained, it could lead to more gains in Pepe’s price movement as the token seeks to mirror and outshine Shiba Inu. Similarly, Remittix has also recorded a major milestone as it eyes another surge to $0.0193, with a presale funding of over $1.7M making now the best time to acquire RTX before its price increases again.

He predicts that the market will peak in mid to late March, which equates to a removal of $180 billion worth of liquidity due to quantitative tightening from January to March. “Sasa” is an essay where I explain y I think #crypto tops out in mid-Mar and then severely corrects. Until then is time to dance. https://t.co/Apt124sOjp pic.twitter.com/LKQ24GMtpq — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) January 6, 2025 The businessman believes that the Fed is exhausting all its tools to bolster demand for US Treasury debt issuance before resorting to stopping quantitative tightening. He argued that the Fed grants a leverage ratio exemption for U.S. commercial banks to resume quantitative easing. Arthur Hayes believes the markets will peak in mid-march Arthur Hayes revealed that Bitcoin bottomed in Q3 2022 after the Fed’s Reserve Repo Facility (RRP) peaked. He argued that it’s because the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, had issued fewer longer-dated coupon bonds and more shorter-dated zero-coupon bills, emptying over $2 trillion from the RRP. He claimed that it resulted in liquidity injection into the global financial market and caused crypto and U.S.-listed big tech stocks to rise as a result. Arthur Hayes also stated that the Fed cut the RRP rate by 0.30% at its December 18th, 2024 meeting, which was 0.50% more than the cut to the policy rate. He argued that it was to tether the RRP rate to the Fed Funds Rate (FFR) lower bound. Hayes disclosed that two pools of money will help keep bond yields in check. He argued that the Fed’s 10-year US Treasury yield cannot be allowed to go over 5% because it is a level where bond market volatility explodes (MOVE Index). He also argued that as long as there is liquidity in the RRP and Treasury general account (TGA), the Fed does not have to change its monetary policy and admit that fiscal policy is in play. The co-founder of BitMEX believes that the RRP will go from ~$237 billion to zero in the first quarter as money market funds (MMF) maximize their yield by withdrawing funds and purchasing higher-yielding Treasury bills (T-bill). He stated that it represents an injection of $237 billion of dollar liquidity in the first quarter. Arthur Hayes also argued that the Fed will remove $180 billion of liquidity due to QT and encourage an additional $237 billion due to the reduction in RRP balances. He believes it will total a net injection of $57 billion in liquidity. Arthur Hayes believes the Treasury will affect crypto market developments The CEO of BitMex also highlighted that Yellen said that she expects the Treasury to begin “ extraordinary measures ” to fund the USG between January 14th and 23rd. He claimed that the Treasury can either issue debt (dollar liquidity negative) or spend money from its checking account at the Fed (dollar liquidity positive). Arthur Hayes argued that the Treasury can only spend funds from its checking account ($722 billion balance) because the aggregate amount of debt cannot rise until the US Congress increases the debt ceiling. The American businessman believes that raising the debt ceiling becomes necessary. At the same time, failure to do so would result in a technical default of maturing Treasury debt or a complete government shutdown. He referred to 2024’s receipts and outlays published by the Treasury and determined that such a situation would occur between May and June of this year when the TGA balance would be completely exhausted. The crypto enthusiast maintained that it’s helpful to visualize the pace and intensity of TGA usage to fund the government and predict when drawdowns will have their maximum effect. He argued that the forward-looking nature of the markets will make the market look for a new source to score a hit of dollar liquidity. Hayes believes that at 76% depletion, March appears to be a time when the market will ask, “What’s next?”. He disclosed that the sum of the dollar liquidity amounts from the Fed and Treasury until the end of the first quarter is $612 billion. The chief investment officer of Maelstrom stated that a last-minute deal will be reached once default and shutdown become imminent and the debt ceiling is raised. At this point, he is confident that the Treasury will be free to borrow on a net basis again and must refill the TGA, resulting in negative dollar liquidity. Arthur Hayes also revealed that the other major date in the second quarter is April 15th, when tax payments are due. He referred to the TGA table and concluded that the government’s finances improved in April, which is dollar liquidity negative. He compared Bitcoin, which hit a local high of ~$73,000 in mid-March last year, then traded sideways and began its multi-month decline on April 11th, right before the 15th tax payment deadline. Arthur Hayes said that as the chief investment officer of Maelstrom, he will turn the risk dial to DEGEN mode and decide to bet on shitcoin in the rapidly developing decentralized science (DeSci) field, purchasing BIO, VITA, ATH, GROW, PSY, CRYO and NEURON.

However, this performance falls short in comparison to Pythagoras Investment Management’s Alpha Long Biased Strategy, which pushed the envelope even further. The fund, which combines a BTC base position with two uncorrelated strategies, achieved an impressive return of 204% in 2024, Pythagoras said in an email to CoinDesk. That equates to a 3x gain, significantly outpacing the 2x return a typical buy-and-hold bitcoin investor would have realized. The fund charges incentive fee only when it beats bitcoin's performance. The fund's base position in bitcoin provides direct exposure to long-term appreciation, and the two uncorrelated strategies – a momentum market timing strategy and a long-short market selection strategy – generate alpha. The momentum strategy employs machine learning and pattern recognition to adjust and optimize exposure dynamically, allowing it to capture short-term market fluctuations. Meanwhile, the long-short strategy utilizes a proprietary AI-based forecasting model to create a dollar-neutral portfolio, making long investments in tokens expected to yield superior returns while shorting those anticipated to underperform. The allocation to the three components is calibrated to maximize returns relative to bitcoin. Despite its performance, the Alpha Long Biased Strategy was Pythagoras' smallest fund, boasting assets under management (AUM) of $7 million. It suffered a 2% drawdown in December as the year-end saw BTC climb down from record highs above $108,000 to $93,000. Meanwhile, Pythagoras' Arbitrage strategy delivered a 3% return in December, ending the year with an 18% gain and $45 million in AUM. The Quant Long Short Fund generated a return of 30% in 2024, with $23 million in AUM and the Absolute Return Strategy generated a 41.7% return, gathering $158 million in client funds. Pythagoras said that the top asset gatherer of 2024 will be closed for new investors from Feb. 1. The combined AUM of the four funds grew to over $230 million from $80 million in 2023 as the bull market revved up investor confidence. Bullish outlook Pythagoras expects the bull market to continue this year, driven by positive regulatory developments in the U.S. and corporate sovereign demand for bitcoin. ""The incoming Trump administration, with its proposal on creating a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and appointing individuals favorable to our industry in key Executive Branch positions, is expected to be a major catalyst. With over 290 members of Congress who are pro-crypto, we anticipate that supportive legislation for the cryptocurrency industry will gain momentum,"" Mitchell Dong, CEO of Pythagoras, said in a note to CoinDesk. ""As the U.S. Congress explores the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, we expect some countries to attempt to front-run the U.S. in accumulating Bitcoin, should this initiative come to fruition,"" Dong added, mentioning the possibility of listed companies following MicroStrategy's lead in adopting BTC.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Trading,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 05:39:07

In anticipation of a network update, Binance has announced that it will temporarily suspend token deposits and withdrawals on the aelf ( ELF ) network on Jan. 15, 2025, at 17:00 (UTC+8). The purpose of this planned update is to enhance the overall user experience on the ELF blockchain. The upgrade is scheduled to occur at block height 252,256,057, and the process is expected to commence at approximately 18:00 UTC+8 on the same day. Block height refers to the position of a specific block within the blockchain, and the network upgrade will occur once the blockchain reaches this point. You might also like: Binance will support DASH network upgrade and hard fork Users will still be able to trade ELF tokens normally on the Binance platform during the network upgrade. However, deposit and withdrawal services will be temporarily unavailable while the upgrade is in progress. To avoid any potential interruptions, Binance strongly advises users to deposit their ELF tokens in advance. Once the upgrade is complete and the network is stable, deposits and withdrawals will resume automatically without further notice. ELF is a decentralized blockchain for cloud computing that aims to provide a scalable ecosystem. Its primary goal is to create a flexible blockchain capable of supporting various industries and applications. At the time of writing, ELF is priced at $0.5016 with a market valuation of $369.18 million. The token’s $28.57 million in trading volume demonstrates a 34.36% drop in the past 24 hours. Token upgrades refer to modifications made to a blockchain network’s core protocol or structure to improve its usability, security, or overall functionality. In this case, it is expected that the ELF network upgrade is expected to boost both performance and scalability, which are essential for the continued growth and success of the ecosystem. Throughout 2024, Binance has actively supported network upgrades for several prominent tokens. In April 2024, Binance supported the Ethereum ( ETH ) Shanghai upgrade, a critical step in ETH’s transition to a more scalable and sustainable network, which allowed staked ETH to be withdrawn. Binance also supported the Dash network upgrade and hard fork , which took place on January 7, 2025. This upgrade aimed to enhance the network’s security and performance. Additionally, Binance has announced its support for the Optimism network update, scheduled for January 10, 2025, which focuses on improving scalability and efficiency within the Optimism ecosystem.

But then he pulled a classic Trump move, accusing China of “ripping off” the United States. It’s the same tune he’s been singing since 2018 when he started what might go down as one of the most aggressive economic standoffs in modern history. But then Trump also called Xi “strong” and “powerful,” adding that he’s “revered in China.” Flattery, maybe. But this isn’t just about who gets along. It’s about the two biggest economies in the world. How it started: Tariffs, deals, and broken promises The US-China trade war has been years in the making, starting when Trump hit China with tariffs on $34 billion worth of goods the last time he was in office. He accused Beijing of intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices. China retaliated almost instantly, matching the US tariffs dollar for dollar. And just like that, a trade war was on. The two sides escalated quickly. By 2019, the US had tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. China targeted $110 billion in US goods. But it wasn’t all fire and fury. In January 2020, both countries hit pause—kind of. They signed the Phase One trade deal, which was supposed to ease tensions. And it sounded like a win on paper. China promised to buy $200 billion more in American goods, and the US agreed to lower tariffs on $120 billion worth of Chinese imports. But there was a catch. Tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods stayed. Spoiler alert—those numbers didn’t stick, and the underlying issues never got fixed. Fast forward to the Biden administration. If anyone thought Joe Biden would go soft on China, they were wrong. In fact, that guy doubled down. His administration kept the Trump-era tariffs and added new ones on strategic sectors like electric vehicles and medical supplies. By December 2021, tariffs on over $300 billion worth of Chinese goods were still alive and kicking. What’s happening now: Trump’s back, and so is the tension Then came 2024. A new round of tariffs hit $18 billion in Chinese imports. Clean energy and semiconductors, two areas critical to US interests, were the main targets. Now, it’s January 2025, and Trump is less than 2 weeks away from being back in the Oval Office. During his campaign, he promised tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods. He also made it clear that Chinese investments in the US would face increased scrutiny. Though just days into the new year, Beijing announced export restrictions on 28 US companies. Big names like Lockheed Martin and Boeing Defense are on that list. Economists have been warning us for months. If Trump’s proposed tariffs become reality, the US could see inflation rise even higher. Supply chains, still fragile from years of disruptions, might buckle under the pressure, putting the entire global economy is in danger.

The asset is up 10% in the past week, retaking the $102,000 level late Monday and reversing nearly all losses from early December. It fell from a peak of nearly $109,000 on Dec.17 to a local low of just below $92,000 on Dec.30, which momentarily sparked fears of a deeper downturn. The surge comes as U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) raked in $987 million on Monday, their highest since Nov.21, data from SoSoValue shows. Fidelity’s FBTC led inflows with $370 million pouring in, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $209 million and Ark Invest’s ARKB with $71 million. Nine of the twelve ETFs recorded inflows, with none showing outflows in a standout day for the cohort. Trump’s expected crypto policies and broader economic plans have brought back positive sentiment among traders — bumping up BTC prices in a usual precursor to an altcoin rally. “We believe that the demand for bitcoin is manifesting itself after a downbeat Fed outlook in late December put the brakes on a Santa Claus rally,” Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message Tuesday. “Now that traders have wrapped up their vacations and are back to work, they've resumed purchases of Bitcoin, crypto, and stocks in a bullish trend as we approach Donald Trump's inauguration,” Mei added. Some traders are targeting the $109,000 level in the short term before a bullish trend is confirmed, setting the stage for even higher prices. “So far, the technical picture looks like a classic correction completion with a resumption of the growth from the Fibonacci retracement level of 61.8% of the rally since the beginning of November,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, in an email. “This scenario will be confirmed if the historical highs of around $109,000 are confidently breached. At the same time, we expect Bitcoin's growth to accelerate after the $100,000 mark.” Fibonacci levels are a technical analysis tool to identify potential support and resistance points where price movements might pause or reverse. Some traders believe that tracking Fibonacci levels can offer predictive value in identifying key price levels — which may become a self-fulfilling prophecy that causes price reactions in the market. As such, market volatility is expected to stay low until the U.S. Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report on Friday, which some believe will kick-start the new trading year with “decision-makers fully back at work,” per Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA. Strong NFP data could strengthens the U.S. dollar, potentially leading to higher interest rates, which can negatively affect risk assets like stocks and bitcoin. “However, the highest volatility event for the month is priced to be FOMC at the end of the month as the economic stats are priced to show 'soft landing' signs soon,” Fan added. BTC trades just above $101,600 in Asian morning hours Tuesday, up 2% in the past 24 hours.

As these whales abandon their positions in established tokens, they are flocking to DTX’s record-breaking presale, which has already raised an impressive $11.3 million. As for the future of these alternate currencies and whether the integration of DTX may result in the creation of promising entrants in the cryptocurrency world, what would happen next is highly speculative. The Current Market Dynamics of Avalanche (AVAX) and Solana (SOL) Avalanche (AVAX), currently priced at $44 with a market cap of $18 billion, has been experiencing a period of consolidation. Many investors are careful due to recent fluctuations even though analysts believe its future holds promise. Similarly, in terms of market resilience, despite the recent volatility, Solana (SOL) is at $214, and its market capitalization is $103 billion. While both cryptocurrencies played a significant role in molding the DeFi ecosystem, they are encountering difficulties that have compelled some investors to look elsewhere. DTX Exchange is appealing because of the original trading techniques it employs. As the first crypto-native platform to offer stocks, forex, ETF trading, and over 100,000 currency pairs, DTX is positioned to attract diverse traders. With its presale currently in the seventh stage and a token price of $0.14, set to rise to $0.16 in the next stage, investors are eager to capitalize on this unique opportunity. DTX Exchange Is About to Transform the DeFi Landscape DTX Exchange is not just a different trading platform but assures to revolutionize how traders interface with the financial sector. With features such as up to 1000x leverage, users can magnify their trading power significantly, turning a mere $100 into access to $100,000 in liquidity. Such leverage becomes appropriate for achieving high returns in a turbulent market. Moreover, DTX holders enjoy governance rights and can participate in profit-sharing through the Rebate Program. This structure encourages people with more tokens created through the blockchain to take an interest in the system. In doing so, it fosters a community-based atmosphere that makes the service more satisfying, hence promoting loyalty among the users. The DTX Exchange has already garnered over 300,000 wallet addresses and demonstrated impressive transaction speeds of 100,000 TPS during its testnet phase. Such metrics indicate robust infrastructure capable of handling high volumes of trading activity without compromising performance. DTX Is the Future Prospect That Is Aiming for $5 As more investors pivot from Avalanche and Solana towards DTX Exchange , the potential for explosive growth becomes increasingly tangible. Analysts predict that the price of DTX could go up by 3,000% in 2025 – a fantastic number that catches the interest of all kinds of investors. The upcoming debut of tokenized ETFs on the DTX platform further boosts growth, those in restricted jurisdictions can easily access these investment vehicles through this feature. As regulatory landscapes evolve and more traditional financial products integrate with cryptocurrencies, platforms like DTX are poised to benefit immensely. Additionally, with major players like Grayscale and VanEck actively pursuing approval for Solana ETFs, there’s a growing sentiment that Solana (SOL) could experience significant price movements if such products gain traction. However, this potential upside does not overshadow the immediate excitement surrounding DTX. Conclusion Therefore, in the face of the market pressures and uncertainties affecting Avalanche (AVAX) and Solana (SOL), the movement of investors towards DTX Exchange can represent a broader direction of the whole cryptocurrency sector, which values creativity and flexibility rather than the accustomed stability. Another aspect that draws investors to DTX is the available high-leverage opportunities, governance rights given to token holders, and limitless types of traded assets. Given that its presale is almost ending, with price targets being projected at this striking price of $5 within the short run, prudent investors should consider including it in their baskets today. In 2025, everyone will be keen to know if DTX can live up to its expectations and redefine trading.

Bitcoin’s Trump-Fuelled Rally At Risk Ahead Of FOMC Meeting Since pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump secured victory in the November presidential election, Bitcoin has climbed an impressive 47%, rising from approximately $67,500 on November 4 to around $99,700 as of January 6. Related Reading: Metaplanet Bitcoin Reserves Grow With Fresh $61 Million Purchase While further gains are anticipated during the so-called “Trump rally” leading up to the January 20 inauguration, the momentum might stall ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later in January, says 10x Research’s Markus Thielen. Thielen predicts a “positive start” to January for BTC, followed by a slight dip before the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data release on January 15. A favorable CPI report could reignite optimism, potentially fueling another rally before Trump’s inauguration. However, Thielen cautions that bullish momentum may wane ahead of the FOMC meeting on January 29. Latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows that interest rates are likely to remain unchanged following the upcoming FOMC meeting. The tool currently predicts a 90.9% chance of interest rates remaining 425 and 450 basis points (BPS). Bitcoin’s decline of approximately 15% to $92,900 following the December 18 FOMC meeting underscores the Fed’s significant influence. This drop came after the Fed signaled only two rate cuts for 2025 instead of five, reinforcing Thielen’s view that the Fed’s decisions are the “primary risk” to BTC’s current bullish trajectory. Thielen stated: We anticipate lower inflation this year, though it may take some time for the Federal Reserve to recognize and respond to this shift formally. Thielen also cited institutional participation as a key factor influencing Bitcoin’s short-term price action, with metrics like stablecoin minting rates and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows serving as indicators of institutional interest. Institutional Interest In Bitcoin Continues To Rise Although US spot Bitcoin ETFs faced significant outflows at the end of December, fresh inflows have sparked optimism about rising institutional interest in the premier cryptocurrency. Data from SoSoValue notes that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $908 million in inflows on January 3. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Face ‘Demand Shocks’ In 2025 Due To Growing Institutional Interest: Report In addition, several major BTC mining firms such as MARA and Hut 8 are bolstering their BTC reserves. Technology firms such as Canada-based video-sharing platform Rumble also recently unveiled a $20 million BTC treasury strategy. A separate report by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex predicts Bitcoin could surge to $200,000 by mid-2025, despite minor price pullbacks. At press time, BTC trades at $101,555, up 3.7% in the last 24 hours.

Meanwhile, the rejection at $4.2 caused the rally to shed off over 50% of its gains, bringing the token back to its initial levels. However, the WLD price has begun to rise and is about to undergo a parabolic recovery, keeping the bullish hopes alive. The change in market dynamics appears to have kept the whales more vigilant over the price action. Data from Santiment indicates millions of WLD have been transferred to Binance and Okex, which has raised some eyebrows as it fuels a bearish trajectory. The tokens moving back into exchanges is not good for the healthy rally as it could promote a potential sell or swap action. Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the WLD price rally that is heading towards the pivotal resistance zone. The WLD price found a support base at $2 and, after accumulating gains around the range, triggered a notable rebound. Although the volume remains above the average range, favouring the bulls, the bearish possibility looms over the rally. The Gaussian channel that helps to identify the trend patterns has just flipped bearish, which raises concerns over the next price action. Besides, the RSI, which is undergoing a parabolic recovery, also shows a possibility of a breakdown. Therefore, the Worldcoin price is expected to face bearish pressure, which may marginally drag the levels below $2.5. Meanwhile, support at $2.417 seems to be extremely strong, which may help the price trigger a strong rebound shortly elevating the levels to the resistance zone between $2.9 and $3.05. Beyond this range, the WLD price may not face strong resistance, which may be equivalent to a discovery phase. Hence, the bulls are required to manifest acute strength at these levels and secure the levels above $4. Meanwhile, a rise above the 2024 highs at $4.16 may pave the way for the Worldcoin (WLD) price to achieve levels above $5, which is significant to reclaim a double-digit figure.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|WLD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-07 06:05:40

Giants like Mara Holdings, Riot Platforms, and CleanSpark are leading the charge, raising $3.7 billion since November. The timing is no coincidence. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $100,000 last month, giving miners a golden chance to convert hype into hard cash. With Donald Trump now officially back in the White House, promising that BTC will be “mined, minted, and made in the USA,” the stakes have never been higher. High costs amid slashed rewards Last year’s halving cut mining rewards from 900 coins a day to just 450. This is built into Bitcoin’s code to make the asset scarcer and, theoretically, more valuable. But for miners, it’s like being asked to do twice the work for half the pay. CoinShares, the investment company, dropped some hard truths in their recent data. The average cost to produce one Bitcoin for US-listed miners jumped 13% last quarter to $55,950. But that’s just the base cost. Throw in depreciation and stock-based compensation, and you’re looking at $106,000 per coin. Here’s the thing: Bitcoin is currently trading around $102,000. “If the price didn’t rise, then we would have started to see quite a few start to turn rigs off or go bust,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. So why aren’t they folding? Because they’ve got a secret weapon: the soaring hash price. This key metric for mining profitability has jumped 32% since Trump’s election win, giving miners just enough breathing room to keep their rigs humming. Trump’s Bitcoin boost Trump’s victory has electrified the crypto market, especially in the mining sector. His commitment to making BTC a fully American enterprise is giving miners a reason to double down on their investments. Mara Holdings CEO Fred Thiel said the company’s entire business model is now about “accumulating as much BTC as [we] can.” Right now, the company holds nearly 45,000 Bitcoin, worth over $4.4 billion. Riot Platforms and others are also following a new playbook, taking inspiration from MicroStrategy’s strategy of issuing long-term convertible bonds to buy BTC. These miners are flipping their treasuries into Bitcoin reserves, keeping every new coin they mine. But while Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance has miners cheering, it hasn’t solved their biggest problem: energy. Mining operations eat up massive amounts of power. The US Energy Information Agency estimates that BTC mining already uses 2.3% of the country’s electricity grid. And in Texas, the top state for mining, regulators are stepping in. Any data center using over 75 megawatts of power annually must now provide detailed energy usage reports. That’s no small feat in a state where energy demand from large users is expected to jump 60% by 2025. AI vs. Bitcoin miners: The new battleground Miners aren’t just competing with each other anymore. They’re up against artificial intelligence developers, and these tech giants are bringing bigger budgets and even more aggressive strategies. AI and Bitcoin mining both rely on high-powered GPUs, and right now, AI is winning the battle for resources. Analysts predict that much of Bitcoin’s computational power could move overseas in the coming years. It’s basic economics: is the grid’s best use as a BTC mining facility or as an AI data center? Realistically speaking, AI is looking like the smarter bet. Faced with this uphill battle, some miners are going global. Mara is planning to move half its operations offshore by 2028, targeting countries with surplus energy like Kenya, the UAE, and Paraguay. These regions offer cheaper power and fewer regulations, making them ideal for miners looking to stay competitive. Other companies are taking a different approach, pivoting into AI themselves. Hut 8, Core Scientific, and Hive are leasing their data centers to AI hyperscalers, turning what used to be mining hubs into profitable AI facilities. It’s a risky move, but one that could pay off big if the AI boom continues. Even with Bitcoin trading at $100,000, miners are feeling the heat. The collective hash rate—essentially the total computing power securing the Bitcoin network—hit an all-time high last Friday. That’s great for network security, but terrible for miners, as it means even more competition.

These coins have grabbed the attention of investors and Gen Z/Millennial crypto fanatics across Australasia, looking to catch the next big wave. Meme coins have exploded in popularity over the years, gaining momentum from the likes of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and other big names in the space. The recent surge of interest in meme coins has opened up new investment opportunities, and BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the top contenders. What sets it apart from the rest? The Play2Earn (P2E) game , a highly anticipated referral program, and staking rewards that offer an eye-popping 90% annual percentage yield (APY).

Along with that, we’ll dive into Moo Deng and Fartcoin to see how they stack up in the ever-evolving meme coin market. Let’s explore what makes these coins stand out and why they’re worth keeping an eye on. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin of the Future BTFD Coin’s presale has been nothing short of explosive. Launched at a low price of $0.000004 per coin, it has surged to its current price of $0.000142, with over 62 billion BTFD coins sold and more than $5 million raised. That’s some serious momentum for a meme coin, especially in such a short amount of time. But why has BTFD Coin caught the attention of so many crypto enthusiasts? One of the key drivers of its success is the 90% APY offered on staking. For investors looking to hold onto their BTFD coins for the long term , staking offers an excellent opportunity to earn passive income. Plus, with a maximum supply of 1 trillion coins, the potential for massive price appreciation is there, especially as the presale nears its end. But BTFD Coin isn’t just about staking rewards. The Play2Earn game, which is set to be launched in the coming months, adds a whole new layer of excitement to the project. With a gaming experience that ties into the coin’s ecosystem, BTFD Coin is positioning itself as more than just a meme coin. The referral program also adds an additional incentive for those who bring others into the fold. The community behind BTFD Coin is strong and growing, which could lead to increased demand and higher prices as the project matures. Let’s talk about the investment potential. At Stage 13, the price of BTFD Coin is $0.000142. If you were to invest $40,000, you’d be purchasing approximately 281,690,140 BTFD coins. Now, let’s say that at the end of the presale, the coin hits $0.0006. Your $40,000 investment would be worth a staggering $169,014. That’s a massive potential return, and it’s one of the reasons why many investors are eyeing BTFD Coin as a solid choice for the future.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Some analysts claim that Intel Markets is replicating the SOL price trajectory and is ready to become the next Solana of this bull run as a 50x altcoin rally approaches. Table of Contents SOL analysis: Solana’s trajectory and future predictions Intel Markets: The new frontier of crypto trading INTL to mirror SOL price charts of 2021 The cryptocurrency market is positioned for an extraordinary surge, with analysts forecasting the altcoin sector could achieve a $7 trillion market capitalization by 2025. This projection indicates a fivefold increase from current valuations, driven by technical indicators resembling patterns observed before the historic 2021 bull run. If the pattern plays out, a historic alt season could be around the corner. Experts claim that the impending altcoin rally is going to push Intel Markets (INTL) to new highs with the INTL coin replicating the previous highs projected by the SOL price in 2021. The emerging platform is ready to become the next Solana of this bull run with an altcoin rally. SOL analysis: Solana’s trajectory and future predictions As of January 2025, Solana (SOL) , a high-performance blockchain known for its speed and low transaction costs, has maintained its position as a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market. Despite facing setbacks, including network outages and a significant drop in market value, SOL price has made a remarkable recovery, driven by innovation and increasing adoption across decentralized finance and NFT sectors. In recent months, SOL price has been bolstered by key partnerships and technological improvements, including the launch of “Project Ironclad,” a scaling solution to enhance transaction throughput. These efforts have contributed to a more stable and resilient network, gaining attention from both developers and investors. Additionally, the Solana Foundation has been working on fostering ecosystem growth, particularly in areas like decentralized applications (dApps) and enterprise adoption. The recent uptrend is attributed to the broader market recovery and Solana’s strengthened fundamentals. Despite the positive momentum, Solana faces ongoing competition from Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain, and new entrants like Intel Markets. With continuous upgrades and a thriving developer community, Solana remains a promising project for the future of blockchain technolog, but the current session witnesses INTL becoming the next Solana of this bull run. Intel Markets: The new frontier of crypto trading One popular altcoin that has delivered 700% gains is Intel Markets . This solid project is designed to address real-world challenges in crypto trading, combining AI, blockchain, and DeFi. INTL is positioned to reshape the $264 billion market. The platform will use advanced AI algorithms to create self-learning trading robots, enabling precise, high-speed trades across multiple markets. With its intuitive platform, retail traders will access sophisticated trading strategies without needing advanced technical knowledge. At $0.07 per token, INTL offers a low entry point with a high ceiling for growth. In its presale stages, Intel Markets has already raised over $5 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. Analysts project a 13,000% rally for INTL, mirroring SHIB’s historical rise but supported by solid fundamentals and utility. INTL to mirror SOL price charts of 2021 During its peak in 2021, SOL prices hit an all-time high, creating overnight millionaires. Looking at the price increase of Intel Markets, it’s evident that INTL shares many similarities to Solana’s 2021 rally. Increasing from $0.009 to $0.073, the value of Intel Markets has grown massively in the last couple of months. With an announced listing price of $0.11, early backers stand to gain from the launch of INTL tokens on tier-1 exchanges. Market experts have compared SOL price’s pre-rally consolidation phase and Intel Market’s current chart patterns. Both assets demonstrate rising interest from investors. While the SOL price breakout was driven by community hype, INTL’s trajectory is supported by tangible use cases and a growing demand for more innovative trading tools. This combination of market sentiment and real-world utility positions Intel Markets for explosive growth. To learn more about Intel Markets, visit the presale website , Telegram , and Twitter .

In contrast, 1Fuel (OFT) has emerged as a beacon of optimism in the crypto market. Its innovative peer-to-peer exchange has captured the attention of the crypto community. Coupled with bullish growth predictions and a presale that presents a unique opportunity to invest at the lowest price, it’s no wonder analysts expect a 100x growth for 1Fuel in 2025. Read on to uncover why 1Fuel is a rising star in the DeFi landscape. SHIB’s Internet Hype Dies Down Shiba Inu (SHIB), which was once a crowd favorite, has seen its hype fade recently. Over the past month, the token dropped by 20%, as investors are surrounded by a bearish sentiment. SHIB has experienced a major decrease in its burn rate, which contributes to its decline. Following a rejection at its range high, SHIB’s price correction seems poised to continue in the short-term. The long-term outlook remains optimistic with the possibility of breaking out from its range in 2025, positioning it as a token to watch in 2025. But, SHIB’s reliance on internet buzz makes its growth trajectory unpredictable. Wallets like Core Wallet and Trust Wallet are essential for securing tokens like SHIB, but investors are turning their attention to 1Fuel which is in its presale. Investors Turn to 1Fuel From The Presale Stage 1Fuel (OFT) is currently in its presale stage and has been drawing increasing interest from investors, including SHIB whales seeking higher returns. With over 114 million tokens sold and surpassing the $1 million mark, 1Fuel’s presale has gained significant momentum. At its current price of $0.012, this is the lowest price investors will ever see for 1Fuel. The anticipation surrounding OFT’s potential 100x growth has positioned it a token to watch in 2025. 1Fuel stands out with its advanced features, including seamless cross-chain one-click transactions, which are not possible in known platforms like Core Wallet and Trust Wallet. It is also fitted with AI-driven tools that improve portfolio management and an integrated crypto card for using digital assets in everyday transactions. Another feature is 1Fuel’s privacy mixer for enhanced anonymity. This, plus the disposable wallets and cold storage, makes 1Fuel suitable for security-conscious investors and gives it an edge over Core Wallet and Trust Wallet. 1Fuel OFT has also established itself as a top P2P exchange crypto, capturing attention in the DeFi space. 1Fuel’s P2P Exchange Captures Attention in the Crypto Space The P2P exchange within 1Fuel is powered by smart contracts and a decentralized order-matching engine, enabling a robust platform for users to trade assets. By supporting cross-chain trading through the use of atomic swaps and cross-chain bridges, the P2P exchange allows for seamless asset exchanges across blockchain networks. This gives it an edge over Core Wallet and Trust Wallet, allowing fluid transactions within the crypto space. 1Fuel’s P2P exchange offers key benefits to users, like eliminating intermediaries to lower fees. Users retain full control of their assets during trades, reducing the risks of hacks, fraud or exchange failures. All of these benefits drive growth in 1Fuel’s value as a top P2P exchange crypto. Analysts Predict Sky-High Growth for 1Fuel in 2025 As a leader in the DeFi space, 1Fuel OFT is fueling excitement among SHIB whales. With the exciting ongoing presale, you can secure 1Fuel OFT tokens at the lowest price. Join the presale today and be a part of the future of cryptocurrencies.

This formation suggests a significant breakout is imminent, with January 16, 2025, marked as the latest date for a decisive move. The direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for XRP’s performance in the first quarter of 2025, and the analyst has expressed confidence in an upward breakout. #XRP – Perfect Symmetrical Triangle: What Comes Next? Here’s the scoop, #XRPFamily : 1⃣Timing the Move : By no later than 16th January 2025, we’re set for a decisive breakout. This move will set the tone for Q1 2025. Scenario 1 – Break to the Upside : If we… pic.twitter.com/OJCYLxsd7x — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 5, 2025 Symmetrical Triangle Formation The symmetrical triangle is a common chart pattern in technical analysis. It represents a period of consolidation. During this phase, the price oscillates between converging trendlines, indicating that buyers and sellers are evenly matched. As the triangle narrows, market pressure builds, culminating in a breakout. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the current formation is a perfect symmetrical triangle, with both trendlines converging evenly. He also identifies key levels for this potential move. Key Scenarios for Q1 2025 XRP is currently trading at $2.38, and two primary scenarios emerge from EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis: Upside Breakout: If XRP breaches the upper resistance of the triangle, it could trigger a strong bullish rally. EGRAG notes that this scenario would likely lead to what the analyst described as “fireworks,” signaling robust upward momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A breakout could propel XRP to $2.60, a crucial resistance level recently identified by another analyst. Following this run, the asset could climb to extended targets as high as $3.77. Downside Breakout: Conversely, if XRP falls below the lower support line, it could signal bearish dominance, resulting in a challenging start to 2025. EGRAG warns that this outcome might dampen investor sentiment for the quarter. This bearish scenario might see XRP decline to $2.00 or lower, potentially testing support at $1.64 and $1.37. When Will XRP Make This Important Move? According to EGRAG CRYPTO, the breakout is expected no later than January 16. Whether the price moves upward or downward, the result is anticipated to influence XRP’s trajectory well into Q1 2025. However, with Donald Trump’s inauguration around the corner, a bearish breakout might not last long, as investors and analysts expect a massive rally after the inauguration. If the asset experiences a bullish breakout, the excitement following the inauguration could also give it a massive boost, potentially sending it to a new all-time high.

Altcoins Market On The Cusp Of Change: Will Bullish Momentum Prevail? Market expert Patrick H recently shared insights on social media, stating, “The altcoins market is attempting to build a new bullish structure. Are we heading for higher levels, or is another rejection more likely?” This query shared among market players signifies the careful optimism present in the altcoin realm as it contemplates the possibilities of a trend reversal. Related Reading: XRP Eyes $11 Breakout, But A Correction Might Come First—Analyst On this matter, the expert unveiled in a recent analysis that the daily chart of the total altcoin market cap (excluding the top 10 cryptocurrencies) reveals important developments. After enduring a prolonged bearish phase characterized by a descending channel—marked by lower highs (LH) and lower lows (LL)—the market appears to be on the verge of a significant shift. In addition, recent activity indicates a breakout from this descending channel, suggesting that bearish momentum may be waning. Importantly, a higher low (HL) has formed around the $330 billion mark, establishing a critical support level, serving as the first indication of a possible bullish shift in the market’s trajectory. Currently, the altcoin market is facing resistance at the $375 billion level, where it is consolidating following the breakout. For a full confirmation of a bullish market structure shift, the market must achieve a clear higher high (HH) at approximately $400 billion. Successfully breaking this level would solidify the reversal and could lead to a rally targeting $600 billion as the next local stop. Conversely, if the market experiences a failed breakout—failing to reclaim the $400 billion mark and subsequently reversing—investors should closely monitor key support levels at $330 billion and $317 billion. A retest of the descending channel breakout could occur, and a breakdown below $317 billion would invalidate the bullish setup, signaling a potential return to the downtrend. Can Cardano Continue Its Impressive Price Climb? Over the past week, Cardano has emerged as a standout performer, experiencing a substantial price increase of 31%. This surge has enabled the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to regain the critical $1.11 level. In stark contrast, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, recently achieved a new all-time high of $108,000. Despite this, Cardano’s current price remains over 64% below its all-time high of $3.09, which was reached in September 2021. However, with the bullish scenarios outlined by market expert Patrick H. indicating a potential rally in the altcoin market in the coming months, Cardano and other altcoins may continue to experience upward price momentum.

The recent breakout and formation of a higher low are promising signs, yet the path forward remains uncertain. A successful push above the $400 billion threshold is essential to confirm a bullish reversal and unlock further upside potential.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) are reclaiming some of their previous positions after a recent slump. Moreover, market analysts like Whales HQ and Posty have made some bold price predictions for them. However, DTX Exchange (DTX) is buzzing with its revolutionary online trading platform. It recently launched the test version of this hybrid exchange, which could become a fan favorite among millions. It has already onboarded over 300K users while giving early investors a 600% return. Some experts hint that this phase seven presale star could be the next 5x crypto coin in 2025. DTX Exchange (DTX) Seen as a Revolutionary Force Amid 600% Price Surge While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) are making comebacks, DTX Exchange (DTX) is also turning some heads. Recently, CoinMarketCap listed the DTX native token, which will bring countless new traders to this project. Demand is already high, with DTX Exchange raising over $11M in its presale so far. Projections indicate this number may reach $20M before this month ends. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange announced it has launched its hybrid trading platform that combines the best of CEX and DEX. Although still a work in progress, users will experience trading over 120K asset classes like bonds, crypto coins, and stocks in total privacy. Plus, users will get to use up to 1000x leverage on assets. This means a $100 investment could open up access to liquidity of up to $100K. The DTX token is another big part of its ecosystem. Those who hold this crypto coin will get governance voting rights and a portion of the trading fee revenue. As a result, millions of DTX tokens have been sold so far. Currently, it costs just $0.14 in phase seven of its presale, a 600% surge from its starting price of $0.02. However, a top-tier crypto exchange like Uniswap listing is expected to trigger a rally to $0.20. This could make DTX one of the altcoins to watch. Whales HQ: The Price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) Will Reach $0.01 Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the meme coin titans showing green price charts recently. According to CoinMarketCap, its value has jumped nearly 10% in the past week alone. During that time, the Shiba Inu price moved between around $0.000021 and over $0.000023. Crypto analyst Whales HQ also excited traders with his Shiba Inu price prediction. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this meme coin will soar to $0.01 soon. This price target has put more eyes on Shiba Inu (SHIB). But, some traders are still cautious about the Shiba Inu coin. Its value has already soared nearly 150% on the YTD chart. This could mean that this meme coin has seen its highest upswing. Therefore, many of them are turning to DTX for faster returns instead. Ethereum (ETH) Price Movement Is Setting Up Perfectly, Analyst Claims Ethereum (ETH) is another altcoin riding a bullish wave. On the one-week chart, the price of Ethereum moved between nearly $3,400 and over $3,600. In other words, CoinMarketCap shows over a 5% surge in just a few short days. Market expert Posty says that the trading plan for Ethereum (ETH) is clear this week. According to his X post, its daily structure is set up perfectly. As an Ethereum price prediction, he said this token may soar over $4,000 soon. Although the Ethereum coin could see a price jump soon, its high market cap may slow it down. It now sits at nearly $440B, which means ETH will need a lot of new money for its price to skyrocket. But DTX will not face this issue. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Outshine Shiba Inu (SHIB) & Ethereum (ETH)? Crypto coins are in for a big year as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) regain their stability. However, the radical transformative power of DTX Exchange (DTX) may make it stand out. It will introduce groundbreaking technology, a fair launch model that benefits both whales and retail investors, and a low market cap, which means faster price growth. Therefore, market analysts consider DTX the next possible 5x altcoin in 2025.

Notably, this altcoin has soared 20.76% this year, making it one of the best-performing altcoins of 2025. TradingView: HBAR/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) supports the HBAR coin price chart in the 1D time frame since the year started. This highlights a strong bullish outlook for the altcoin this week. Further, the MACD indicator records a constant decline in its red histogram. Moreover, its averages successfully display a positive crossover in the price chart. This indicates that the price of Hedera may continue gaining value in the upcoming time. Will Hedera Price Hit $0.50 This Month? Suppose, a bullish breakout occurs, under such a situation, the HBAR coin price could retest its important resistance level of $0.3370. Maintaining the value above that level could set the price for this altcoin to head toward its upper high of $0.393 this month. On the flip side, if the bulls fail to breach the resistance level of the triangle pattern, this altcoin could retest its low of $0.278. Furthermore, if the bearish influence intensifies, this could pull the price of Hedera token toward its $0.25 mark. Curious to find out if the Hedera price will achieve the $1 mark?

Price discovery occurs when an asset enters new territory and makes consecutive new all-time highs. At the time of writing, BTC was just 6% away from its Dec. 17 peak price of $108,135, according to CoinGecko. It has gained more than 10% in a week and broke above the $100,000 level again during late trading on Jan. 6. BTC hit an intraday high of $102,500 during early trading in Asia on Tuesday before falling back slightly. Most Bullish Year of The Cycle “We’re now in the first full week of the post-halving year, which is historically the most bullish year of the cycle,” the analyst added. $BTC Has only just started its price discovery phase.

Exciting times. pic.twitter.com/1s10e5JS54 — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) January 6, 2025 CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju was also bullish, commenting on this bull market on X on Jan. 7. “This Bitcoin bull cycle might turn out to be the longest ever. New liquidity sources are steadily fueling the market, and more are waiting to be unlocked.” However, some analysts at the firm didn’t agree , predicting that the bull market may end in the first half of this year. ITC founder Benjamin Cowen observed that Bitcoin would need to reclaim a short-term trendline, which could put its price at $120,000 by the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.

He also said that 2025 will be the year of the bull market peak, 2026 will be the year of the bear market, and “2027 will be the bottoming out year to precede an entirely brand new future bull market.” Even Bitcoin educator and investor Tone Vays said he was back in the market at current levels after selling in November. “Now that the year is over, I am now back to fully long in Bitcoin as of this afternoon at a price of around 100k!” Elsewhere on Crypto Markets Crypto market capitalization is up marginally at $3.74 trillion at the time of writing, mostly due to Bitcoin’s 2.7% daily gain into six-figure territory again. Ethereum hasn’t mirrored the momentum with a short spike above $3,700, only to fall back again on Tuesday morning. The altcoins were mostly flat, with minor gains for Tron (TRX), Avalanche (AVAX), and Hyperliquid (HYPE).

Table of Contents Understanding the evolving crypto market in 2025 Sui and Floki: Analyzing their market position and potential Lightchain AI rising: Why it could outperform Sui and Floki in 2025 As the cryptocurrency landscape progresses, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a formidable contender for 2025, with the potential to eclipse the prominence of projects like Sui and Floki. While Sui and Floki have garnered attention through their avant-garde ecosystems and meme-driven allure, Lightchain AI distinguishes itself by synergizing blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, delivering pragmatic, real-world applications. Currently in its presale phase, Lightchain AI has amassed over $8.5 million, with tokens priced at $0.0048, signaling robust investor enthusiasm. With an unwavering emphasis on scalability and smart solutions, Lightchain AI is set to emerge as a pivotal force in the forthcoming cryptocurrency bull market, appealing to both veteran investors and novices seeking transformative opportunities. Understanding the evolving crypto market in 2025 The changing crypto market in 2025 is likely to have more new ideas, with more big companies using it and clear rules helping its shape. Blockchai͏n answers that aim on growing, being good for the earth, and real use will get more attention, with projects such as Ethereum 2.0 and Lightchain AI showing the path. DeFi places will keep changing old money systems, while AI use in blockchain will push more growth. As more people join in, a wider mix of investors will take part, moving the market towards steadiness and lasting rise. Sui and Floki: Analyzing their market position and potential Sui and Floki have carved unique positions in the crypto market, each attracting distinct investor interest. Sui, known for its high-performance blockchain and scalability, aims to enhance decentralized applications with faster transactions and greater efficiency, making it a contender in the race for blockchain dominance. In contrast, Floki, a meme coin inspired by Elon Musk’s dog, has leveraged community-driven enthusiasm, gaining attention through its ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) products and NFTs. While Sui’s utility-driven focus positions it for long-term growth, Floki’s viral appeal continues to attract speculative investments, fueling both market excitement and potential risks. Lightchain AI rising: Why it could outperform Sui and Floki in 2025 Lightchain AI is quickly gaining attention as a promising project that could outperform Sui and Floki in 2025. Unlike Sui, which focuses on high-speed transactions, and Floki, which relies on community-driven hype, Lightchain AI provides a clear roadmap with tangible use cases. Its integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence is smart, offering scalable, decentralized solutions for AI-powered applications. The platform’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) set it apart, ensuring real utility and long-term growth. With a strong presale, solid tokenomics, and a dedicated team, Lightchain AI is poised to capture investor interest. As the project progresses towards its mainnet launch in 2025, its practical value and sustainable growth make it a strong contender to surpass both Sui and Floki in the evolving crypto market.

Currently, the price action doesn’t seem impulsive enough to confirm a strong upward trend, but this could change as the market develops. There are two main scenarios to consider moving forward. Scenario 1: Corrective Rally (B-Wave Correction) The first scenario involves a broader B-wave correction . The downward movement from December 6th to December 20th is seen as an ABC structure (Wave A), and the current move upwards could be part of Wave B, forming either as an ABC or WXY structure. A WXY formation is particularly common in the crypto market. Once the B-wave tops out and a break below key support levels occurs, a C-wave down could begin, signaling the start of a bearish phase. Key Resistance and Support Levels The initial key resistance was marked by the previous swing high at $3550. With Ethereum reaching its blue target zone, the move up may be technically complete. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean a top has formed yet. The price would need to break below the most recent swing low at $3593 and support at $3515 for further confirmation that the rally has ended. Scenario 2: Bullish Scenario (New All-Time Highs) The second scenario presents a more bullish outlook. This involves a potential wave two bottom around December 20th, with Ethereum aiming for higher prices, possibly reaching new all-time highs. However, the current upward move lacks the clear impulsive characteristics typical of a third wave in Elliott Wave theory. A break above the $3800-$3880 zone could provide more evidence for this bullish outlook, but a correction could follow before Ethereum pushes higher. Key Levels to Watch Support Levels : $3593 and $3515–$3575 (Micro Support Zone). Resistance Levels : $3808 and $3880 (Potential Resistance Zone). Trend Confirmation : A break below the trend channel and the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $2400 would signal a shift to a more bearish outlook.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-07 07:45:08

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows of $987.06 million on Monday, marking their second straight day of inflows. Over these two days, the ETFs saw over $900 million in inflows each day, totaling nearly $1.89 billion. The recent jump in inflows nearly offset the streak of low demand observed in the latter half of December, during which the ETFs experienced approximately $1.9 billion in net outflows between Dec. 19 and Jan. 2. Meanwhile, the inflows seen on Monday, Jan. 6 were led by Fidelity’s FBTC which saw $370.24 million entering the fund followed by BlackRock ’s IBIT and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB which attracted $209.08 million and $152.92 million of investors’ money respectively. Biwise’s BITB, Grayscale’s spot BTC ETFs with the tickers GBTC and BTC also contributed to the positive momentum as they recorded $75.23 million, $73.79 million and $71.19 million respectively.

The remaining three BTC ETFs remained neutral. The total daily trading volume for these investment products stood at $3.96 billion on Jan. 6 much higher than the $2.59 billion recorded the previous day. The strong inflows experienced on Monday came as Bitcoin continued its upward climb, managing to surge past the $102,000 level which drove fresh enthusiasm and heightened institutional interest in Bitcoin ETF products once again. Meanwhile, last December was a standout month for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, with funds accumulating around 51,500 BTC—approximately 272% more than the 13,850 new coins that entered circulation during the month. Momentum was fueled by strong spot market activity, driving Bitcoin to an all-time high of $108,135 on Dec. 17, according to data from crypto.news.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 07:47:08

The sting was executed by Tran Minh Quang, 41, and three others who were apprehended in Dong Nai Province south of Ho Chi Minh City. Bitminer: An Overview of a Crypto Mining Scam The suspects are said to have adopted a website that they named BitMiner having registered it under the Singapore domain for the express purpose of defying investors. Investors were lured into the BitMiner cloud mining service based in Dubai and offered such mining contracts as Red Diamond, Blue Diamond, Diamond Gold, Black Diamond, and Green Diamond. With the help of fake advertising and fake trading accounts the group enrolled accomplices that used various tricks to attract potential victims and then promised them high yields. This attracted investors through forums where they were introduced to various interesting educational materials touching on mining technologies underpinned by AI. However the fact was that everything went to wallets owned by Quang and his team only. The Arrest and Investigation The Vietnamese police caught the group after investigating their well-planned con. According to the police, two suspects and one still at large used BitMiner to swindle the public by marketing a fake currency known as ‘Bincoin’ and the money of the victims. The probe is still ongoing, and authorities are in the process of naming other people involved in the crime and seeking the money that was embezzled. Fraudsters abuse the irreversible characteristic of the blockchain transaction, having the victims deposit the cash they were given in fake schemes. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hack Report of 2024: $2.3 Billion Stolen, Phishing Remains Top Threat , In the same way, new techniques relying on covering AI and deepfake technologies are also being used in investment scams and this makes it very challenging for investors to protect themselves. Thus, the case of BitMiner should be a rather loud signal, and individuals should pay more attention to what is happening in the sphere of cryptocurrencies .

According to the local newspaper Khaosod, a 31-year-old Russian national was assaulted and robbed of $20,000 in a hotel in Karon, Phuket. The two suspects, who were known associates of the victim, allegedly confronted him over an unsettled cryptocurrency debt stemming from previous business dealings in Russia. A complaint with local police alleges that the mastermind, identified as Andrei, reportedly demanded the victim repay $120,000 and attempted to force the victim into unlocking his crypto wallet, even threatening to kill him if he refused. When the victim resisted unlocking the wallet, he was repeatedly punched and kicked, eventually losing consciousness after being struck on the back of the head. The assailants then fled the scene after stealing cash and left the victim restrained in the bathroom. One suspect, Andrei, remains in Thailand, while the second, Dmitri, fled to Dubai shortly after the incident. Arrest warrants have been issued, and Thai authorities continue to track the suspects with the assistance of immigration and local police units.

In 2024 alone, the digital gold rush has fueled a wave of chilling crimes, from high-stakes kidnappings to violent extortions. In July, four men were arrested for abducting and murdering a 29-year-old tourist in Kyiv, which police said was a premeditated incident over plans to steal 3 Bitcoin. After discovering the victim owned BTC, the suspects followed and assaulted the tourist, attempting to force a Bitcoin transfer before the situation turned deadly. A month later, a similar case was reported in Santa Teresa de Cóbano beach in Puntarenas, Costa Rica. Eleven Israeli tourists were robbed of a substantial amount of Bitcoin at gunpoint by criminals dressed in police uniforms and believed to have police training.

In early December, its price rose to $2.86, its highest since 2018. This bolstered the community’s bullish sentiment. However, it has spent the weeks since then consolidating, failing to come close to this level. Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7), a prominent cryptocurrency expert, addressed this development on X, stating, “This is called a consolidation flush. Designed to shake out the limp weak-handed and prepare our true believers for the next brutal ascent.” According to him, this phase is a natural part of XRP’s growth cycle and is to strengthen the market by filtering out less committed investors. This is called a consolidation flush $XRP – Designed to shake out the limp weak handed and prepare our true believers for the next brutal ascent. This is what you wished for. So embrace the fire. And be ready now. — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) January 5, 2025 XRP’s Recent Consolidation Following XRP’s rapid ascent in November and early December, analysts anticipate a new all-time high by early January. However, the digital asset’s momentum seems to have stalled, as it has yet to experience another notable breakout. It has held its position above $2 but has failed to regain $2.86 or show any notable signs that it will surpass it soon. The consolidation period has sparked mixed reactions in the community, but Crypto Bitlord believes this is a strategic pause before XRP’s next significant upward movement. His post emphasized that this is an opportunity for long-term investors to remain steadfast, adding, “This is what you wished for. So embrace the fire. And be ready now.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Context and Bullish Milestones The broader context surrounding XRP is equally significant. January 20, 2025, is shaping up to be a pivotal date for the cryptocurrency. President-elect Donald Trump will take office, and Gary Gensler, the outgoing SEC Chair, will officially resign the same day. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins , a known advocate for cryptocurrency innovation, as Gensler’s successor. Atkins’ crypto-friendly stance has raised hopes within the industry that regulatory pressures on digital assets, including XRP, will ease. There is also speculation that the new administration will end the lawsuit against Ripple. This would positively impact XRP’s price and future adoption in the U.S. Despite the current consolidation, all signs point toward a bright future for XRP, and that explains the optimism shown by Crypto Bitlord and many others in the community. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has expressed optimism for the new year, and the XRP community shares his excitement for where XRP can go in 2025.

Currently at 46.92 and still moving downward, this indicates a bearish trend. The steep bearish slope on the indicator’s graph confirms a negative market sentiment. Moreover, as the selling activities remained considerably high, the market conditions seem unfavorable for the investors.

In his latest essay on Jan. 7, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin ( BTC ) will hit its peak by late March, pointing out the Fed’s challenges in keeping the market stable while pulling $180 billion out through quantitative tightening from January to March. At the same time, a change to the Reverse Repo Program rate will add $237 billion of liquidity, Hayes notes, explaining that money will flow into higher-yielding Treasury bills, resulting in a net liquidity injection of $57 billion in Q1. You might also like: Once again, Bitcoin beat the S&P 500 in yearly growth. Is it time to trade the index for crypto? The Treasury’s General Account will also play a role. “Bad Gurl Yellen” (Hayes’ nickname for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen) has begun “extraordinary measures” to fund the government while waiting for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. Until then, the Treasury can only spend from the TGA, which Hayes estimates will be depleted by May or June. This spending adds liquidity to the market, but once the ceiling is raised, the Treasury will need to refill its account, pulling liquidity out. Hayes believes the market will react to these liquidity shifts. He predicts Bitcoin and the whole market to peak “in mid to late March,” similar to March 2024, when Bitcoin peaked around $73,000. After that, the market might face headwinds from tax deadlines and TGA replenishment. The BitMEX co-founder believes that the Fed is “exhausting all tools at its disposal,” adding that future moves could include stopping QT or even restarting quantitative easing. For now, Hayes says liquidity conditions in Q1 suggest a temporary boost for risk assets like Bitcoin.

FTX EU, which held a MiFID II-license under the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), cost Backpack $32.7 million, the exchange said. Backpack’s new European arm will offer a full suite of crypto derivatives throughout the EU, starting out by capitalizing on its position as the only regulated perpetual futures provider across Europe, according to Armani Ferrante, CEO of Backpack Exchange. A number of crypto trading firms have applied for a MiFID license, which allows firms to also offer crypto-asset services under Europe’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regime, once a notification has been provided to the relevant competent national authority. Currently, Bitstamp and Coinbase have received their MiFID II licenses, while D2X , based in the Netherlands, has also received a license and plans to deliver USD-denominated futures and options early this year. Other new entrants also aim to shift the crypto derivatives market dominance away from the likes of Panama-based centralized exchange Deribit. Backpack’s Ferrante said the firm’s MiCA notification has been submitted and he expects to go live in the first quarter of 2025. “Even though a few firms have been able to acquire approval for a limited form of a derivatives license, we’re not aware of any players that currently offer perpetuals and are live in the EU, including Coinbase and Bitstamp,” Ferrante said via email. “Once we return FTX EU customers' funds, we’re excited to begin serving a regulated perpetual futures product as a priority.” A full suite of products is being worked on, Ferrante added, although some of these may not roll out in Q1.

As per the court timeline SEC needs to file its appeal-related brief by January 15. Based on the current US political scenario, Prominent attorney and XRP advocate John E. Deaton has outlined his predictions for Ripple’s future, suggesting the company may launch an IPO by late 2025 or early 2026. The timeline depends on how quickly Paul Atkins is confirmed as SEC Chairman. Deaton believes the SEC will withdraw its appeal, resolving the legal battle and allowing Ripple to focus on growth and an IPO. Possible outcome if SEC Appeal Deaton outlines several reasons why the SEC’s appeal is a losing battle. First, the ruling isn’t binding for other cases and doesn’t broadly apply to all cryptocurrency sales. Judge Torres only ruled that the SEC didn’t prove XRP sales in the secondary market were securities under the Howey Test. Even if the SEC won the appeal, the case would likely return to Judge Torres, who could still rule against the SEC on other grounds. If the SEC takes the case to the Supreme Court, it risks a bigger loss. The Court could set a precedent that favors cryptocurrencies , which the SEC likely wants to avoid. Deaton believes that under Paul Atkins , the SEC would recognize this risk and withdraw the appeal. Ripple would likely pay a fine, and the case would end. Moreover, with the positive outcome, XRP can attain new heights currently XRP is waiting to break its 2021 ATH of $3 target. The analyst even predicts that XRP can go even $19 if the SEC withdraws the case. The Weaknesses in the SEC’s Appeal Deaton highlights several reasons why the SEC’s appeal lacks merit. First, Judge Torres’ decision is not a binding precedent and has already been criticized by legal scholars and other judges, including Judge Rakoff in the same district. Second, the ruling’s narrow scope means it doesn’t broadly exonerate all secondary market sales of digital assets but focuses on the SEC’s failure to meet the Howey Test’s criteria in Ripple’s case. Even if the SEC were to win on appeal, the case would likely be remanded to Judge Torres, who could apply other Howey factors and potentially arrive at the same conclusion. Furthermore, Deaton notes that if the case escalates to the Supreme Court, the SEC risks a significant loss. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction for January 7 , Ripple’s IPO and Regulatory Clarity With the legal battle behind them, Ripple could focus on launching its IPO . Deaton sees this as a big step for the company and the crypto industry. Going public would give Ripple more resources and credibility while showcasing how regulatory clarity can help crypto companies grow. Deaton predicts Ripple’s SEC battle could end positively, paving the way for the company to lead crypto innovation and highlight the benefits of clear regulations. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Daily Bitcoin production also declined from 20 BTC in December 2023 to 16.5 BTC in December 2024. The company’s expansion efforts focused on its Corsicana facility in Texas, where the initial 400 MW development phase was completed. Riot CEO Jason Les highlighted a cautious approach to bringing the facility fully online, ensuring grid stability. This methodical process has temporarily delayed the full deployment of hash rate capacity. In 2024, Riot’s Bitcoin holdings surged by 141%, reaching 17,722 BTC by year’s end. This increase stemmed largely from strategic purchases, including 5,117 BTC for $510 million on December 12 and another 667 BTC for $69 million later that month. The average price of these acquisitions was $101,135 per Bitcoin. Additionally, the company announced plans to raise $500 million through convertible senior notes due in 2030 to fund further Bitcoin purchases. Riot shares climbed nearly 5%, trading at $12.88 after the updates. Earlier in 2024, Riot acquired a 9.25% stake in Canadian mining firm Bitfarms, aiming to bolster economic resilience post-Bitcoin halving. The company also experienced a significant 155% increase in its hash rate during the year, surpassing the overall network hash rate growth of 52%. Riot mined 4,828 Bitcoin in 2024 at an average net power cost of 3.4 cents per kWh. This efficiency was a key driver of its strong performance. Riot’s actions align with broader industry trends, as other firms like Marathon Digital and MicroStrategy have also expanded their Bitcoin holdings. With a focus on strategic growth and operational efficiency, Riot Platforms solidified its position as a leading player in the Bitcoin mining sector.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-07 08:13:58

A Jan. 7 announcement from the company noted that the prominent Asian cryptocurrency exchange has entered the Irish market by securing a Virtual Asset Service Provider license from the Central Bank of Ireland through HashKey Europe Limited, a member of the HashKey Group. The license permits the cryptocurrency exchange to offer several crypto-related services, including fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto trading, custodial wallet services, and the transfer of virtual assets on behalf of clients. Beyond Ireland and Hong Kong, Haskey has continued expanding its global footprint and secured licenses in Singapore , Japan, and Bermuda . The company, which recently launched its utility token HASK, views the expansion into Ireland as a “critical step toward strengthening its presence in key international markets,” per the announcement. The license comes as part of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, which introduced mandatory licensing requirements starting December 30, 2024, for all crypto service providers operating in the region.

Data from multiple sources shows an uptick in interest from whales, a colloquial term for wealthy and influential market participants, with a spike in transactions worth above $100,000 over the weekend. Such activity may serve as a precursor to a move higher. January has historically served as the memecoin’s best-performing month with an average return of 85%, data shows , though it had outlier performances of 250% and 700% in 2014 and 2021, respectively. It has a median performance of 5%, the second-highest after 8% for October. Futures markets tracking the token set a fresh record in terms of open interest on Monday, with number of active contracts zooming to 10.35 billion DOGE from 7.50 billion DOGE over the weekend. That has surpassed a March 2024 peak of 10 billion DOGE, data from CoinGlass shows. Open interest is the total number of unsettled derivative contracts. A bump in open interest can signal new money entering the market, potentially confirming current price trends and indicating upcoming volatility. High open interest might suggest a strong trend continuation. CoinDesk market analyst Omkar Godbole expects prices to reach 50 cents in the coming weeks, based on price-chart analysis. “DOGE has risen back above the closely monitored 50-day SMA, coinciding with a renewed upswing in the 10-day SMA, signaling a bullish bias,” Godbole said. “Additionally, the discount on Coinbase compared to Binance has disappeared. This suggests a strong likelihood that prices will break through the current three-day resistance at $0.40, potentially pushing toward 50 cents and beyond.” SMA, or simple moving average, is a measure of average prices for any asset over a specified period that can be used to determine resistance and support levels. “However, trading volumes on Coinbase remain low compared to the levels seen during the November rally, which warrants caution as long as the $0.40 resistance remains intact,” he added. Some expect DOGE to touch a memetic milestone level of $1 in 2025, a nearly 50% higher target than the token’s lifetime peak of 70 cents in 2021. “Dogecoin will finally hit $1, with the world’s largest and oldest memecoin touching a $100bn market cap,” Galaxy Digital head of research Alex Thorn wrote in a markets predictions post for the year. “However, the Dogecoin market cap will be eclipsed by the Department of Government Efficiency, which will identify and successfully enact cuts in amounts exceeding Dogecoin’s 2025 high-water mark market cap.” Much of DOGE’s rally in recent has been fueled by bullish sentiment around the meme’s endorsement by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk in the Trump administration. Musk has kickstarted plans for a “Department of Government Efficiency,” abbreviated as D.O.G.E, to make government spending more efficient. That has fueled expectation among traders that there could be more chatter of “DOGE” in mainstream media and retail trading circles, fueling attention and interest in dogecoin, as a CoinDesk analysis first noted in mid-October .",Markets|Dogecoin|Markets,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 09:11:28

Most of top altcoins struggles to sustain upward trends, reflecting mixed performance. Dogecoin price, currently holding above $0.39, is showcasing resilience amid these fluctuations.

The TD Sequential indicator has flashed a sell signal on Dogecoin’s daily chart, suggesting a potential price correction ahead. DOGE price trades near $0.39, gaining momentum after recent bullish price action. The sell signal, highlighted by a green-to-red transition, indicates waning buying pressure. Traders anticipate a temporary pullback as the market adjusts. Recent market optimism fueled Dogecoin’s surge, with significant trading activity pushing prices higher. Analysts believe the sell signal may serve as a cooling phase before another potential rally. Despite the correction warning, market sentiment around the top meme coin remains optimistic. Source- Tweet DOGE Nears Key Resistance as Bulls Target $0.41 Breakout A crypto analyst highlights that Dogecoin is approaching a critical resistance level, marking a decisive moment for the popular memecoin. To reignite its momentum and push toward previous all-time highs, Dogecoin needs to break past the $0.41 mark. The coin has been consolidating near this significant level after a recent upward trend. Analysts emphasize that a clear breakout beyond $0.41 could set the stage for a renewed rally. The current price action shows a retest of prior resistance, suggesting growing market interest. Source- X What Next For Dogecoin Price After a Market Rally? The global crypto market cap has reached $3.58 trillion, reflecting a 1.68% rise in the past 24 hours. Market activity surged as the total crypto trading volume jumped 30.% to $124.78 billion. Bitcoin price is above $102k, while Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and other cryptocurrencies followed suit. Meme coins, including Dogecoin, also saw significant price rallies. Analysts suggest Dogecoin price could experience further gains if the bullish momentum persists. The latest DOGE price hovered at $0.393, reflecting a 4% surge within the past 24 hours during the U.S. timeframe. This upward momentum positions Dogecoin near the $0.40 mark, indicating potential bullish activity. Technical analysis suggests on the 4-hourchrt shows a continuation of the upward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a reading of 66.71, nearing an overbought condition that could lead to a temporary market correction. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remains positive at 0.03, reflecting consistent capital inflows. Support lies at $0.35 and $0.32, offering a safety net in case of downward pressure. If bears make a comeback the Dogecoin price prediction could see a market corrects. And If bulls maintain momentum, DOGE could test the $0.50 psychological resistance, a key level for further rally potential. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView To conclude, the Dogecoin price has seen a market recovery following the crypto market rebound. Dogecoin’s price holds promise amid market optimism but faces potential corrections. Breaking $0.41 could ignite a rally toward $0.50.

While major reasons contribute towards the rise, some among them are the rise in the hash rate that marked the ATH, increased mining difficulty, Michael Saylor buying more Bitcoin, and Donald Trump taking office soon. With this trade setup, the BTC price is assumed to rise above $300K. But are these realistic targets? Ever since the price rose above the consolidation, the spot ETFs have seen a significant inflow. After recording over $900 million during the past week, the total net flows were also above $900 million for the second consecutive day. This suggests the institutions are fueling the Bitcoin momentum as the institutions are buying more than the BTC mined in a day. Now that the volume over the platform has recovered from the lows below $20 billion to levels above $50 billion, here is what to expect from the BTC price rally this month. The historical BTC price action remains bullish and the latest rebound above $100K indicates the bulls have gained enough strength. The price is printing consecutive bullish weeks in a row, which usually happens when the token is poised to mark new highs above the current ATH at $108.2K. The +Di of DMI has displayed a bullish divergence along with RSI; hence, indicating the price could maintain a healthy ascending trend. The trade pattern suggests the next highs for the BTC price could be somewhere around $111,676, hitting the resistance of the rising wedge. Meanwhile, the question arises whether the token will be able to sustain the gains or face another rejection from the highs. Considering the trade pattern, rejection seems imminent, while the growing market dynamics are expected to hold the levels above the previous highs, which may initiate a strong recovery. In 2024, U.S. politics will have impacted the crypto markets, particularly the BTC price. The launch of spot ETFs and the election of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump were the main drivers of the growth. Therefore, it is quite evident that future price surges could be highly dependent on the U.S. government’s adoption of pro-Bitcoin policies and actions.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-07 09:12:09

Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2024 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself.

However, there is currently no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

Mining profitability increased as the rally in the world's largest cryptocurrency continued to outpace network hashrate growth, the bank noted. JPMorgan estimated that bitcoin miners earned an average of $57,100 per exahash per second (EH/s) in daily block reward revenue last month, 10% more than in November. Still, ""daily revenue and gross profit per EH/s is still 43% and 52% below pre-halving levels, respectively,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. The network hashrate grew by 6% in December to an average of 779 EH/s, the report said. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain.

Analyst predicts XRP could reach $10 to $13, but risk-to-reward ratio deteriorates. XRP.d approaching resistance signals potential market underperformance ahead. XRP’s price movement has long intrigued investors with sudden surges and quick corrections. Crypto analyst Maelius says understanding XRP’s past patterns and market dominance can help you figure out the best time to sell. With XRP currently priced at $2.44 and a 24-hour trading volume of $4.12 billion, Maelius’ analysis suggests strategic timing is crucial to maximize returns while minimizing risks. How XRP Price Moves XRP’s price tends to jump quickly, usually in two big waves with a correction in between. These waves attract a lot of media hype, drawing in retail investors who often buy in late. This usually leads to one final surge followed by a sharp drop, shaking out many retail investors before a final upward move. For example, in 2017, the third wave (W3) showed two similar jumps, pushing XRP to impressive highs.

However, there’s a new contender in the crypto payments niche that could provide much greater returns, mimicking the golden days of Solana’s 2021 run. Let’s talk about Remittix and its intriguing premise that could revolutionize an entire industry. How Remittix Is Poised To Disrupt A $150 Trillion Market In 2017, global payments were estimated at around $150 trillion, and Remittix (RTX) is uniquely positioned to capture a significant share of this market with its innovative PayFi framework. Users will be able to instantaneously convert over 40 major cryptocurrencies into fiat, and have the funds deposited to any bank account worldwide. Remittix emerges at a point where traditional payment solutions like Stripe or Wise are becoming increasingly obsolete, as they are failing to accommodate the growing demand for comprehensive crypto-to-fiat solutions. While they support cryptocurrencies, the transfer processes are often slower and more complicated than they need to be, with hidden fees behind every movement of funds. Remittix prides itself on its transparency as it’s entirely blockchain-based, meaning that all transactions are immutably recorded and easily traceable. The protocol is designed to serve a broad audience, regardless of their banking status or local limitations they might be subject to. Additionally, businesses will also be able to leverage the Remittix Pay API, which will allow them to seamlessly integrate cryptocurrency options into their payment systems. Remittix also adopts the highest security standard, as its smart contract and a native token $RTX have been rigorously audited by established blockchain security firms, BlockSAFU and SolidProof. Furthermore, the liquidity pool and team tokens are locked for 3 years, ensuring long-term price stability and underscoring an effort to uphold user trust. The Solana Ecosystem Continues To Expand As Revenue Skyrockets Solana played a protagonist role in 2024, taking the spotlight and capturing the attention of millions of investors. Solana’s meme coin factory, Pump.fun, singlehandedly kickstarted a meme season for the ages. Projects like Dogwifhat, Popcat, and PNUT have soared to billions in valuation, driving tens of millions of revenue back into the Solana ecosystem. In November alone, Solana recorded a staggering $92 million in revenue, with its dApps generating over $365 million. These numbers highlight Solana’s position as one of the undisputed leaders in the Layer-1 landscape, and if this explosive growth continues, Ethereum could see its dominance threatened relatively soon. In addition to this, Solana also recently added over $1 billion in stablecoins to its Total Value Locked (TVL), which now amounts to more than $5 billion, a remarkable milestone. In terms of price action, Solana is retesting lower support levels and is now headed toward $210. On the daily timeframe, Solana experienced a 1.7% intraday decline, and its daily volume dropped by 12.5%, with $2.4 billion worth of SOL changing hands on trading platforms. The $RTX Presale Could Be The Best Play of 2025 The $RTX token is currently priced at $0.0185 during its presale phase, and over $1.6 million has been raised in just a few weeks, highlighting enormous investor interest. As this cross-border payment project enters a trillion-dollar market, analysts expect an 800% increase by the end of the presale alone. Once $RTX is available for trading and listings on major exchanges are finalized, early buyers could see a repeat of Solana’s legendary 100x run when the bull market is in full swing.

Deaton voiced his concerns over the pervasive influence of substantial monetary contributions in American politics. His focus has been on the particular role of crypto donations. The crypto advocate’s post was a direct response to Elon Musk’s tweet, where the former called the awarding of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to George Soros a “travesty.” According to an X post from Bachata CEO Mario Nawfal, a nonprofit backed by billionaire George Soros injected millions into various organizations. His money funded several initiatives in the United States. And Soros was just given the Presidential Medal of Freedom … https://t.co/vhK7EMZkAj — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 7, 2025 Nawfal believes Soros is being hailed for his contributions, while Musk is getting the bitter end of “compliments” from economists. Crypto lawyer warns crypto enthusiast on involvement with politics Deaton began his post by stressing the need to remove ‘big money’ from politics. He pointed out the case of Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the beleaguered exchange FTX. Referring to the sentenced head of FTX as “the Bernie Madoff of Crypto,” the attorney explained how SBF donated $70 million during the 2022 midterms. Bankman-Fried predominantly supported Democratic candidates, which positioned him as one of the largest donors behind George Soros. This contribution was revealed during FTX’s fraud trial. Here, it was revealed he donated $10 million to Biden’s Administration to “gain regulatory access.” Per the pro-XRP lawyer, SBF succeeded in his ploy to meet with regulators like SEC Chair Gary Gensler and members of the CFTC multiple times. He then provided other examples of SBF’s acquired influence, which saw his dad, Joe Bankman, write Elizabeth Warren’s tax policy. “ SBF’s mom, Barbara Fried, runs Mind The Gap, a SuperPac for liberal democrats. Despite receiving $10M in stolen customer funds and having tens of millions of dollars worth of Bahamian luxury real estate in their names, paid for by stolen customer funds, they have not been charged or indicted. ” Deaton questioned. The crypto attorney also reiterates that political campaigns have become vehicles for moving and paying money, potentially corrupting the democratic process. He cited the example of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Future Forward SuperPac, which together spent an astonishing $2.5 billion in just 15 weeks. From the lump sum, the outgoing US vice president reportedly raised $1.5 billion alone. Democrats calling for financial expenditure oversight Some members of the democratic party are calling for audits to trace the expenditure of Biden’s administration. Senior lawmakers, including Bernie Sanders and John Fetterman, are backing parts of Elon Musk’s proposed spending cuts plan. Musk’s proposal aims to reduce $2 trillion in annual federal spending, targeting waste and inefficiency in government programs. Representative Ro Khanna supported Musk’s call to curb Pentagon spending, citing longstanding issues with wasteful defense contracts. “ Defense contractors have exploited taxpayers for too long,” Khanna, representing parts of Silicon Valley , told the Financial Times. His remarks followed Sanders’ statement endorsing Musk’s focus on defense spending as a necessary reform. “ The Pentagon, with an $886 billion budget, failed its seventh consecutive audit, losing track of billions, ” Sanders said. Interestingly, this outcry for transparency contrasts with the party’s support for increasing IRS agents to scrutinize ordinary Americans, which attorney Deaton said he finds quite ironic.

Ali Martinez, a respected voice in the crypto space, reignited excitement on January 6 when he noted: “The last time the SuperTrend indicator flipped bullish on the 12-hour chart, XRP went up 470%. It just flipped bullish again.” If history repeats itself, the token’s price could surge past the $11 mark, a seismic leap from its current levels. Critical support range appears to be holding steady around $2.25 to $2.40, while resistance at $2.60 looms as the next test.

The indicator is notorious for predicting significant price shifts, making it a favorite for technical traders who thrive on precision.

According to a January 6 report by Canadian French-language news outlet La Presse, the man, whose identity has been withheld, claims the assailants planned to torture him to access his crypto wallet. Family Flees “The guys had equipment to torture me,” the victim disclosed, describing a chilling scene involving a tarpaulin and surgical tools intended for gruesome use. “It’s incredible violence,” he told reporters, adding that he and his children now live out of Airbnbs to avoid detection. The alleged motive was a mistaken belief that the moderator possessed 2.5 million Bitcoin, a claim he refuted. “I’m a very ordinary guy. I may have $10,000,” he explained. The ordeal began on November 4, when two masked men threatened him outside his home but fled after he secured his door. Days later, on November 8, he noticed a black car without plates stalking his residence. A subsequent confrontation escalated as he was followed and held at gunpoint. Four suspects were arrested, and two faced charges of conspiracy to kidnap and possession of prohibited firearms. Despite crime allegations, the suspects were released on bail pending trial in March, under conditions of house arrest. The victim criticized the court’s decision, saying he has had to drain his savings to evade further attacks. Crypto Crime Cases Surge Worldwide This chilling incident underscores a troubling trend of crypto-linked crime cases. According to Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp, at least 181 cases of crypto-related robberies, kidnappings, and murders have been reported since 2014. In November 2024, WonderFi Technologies CEO Dean Skurka endured an abduction and was forced to transfer $720,000 to secure his release. Similarly, in Pakistan, a crypto trader was kidnapped in a police van on Christmas Day and coerced into transferring $340,000. Other high-profile cases include a French influencer’s father being held for ransom and a Belgian crypto influencer’s wife targeted in a car chase that ended in a crash. Lopp advises the crypto community to practice discretion. “The general premise is that if criminals are less aware of you, they are less likely to target you,” he said. He warned against flaunting wealth on social media or engaging in risky peer-to-peer transactions.

The new European branch will provide a range of crypto derivatives, including perpetual futures. This comes as other exchanges exit Europe, leaving a gap in the regulated crypto derivatives market.

The Solana ecosystem is particularly preferred due to its high speed and low transaction costs. Both of these features are being tried to be provided by layer 2 solutions on the Ethereum side. In addition, the Solana ecosystem has recently become an area where the memecoin theme has particularly intensified. However, interestingly, we see that the focus of developers is not on memecoins but on more robust projects.

This move is part of the company’s broader strategy to enhance its international presence, with HashKey already holding operational licenses in Bermuda and other key Asian markets like Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan. For HashKey, this marks the company’s first VASP license fully aligned with the EU’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), reinforcing its commitment to maintaining a strong, compliant regulatory framework as it builds a global Web3 ecosystem Ireland’s Role in the Crypto Revolution The VASP license from the Central Bank of Ireland is crucial because it ensures that HashKey can operate within Ireland’s legal framework. Under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) regulations, crypto companies were required to apply for VASP registration by December 30, 2024. These rules aim to make crypto services in the EU more secure and consistent, ensuring companies like HashKey follow high standards of compliance. Derville Rowland, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, explained that MiCA rules help make finance more accessible and encourage new ideas.

Experts believe it could be a last-minute filing by Gensler to create headwinds for Ripple similar to Jay Clayton, former SEC chair who brought the case against Ripple and its executives before his exit. Pro-XRP Lawyer Says US SEC Will File Appeals Opening Brief Jeremy Hogan, Partner at Hogan & Hogan, responded to queries from XRP army about whether the US SEC will file its opening brief in the Ripple vs SEC appeal, as per an X post on January 7. Hogan said, “Don’t be surprised when the SEC’s brief IS filed timely and don’t be dismayed.” He highlighted that the agency is still under Gary Gensler. In fact, Gensler and chief litigation counsel Jorge Tenreiro indicated earlier that the legal battle may not shift drastically with a new SEC chair. Currently, the community expects a last-minute filing by the SEC. He added that the January 15 filing has no impact on whether the case will be settled or dismissed by the Trump administration. However, it seems most likely scenario under incoming SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who may decide not to pursue the appeal. “An attorney is working hard on this brief as we speak, knowing that all his effort is probably for naught,” added Jeremy Hogan. Reactions from Former SEC Lawyer The post gets reactions from the community and former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel. He appreciated Hogan for clearing the doubts in the XRP community. The staff has no choice other than to draft and file the opening brief as ordered by the court, he added. It is also important to note that the 2nd Circuit Court has already granted an extension order to the agency last year. The court also stated in the order that no more extension would be provided in the XRP lawsuit. Ripple Vs SEC Case Settlement or Dismissal Hopes As reported by CoinGape Media, Jeremy Hogan earlier predicted a dismissal or settlement between Ripple and SEC under Trump administration and Paul Atkins. He expected a potential resolution of the lawsuit by April or May this year. Meanwhile, Marc Fagel also claimed that a settlement in Ripple vs SEC lawsuit is likely as the Trump admin and Paul Atkins may decide not to pursue the appeal. The parties must settle and agree to proceed with Judge Torres’ order on Ripple to pay $125 million in penalty.

This technology is transforming industries and empowering individuals with the tools to attain financial freedom. Leading these changes are innovative projects in the ecosystem. In this article, we’ll explore some of the industries experiencing the profound impact of this technology and highlight some of the projects at the forefront of innovation in these spaces. The Blockchain Gaming Revolution Gaming activities have become a major use case of blockchain technology. Gaming-related transactions account for more daily transactions than every other blockchain use case combined. A report by DappRadar showed that in Q4 2024 blockchain games captured a market share of 28.2%, with an average of 6.8 million daily active wallets (dUAW)—a 16% increase compared to October 2024. Blockchain gaming and metaverse projects also saw investments skyrocket to $222 million. This represents a 148% month-over-month increase, highlighting the growing confidence in the Web3 gaming ecosystem. The total market capitalization of gaming tokens is currently $26.7 billion. What is Blockchain Gaming? Blockchain gaming in its simplest form is playing games on the blockchain. These are games built in part or in full using blockchain technology. They can be adapted to sub-technologies in the blockchain. For instance, in some games, in-game items can be minted as NFTs that can be traded amongst players. Other games are designed and built for the Metaverse. More often than not, these games have in-game currencies that players can earn by completing levels or swapping other in-game assets. Blockchain gamers earn and keep these assets, in line with the true ownership mechanisms of blockchain games. Players have full control of their in-game assets and are less susceptible to loss, unlike what is obtainable in traditional games. The lagging and crashing of Call of Duty Warzone 2.0 servers in 2022 is a good example of the susceptibility of conventional games to random crashes. Players lost their in-game assets, which could have been avoided if the game was on the blockchain. The lost items could have been minted as NFTs, ensuring they’d still exist and can be traced in the player’s wallets. Also, because the blockchain is essentially an encrypted ledger, player security is enhanced as the player account information can be stored on this ledger. This makes blockchain games less susceptible to hacks, ensuring that the player’s information isn’t exposed, unlike in traditional online games. Some blockchain gaming projects leading innovation in the space include: Creo Engine: a next-level Web3 gaming ecosystem that connects gamers and developers in a one-size-fits-all Web3 gaming hub with its powerful blockchain technology. Creo Engine’s vision is to be the foundation of all Web3 gaming systems, providing game developers with a robust and secure platform to build upon. QORPO: a blockchain game developer on a mission to revolutionize eSports, making the sector accessible to everyone. Hero shooter game, Citizen Conflict, is the company’s flagship project. Citizen Conflict is a fast-paced gameplay designed with the robust infrastructure of eSports and powered by the blockchain for the ultimate competitive gaming experience. Sidus Heroes: a futuristic play-to-earn NFT MMORPG with an amazing blockchain journey and a truly player-driven economy with tangible value in the real world. Sidus gives players ownership rights over all in-game items, and they can trade, sell, or rent these possessions–ultimately, creating a vibrant marketplace fueled by blockchain technology. Super Champs: an immersive, anime-inspired universe spanning games, video, social media, merch, and web3 ownership. It is the brainchild of a team of gaming veterans who led game studios and franchises at companies like Disney, Electronic Arts, and Zynga. Real-World Application of the Blockchain: Real Estate The real estate sector is plagued by property data management issues, a lack of transparent transactions, and inefficient data management systems. The blockchain is providing solutions to these. By leveraging the technology, the real estate market is evolving into a more streamlined and transparent ecosystem. Today, trust and collaboration in this space have been improved, and industry stakeholders can deal directly with each other as the concept of intermediaries dies out and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) takes the main stage. Challenges of Blockchain Technology in Real Estate While the blockchain presents a new era for real estate, its implementation has limitations—as with recently developed technologies. These challenges include scalability, data privacy, legal and contractual issues, interoperability, regulatory uncertainty, etc. A project providing solutions to these challenges is Propy. Propy is a platform modernizing real estate transactions by automating closing processes in real estate deals. The platform automates the closing process for all real estate participants to make closing faster, easier, and more secure. These transactions are also easier to carry out because of the availability of using cryptocurrencies. According to an interview on TechCrunch , almost one-fifth of millennials have now thought about buying a home because of the lock-downs induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning that many will be looking for an easy way to transact, especially if it has the ease of use Propy has. The Future of Digital Engagement The blockchain has also proven important in how individuals communicate and engage with each other. The creator economy in today’s digital world has allowed people to turn their creativity and online presence into careers where they earn impressively. Creatives like musicians, writers, artists, and influencers can now connect with their fans and monetize their content simultaneously on social media platforms like TikTok, Patreon, YouTube, etc. The global creator economy is valued at over $191 billion and is expected to surpass $528.39 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 22.5%. While the creator economy is well and truly here to stay, these traditional models on the platforms mentioned above have their limitations. These platforms take a large cut of the revenue creators earn while maintaining control over the creator’s relationships with their audience and ultimately, their content. This is where the blockchain comes in. KOLZ for example is using blockchain technology to transform how Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) connect with their communities. This platform is dedicated to reshaping influencer engagement through AI-powered replicas of top influencers in cryptocurrency and blockchain. KOLZ is a dynamic, interactive space where influencers and followers can engage in real time. Financial Innovations Since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, the world’s financial system has experienced different solutions and innovations to traditional finance issues. An example of this innovation is Staking. This is a technical concept that came with the advent of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol, and it has continued to evolve. The DeFi ecosystem has thrived with it around too. At the time of writing, the Total market capitalization of liquid staking derivatives is $75.8 billion . Stader Labs is a platform that simplifies staking & offers the best risk-adjusted returns to delegators. The company is building a future where DeFi building blocks unleash a new world of staking derivatives. In the long run, Stader would be a platform for DAOs and developers to build custom staking solutions consisting of chosen validator pools, and staking-based cross-asset ETFs (equivalent to an S&P 500 index that additionally pays out interest). Conclusion While projects like Creo Engine, QORPO, and Sidus Heroes are reshaping gaming experiences, projects like Propy are revolutionizing real estate transactions, KOLZ is transforming digital engagement, and Stader Labs is democratizing financial participation. These are all possible because of the blockchain’s versatility in creating tangible value across various sectors. The evolution of this technology suggests a future where digital ownership, community-focused economies, and transparent transactions are the norm rather than the exception.

The $234 million WazirX hack was one of the major highlights of the last year which shocked the Indian crypto community. In the latest developments, an India-grown crypto exchange seems to be lending a helping hand to the affected users. CoinSwitch unveiled a Rs 600 crore (approx. $70 million) recovery program for WazirX users. The exchange aims to help users recover losses and acquire customers from the embattled exchange. This comes in when the hacked exchange is planning new business initiatives alongside distributing funds to Creditors. CoinSwitch Care launches According to the announcement , CoinSwitch Care will disburse Rs 600 crore to WazirX users over 2 years. Affected users will receive funds in INR or crypto without a lock-in, allowing flexibility in withdrawals and trades. As WazirX is still unable to offer crypto withdrawals, the exchange plans to track claims once the exchange reopens its crypto withdrawal system. This is done in order to ensure fair distribution of funds based on user losses. It mentioned that the CoinSwitch is covering this initiative from its own pockets.

WazirX turmoil continues WazirX held its Third Committee of Creditors (COC) meeting on December 12 and 14, 2024. It happened in two identical sessions to accommodate the COC’s availability. The aim of the meeting was to provide the COC members with further details of the Scheme terms and to explain the Scheme of Arrangement filed with the Singapore High Court on December 06, 2024. The distribution of funds lands with the WazirX plans of launching new business initiatives. It stated that its parent company, Zettai Pte Ltd, is committed to maximizing recoveries for Scheme Creditors. The First distribution of rebalanced Net Liquid Platform Assets will take place within 10 business days after the scheme is effective. Another Indian crypto exchange had decided to step up amid WazirX turmoil. CoinDCX Co-founder, Neeraj Khandelwal, expressed openness to absorb WazirX’s 4.4M stranded users and pending cooperation from management. In a post, he stated “We want to. But it’s also dependent on WazirX. If they want to.” This comes after a Rs 2000 Cr hack in July and 5 months of frozen funds.

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOMAGA.

The altcoins are also in the green today, with DOGE nearing $0.4 and XRP at $2.45. BTC Jumped Past $102K The last two Mondays were massively different in terms of BTC price actions. On December 30, the cryptocurrency plunged from $94,000 to a monthly low of $91,300. However, it recovered a lot of ground in the following days, especially since the start of the new year. It managed to challenge $100,000 on a couple of occasions since January 4 but ultimately failed and was pushed south by a few grand. However, that changed yesterday as the bulls took complete control of the market and initiated an impressive leg-up that resulted in BTC breaking past $100,000 for the first time since December 19. The asset kept climbing in the early Tuesday morning Asian hours and jumped to an 18-day peak of $102,700 (on Bitstamp) amid the massive BTC ETF inflows. However, it failed to maintain its run and has retraced by about $1,000 since then.

Table of Contents Rollblock is transforming the $450 billion casino industry Dogecoin momentum continues in 2025 Pepe becomes the most traded meme coin of the week Rollblock may become the next 100x gem Dogecoin and Pepe started the year with a bang, offering great returns for their holders. Historically, these two memecoins have performed very well in January, and it seems that 2025 won’t be much different. However, some crypto investors have spotted an altcoin that can outshine both projects in the long run. Rollblock looks to redefine the casino industry with blockchain technology and has already attracted over 40,000 investors. On its current trajectory experts believe it could outperform Dogecoin, Pepe and other altcoins on the market. Rollblock is transforming the $450 billion casino industry Despite being one of the largest global industries, traditional gambling faces significant challenges. Rollblock aims to change that by introducing smart technology into the mix. By utilizing blockchain technology throughout its GambleFi protocol the project eliminates unethical practices such as scams and fraud. The platform offers over 7,000 games with complete transparency. Every outcome is recorded on-chain, ensuring that the house can never cheat players out of their winnings. Furthermore, Rollblock has undergone a comprehensive SolidProof audit and holds a license from the Anjouan e-gaming authority. Rollblock has a solid track record since its presale started. In December alone, it attracted over $1.75 million in wagers and aims to double that by the end of January. At the heart of the platform is the RBLK token, which powers its revenue-sharing model. Rollblock uses up to 30% of its revenue to repurchase RBLK tokens, burning 60% to increase scarcity while allocating the remainder for staking rewards. This allows investors to build a passive income stream while holding tokens that appreciate in value over time. Rollblock’s presale is already becoming a huge success with over $8 million raised. Early investors have seen huge returns with RBLK tokens selling for $0.0445 during stage nine of the presale.

Over the past week, the meme coin increased in value by 20%, driven by heightened whale activity, a spike in daily active addresses, and speculation about its integration with Elon Musk’s X Money payment system. During this timeframe whales have purchased more than 6 billion DOGE, solidifying investor confidence, while Tesla’s continued acceptance of Dogecoin for payments enhances its real-world utility. Although mixed social sentiment poses short-term challenges, Dogecoin’s robust network activity and increasing adoption signal a bright future. With its utility expanding beyond memes, Dogecoin is positioning itself as a serious contender in the evolving crypto landscape, promising significant returns for investors. Pepe becomes the most traded meme coin of the week Pepe’s volatility continues to draw attention, with its price hovering at $0.00001731 and a 24-hour trading volume of $4.03 million. Known for sharp price swings, Pepe has recently shown signs of a bullish reversal, trading above a key moving average and forming a falling wedge pattern, often a precursor to upward price movements. In October 2024, a significant burn of 6.9 trillion Pepe tokens, worth $7.01 million, reduced supply, fueling optimism for long-term growth. Analysts are bullish, with Jake Gagain predicting a climb to $0.0001, equating to a $42 billion market cap if achieved. Resistance levels include $0.00002290 to $0.00002320, while support lies between $0.00001732 and $0.00001700. Forecasts for 2025 are ambitious. CoinCodex estimates a 227% rise in early 2025, and Binance Square posits Pepe could reach $0.00010 by year-end. If momentum continues, the token’s appeal could extend beyond speculation, drawing investors with its potential to outperform. While risks remain, Pepe’s development activity and community enthusiasm signal it might soon surpass its current limits, capturing a larger share of the meme-coin spotlight.

This $32.7 million deal isn’t just about ownership—it’s about shaking up the European crypto market . This is also perfect timing as European markets are getting softer on their crypto regulations , and there is a possible increase in crypto users to 218.60 million by 2025. What’s the Big Deal? Once a key player in sam bankman fried sam bankman fried Sam Bankman Fried is a successful American entrepreneur, angel investor, and billionaire with a remarkable history in the space of the cryptocurrency industry. Being the Founder and CEO of FTX, a leading cryptocurrency exchange he has played a key role in the revolutionization and development of the crypto space through his excellent experience and potency. Sam Bankman Fried is a native of Stanford, California, United States. Ranked as 60th on the 2022 Forbes billionaires list incorporating a net worth of US$24 Billion. Began his career working at Jane Street Capital, a trading organization that trades international ETFs. Later, in 2017 he quit Jane Street and founded Alameda Research, a quantitative cryptocurrency trading organization established in October 2017. Bankman build an arbitrage trade, raising $25 Million every day, to take benefit from the higher price of Bitcoin in Japan in 2018. After attending a cryptocurrency conference in 2018, in Macau, he got inspired by the concurrent crew of Bitcoin cash and built his firm, FTX according to July 2021 that averages $10 Billion of day-to-day trading volume with beyond 1 Million users that provides a policy of donating 1% of its revenue to charity. Bankman aims to support lawmakers who perform the vast game on policymaking in spaces like pandemic planning and preparedness. Entrepreneur Chief Executive Officer Trader trading empire, FTX EU held a MiFID II license under the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), allowing it to operate in the European Union. Backpack Exchange, founded by former FTX and Alameda Research employees, now plans to use this license to establish itself as a leader in regulated crypto derivatives across Europe. Backpack’s CEO, Armani Ferrante, announced that the exchange has submitted its notification under Europe’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. If approved, Backpack aims to go live in the first quarter of 2025. The firm intends to offer a comprehensive suite of crypto derivatives, with a primary focus on becoming the only regulated provider of perpetual futures in the EU. We're fully focused on working with all the relevant parties to return customer funds in the EU. It's our top priority. If you have an FTX EU claim, we'll announce next steps shortly. https://t.co/Wy2NBbSkRc — Armani Ferrante (@armaniferrante) January 7, 2025 Ferrante highlighted that while other firms like coinbase coinbase - support@coinbase.com Wallet Centralised Exchange and bitstamp bitstamp - info@bitstamp.net Centralised Exchange have acquired MiFID II licenses, none currently offer perpetual futures within the European Union. This gives Backpack a unique opportunity to fill the gap and cater to a growing demand for regulated crypto derivatives. Ferrante also emphasized the importance of restoring FTX EU customer funds as a top priority before rolling out new services. What’s this all about? But Backpack isn’t just focused on new customers. Ferrante stressed that returning funds to FTX EU’s existing users is a top priority. Once that’s sorted, the company will launch its suite of products, with some features potentially rolling out later in the year. Backpack’s journey so far has been impressive. The team, known for its contributions to the Solana ecosystem and successful NFT ventures, raised $17 million in funding last year. Now, with the FTX EU acquisition, they’re stepping up their game in a highly competitive market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : HashKey’s Big Break: Just Got Approved for a Big Crypto License in Ireland! , Europe’s crypto scene is buzzing, with firms like D2X and others vying for a slice of the derivatives market.

DTX brings a revolutionary approach to trading, while DOGE, with its meme magic and Elon Musk’s backing, continues to defy expectations. With both altcoins priced under $1, which one will lead this year’s anticipated bull rally? Let’s take a closer look into the details and know who will lead this exciting showdown. 100,000 Commodities, One Platform: The DTX Advantage DTX Exchange (DTX) is a fresh entry to the crypto market aiming to be the first crypto-native platform to offer 100,000 commodities including stocks, forex, bonds, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and much more. This revolutionary aim is powered by its layer-1 blockchain, VulcanX. This blockchain-enabled DTX Exchange connects old-school assets to modern-day ones, bringing them all into one platform, and saving users from the hassle of managing multiple platforms. The platform recently launched its blockchain’s testnet, which gave an estimated TPS of over 100,000 setting itself apart from all the leading players in the market. The platform offerings further propel it ahead to be one of the leading players. These offerings include leverage up to 1000x which helps users with minimal investment to have maximum liquidity and market exposure. Its recently launched Phoenix Wallet proved itself to be a hit as it is a safe and secure non-custodial solution to hold all your assets. One of the highlights of the platform is ETF tokenization which makes it easier to trade ETFs even for those users residing in jurisdictions where ETF trading is restricted. This feature has got investors all around the world excited for the platform’s official launch which is planned to be in the first quarter of this year. The Musk Effect: Driving DOGE’s Market Momentum As Elon Musk is ready to turn X into an “everything app,” speculation about the X payment launch swiftly gained momentum. According to Forbes , recent sources indicate that the platform’s payment system, X Money, may soon launch without receiving complete regulatory permission in every US state. The CEO of X, Linda Yaccarino, stated that X Money will be available by 2025. This payment system will be inspired by WeChat in China and will have a number of features. There has been no official announcement, but rumors indicate that Musk’s favorite, Dogecoin (DOGE) will play an important role in this new feature. Musk’s X Payment launch may set Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price on an upward trajectory. However, after making a recent remark on the development, well-known market analyst Ali Martinez raised speculation. He commented on Rogozinski’s post, highlighting Musk’s well-known association with this cryptocurrency, stating, “It smells like DOGE in here.” Source : CoinMarketCap In the meantime, Elon Musk has published a piece that sparks further rumors and questions over a possible Dogecoin Reserve in the United States. Further fueling rumors is Donald Trump’s recently established Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). This department, which will be headed by Vivek Ramaswamy and Musk, has an interesting name that adds to the conversation in the cryptocurrency community. DTX at $0.14: The Best Entry Point for Big Gains DTX Exchange (DTX) is currently in its presale phase 7, making records after records. The presale recently surpassed the $11M mark, being one of the fastest-growing ICOs of recent times. The presale is offering each DTX token for a mere $0.14, which is considered a cheap entry point to a platform with high profit potential. The presale has already generated over 450% ROI for all of its early investors who jumped in the ship at the $0.07 price point. The project is still in its early stages, meaning those who are investing in the current stages still stand a chance to gain big profits. Final Thoughts The race between Dogecoin (DOGE) and DTX Exchange (DTX) pits meme power against innovation. DOGE thrives on community hype and Elon Musk’s influence, while DTX focuses on utility with its groundbreaking platform bridging traditional and decentralized markets. While DOGE relies on speculation and Musk’s backing to fuel its growth, DTX is making its path with real-world applications, from ETF tokenization to 1000x leverage trading. The question remains: will the meme charm of DOGE maintain its edge, or will DTX’s bold vision change the cryptosphere? Speculation is saying yes, but analysts are waiting for further developments to pass a solid conclusion.

Particularly in the wake of the latest developments, such as the new RTX Blackwell series launch and the GPU manufacturer’s entry into the automotive industry, market sentiments surrounding the Nvidia stock have turned highly bullish. As a response, NVDA price soared roughly 4% on Monday to reach $149.43, challenging AAPL’s dominance with a remarkable surge in the stock’s market cap. Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Price Is Rising Nvidia has announced staggering developments at CES 2025, pioneering the AI & GPU chip manufacturing industry. Notably, the GPU manufacturing giant unveiled the GeForce RTX 50 series, a card boasted of outperforming RTX 4090, mirroring its Blackwell architecture as the year kicks off. This development has marked a monumental stride for the company. Further, the AI chip giant also unveiled ‘DIGITS,’ a personal AI supercomputer powered by the GB10 super chip, at CES 2025. Collectively, the launch of the new AI-related products appears to have substantially bolstered the market sentiment for Nvidia stock. Simultaneously, the AI giant’s CEO, Jensen Huang, has conveyed immense optimism over robotaxis and the self-driving automotive industry, sparking another market buzz. Intriguingly, Huang stated, “I predict that this is going to be the first multi-trillion dollar robotics industry.” While this statement already bolstered the firm’s future, the keynote speech at CES 2025 also revealed that the AI chip manufacturer’s upcoming automotive endeavors include collaborations with giants such as Tesla, Mercedes, Toyota, and Volvo, among many other companies. Altogether, in light of the abovementioned advancements, traders and investors are seeing a remarkable, bullish market sentiment prevailing for Nvidia’s stock. Apple Dominance Under Threat? Simultaneously, it’s also noteworthy that NVDA’s market cap is again nearing that of AAPL after overtaking it the previous year. Nvidia’s market cap at the time of reporting was evaluated as $3.65 trillion, inching closer to Apple’s $3.70 trillion. The rising market value reflects the firm’s recent pivotal achievements, with CoinGape previously revealing that the NVDA stock price is poised to overtake AAPL in 2025. Also, some other AI stocks reflect the same potential, including Alphabet, Google, and Meta Platforms. Simultaneously, it’s also noteworthy that the AAPL stock price traded at $245, up nearly 2% intraday. Market watchers continue to compare the stocks’ prices as broader events continue to unfold, impacting investor sentiment.

""Major Uptrend Could Be Imminent!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/peter-brandt-gives-six-weeks-for-xrp-major-uptrend-could-be-imminent/,"Experienced analyst Peter Brandt, who has been on the market for a long time and is closely followed with his successful analyses, made a bold prediction for Ripple (XRP). Sharing from his X account, Brandt claimed that the market value of XRP could exceed $500 billion. Peter Brandt claimed that there is a halving flag pattern on XRP’s weekly chart and if this pattern is completed within six weeks, XRP will experience a potential breakout. Brandt said that XRP is at a turning point, stating that it has been consolidating within a flag pattern since a sharp rise last December. At this point, the analyst stated that the current flag pattern on the XRP chart should gain momentum soon, and that if XRP does not gain upward momentum and the flag pattern is not completed, the flag pattern carries the risk of turning into a different formation and declines may occur. However, if the flag model is successfully completed, XRP's market cap could potentially reach $500 billion. “The half-mast flags must be completed within six weeks, otherwise they should be viewed with great suspicion. “This flag on the XRP chart needs to be completed soon, otherwise it will likely turn into something else. But if it is completed, a $500 billion market cap for XRP could be possible.” According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP, which is trading at $2.4 at the time of writing and has a market value of $140.3 billion, ranks third in the ranking, just behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Half mast flags should complete within six weeks, otherwise they should be viewed with great suspicion. This flag in $XRP needs to rock and roll soon, otherwise it will likely morph into something else TBD. But if it completes, then market cap of $500 B is possible pic.twitter.com/c7BHqnQFkP — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) January 6, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

After dipping below $93,000 just a week ago, Bitcoin has made an impressive recovery, rising more than 9% this week. This price jump is sparking hopes that Bitcoin might soon reach its previous all-time high of $108,000. Reasons Behind Bitcoin’s Price Surge One of the key factors driving Bitcoin’s rise is the decision by major players like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet to buy more BTC. On January 6, MicroStrategy announced it had recently purchased 1,070 BTC for $101 million. While this is smaller compared to their previous multi-billion-dollar buys, it’s still considered a positive signal for Bitcoin’s market outlook. Currently microstrategy microstrategy - Business Intelligence holds a total of 447,470 BTC, which was acquired for approximately $27.97 billion, with an average purchase price of $62,503. In a similar move, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet is also increasing its Bitcoin holdings . They plan to boost their stash to 10,000 BTC, a five-fold increase from their current holdings. Happy New Year to Our Valued Shareholders! As we step into 2025, I couldn’t be more excited about what lies ahead for Metaplanet.

Gemini $5M Settlement With CFTC In addition to this, Gemini announced a settlement of a 2022 lawsuit with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The exchange paid a $5 million fine without admitting to any wrongdoing over Bitcoin price manipulation claims.

Leading the charge are firms like Fidelity, BlackRock, and Ark Investment, which have been investing millions in Bitcoin ETFs. These inflows are seen as a sign of growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin. What Next For Bitcoin? With Bitcoin’s price rising by 3.2% in the last 24 hours, reaching $101,669 , investors are now looking for Bitcoin to break past $105,000. If Bitcoin can hold above this level, it could move closer to its all-time high of $108,384, making this recent surge even more significant. As Bitcoin recovers from weeks of lower momentum, its upward movement could continue, keeping the market excited about what’s next. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

How Much XRP Do They Have?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/important-xrp-statement-from-ripple-ceo-brad-garlinghouse-how-much-xrp-do-they-have/,"Although Ripple has faced many legal battles with the SEC in recent years, it continues to make a name for itself as one of the most promising cryptocurrency companies. As Ripple continues its success, Ripple’s token XRP also experienced a huge boom in the rally following Donald Trump’s victory in November. While this explosion in XRP has also increased the value of Ripple's XRP holdings, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that Ripple's XRP assets are over $100 billion. Speaking in a recent interview, the Ripple CEO highlighted the rise in Ripple’s valuation, revealing that the company holds more than $100 billion worth of XRP. “The total value of XRP that we currently have has exceeded $100 billion.” Garlinghouse, who noted that the $11 billion valuation in early 2024 was too old, said an initial public offering was not being considered due to past regulatory challenges and there were no plans for an IPO yet. Garlinghouse said that demand for Ripple’s custody solutions and Ripple USD (RLUSD) has increased, which is why Ripple is focusing more on solutions like custody and cross-border payments. The famous CEO attributed this increase to regulatory changes and the departure of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. On that point, Garlinghouse said recent months have been a “turning point” due to the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and the possibility of greater regulatory clarity with a new administration, adding that “the winds have now changed.” Ripple CEO recently stated that 95% of Ripple customers are outside the US, but he expects interest to return in the US in the next few months. *This is not investment advice.

The reversal in the Coinbase premium came after a shift in market sentiment as Bitcoin price continues to trade above $100k. The index had plummeted earlier as investors began to demonstrate caution about BTC’s price, which entered a range-bound motion on December 19. The shift came when Bitcoin’s price crossed the $100K mark yesterday after it experienced a 15% correction from its all-time high. Recent Bitcoin purchases fuel bullish momentum Coinbase Bitcoin buyers are bullish! The Coinbase premium index has completely reversed course and is now back in the green 👇 https://t.co/305czX0Prg pic.twitter.com/9Guodlx7l3 — Nic (@nicrypto) January 7, 2025 The Coinbase Premium Index helps measure the difference between the price of BTC on Coinbase and Binance. When the index turns positive, it indicates an uptick in demand from the U.S. market, and the opposite is true when it is negative. Microstrategy bought 1,070 BTC , worth $101 million earlier in the week, marking its ninth week of consecutive purchases. Whale Alert data also revealed an accumulation trend in the market after an investor recently moved 1,850 Bitcoins from a Binance wallet to an unknown wallet. Another investor also transferred 3,999 BTC from an unknown wallet to a Coinbase wallet. Data from CryptoQuant revealed that as the Coinbase Premium Index turned positive, a single block outflow of 4,012 BTC was also recorded from Coinbase yesterday. The analytic firm also confirmed that the data points prove that there is a dominance of buying pressure in the American market. The platform further revealed that Bitcoin’s 14-day Simple Moving Average also turned positive 3 days ago, the first time in 3 years. BTC’s price has surged by 4% in the last 72 hours, a move that aligns with historical contexts. According to CryptoQuant analysts , when the index last turned positive in November last year, Bitcoin’s price ascended from $69,000 to $108,000. The firm’s analysts also maintained that if U.S. investors are back in action, Bitcoin’s price might surge and reach new all-time highs. Bitcoin surpasses $100K as Coinbase Premium Index turns positive BTC has already surpassed the $100K resistance level and currently trades above $101,000, recording a 2.47% increase in the last 24 hours as of publication time. Bitfinex reported that the Liquidity Inventory Ratio, a measure of how long the existing Bitcoin supply can meet demand, dipped from 41 months in October to just 6.6 months. The report also indicated that the drop reflects a constriction in Bitcoin’s available supply and that growing demand has outpaced the sell-side liquidity. CryptoQuant also noted that 36% of Bitcoin’s supply had been traded in the past month, which signaled increased market activity. Crypto Dan , an analyst at CryptoQuant, added that the long-term trend remains downward, which suggests that the market will reach its cycle peak by Q1 2025 or, at the latest, by Q2 2025. Another Bitcoin maxi highlighted that BTC’s monthly chart illustrated a “nasty” setup from its previous bull run. They predict that if the market follows a similar path, the price of Bitcoin could go as high as $200K. Another CryptoQuant analyst also revealed that if there are no “black swan” events in the current cycle, the market could resemble the 2017 bull cycle. Adler maintains that the current cycle will be characterized by a bullish trend with minimal pullbacks to the metric level of 80%. Spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have also gained momentum after $908 million flowed into ETFs on January 3. Fidelity’s FBTC led with $357 million in inflows, trailed by Blackrock’s IBIT with $253 million. “The ETF issuers almost all trade and custody with Coinbase so they tend to push the premium or discount based on demand for the ETF.” ~Joe McCann, Founder and CEO of Asymmetric. A similar report by 10xResearch revealed that Bitcoin could approach its all-time high of $108,353 ahead of Trump’s inauguration. The report also suggested that BTC could have a positive start to the year, followed by a slight pullback leading into the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release on January 15. The firm added that a rally could follow into Trump’s inauguration on January 20 but could die down ahead of the FOMC meeting on January 29.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $13,229 and $14,589, with an average expected price of $16,417. In 2031, ETH could trade between $23,172 and $26,740, with an average price of $25,166. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of any secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and its smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031.

The Bollinger Bands indicate moderate volatility, with resistance at the upper band near $3,706 and support at the lower band around $3,198. The price remains above the 20-day SMA at $3,452, suggesting bullish potential despite recent corrections. The RSI is at 48.49, showcasing a neutral stance with no significant overbought or oversold conditions. If bullish momentum returns, ETH could test $3,706. However, continued bearish pressure may lead to a retest of the $3,452 support, with further downside to $3,198 if broken. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart The Ethereum (ETH) 4-hour chart indicates minor bearish momentum, with the price trading around $3,655, down 0.36%. The Bollinger Bands reflect moderate volatility, with resistance at $3,709 and support at $3,584. The price is near the 20-SMA at $3,646, signaling uncertainty in short-term momentum. The MACD shows a neutral stance, with the MACD line at 46.0, slightly below the signal line at 52.7, reflecting slowing bullish momentum. The Balance of Power (BoP) at -0.50 suggests sellers have slight control. If the price breaks below $3,646, it may test $3,584. A move above $3,709 could restore bullish sentiment.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour charts, Ethereum (ETH) shows signs of consolidation with a slight bearish bias. On the 1-day chart, the price is trading near $3,656, with resistance at $3,706 and support at $3,452. The RSI remains neutral, suggesting limited momentum in either direction. The 4-hour chart indicates short-term uncertainty, with the price hovering near the 20-SMA at $3,646. The MACD reveals weakening bullish momentum, while the Balance of Power suggests sellers hold a slight edge. A breakdown below $3,646 could lead to $3,584, while a recovery above $3,709 may push ETH toward $3,800. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider doing their own research before investing. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2026, with its potential low starting at $10,662.92. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to approach the $25,000 level by 2030, with an average price of $25,417.45 and a potential high of $26,740.04.This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such long-term projections should be approached with caution. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum is unlikely to reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $26,740 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $26,740 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Ethereum Stani Kulechov, co-founder of Aave, highlighted the upcoming Pectra upgrade on Ethereum, which is expected to enhance scalability, user experience, and security by enabling externally owned accounts (EOAs) to function like smart contracts. The upgrade, set to begin in the first quarter of 2025, introduces features like “blob spaces” for efficient data storage, benefiting both the Ethereum mainnet and Layer 2 networks with lower transaction costs and improved efficiency. Kulechov believes these advancements will drive broader Ethereum adoption and potentially fuel a price rally in 2025. Ethereum will have a great start for 2025.

These two days of substantial inflows have brought the total net inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs to $36.9 billion since their launch nearly a year ago. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF remains the frontrunner, with $37.4 billion in accumulated inflows, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund at $12.4 billion. Grayscale’s converted GBTC, however, has faced challenges, reporting $21.4 billion in outflows during the same period. Demand Outpaces Bitcoin Supply Meanwhile, data averaged from Apollo and BiTBO revealed that U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated about 51,500 BTC in December 2024—nearly triple the 13,850 coins added to the circulating supply during the month. This imbalance underscores the major role ETFs play in Bitcoin’s growing adoption. While miners produced fewer coins, ETFs absorbed a staggering 272% more than the newly minted supply, reflecting strong institutional and retail investor interest. The momentum in spot markets has also been a driving factor, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $108,135 on December 17. As Bitcoin ETFs continue to amass substantial holdings, they are increasingly shaping the dynamics of Bitcoin’s supply and demand. Bitcoin is currently trading around $101,600, up by over 8% in the past seven days. As per the data by CoinMarketCap, the largest cryptocurrency currently boasts a market cap of $2.01 trillion.

Solana secures ETF approval but faces falling trading volume; Intel Markets dominates Q1 with 1000x leverage, AI tools, and quantum-proof blockchain solutions. Table of Contents Solana gains ETF approval but faces investor apathy ETF excitement dims as its trading volume declines Intel Markets emerges as the clear leader in Q1 Solana’s ETF approvals mark a notable step forward, but declining trading volume raises concerns about its broader market impact. While the blockchain network adds ETFs to its portfolio, the lack of sustained activity casts doubt on its ability to capitalize on the opportunity. In sharp contrast, Intel Markets is setting the standard for advanced trading. With 1000x leverage, AI-powered tools, and exclusive access to high-yield trades, it’s not just another platform, as it’s where serious traders go to win. Solana gains ETF approval but faces investor apathy Solana’s ETF approval marks a milestone, but trading volume tells a different story. With over half a billion SOL tokens circulating and a market cap exceeding $100 billion, activity appears underwhelming. Approximately 3.5% of its market cap is reflected in 24-hour trades, raising questions about whether ETFs alone can revive engagement. SOL’s price sits above $200, showing minimal movement despite its potential. Analysts attribute this stagnation to concerns over liquidity and scalability, as trading volumes dropped by nearly 4% within 24 hours. The once-dynamic network now faces increasing pressure to prove its relevance. Looking forward, Solana’s plans for ecosystem expansion might spark activity, but the immediate outlook remains uncertain. Without a clear uptick in volume, SOL risks losing its standing as an investor favorite, regardless of its ETF achievements. You might also like: ETH retests $4k as Intel Markets at $0.064 becomes a new investor favorite over SOL ETF excitement dims as its trading volume declines Exchange-traded funds have grabbed headlines recently, but not always for the right reasons. Despite growing options and institutional backing, trading volume paints a sobering picture. Recent data shows a drop of over 7% in 24-hour ETF volume, suggesting that the initial enthusiasm may be giving way to investor hesitation. Insiders point to market dynamics and shifting priorities as possible explanations for this dip. While the total supply of 21 million ETF tokens remains unchanged, their current trading metrics hint at limited activity. The Vol/Mkt Cap ratio surpasses 25,000%, underscoring the mismatch between trading activity and market valuation. Experts believe this imbalance could indicate deeper issues within the ETF space, particularly as market participants weigh short-term moves against long-term strategies. Looking ahead, analysts remain cautious about ETF growth. Despite their role in reshaping access to traditional and digital assets, declining activity raises questions about sustainability. As ETFs adapt to evolving market conditions, all eyes are on whether they can recapture the dynamic engagement seen in their earlier days. Intel Markets emerges as the clear leader in Q1 While others debate ETF volumes and market direction, Intel Markets takes trading to an entirely new level. Its 1000x leverage feature turns minor price fluctuations into significant profit opportunities, transforming a $100 investment into a potential $100k. This isn’t standard trading; it’s a precision-crafted system for those who demand results beyond the ordinary. Intel Markets isn’t just inclusive; it’s exclusive. The platform offers trading environments typically reserved for elite players managing over $100 million in assets. With curated opportunities ranging from high-yield arbitrage setups to breakout strategies, Intel Markets doesn’t just participate, it dominates. This exclusivity is underpinned by over $5.6 million raised during its ongoing presale, with tokens quickly nearing the next price round. Intel Markets’ Route X21 initiative is setting new standards by addressing blockchain’s quantum security challenge. Backed by a $1 million grant, the initiative is building the first quantum-proof ledger. This forward-thinking approach ensures the platform remains a step ahead in securing decentralized systems against future threats, a critical need as computing power evolves.

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 11:50:00

Specifically, Peter Brandt noted that XRP could soar to a $500 billion market cap in a prediction that hinges on completing a ‘half-mast flag’ bullish technical pattern, as noted in an X post on January 7. Brandt explained that this bullish continuation pattern needs to resolve within six weeks to remain valid. He suggested that if the setup is completed successfully, XRP could reach a market cap of $500 billion. However, if the pattern takes too long to play out, it could lose its significance or evolve into a different structure. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Peter Brandt “This flag in $XRP needs to rock and roll soon, otherwise it will likely morph into something else TBD. But if it completes, then market cap of $500 B is possible,” he said. The analysis acknowledged that XRP has experienced a massive rally followed by consolidation. The decrease in trading volume during this consolidation aligns with typical flag behavior, suggesting a potential continuation of the bullish trend. Should XRP break out of this pattern, the projected market cap of $500 billion is derived by measuring the height of the initial rally and applying it to the breakout point. Therefore, if XRP hits the market cap target, the price would be valued just below the $9 mark. XRP possible 470% breakout Meanwhile, a bullish analysis was shared by another prominent cryptocurrency analyst, Ali Martinez, who, through an X post on January 6, pointed out that the Ripple -affiliated token is facing the possibility of rallying by 470%. In this case, Martinez stated that XRP’s super trend indicator on the 12-hour chart flipped bullish once again. The last time this key technical signal appeared, XRP surged by a staggering 470%, marking a significant rally in a short period. The formation helps traders identify potential shifts in market direction. In the current setup, XRP is trading around $2.40, with the indicator suggesting bullish momentum could push prices significantly higher if history repeats itself. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView XRP fundamentals Although XRP remains susceptible to general market price movements, there is anticipation that the token could be further boosted with the anticipated friendly regulations under the Donald Trump administration. Notably, Gary Gensler’s exit from the helm of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is at the top of the list. Indeed, XRP’s parent company, Ripple, is already witnessing the fruits of the anticipated Trump policies. To this end, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse declared 2025 as the start of a “Trump bull market,” crediting the pro-crypto stance of the incoming administration for renewed optimism in the U.S. economy and blockchain innovation. He stated that Ripple has shifted 75% of its hiring back to the U.S. and signed more domestic deals in the last six weeks of 2024 than in the previous six months, signaling a strong rebound after years of regulatory hurdles under SEC Chair Gensler. 2025 is here and the Trump bull market is real. For Ripple, this is even more personal after Gensler's SEC effectively froze our business opportunities here at home for years. The optimism is obvious and very deserved. Today: ✅75% of Ripple’s open roles are now US-based, while… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 5, 2025 XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.46, having rallied almost 3% in the last 24 hours, while on the weekly chart, the token is up over 18%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, XRP is showing moderate volatility at 5.65%, and its position above the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) and 200-day SMA indicates strong bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 59.33 reflects a neutral to slightly bullish trend, while the market sentiment is bullish, supported by a Fear & Greed Index of 78 (Extreme Greed). Besides this technical setup, XRP will likely experience swings, especially with Ripple’s planned unlock of more tokens for January.

As interest in digital assets continues to rise, a new phase of corporate adoption for bitcoin (BTC) appears to be taking shape, with publicly listed firms following MicroStrategy's lead by adding BTC to their balance sheets. It all started with MicroStrategy (MSTR) adopting BTC as Treasury asset in 2020. Since then, its share price has jumped almost 2,500%. Over the years, the company has boosted its coin stash through cash, at-the-market (ATM) equity offerings, convertible debt or, more recently they said they would also use preferred stock offerings. In 2024, we saw multiple companies follow suit and adopt a bitcoin treasury strategy, such as Metaplanet (3350), Semler Scientific (SMLR), MARA Holdings (MARA), as well as many other publicly traded miners that have also achieved great success. Now more firms are joining the party. The first company emerging from the second wave is KULR Technology Group (KULR), which trades on the NYSE, announced a $21 million bitcoin purchase on Monday. This takes its total bitcoin holding to 430 BTC at an average weighted price of $98,393 per token. KULR has leveraged a combination of an ATM equity program and surplus cash to fund its purchase. Like the other pioneers of this strategy, they have adopted a BTC yield strategy, coming in at 93.7% from December 2024 to January 2025. KULR's share price has been up 847% since Nov. 19. As of Jan. 7, there also seems to be an emergence of publicly traded companies that have announced a bitcoin treasury strategy, but have yet to acquire any bitcoin. First up, Acurx Pharmaceuticals (ACXP) , trading on the Nasdaq, whose board approved a purchase of up to $1 million in bitcoin on Nov. 20. The share price has been down 35% since Nov. 19, but it is up 30% year-to-date. The same is true for Hoth Therapeutics (HOTH) , also on the Nasdaq. Its board approved a $1 million bitcoin purchase, back in Nov. 20 but there has been no acquisition yet. However, the share price is up 2% since Nov. 19. The third company to have approved a $1 million bitcoin treasury strategy is Nasdaq-listed LQR House (YHC) . On Nov. 19, the firm made the announcement that they have also accepted cryptocurrency payments and adopted a policy to retain up to $10 million of these payments in bitcoin. The share price is up 56% since Nov. 19. The last company, NYSE-listed SOS Limited (SOS) approved a $50 million purchase of bitcoin on Nov. 27. The announcement was made when bitcoin was $93,000 a token. The share price has been down 30% since Nov. 19. In the second wave KULR has seen massive share price appreciation, compared to the other companies. However, LQR House could be an outlier with a share price gain of 57%.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 11:51:52

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss' exchange settled without admitting or denying liability, according to a letter from the CFTC's attorney, K. Brent Tomer. A trial for the case had been set to start Jan. 21 , but that will no longer proceed. The CFTC sued Gemini in 2022, alleging it had misled the U.S. regulator during in-person meetings that occurred in 2017 . Part of the deal also included an injunction to prevent Gemini from making false or misleading statements to the commission in the future. These types of injunctions are common in settlements or lawsuits by federal securities and commodities regulators. Gemini also faces another case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A judge ruled in March that the SEC could sue the exchange for violating securities laws . In the absence of legislation relating specifically to the crypto industry, U.S. regulators have sued a number of crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance , for violating securities laws. Many observers have said pro-crypto comments made by President-elect Donald Trump indicate he will appoint regulators with a less confrontational attitude to the industry and a reduction in so-called regulation by enforcement .",Policy|Policy|CFTC|Gemini|Use Cases,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 11:57:29

BTC is looking to secure a foothold above $100,000, and its Deribit-listed options are indicating a bullish bias. The same can't be said of the S&P 500, which has a history of providing risk-on/off cues to risk assets, including BTC. According to Cboe data, the SPX options skew now reflects greater downside risk than it did a year ago. The defensive positioning in stocks perhaps stems from concerns that President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration could be a ""sell-the-news"" event. Risk-taking has picked up across financial markets in the past two months in anticipation of pro-corporate and pro-economy reforms under Trump's presidency, and profit-taking cannot be ruled out. ""Broadly speaking, we see some cracks in the data and think that Trump’s inauguration later this month has a decent chance of being a ‘sell the news’ event after nearly three months of unbridled economic optimism across most sectors,"" Bruce J Clark, head of rates America at Informa Connect, said on LinkedIn. That raises the question: How will BTC react? After all, expectations of regulatory clarity under Trump have already seen the cryptocurrency rally to over $100,000 from $70,000 in just two months. A Jan. 20 broader market sell-off could pull down the dollar index and the bond yields, potentially supporting BTC. For now, there are several factors supporting BTC. For instance, the $400 billion in liquidity sucked out of the system in the final two weeks of 2024 is likely to return, greasing asset prices, according to the LondonCryptoClub newsletter. Plus, some of the capital flows from China could find a home in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is again trading at a premium on Coinbase, reflecting stronger Stateside demand while miners are expected to cut back on sales. ""The Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) for miners remains very positive, hovering around 0.5, suggesting that miners are still in a strong position, with substantial unrealized profits and a preference to hold onto their BTC at this stage,"" analysts at Bitfinex told CoinDesk. In the broader market, some traders are dabbling with December 2025 ETH calls at strikes as high as $11,000. Ether is currently trading below $4,000. Over 70 of the top 100 coins by market value were up on a 24-hour basis at press time. Need more evidence of risk-on? That said, keep an eye on the bond market rout, which is fast spreading outside the U.S. Early today, the Japanese 10-year bond yield rose to a 13-year high while its 30-year British counterpart was on the verge of hitting the highest since the late 1990s. That can suck the wind out of risk assets. Stay alert! What to Watch Crypto Jan. 7: Dusk (DUSK) mainnet launch.

In the past two days, Buterin has sold $940,900 worth of lesser-known memecoins for the USDC stablecoin and ether. The NEIRO, ESTEE, MARVIN, EBULL, MSTR, and TERMINUS tokens brought in at least $57,000 worth of USDC, while other tokens were sold for less than $40,000. Just over $916,000 was whisked away to a multisign wallet, likely tied to the charity Kanro, according to SpotOnChain. Communities often send tokens to Buterin mainly to gain exposure and leverage his influence in the crypto space. But Buterin’s known philanthropy also plays a role. Communities send tokens expecting him to donate them, indirectly supporting charity.

In his post, Ducoff advocated for banks to build on public blockchains, emphasizing that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) should support such innovation for the benefit of customers. The Head of Institutional Growth at the Solana Foundation, Nick Ducoff warned the banking institution in a recent post on his X account. He stated that banks are at risk of losing in the “internet financial revolution” if they fail to embrace innovation for the benefit of their customers. Ducoff went on to say that FDIC restrictions placed on banks could stifle innovation and cause banks operating in the US to lose out on major opportunities to modernize their operations. The Solana Foundation actively promotes the adoption of public blockchain technology by financial institutions. It has several projects, such as a customizable blockchain solution aimed at high-volume finance and token extensions designed to make it practical for banks and other financial institutions to integrate blockchain technology into their operations. According to Ducoff, public chains should be seen as an opportunity to expand services and reach new customers. Banks should prepare to function in a complementary role and build a hybrid financial system that combines the accessibility of DeFi with the trust and regulation that come with traditional banking. The FDIC restricts innovation – Nick Ducoff Documents recently obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Coinbase revealed that the FDIC limited US banks from using public blockchain networks for settling client transfers. It cited risks associated with public blockchains, such as exposure to bad actors and unregulated activities, as the reasons for the restriction. However, Ducoff points out that banks already manage risks in other areas, such as internet banking and ATMs on dangerous streets. Rather than avoiding the use of public blockchains, banks should focus their efforts on leveraging the benefits and mitigating the risks. The incoming US administration may give banks another chance to explore the potential of public blockchains. Ducoff believes that if regulators, including the FDIC, fail to embrace these innovations, they risk pushing financial activity into unregulated spaces, leaving customers at more financial risk and banks becoming increasingly irrelevant. Why banks should embrace public blockchains Ducoff believes that public blockchains are also more efficient than the private blockchain networks banks currently operate with. He used Solana as an example, stating that the blockchain processes tens of millions of transactions daily while private blockchain networks cannot achieve similar results. There are many more benefits to banks adopting public blockchain technology. Banks would make networks safer by providing regulation services. Their compliance infrastructure would also help prevent financial crimes. The custody solutions provided by banks would secure the digital assets of customers. Bank participation would also deepen liquidity pools and reduce market volatility. Just as banks once adapted to the rise of internet banking, they must now evolve to meet the demands of the new financial system. Institutions that embrace innovation will lead the charge to shape the future of finance.

Bitcoin Spot Exchange Supply Has Seen A Sharp Plunge Recently In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about the trend in the Bitcoin spot exchange inventory. This metric keeps track of the total amount of the cryptocurrency that’s sitting in the wallets of all centralized spot exchanges. Related Reading: Dogecoin Jumps 20%, But Social Media Still Bearish: Green Signal For Rally? This part of the exchange supply refers to the actual tokens of the asset that exist on the blockchain. The exchange supply that doesn’t actually involve users to own BTC, as is the case with derivatives products, is known as “paper BTC.” When the spot exchange inventory rises, it means the investors are depositing a net number of coins into the wallets associated with these platforms. As one of the main reasons why holders might transfer their BTC to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, such a trend can have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies the exchange outflows are outweighing the exchange inflows. Investors usually take their coins off into self-custody when they plan to hold into the long-term, so this kind of trend can be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin spot exchange inventory over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot exchange inventory saw a large plunge around the time of the FTX collapse back in November 2022. This suggests a large movement of coins occurred out of these platforms as the asset’s bear market reached its bottom. Following this plummet, the indicator started a phase of consolidation that lasted for the entirety of 2023 and most of 2024. The trend finally broke in the last couple of months of 2024, when the metric registered a sharp crash. These outflows came alongside Bitcoin’s exploration of new all-time highs, implying the accumulation from the investors might have played a role in the run. In total, 240,000 BTC exited the exchange-related wallets during this plunge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Make $1.08 Billion Net DOGE Purchase Woo has pointed out that Microstrategy’s buying in this period summed up to about 192,000 BTC, which means there are other whales present in the market taking significant amounts off the exchanges. So far, the downtrend in the spot exchange inventory has shown no signs of reaching a bottom, as outflows have continued into 2025. If investors indeed keep up the accumulation in the near future as well, then Bitcoin could benefit from some further bullish momentum. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued its recovery in a sharp fashion during the last 24 hours as its price has broken back above the $101,700 mark.

This growth may continue as the crypto bull run accelerates, a move that will benefit more DeFi crypto tokens. Here are some of the best cryptocurrencies to accumulate as the DeFi industry grows. DeFi TVL Best Crypto Tokens To Buy As DeFi TVL Grows There are many cryptocurrencies to buy as the DeFi industry grows, including Morpho, Lido DAO, AAVE, and DexBoss. Morpho (MORPHO) Morpho is one of the best crypto token to buy as the DeFi industry booms . It is a relatively new DeFi network with over $3.2 billion in assets, most of which are in its Ethereum network and the rest in Base. Morpho has become highly successful such that it made over $90 million in fees in the last 365 days. Morpho price has done well since its airdrop a few months ago. It has made a series of higher highs and higher lows. While th coin has lost momentum recently, it remains above the 50-period moving average, which is providing substantial support. The token will likely keep rising, with most gains expected when it moves above the all-time high of $3.7. A drop below the 50-period moving average will point to more downside. Morpho Price Chart DexBoss (DEBO) DexBoss is significantly different from the other three crypto tokens listed here because it offers somewhat guaranteed returns. It is an upcoming DEX platform that is currently in a presale that has collected over $342,000 in funds. The guaranteed returns comes from the fact that each token is selling at $0.011, lower than the eventual listing price of $0.0505. As such, if you buy today and hold it to the listing price, you will likely make a near 360% return. You can buy the DEBO token here . Lido DAO (LDO) Lido DAO, the biggest player in the DeFi industry , is another top crypto token to buy because of its strong fundamentals. It is a top fee earner that made over $1 billion in the last twelve months as its staking volume rises. LDO token has strong technicals as it has formed a cup and handle pattern whose upper side is at $2.47. It is now in the process of forming the handle section of this pattern. Also, the token has remained above the 50-day moving average. Therefore, a cross above the upper side of the cup will point to more gains, possibly to $4.035, the highest level in 2024. Lido Price Chart AAVE (AAVE) AAVE is another good crypto token to buy as it is slowly forming a highly p opular bullish pattern known as a bullish pennant . This pattern has a flag pole and a triangle shape. The two lines of the triangle pattern are now nearing their confluence, pointing to more gains. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the value of AAVE token will rise to $500 in the near term. AAVE Price Chart These technicals are supported by the strong fundamentals as the network has over $22 billion in assets and made $480 million in fees in th last 30 days.

If the $XRP bulls can force the price up through the trendline and there is a confirmation above, stand by for the next stage of this amazing run. Target levels at $2.51, $2.68, and the local high at $2.90 can be achieved if the breakout occurs. If the price is rejected from the descending trendline, the 0.382 Fibonacci is support at $2.28, and then major support is at $1.96. Bulls will want to avoid the continuing formation of a descending triangle by breaking out soon. Major horizontal support under the $XRP price Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $XRP shows just how important the major horizontal support is, resting on the top of a price surge as far back as April 2021. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is shaping to turn back up. It will need to do so if this breakout and further upside is to occur. $ADA breaking out right now Source: TradingView As can be seen on the 4-hour chart for $ADA (ADA/USDT) above, the struggle to take out the big resistance level at $0.00001125 is happening right now. The descending trendline looks to have been surpassed, and the bulls and bears are in a tussle for the horizontal resistance level. There is plenty of room for the indicator lines to rise on the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart, bringing upside momentum, so it may be more likely than not that the bulls win this particular battle. Much to do for $ADA bulls to reverse the downtrend Source: TradingView Zooming right out into the weekly time frame, it really does not look promising for $ADA. Even if the bulls succeed in breaking the resistance, they have another major horizontal resistance to get through at $0.00001585. In fact, this particular resistance is the key to reversing the downtrend and it must be conquered. The weekly Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart shows that the indicator lines are crossing back up. This is bullish, and if confirmed, will supply upside momentum. Hopefully for the bulls, this will continue at least as far as the second major resistance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Heavy buying from the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs As much as the charts say that Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) is overbought right now, heavy institutional buying is keeping the price aloft. $BTC is currently just below $202,000 on Tuesday, and if the heavy buying continues into the rest of this week, a new all-time high may not be out of the reckoning. On Monday, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs bought big again. A total of 9.95 BTC was the total inflow, amounting to almost $1 billion. This was the 5th biggest daily inflow on record, just beating Friday’s purchase of 9.36K BTC. The difference in the buying share over these last two purchases was that for once, Blackrock’s IBIT fund did not take the lion’s share. Instead, Fidelity’s FBTC fund bought most, with 3.68K BTC and 3.76K BTC on Friday and Monday respectively. MicroStrategy announces a 1,070 BTC purchase MicroStrategy announced its now customary buy on Monday. The purchase was 1,070 BTC in total, amounting to $101 million. The purchases for MicroStrategy have tailed off over the last couple of weeks, but with at least $42 billion in planned BTC buying over the next three years, there is a lot more to come from this particular demand source. $BTC overbought. How deep will the dip be? Source: TradingView Despite the recent big purchases, the $BTC price is overbought, and a period of downside price action is probably what needs to follow from here. The short-term chart shows that the $BTC price is just starting to roll over, and has come up against the first support of the 0.236 Fibonacci. If a bounce should occur here, or even at the 0.382 Fibonacci, this would be extremely bullish, but a healthier and deeper correction would probably be better for the price going forward. The 0.5 Fibonacci at just under $100,000, or the 0.618 Fibonacci at $96,300 would be good levels for a bounce. Monthly price targets Source: TradingView Zooming right out into the monthly time frame, the big picture becomes apparent. The price is currently up against the 1.618 Fibonacci for the whole bull market. Further target price levels can be seen above. Looking at the next segment down in the chart, the Stochastic RSI lines are angled up, displaying bullish momentum. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing a nice bounce from the descending trendline. However, the indicator line will need to get all the way to the 91.70 level in order to nullify extremely strong bearish divergence. If it does not do so, a bear market will in all likelihood commence. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Among the leading ETFs, Fidelity’s FBTC stood out with $370 million in net inflows, while BlackRock’s IBIT followed closely with $209 million in new investments. These inflows underscore Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a long-term asset for institutional investors, particularly as anticipation builds around favorable regulatory and economic conditions in the United States. Ethereum spot ETFs also saw notable activity, with net inflows totaling $129 million. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF accounted for most of this influx, recording single-day net inflows of $124 million, reflecting strong interest in Ethereum’s potential as a foundational layer for decentralized applications and smart contracts.

A closer look at Open Interest and momentum indicator reveals that a lack of momentum that suggest a correction could come before ETH revists $4,000 retest. Ethereum (ETH) Price Today While many top altcoins bounced hard on Monday due to Bitcoin crossing $100K, ETH’s value remained relatively unchanged. Ethereum price today trades at No data found for ethereum on 15 minutes ago and is down No data found for ethereum on 15 minutes ago% in the past 24 hours. Why is ETH performance lackluster? One of the main reasons for Ethereum’s lackluster performance is the lack of interested participants. This can be observed by looking at VeloData’s open interest that is declining while Ethereum price continues to creat higher highs. A divergence of this sort indicates that shorts could be closing, which is why the price is slowing and climbing higher. For a full-fledged uptrend, there should be a combination of shorts closing and longs opening. Due to the drop in OI, investors can expect a lack of willing, bullish participants. ETH/USDT Vs. Open Interest While the drop in OI amid rising prices is a bearish signal, the momentum is also lacking. Let’s take a look at the technical analysis to get a better understanding. Ethereum Technical Analysis: Will ETH Reach $4,000 in January? With only seven days elapsed, January 2025 still has a lot to offer to both Ethereum and the rest of the crypto market. ETH could hit $4,000 if these conditions are satisfied: Bitcoin is not driving the market lower. Ethereum whales are not actively selling but buying. The momentum flips from bearish to bullish. Open Interest spikes to the upside. As seen in the below chart, Ethereum price pierced the $3,539 to $3,654 resistance zone on January 3. Since then ETH has produced higher highs while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) produced lower highs. This non-conformity is termed bearish divergence and often forecasts a reversal or short-term corrections. ETH/USDT 4-hour chart With a bearish short-term outlook, ETH dips could serve as a buying opportunity for long-term holders. Let’s take a look at Ethereum price targets for January 2025. Ethereum Price Prediction For January 2025 If the bearish divergence plays out, the selling momentum could knock Ethereum price down to $3,59 and the demand zone, extending from $3,430 to $3,470. This is a good area to accumulate ETH at a discount. A bounce after an accumulation could propel Ethereum price to recover above $3,600 and set up a higher high to confirm the start of an uptrend. In such a case, the next targets for ETH price would be $3,843 and $4,096. ETH/USDT 4-hour chart Ethereum’s Long-term Outlook Remains Bullish Despite the short-term outlook hinting at a correction, the crypto market bull run depends on Bitcoin. With BTC top likely to form in the fourth quarter of 2025, the cycle is far form over. With the same logic, Ethereum price dips could be an opportunity especially considering the lackluster performance ETH noted in 2024. Hence, the 2025 Ethereum price prediction targets stretch from $6,000 to $15,000, as noted in previous CoinGape articles.

A decade ago, there were some predictions and forecasts, but nobody was certain nor was the general premise that of optimism until recently. Nowadays, cryptocurrencies and online gambling go hand in hand and their hybrid industry is paving the way for an even wider adoption of digital tokens. It does seem like a logical step in the right direction, and yet many still doubt the increased interest in cryptos at the end of 2024. Gambling on the internet has been widespread well before virtual currencies became a thing and it is only better for it. But how exactly is this connection made, why is it so beneficial, and how much can it grow? Should you opt for a Bitcoin casino with your daily gambling sessions, and if so, why? If you are a fan of modern technology as well as an online casino enthusiast, stick with us. By the end of this article, you will have learned all there is about the connection between these two industries and why cryptocurrencies are bigger than ever. The New Rise of Crypto in 2024 The main reason why cryptocurrencies are the talk of the town again, and why there is seemingly a sudden increase in interest, is the rise in value. In November and December of 2024, Bitcoin as the leader among them and the most prominent and valuable digital currencies shattered the previous records in value and crossed the $100,000 mark. It reached as high as $104,000 and brought about a new widespread craze and attention to other digital currencies. As a result, many alternative coins (altcoins) are also more valuable and people are investing more than they were before the winter period. Trading is up and the demand is high. On top of all of this, there has been an increased engagement in crypto casinos. These platforms work in a similar way as the usual online gambling services, with one important difference. Apart from regular money and traditional payment methods like credit cards and bank transfers, they also offer blockchain transactions for depositing and withdrawing money. Financing your favorite pastime activity with cryptos of your choice and getting to collect your winnings the same way is not completely new, but thanks to more platforms recognizing its value it is now becoming mainstream. Therein lies the potential for these two industries to merge, something that has nothing but benefits for all sides. Benefits of Cryptocurrencies for Other Industries So why is a cryptocurrency of any kind so good and appealing for other industries to engage with and integrate? Well, it is not so much about the cryptos themselves but the technology they operate on. That would the blockchain technology, something synonymous with digital currencies and a term that has been mentioned numerous times in the same sentence. The way it works is important but also the benefits that brings. It is a ledger where every transaction is clearly visible, where nothing can be hidden, and where all the users and their data remain anonymous. What is more, it is also a network and a new way to make apps and websites. Platforms that utilize blockchain are more secure and stable, making them less prone to attacks, scams, and frauds. When an industry, a system, or a platform has crypto and blockchain features, it means that it is more modern and capable. When a casino has it, it allows more useful features to the clients and players. First and foremost, the transactions they make are faster and more secure. Only they and the platform are involved without any intermediary to take a cat just to complete the transaction. This is possible because blockchain is inherently decentralized so no higher power or organization like a government or a bank interferes. Such transactions are transparent, almost instant, and secure since nobody can swoop in and steal it once it is in motion. Best of all, it is anonymous since you only need your electronic wallet’s address to complete it. No personal data, no financial details. When a service makes a move to utilize the benefits of crypto, it attracts a brand-new, modern, and tech-savvy clientele. Younger people know their technology, they are familiar with what it brings, as well as what the old solutions were lacking. Therefore, when a popular online casino goes the way of cryptocurrency and blockchain, they instantly know what it means. If you care about safeguarding your data, which is the most valuable asset in the modern day and age, gambling on a service like this makes perfect sense. Conclusion and Takeaways: The World of Crypto is Waiting Eventually, many tech, online, finance, and IT sectors will start integrating cryptocurrencies into their systems and it is only a matter of time before governments make new laws and regulations about it. Right now, entertainment as a whole is leading the way through gaming and gambling, and online casinos are a clear example of how great this integration can be. If you are a fan of poker, blackjack, or roulette and enjoy playing them over the web, and have some money invested in digital currencies, try out a Bitcoin casino and see why it makes so much sense.",Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 12:11:17

These gains have seen XRP’s market capitalization surge past $140 billion, ranking it the third largest crypto after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). According to Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, Donald Trump is one of the catalysts behind these gains. In an X post, he noted that Trump’s election win was good for the broader cryptocurrency industry and Ripple due to a shift in the US regulatory stance towards cryptocurrencies. “2025 is here, and the Trump bull market is real. For Ripple, this is even more personal after Gensler’s SEC effectively froze our business opportunities here at home for years. The optimism is obvious and very deserved,” Garlinghouse stated. The executive also pointed out the growth of Ripple’s business in the last six weeks of 2024, when it secured more deals than it had earlier. Is a Ripple IPO coming in 2025? Crypto advocate John Deaton has hinted at a possible Initial Public Offering (IPO) for Ripple in 2025. Deaton noted that the company could be listed in US exchanges towards the end of the year or in Q1 2026 based on the decisions of the incoming Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Paul Atkins. “If Atkins is confirmed quickly, this could happen in the 1st quarter. But because Washington moves slowly, it will likely happen in the 2nd quarter,” Deaton stated. The advocate further stated that the SEC would withdraw the appeal made in the Ripple vs. SEC case. One of the reasons why the regulator would do this was because the decision made by US District Court Judge Torres was not a binding precedent. “Judge Torres made her ruling very FACT SPECIFIC and, thus, only applicable to the facts of the Ripple case. Therefore, the DECISION ITSELF has very limited persuasive use,” he stated. Deaton further revealed that when making her decision, Judge Torres clarified that the ruling was specific to the facts represented in Ripple’s case. Therefore, the case cannot be used as a precedent to claim that all secondary market sales for digital assets are non-securities. “Appealing the Ripple ruling is a fool’s errand, and I think Paul Atkins will see it that way. Now you can also see why I called these unelected bureaucrats, Primma Donnas,” Deaton concluded. Moreover, the current SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, is expected to resign on January 20 in a move that could positively impact XRP’s price.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-07 12:17:52

However, the expectation for DOGE to rise continues, as data shows that whales' interest in Dogecoin continues to increase. At this point, investors are showing great interest in DOGE, while DOGE futures markets broke a new record in open interest. According to Coinglass data, the number of active contracts jumped from 7.50 billion DOGE to 10.35 billion DOGE over the weekend, surpassing the 10 billion DOGE peak in March 2024. Experts commenting on the change in the DOGE futures market said that the increase in open interest indicates new money entering DOGE, potentially a rise and also an indication of upcoming volatility. According to experts, a high open interest rate also indicates that a strong trend will continue. At this point, market analyst Omkar Godbole said that Dogecoin will rise in the coming weeks and he expects the price to reach $0.5. Citing historical data and the 50-day SMA in his forecast, the analyst stated that DOGE showed its best performance historically in January with an average return of 85%. “DOGE has broken above the closely watched 50-day SMA, which coincides with a rise in the 10-day SMA, signaling a potential uptrend. “Additionally, the discount on Coinbase compared to Binance has disappeared. This suggests that prices are likely to break the current three-day resistance of $0.4, potentially moving to $0.5 and above.” Alongside Godbole’s short-term target of $0.5, Galaxy Digital head of research Alex Thorn wrote that he expects $1 for Dogecoin. *This is not investment advice.

This optimism has further surged with the recent comments from top attorneys and market experts, who anticipate more positive developments in the coming days. Besides, a prominent market analyst has also hinted towards a potential 470% rally in the crypto’s price ahead. So, here we take a close tour of the recent developments and the analyst’s projection, which might further boost the asset’s appeal to investors. XRP News: Lawyer Predicts Positive Developments In Coming Weeks In the latest XRP news, legal experts and market watchers predict positive developments for the crypto in the coming weeks. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has recently shared his optimism, which aligns with the latest bullish prediction of the top market analyst Ali Martinez. For context, Martinez has recently highlighted a technical pattern of XRP price in an X post. In his post, he said that “the SuperTrend indicator flipped bullish on the 12-hour chart” had turned bullish. He noted that this is a rare and historically significant signal for the asset. According to his post, the last time this indicator turned bullish, Ripple’s native crypto jumped around 470%. So, as the signal has once again appeared, the market watchers remained bullish, while anticipating a robust surge in the asset’s price ahead. Source: Ali Martinez, X Meanwhile, Bill Morgan further added to the excitement, expressing hopes for positive outcomes for Ripple and its native crypto. The attorney has lauded the recent prediction of Martinez while saying “That would be great given anticipated positive news over the next few weeks concerning XRP.” Ripple’s Legal Clarity In Focus XRP price today was up about 3% and exchanged hands at $2.45, while its trading volume rose 14% to $4.35 billion. The crypto has added over 18% in the last seven days but was down around 3% on a monthly basis. However, the asset’s Futures Open Interest was up 7%, reflecting the positive sentiment hovering in the market. Meanwhile, the surge also comes as speculations soar over what’s next in the ongoing lawsuit. Although legal experts claimed that the US SEC under Gary Gensler would file its opening brief on the XRP lawsuit before the January 15 deadline, the market sentiment remained strong. Notably, the experts maintained a bullish stance, especially with soaring anticipation over the pro-crypto regulatory environment in the US after Trump’s inauguration. Besides, the top attorneys also said that chances are high over a potential settlement in the Ripple SEC case under the incoming agency’s Chair Paul Atkins. Having said that, it appears that XRP is likely to continue its strong momentum ahead, as optimism over Ripple’s legal clarity soars. Besides, adding to the excitement, veteran trader Peter Brandt said that Ripple’s native crypto could attain a market cap of $500 billion.

While BTC and ETH have posted modest gains of 6% and 7%, respectively, since the start of the year, ADA has soared by an impressive 32%, breaking past the $1 threshold and reigniting investor interest. ADA seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At press time, Cardano is trading at $1.13, reflecting a 5% increase over the past 24 hours and an impressive 32% surge over the week. This remarkable rally has drawn attention to ADA’s potential to maintain its momentum, with investors speculating on whether the cryptocurrency can break through critical resistance levels in the weeks ahead. ChatGPT projection on Cardano (ADA) price To gauge Cardano’s potential trajectory, Finbold turned to market data and sought insights from OpenAI’s advanced AI model, ChatGPT-4o. According to the AI model, ADA is poised for continued growth in 2025, driven by a combination of technical upgrades and strong fundamentals. In the near term, ChatGPT-4o projects that Cardano could test the $1.50 resistance level, provided its current momentum remains intact. Looking further ahead, the AI estimates a steady upward trend, suggesting that ADA could climb between $2.50 to $3 by the end of the year. Key drivers behind ADA’s price surge One notable driver, as highlighted by the AI, is the introduction of CIP-113 , a proposal that has significantly boosted investor confidence. The proposal aims to integrate programmable assets, enhanced security features, and smart accounts into the Cardano ecosystem. This could potentially enable Cardano to support stablecoins , enhanced security features, and real-world asset tokenization , making a major step forward for the network. ChatGPT outlook on Cardano. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold DeFi activity strengthens the outlook Cardano’s total value locked (TVL) has risen sharply, climbing 33% since the start of the year to $569.4 million, according to data from DeFiLlama. This increase in DeFi activity, as highlighted by the AI model, suggests that the rally is being driven by organic demand within the Cardano ecosystem rather than speculative trading, further strengthening the bullish outlook for the token. Derivatives data reinforces Cardano’s bullish sentiment Derivative data adds another layer of positive sentiment. Long/short ratios on major platforms like Binance and OKX show a strong bias toward long positions , indicating that market participants are confident in ADA’s continued price growth. ADA Derivatives data. Source: CoinGlass Notably, short liquidations have outpaced long liquidations in recent sessions, creating a short squeeze that often drives prices higher. The AI model sees this as a sign of growing trader confidence and a shift toward bullish momentum for Cardano. Surge in wallet activity Recent transaction trends indicate a significant rise in wallet activity on the Cardano network, driven by a surge in new investors since December. Data from the IntoTheBlock reveals steady growth in the total number of funded wallets showcasing a consistent influx of new participants. This increase in activity appears to align with the countdown to Trump’s inauguration , reflecting renewed market engagement and heightened investor interest. ChatGPT notes that this rise in transaction activity and wallet creation reflects increasing network adoption and deeper investor engagement, further bolstering confidence in Cardano’s long-term potential. ADA technical indicators and market projections Technical indicators add weight to the bullish outlook for Cardano, with projections pointing toward a potential breakout. Analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted the formation of a bull pennant pattern, which could propel ADA to a target price of $3. Additionally, projections suggest that Cardano could achieve a $100 billion market cap in 2025 , potentially translating to a price range of around $2.85. This aligns with forecasts highlighted by AI, further strengthening the bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. This convergence of technical patterns , on-chain activity, and growing market sentiment paints a compelling picture of Cardano’s growth potential, positioning it as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies of 2025.

Legal expert John Deaton expects the SEC to withdraw its appeal. The Ripple decision remains fact-specific, limiting its broader impact. Legal analyst John Deaton predicts that Ripple could go public by late 2025 or early 2026, depending on developments in its ongoing SEC legal battle. Deaton suggests the SEC may choose to withdraw its appeal to avoid significant legal and reputational risks. Ripple IPO on the Horizon Deaton, known for his active involvement in Ripple’s legal disputes with the SEC, believes the appeal may be dropped under the new SEC chairman’s leadership. This move could pave the way for Ripple’s much-anticipated IPO. Ripple delayed its IPO plans due to its legal battle with the SEC. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP’s secondary market sales did not classify as securities under federal law. Although this decision was seen as a major win, it was limited to the specific facts of Ripple’s case rather than establishing a broader legal precedent.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-bitcoins-correction-over-analysts-pointed-to-this-price-level-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin’s bullish momentum is gaining momentum as investors eye a return to $109,000 as Donald Trump takes office and expectations of a resurgence in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grow. Bitcoin Investors Target $109K as Trump Inauguration Sparks Optimism, ETFs See Record Inflows The cryptocurrency has surged 10% in the past week, climbing above $102,000 on Monday and recouping almost all of its losses from the December crash. Bitcoin had fallen from a peak of $109,000 on Dec. 17 to a low of $92,000 on Dec. 30, temporarily raising concerns of a deeper correction. According to SoSoValue data, $987 million inflows into U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs on Monday marked the highest daily total since Nov. 21. Fidelity’s FBTC led the way with $370 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT ($209 million) and Ark Invest’s ARKB ($71 million). Nine out of twelve Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows and none saw outflows, signaling renewed investor confidence. Investors are bullish on potential crypto-friendly policies under Trump that are expected to boost Bitcoin and other digital assets. That optimism coincides with a broader recovery in financial markets as investors return from vacation. “We are seeing a resurgence of Bitcoin demand after the lackluster Fed outlook dampened a potential Santa Claus rally,” said BTSE COO Jeff Mei. “With investors returning to their desks, Bitcoin and crypto assets are showing bullish trends heading into Trump’s inauguration.” Technical Analysis: Is the Correction Complete? Some analysts suggest that Bitcoin’s recent price action is in line with a completed correction, paving the way for further gains. “Bitcoin’s recovery from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level suggests the correction is over,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro. “If the all-time high of $109,000 is breached, we could see growth accelerate.” Fibonacci levels are a technical tool used to predict potential price support and resistance levels. Traders often view these levels as important signals for price action. Market volatility is expected to remain subdued ahead of Friday’s U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, a key economic indicator. Strong NFP data could strengthen the U.S. dollar and put pressure on riskier assets like Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is Bitcoin's Correction Over?

In 2025, there are three altcoins likely to expand the market: Rexas Finance (RXS), Uniswap (UNI), and Render (RNDR). These coins are poised to set the pace for altcoin development in the near future. The world of blockchain and finance technology, as we know it, is about to change due to the shifts these tokens represent, each with a different level of significance. Rexas Finance (RXS): An Innovator of Asset Tokenization Thanks to Rexas Finance, the tokenization of real-life assets has reached another level, and the market has welcomed it with open arms. By tokenising real assets, RXS is creating new forms of value for investors with access to previously untouched markets. What makes Rexas Finance different is its enabling fractional ownership of such assets, making it easier for a larger audience to invest in illiquid markets. New forms of liquidity define this new era. The presale has been a success so far, with Rexas Finance raising more than $35 million. Currently in stage 11, each token is priced $0.175. This success gave the project credibility and built on security due to its Certik audit, aiding its recognition on platforms like CMC. What makes RXS unique is its ambitious roadmap. Rexas Finance seeks to become the preferred asset digitization platform, with plans to incorporate advanced DeFi features and develop an ecosystem of tokenized financial products. As 2025 approaches, interest in RXS and its investment opportunities grows alongside its value due to its potential to disrupt established markets. Uniswap (UNI): Decentralized Trading of a New Era Using a programmable AMM mechanism, UNI allows users to trade tokens directly from their wallets. Uniswap has gained millions of users worldwide by eliminating the need for intermediaries, becoming integral to DeFi initiatives and providing security. It has become the most popular DeFi. With a price of $13.30 and a market cap of $7.99 billion, UNI has proven its prospects amidst market volatility for several years. Upgrade options such as the introduction of liquidity pools, have made the platform a premier DEX. Analysts suggest that broader decentralized finance adoption and the rise of the DeFi market could drive the price surge to $50 in 2025. With uncertainties in regulatory standards shifting users to decentralized platforms, Uniswap is positioned to remain an industry leader. Render (RNDR): The Future of Decentralized Computing Power Render Network is transforming the allocation of computing power by enabling a decentralized network for individuals and developers to access unused GPU power. This comes when the high-performance computing market is expanding in gaming, animation, and artificial intelligence. With a market cap of $3.62 billion and trading at $7.00, RNDR is attracting attention in both tech and crypto communities. The platform’s goal of achieving cost-effective, scalable, and eco-friendly rendering tasks has gained significant users and partnerships in the industry. RNDR is predicted to reach $25 by 2025, suggesting that decentralized infrastructure usage will grow as the GPU computing market expands. Render Network bridges blockchain and creative technology, making it a strong contender for future growth in this industry. Conclusion Due to their strengths, Rexas Finance, Uniswap, and Render are undoubtedly altcoins to consider in 2025. Rexas Finance leads in the tokenization of assets, enabling people globally to invest in high-value opportunities. Uniswap continues to pioneer decentralized trading with a simple and secure platform. Render Network addresses the growing needs of blockchain and high-end computing, particularly with gaming and AI technologies driving progress. As these solutions emerge, the market matures, offering innovation, adoption potential, and solutions to real-world problems. These tokens, positioned to transform blockchain applications in the economy, deserve the attention of those preparing for the next big wave in cryptocurrency.

A rare price pattern suggests a potential 100% rally for SOL as the cryptocurrency beats Ethereum and Base in performance. While Bitcoin remains above $100, Solana struggles to mirror its growing dominance in the decentralized finance space. Rare Solana Price Pattern Predicts Massive 100% Rally, Overtakes Ethereum & Base Solana price gains momentum as its decentralized exchange (DEX) volume surpasses $3.8 billion in a single day. The network’s latest achievement outpaces Ethereum and Base, signaling strong growth in the Solana ecosystem. Raydium, a major Solana-based DEX, saw trading activity skyrocket tenfold. Memecoins played a significant role in this surge, contributing over $250 million in trading volume on Pumpdotfun. The spike highlights Solana’s increasing competitiveness in the blockchain landscape. This development positions Solana as a key contender among top-performing blockchains. Analysts predict the ongoing momentum could fuel a 100% rally in Solana’s price. With consistent growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, Solana’s prominence continues to rise. Market observers attribute Solana’s rapid growth to its low transaction fees and high-speed infrastructure. These features attract developers and traders seeking efficient blockchain solutions. As Ethereum faces congestion challenges, Solana’s scalability gives it an edge. If current trends persist, Solana could secure its position as a leading blockchain network. Its ability to rival Ethereum in transaction volume underscores the growing adoption of Solana’s technology. Analyst Predicts SOL Surge to $382 Using Cup-and-Handle Pattern A crypto analyst recently shared a bold prediction for Solana, citing a potential surge to $382. The technical analysis presented revolves around a “cup-and-handle” formation on Solana’s three-day price chart. The cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish technical indicator, is often associated with significant upward price movements. According to the analyst, Solana has formed this chart pattern, signaling the possibility of a substantial rally. The prediction aligns with increasing optimism surrounding Solana, as the blockchain network continues to showcase robust development and adoption. This target, $382, marks a considerable upside from Solana’s current market price, suggesting strong investor confidence in the cryptocurrency. Source- Tweet Solana Price Analysis Over the past week, the SOL price has surged by 10% following other crypto market gains, with BTC surging above $100k. At the time of writing, the SOL price is trading at $214.15, showing mild intraday gains. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending at 49, marginally below the neutral zone of 50. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains positive, although showing signs of declining momentum. The histogram indicates a potential slowdown in bullish strength, warranting close monitoring for any shifts. if Solana price prediction sustains its position above $214 and breaks $225, a rally toward $263.83 could materialize. Conversely, failure to maintain the $200 support level might expose the asset to risks of revisiting the $175 region. Solana Price Chart: TradingView Solana’s rare price pattern hints at a 100% rally, supported by strong DeFi metrics outperforming Ethereum and Base. As Solana’s DEX volume surges and adoption grows, analysts predict a bullish future, positioning SOL as a blockchain contender.

The bank’s accredited investors, defined as entities with over S$10 million ($7.3 million) in assets, can now purchase bond units starting from S$1,000 — a significant reduction from the traditional minimum of S$250,000, according to Ledger Insights. The new solution also allows investors to customize bond duration and coupon rates. These tokenized bonds reference existing investment-grade assets, providing corporate clients with more tailored and liquid investment options. For instance, a mid-sized construction firm recently utilized the service to diversify its treasury holdings beyond fixed deposits, Ledger Insights reported. Settlement times have also improved, with transactions now taking just one day compared to the typical five days. This initiative builds on OCBC’s previous blockchain projects. In 2023, the bank partnered with ADDX for structured product issuances and introduced a conditional payment solution using blockchain. The system facilitated automatic disbursements for the Land Transport Authority, processing over S$22 million in payments by late 2024.

However, judging by the current price action, it is quite likely to do so soon. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the asset has been rising since rebounding from the $91K support level. Yesterday, the price broke above the $100K level and closed above it on the daily timeframe. If bitcoin is able to hold above the $100K level, a rally higher and a new record high would be imminent. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour chart, the price is behaving just as expected in an uptrend. Since the beginning of the year, new highs and lows have been forming, indicating the start of a new rally. The market is currently pulling back to the $100K level, but it will likely rebound from it and continue higher in the coming days. Yet, if this level is lost, deeper correction toward the $91K level would be expected. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Exchange Reserve While the BTC price has been consolidating around the $100K level, market participants were wondering whether the bull market is over. Yet, as the underlying dynamics suggest, there is still sufficient demand that would push the price higher. This chart presents the Bitcoin exchange reserve metric, which measures the amount of BTC held in trading platforms. As evident, investors have been withdrawing their BTC from exchanges at a significant rate. This indicates that there is still an enormous buying pressure on aggregate, which would likely lead to higher prices in the coming weeks.

RLUSD, a USD-backed digital currency, is designed for secure, instant payments and is supported on both the ( XRP ) Ledger and Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchains. With this collaboration, Ripple aims to boost RLUSD’s utility across decentralized finance applications. DeFi refers to blockchain-based financial services that eliminate intermediaries, such as banks. These applications rely on smart contracts — automated programs that execute transactions based on predefined rules. Stablecoins like RLUSD are crucial to DeFi because they offer price stability by being pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar.

The proposal, co-authored by Llamarisk, a decentralized finance (DeFi) risk management platform, seeks to hardcode Ethena’s USDe’s price to match USDT’s price on Aave’s price feed. The authors argue that doing so would protect Aave users from secondary market fluctuations. Detractors argue that pegging USDe to USDT introduces risks due to the inherent differences between the two assets. While USDT is designed to hold a fixed value, USDe is not a stablecoin and operates under a different mechanism, relying on ETH-backed positions.

Netflix: Why Tim Draper Sees BTC as the ‘Next Netflix’?,https://coingape.com/trending/bitcoin-vs-netflix-why-tim-draper-sees-btc-as-the-next-netflix/,"Bitcoin’s exponential growth in 2024 brought all the attention to this digital asset. Interestingly, BTC’s achievement led Tim Draper to compare it to the popular streaming site Netflix, a pioneer in the multi-media industry. He presented a metaphorical connection between the two, depicting why Bitcoin is the next Netflix. Let’s explore Draper’s reasoning behind the comparison between the two and what it means for the potential of the crypto industry. The Netflix Disruption Netflix has become the mainstream media platform, beating its competitors by a large margin and attaining a $380 billion valuation. Interestingly, the same company was on the brink of bankruptcy in 2010 and was just a CD rental business before. However, it rose and developed from a movie retail business to an online blockbuster media and entertainment platform. Some even call it a real-life example of technological disruption or Netflix disruption, as it changed how people consume media. Somewhere, there is a big similarity between the rental industry and the TradeFi industry, which is also getting left behind with digital assets, especially Bitcoin, the new mode of payments based on decentralization. The way Netflix left behind its competitors, which failed to rise with new technology and trends, BTC is likely to do the same with third-party controlled, slow, and expensive traditional transactions. Its growth, where one Bitcoin is priced at $101.5k per coin with a market cap of nearly $2 T, reveals its high adoption rate. This is especially true as the soon-to-be 47th US president, Donald Trump, promised to make the US the crypto capital involving BTC. Based on this, the famous venture capitalist Tim Draper presented a Bitcoin vs. Netflix analysis, drawing a parallelism between Netflix and Bitcoin’s growth. Tim Draper Bitcoin Prediction on Why BTC Could Be the ‘Next Netflix’ Tim Draper presents a very interesting key point, hinting at Bitcoin’s dominance among traditional financial systems like Netflix in the media. With the growing adoption of this digital asset and tech giants like Elon Musk, Michael Saylor, Robert Kiyosaki, and many others seeing Bitcoin as the future, much more dominance could be seen. “Next Netflix vs. blockbuster moments to come is the Bitcoin vs Banks,” outlines Draper, boldly asserting that Bitcoin’s trajectory mirrors Netflix’s disruption. Although Tim Draper’s Bitcoin Vs. Netflix post did not clearly explain, but his few words were enough to conclude the parallelism between these two. Both, Netflix and Bitcoin are disruptive technologies, grabbing global adoption and mainstream acceptance. More importantly, BTC has already set its foot strong in the financial market, but there is much more to come. Analysts’ Bitcoin price prediction sees it achieving $225k in 2025 alone and much more in the upcoming years. Michael Saylor and many other industry leaders believe that Bitcoin is the US debt’s solution and that this digital asset would disrupt traditional banking institutions. This belief could become more prominent with Donald Trump’s presidency. Eventually, all this would make Bitcoin the pioneer of the financial industry. More importantly, as Tim Draper sees, BTC is the next Netflix for the TradeFi and banking sectors. However, this is not new Bitcoin news. Draper’s months-old Bitcoin price prediction that this asset per token will hit $3M evaluations describes his ideology, as he believes BTC is the currency of the future. Conclusion Tim Draper provided more than just a catchy analogy by calling Bitcoin the next Netflix of the financial sector. Netflix shaped the future of the media and entertainment industry, and BTC would shape the future of the financial industry with its exponential growth, global adoption, and overcoming the TradeFI, which is slow, complicated, and controlled by institutions and government. Draper’s analysis of Bitcoin Vs. Netflix depicts the future of financial freedom and a tech-driven financial system, where one token could grab a price of $3M, far away from any asset’s value.

Cardano, a decentralised blockchain platform, is widely known for its energy-efficient and scalable solutions. ADA is not the only meme coin recently attracting interest from investors, with big predictions for a mega pump in the coming weeks, as the Yeti Ouro (YETIO) and DOGE begin to spark interest. Yeti Ouro: The Successful Gaming-Oriented Altcoin Yeti Ouro is a utility-driven token behind the revolutionary Yeti Go gaming ecosystem , not just another crypto. This P2E Unreal Engine racer is such a title, building chaos and frenetic fiscal immediacy for players and investors. What Makes Yeti Ouro Unique? State-of-the-art Gameplay: Yeti Go features adrenaline-pumping PvP races where players race across treacherous races filled with hazards, power-ups, and surprises. Real Utility — Unlike meme coins, Yeti Ouro offers in-game utility, enabling players to buy items, trade assets, and earn rewards with YETIO tokens. Deflationary Model: By introducing token burns in this game, Yeti Ouro's supply decreases over time, increasing its long-term interest. Staking and Rewards: Investors can earn passive income by staking YETIO tokens, a win-win for gamers and holders. Explosive Presale: The Yeti Ouro presale is already turning heads by allowing early investors to make astonishing profits. Due to its emphasis on providing value in gaming and finance, Yeti Ouro is seen as one of the most prospective altcoins on the market. NFT Integration Common parts of a game, such as characters, tools, and weapons are considered in-game assets which are tokenized as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). All digital items belong to players and are tradable or sellable in a decentralized marketplace. Staking Rewards Yeti Ouro also provides staking opportunities for token holders beyond the gaming platform. Investors can stake their tokens to earn passive income while helping the ecosystem. Community Involvement Yeti Ouro is a community-focused initiative, with its dedicated development team constantly interacting with its players and investors, ensuring that the platform will continue to evolve based on what users want. Rising in Popularity: A Closer Look at the Presale. Yeti Ouro has already demonstrated its capabilities during its presale period, raising over $1.562 million and selling over 21 million tokens thus far in its second stage. The presale price of $0.017 makes it an affordable prospect for investors here with early investors in the first stage seeing a 40% ROI, and for a limited time, they are offering a 10% bonus. Yeti Ouro has created a sustainable ecosystem in an industry often saturated with speculative altcoins, which will drive continued demand for its tokens. This diverse, unique mix of gaming, NFT, and DeFi makes it an exciting cross-sectional project worth holding long-term. Cardano Price Prediction: The Blockchain That Scales Another notable contender in the crypto space is Cardano, designed with an energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and laser-focused on scalability, governance, security, and interoperability. Currently priced at $1.10 , ADA price is predicted to reach astounding highs by 2025 as an increasing number of developers contribute to its ecosystem. 7-day ADA price chart- source: CoinMarketCap What Drives Cardano’s Growth? Energy Efficient: The low environmental impact of Cardano positions it as an appealing option for eco-friendly investors. High Developer Adoption: As Cardano saw a steady increase in the number of projects on its blockchain, it was gaining ground as a Scalability Leader. Community Support: The loyal Cardano community continues to propel its uptake and long-term growth. Dogecoin Price Prediction: The Meme Coin Giant The original meme coin, dogecoin, remains a darling of retail investors and celebrities. Market sentiment and endorsements from big names such as Elon Musk often propelled it. 7-day Dogecoin price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Why DOGE Price Could Pump Wide-spread Usage: Dogecoin’s growing acceptance for payments increases its utility. Community Resilience: The Vibrant and Loyal Community of DOGE. Speculative Potential: Dogecoin, as a meme coin, is subject to speculation, where hype and social media trends drive prices. Conclusion While Cardano, Dogecoin, and Yeti Ouro each have their unique strengths, Yeti Ouro is leading the pack thanks to its innovative play-to-earn world, NFT integration, and opportunity to stake. As a high-growth project with real profit potential, Yeti Ouro stands out amongst competitors like Cardano, which emphasizes scalability, and Dogecoin, which exploits the power of community. For investors looking to balance entertainment and financial opportunity, Yeti Ouro is one to watch as it prepares to breakout in 2025.

The valuation of leading crypto assets like bitcoin (BTC) has soared to heights not seen since the start of the year. The latest market performance has prompted crypto experts like Arthur Hayes, BitMEX’s co-founder and former CEO, to restructure their projections. In his latest report , Hayes explained that the ongoing bull cycle will conclude in March. Bull Cycle Continues Until March In December, the BitMEX co-founder explained that the crypto market would likely face a “harrowing dump” towards January 20th because crypto enthusiasts would realize that Donald Trump’s administration may not live up to all promises. Hayes argued that the Republican president-elect cannot make sudden policy modifications after his inauguration to accommodate the crypto-oriented vows. With crypto prices rising, Hayes had to rethink his approach. He suggested that the Trump dump he speculated about had likely occurred between mid-December and the end of the year. Still, this did not rule out the possibility of a potential price drawback in the short term. “I still believe that is a potential negative factor that could weigh upon the market in the short term, but against that, I must balance the dollar liquidity impulse. Bitcoin, for now, jukes and jives as the pace of dollar emissions changes,” he wrote. Addressing risk-takers at his family office, Maelstrom, where he is the chief investment officer (CIO), Hayes recommended turning the risk dial to “degen.” He added that the market could keep seeing bullish trends until March. How Will Dollar Liquidity Play Its Role? The Maelstrom CIO projects that actions from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department will fuel positive dollar liquidity, benefiting crypto assets like BTC. He predicts that as much as $612 billion will add to the economy’s liquidity in the first quarter of this year. Shortly after, Hayes expects the negative dollar liquidity factors like the April 15 tax payment deadline to trigger players in the financial industry to migrate their money from assets like crypto to cover these expenses. This, he believes, will usher in the bearish trend.

Tron ( TRX ), the cryptocurrency founded by Justin Sun, was trading at $0.2691, slightly above its December low of $0.2237. Third-party data shows that Tron has surpassed Ethereum in terms of fees as network activity continues to rise. According to TokenTerminal , Tron has generated over $54 million in fees this year, making it the second-most profitable token after Tether ( USDT ). Ethereum ( ETH ), which has long dominated in terms of fees, has earned just $37 million. This pattern is a continuation of a trend that began in late 2024 when Tron’s network fees surged. Over the last 180 days, Tron’s fees amounted to $1.8 billion, significantly higher than Ethereum’s $822 million during the same period. Tron’s network has benefited from the launch of SunPump’s meme coin generator. According to CoinGecko , there are hundreds of SunPump tokens, which have a market cap of over $152 million. The biggest ones are Sundog, Tron Bull and Tron Bull Coin. You might also like: Bitcoin ETFs record nearly $1b inflows as BTC rallies past $102k Tron is also thriving in the stablecoin sector. According to TronScan , the network handled stablecoin transactions worth over $108 billion on Monday, with the number of transfers reaching 2.15 million. The number of Tether holders on Tron has now surpassed 58.9 million. Tron’s on-chain metrics remain notable. The network ranks as one of the most deflationary tokens in the crypto industry, having burned over 8.3 million tokens on Monday. This brings the total supply down to 86.19 billion, compared to 88.3 billion tokens a year ago. Tron supply chart | Source: TronScan Tron stakers benefit when the fees are rising at a time when the number of tokens are falling. Its staking yield stands at 4.53%, higher than Ethereum and Binance Coin ( BNB ). Tron price analysis Tron price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that TRX has risen for three consecutive weeks as investors sought to buy the dip. It remains above the key resistance level of $0.1842, which was its previous all-time high. The token is also trading above an ascending trendline that connects the lowest levels since November 2022. Tron is above the 50-week moving average, while the MACD and the Relative Strength Index have pointed upward. Therefore, the TRX token is likely to continue its upward trend as buyers target the psychological resistance level at $0.40. However, the bullish outlook would be invalidated if the price drops below the support at $0.1842.

Whale Moves 8.18 Trillion SHIB appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid the ongoing market recovery, Shiba Inu (SHIB), the world’s largest crypto meme coin, is poised for massive upside momentum. The potential reasons for this bullish speculation include recent SHIB transactions from exchanges to wallets, ongoing consolidation following a breakout, and the presidential inauguration. Crypto Whale Moves 8.18 Trillion SHIB Meme Coin Today, January 7, 2024, blockchain transaction tracker Whale Alert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a crypto whale transferred a significant 8.18 trillion SHIB meme coins, worth $195.1 million, from Crypto.com to an unknown wallet. The substantial amount of meme coins was transferred in five separate transactions of equal value. Source: X Industry experts speculate that this transaction may be a potential accumulation, which could create significant buying pressure on SHIB and lead to a notable rally in the meme coin. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, SHIB has been consolidating in a tight range between $0.00002327 and $0.00002465 for the last four trading days. However, this consolidation on SHIB’s daily chart follows the breakout of a bullish double-bottom price action pattern. Source: TradingView Additionally, on the weekly time frame, SHIB appears to be forming a bullish inverted head and shoulders price action pattern, having already formed a head and one shoulder and is now in the process of forming the second shoulder. Source: TradingView SHIB Price Prediction If this happens, we may witness significant upside momentum. Based on the recent price action and historical trends, if SHIB breaks the ongoing consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $0.000025 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 60% to reach the $0.000039 level. On the positive side, SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands well below the overbought zone, indicating that the meme coin has the potential for a significant rally in the coming days.

In the past year or so, each of these traditional finance (TradFi) leaders made bets that tokenization will become a transformative force in the financial landscape. BlackRock partnered with Securitize to tokenize assets and led a $47 million fundraise in the startup, Franklin Templeton launched a money market fund on Base, and Janus Henderson entered the foray by agreeing to manage a Liquid Treasury Fund from Anemoy. The entire sector is scaling rapidly: a Chainlink report found that the current value of tokenized assets is already north of $118 billion, and will reach up to $10 trillion by 2030.

Ethena (ENA) Ethena (ENA) has been experiencing notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price has increased by almost 29%, and over the past month, it has risen by over 15%. In the last six months, ENA has surged by nearly 188%. Currently, the price fluctuates between $0.9998 and $1.42, showing some volatility in the market. Technical indicators suggest that Ethena may be poised for further movement. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days ($1.24) is slightly above the 100-day average ($1.17), which can be a positive sign. The Relative Strength Index stands at 41.25, indicating that the asset is not overbought. The Stochastic oscillator is at 5.31, suggesting oversold conditions, which may precede a price increase. Traders are watching the nearest resistance level at $1.57; if ENA breaks through this level, it could aim for the next resistance at $1.99. This would represent a potential increase of around 40% from current levels. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) has seen a weekly gain of 12.25%, with its current price ranging from $1.82 to $2.30. Despite a monthly drop of 41.29%, the recent uptick suggests bulls are making a comeback. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 34.78, indicating the asset is nearing oversold territory. The MACD level of -0.0160 hints at decreasing bearish momentum. Short-term moving averages are close, with the 10-day SMA at $2.08 and the 100-day SMA at $2.09, showing consolidation. If bullish momentum continues, WIF could test the nearest resistance level at $2.49, representing an increase of about 10%. Breaking this level might open the path to the second resistance at $2.97, potentially yielding a gain of around 30%. However, if it fails to maintain current levels, the price could drop to the nearest support at $1.54. With a potential altcoin season and a global crypto bull run on the horizon, WIF may experience significant growth in the near term. Algorand (ALGO) Algorand’s price is currently fluctuating between $0.33 and $0.45. In the past week, it has surged over 24%, showing signs of bullish momentum. Despite this, it has experienced a decline of about 19% over the past month. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands near 47, indicating a neutral market without extreme buying or selling pressure. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are at $0.41, suggesting the price is aligning with its average trends. Looking forward, if the bulls maintain control, ALGO could challenge the nearest resistance level at $0.50. A successful break above this point might lead the price to the second resistance at $0.62, representing potential gains of over 35% from the current upper price range. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.26. The slightly negative MACD level hints at mild bearish pressure, but overall, ALGO’s recent performance indicates potential for upward movement as the market gears up. Popcat (POPCAT) Popcat (POPCAT) is trading between $0.73 and $0.99, showing market volatility. In the past week, the price increased by 16.87%, hinting at a possible shift in momentum. However, the one-month change is -40.07%, indicating recent bearish dominance. Technical indicators are mixed; the Relative Strength Index is at 41.91, suggesting neutral to slightly bearish sentiment. The Moving Averages for 10 days and 100 days are close at $0.86 and $0.88, respectively, showing alignment between short-term and long-term trends. If bulls maintain momentum, the price may test the nearest resistance at $1.11, a potential increase of about 29% from $0.86. Breaking this level could lead to the next resistance at $1.37, offering an upside of around 59%. On the downside, if bearish pressure resumes, support at $0.59 might be tested, which is roughly a 31% decrease. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge Popcat’s next move. Conclusion ENA, WIF, ALGO, and POPCAT may rise, but XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely combines sports and memes, targeting 20,000% growth and community-driven success as the “G.O.A.T of all memecoins.” You can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here: Site , Telegram , X",Press Release,EN,0,0,ALGO|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-07 14:52:50

Last month at the New York Times DealBook Summit , political analyst and media personality Van Jones admitted that the Democrats made a fatal mistake in not only largely disregarding the crypto voter but in acting against them during the last election cycle and more broadly during President Biden’s time in office. “50 million people bought some crypto — that’s a bet on [the] future,” said Jones. “They’re trying to get to a better future. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren beating the hell out of crypto was not smart,” he added. CNN host @VanJones68 says, “Democrats ran people out of the party on crypto. 50 million people bought crypto. It’s a bet on a better future” pic.twitter.com/Ee8NlutNK1 — Documenting ₿itcoin 📄 (@DocumentingBTC) January 6, 2025 Jones is one of the first prominent Democrats to publicly admit post election that the Democrats should have invited those who hold bitcoin and crypto into the party instead of pushing them away. The questions now are Will other well-known Democrats follow Jones's lead? and What would their policy proposals look like if they did? The latter question is particularly important because while Democrats may begin to say they’re “pro-crypto,” the devil is in the details. For example, when I interviewed former Congressman Wiley Nickel (D-NC) , one of the few outspoken bitcoin and crypto proponents in the Democratic party last year, I asked him if he’d support the right for bitcoin and crypto owners to hold their private keys. This was his response: “In Congress, we've really focused on doing a few things before we get into the next level of stuff. It's about regulating the industry, FIT21, the digital assets market structure bill and stablecoins. We've gotten sidetracked with SAB121 for custodial banking. Those are the things that I think we need to tackle first, and then we get into the next layer of stuff, and I'm really hopeful we're going to get those things done this Congress.” The right to hold one’s private keys is the “first level of stuff” in my book, and his lack of a direct response to my question worried me, especially when juxtaposed with what Trump said on the matter at the Libertarian National Convention in May 2024: “I will support the right to self-custody [for] the nation’s 50 million crypto holders.” -Donald J. Trump So, if the Democrats are to start shifting their rhetoric when it comes to Bitcoin and crypto, they’re also going to need to come correct when it comes to policy proposals if they plan to win over the voters they lost in this previous election cycle come midterm elections.

Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Rostin Behnam has announced his resignation from the regulatory watchdog, just two weeks before President Donald Trump is set to be sworn in. During his tenure, the CFTC pushed for comprehensive digital asset policies aimed at supporting industry growth. The agency also classified cryptocurrency leaders Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) commodities, while the Securities and Exchange Commission under outgoing chair Gary Gensler refrained from clarifying Ether’s regulatory status. Behnam has repeatedly warned about regulatory gaps in digital assets and Bitcoin, calling for greater oversight of political betting contracts and platforms. His concerns remain a key focus as he prepares to step down. Behnam previously steered the CFTC during court clashes with platforms like Kalshi, a regulated prediction market open to U.S. users. You might also like: Michael Barr resigns as Fed vice chair for supervision Rostin Behnam’s exit constitutes a proverbial “mixed bag” Despite his opposition to Kalshi and political betting markets, citing concerns about potential manipulation, Behnam’s exit from the CFTC may generate mixed reactions within the crypto community. Some of his decisions as CFTC chair became rallying points for crypto advocates, who viewed him as more open to the industry compared to other regulators. In contrast, figures like SEC Chair Gary Gensler and Federal Reserve board member Michael Barr were regarded as textbook enemies of crypto. Digital asset leaders have agreed with Behnam’s view that blockchain operations need clearer regulations to encourage innovation and business growth in the U.S. Behnam also argued that the CFTC was well-equipped to oversee digital asset markets, despite its smaller budget compared to the SEC. A bipartisan bill, known as FIT21 , proposed sharing crypto regulatory responsibilities between the CFTC and SEC. Under the bill’s terms, the CFTC would be the primary regulator for crypto exchanges and brokers.

Targets US Inflation,https://coingape.com/dogecoin-price-may-rally-to-5-as-elon-musk-doge-targets-us-inflation/,"A top analyst recently predicted Dogecoin price’s likely rally to $5 ahead, with soaring global interest towards the digital assets space. On the other hand, the recent comment from Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan has further fueled speculations. In a recent X post, the CEO said that the meme crypto is likely to go up if Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) fixes the US inflation. Dogecoin Eyes Rally As Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E. Targets US Inflation Dogecoin has witnessed impressive growth over the past few days, with increasing focus of the investors towards the meme coins sector. In addition, Elon Musk’s tie to the leading meme coin has further boosted its appeal among traders. Now, the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), a department created by Donald Trump and led by Musk, focuses on cutting government spending. D.O.G.E. said that excessive government spending is the root cause of inflation. With Vivek Ramaswamy at his side, Musk’s department seeks to implement robust fiscal policies to curb overspending and reduce inflationary pressures. Relation Between Dollar & Crypto Meanwhile, Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator, recently highlighted the link between Dogecoin’s potential rally and D.O.G.E.’s success. In a recent X post, Tan explained how government overspending inflates the money supply and devalues the dollar. Besides, he predicted Dogecoin could surge in 2025 if “Elon’s DOGE is successful” in tackling the soaring prices. Tan shared a video explaining the inflation crisis. The video outlined how inflation arises when governments create excessive cash. With the US money supply growing ten times faster than the economy, inflation has surged, eroding the purchasing power of everyday Americans. Tan emphasized the need for strict spending caps to halt further monetary dilution, which also resembles the vision of Donald Trump and his associates like the Tesla CEO. Notably, Elon Musk responded to the post, agreeing with the analysis. He noted that if inflation is controlled, the dollar price of cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin may decrease. However, he also highlighted that the value of crypto remains tied to its scarcity and utility rather than dollar inflation. DOGE Rally To $5 Imminent? The crypto community has taken note of Musk’s bold move to address inflation. Besides, analysts speculate that the Dogecoin price could witness a strong rally, driven by its cultural appeal and increasing adoption as a payment method. On the other hand, Elon Musk’s influence on Dogecoin is no secret, and his association with D.O.G.E. strengthens investor confidence. Recently, speculations have soared over a potential DOGE integration to X payments alongside other cryptocurrencies. In addition, crypto enthusiasts believe Dogecoin could emerge as a reliable store of value if Musk’s D.O.G.E. could resolve the US inflation woes. Amid this, a top analyst predicts a potential Dogecoin rally to $5, which has sparked market optimism. Meanwhile, in a recent X post, analyst CryptoELlTES said that a major move for the leading dog-themed meme coin is “just getting started.” In addition, he has set three targets for DOGE at $0.75, $1.5, and $5. Besides, he also said, “Even higher targets are on the horizon!” Source: CryptoELlTES, X Notably, DOGE price today was up 1% to $0.3868, while its trading volume jumped 26% to $3 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a high and low of $0.3978 and $0.3826, respectively. Besides, the recent DOGE whale transactions also indicate a potential rally of the meme coin.

He further explained what this development means for the flagship crypto in relation to the ongoing bull market. Bitcoin’s Weekly PPO Turns Red At $102,000 In an X post, Severino revealed that the Bitcoin weekly PPO just turned red after reaching $102,000. The analyst had mentioned before that when the weekly PPO turns red, the end is near for Bitcoin’s bull run. He warned back then that this indicator could be pointing to the top soon. Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? As to how this market top could happen now, the crypto analyst explained that the Bitcoin price will keep running once the red ticks begin, and the market will have topped before the red tick runs out. Severino also highlighted the TD Sequential as another indicator that suggests the Bitcoin peak could occur as soon as the first or second quarter of this year. He noted that BTCUSD’s quarterly candlesticks are on an 8-count. The analyst further revealed that a perfected TD9 count ended the 2017 bull run. Therefore, if history repeats itself, the Bitcoin price could top by July. However, the analyst still believes that the top could happen as early as Q1, noting that it isn’t uncommon for this peak to happen on the 8th candlestick in the sequence. He also raised the possibility of the Bitcoin bull market extending beyond Q2, stating that the TD8/9 setups could fail. However, Severino added that it seems unlikely that Bitcoin will continue trending higher for multiple quarters without a more significant correction. The crypto analyst also previously predicted that the Bitcoin price could top below $150,000 as early as January 20. He explained that Donald Trump’s inauguration could be the new paradigm leading to this cyclical peak. He made this prediction based on the fact that the market could have already priced into Trump’s pro-crypto moves. Bitcoin Price Correction Nearing Its End In the meantime, crypto analysts have suggested that the Bitcoin downtrend may be nearing its end, especially with the flagship crypto back above $100,000. In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto mentioned that a Bitcoin mark-up is imminent. This came as he remarked that the 7-week consolidation for BTC might be nearing its end. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gaussian Channel Turns Green On The 4-Hour Chart, Why A New ATH Above $1 Is Imminent Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also suggested that Bitcoin has flipped bullish once again. He remarked that the bears were no longer in control following Bitcoin’s rise above $100,000, invalidating the bearish setup. With the flagship crypto back above this price level, the crypto analyst predicted it may be ready for a sustainable rally to a cycle top. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $101,677, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The Coinbase Premium Index measures how much more or less Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading on Coinbase compared with other major exchanges. The recent CPI shift indicates increasing demand for BTC among U.S. traders and institutions, signaling a notable change in market dynamics. A positive CPI suggests BTC is trading at a premium on Coinbase, reflecting strong buying interest from U.S. investors, particularly institutions and ETF participants. In contrast, a negative CPI typically signals selling pressure or reduced demand in the U.S. market. As Coinbase is one of the most popular trading platforms in the U.S., its pricing trends are often considered a leading indicator for global market sentiment.

Simultaneously, a huge outflow of 4,012 BTC from Coinbase was noted at 18:04 local time, implying institutional investors are increasingly moving BTC away from exchanges to personal wallets; in most cases, this is viewed as a long-term ‘HODL’ing strategy and that such people have a great deal of confidence in future price movements of the asset. Burak Kesmeci, an analyst on CryptoQuant, further pointed this out. Bitcoin’s price rally beyond $102,000 aligns with this positive sentiment. The CPI is regarded as an early indicator of U.S. investor behavior and further underscores the U.S. market’s role in driving BTC price trends. Additional metrics, such as open interest and on-chain data, combined with the CPI returning to positive territory, suggest a more bullish outlook for Bitcoin in 2025.

At this point, while BTC reserves are being discussed in many countries, the latest news came from the Czech Republic. Accordingly, the president of the Czech National Bank (CNB), Aleš Michl, said that they are investigating the purchase of Bitcoin. Speaking to CNN Nes, Aleš Michl said that they are considering purchasing small amounts of Bitcoin in the future as part of their strategy to diversify their foreign exchange reserves. Michl noted that the decision to allow BTC purchases must be approved by seven members of the CNB Board of Directors. “In summary, the CNB is not currently considering purchasing Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency for its reserves. However, President Michl did not rule out discussing the idea of purchasing crypto,” said Janis Aliapulios, an advisor to the board of directors. Aliapulios also added that the bank will continue purchasing gold in the near future and plans to increase its gold holdings to around 5 percent of its total assets by 2028. But government-to-government blockchain expert Anndy Lian said interest in BTC is increasing as governments and institutions reevaluate their financial strategies to include Bitcoin. While this is a positive change, Lian warned that price volatility could pose a risk to national reserves. *This is not investment advice.

However, the country has also suffered from a bloody civil war, with several regions still under the control of anti-government forces, like the ethno-nationalist Amhara militia Fano. But that hasn’t prevented Chinese bitcoin ( BTC ) mining company BIT Mining (BTCM) from expanding its operations — until now confined to Akron, Ohio — into Ethiopia by signing a $14 million deal to acquire facilities worth 51 megawatts (MW) and almost 18,000 bitcoin mining rigs in the country. In fact, for Dr. Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, Ethiopia’s ultra-low electricity costs provide the firm with a unique opportunity to extend the shelf life of its bitcoin mining rigs which, due to the industry’s extreme competitiveness, tend to become obsolete in the U.S. after roughly two or two-and-a-half years of activity, he said. “The price of electricity is maybe 70% higher in Ohio than in Ethiopia, sometimes almost double, so it can only run very advanced ASICs, like the newest or second newest generations,” Yang told CoinDesk in an interview. “Now we can just move older generation machines into Ethiopia.” It’s a big deal, because aside from mining litecoin ( LTC ) and dogecoin ( DOGE ), BIT Mining is mainly in the hosting business, meaning that it operates mining facilities for the sake of various clients. State-of-the-art mining rigs don’t come cheap (a single machine fetching anywhere between $5,000 and $10,000 for retail buyers) and investors are naturally reluctant to send such expensive pieces of machinery to war-torn jurisdictions. The pitch, then, is to install the newer rigs in the U.S. and send out the aging ones to Ethiopia. That creates a positive feedback loop, because now investors can extract greater returns from their machines than if BIT Mining restricted itself to operating in the U.S. That, in turn, attracts more capital, Yang said. “We can get at least two extra years by moving the rigs to Ethiopia, and then maybe after that, they’re completely done,” Yang said. Mining bitcoin in Ethiopia But why Ethiopia specifically? For one thing, the country’s electric standard is similar to China’s, which allows BIT Mining to leverage the expertise of its engineering team and redeploy some of the electric equipment it previously used in the Middle Kingdom before the bitcoin mining ban. Ethiopia also enjoys an abundance of hydroelectric power, some of it thanks to Chinese investments, which have totalled $8.5 billion across more than 3,000 projects in recent years. For example, China helped fund the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD); once completed, it will be the largest dam in Africa and generate over 5,000 MW. Not all of Ethiopia’s electric output has been put to use yet, however, and that has created a window of opportunity for bitcoin miners, especially since the Ethiopian government has been supportive of the mining industry. In fact, the country is home to 1.5% of Bitcoin's total hashrate, according to Hashrate Index, meaning that it contributes about as much to the network as Norway . That’s despite the fact that the Ethiopian federal government has a shaky control over the country’s overall territory. Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians were killed in the government’s war against the Tigray People's Liberation Front between 2020 and 2022, and the state only just signed a peace treaty in December with the Oromo Liberation Army, which it had been fighting in some form or other since the 1970s. When asked whether BIT Mining had concerns about the social unrest in the country, Yang replied that the firm had been “studying, researching and also visiting [Ethiopia] several times, just [ascertain] that it’s a stable place.” The decision was made to purchase a facility instead of building it from scratch to avoid any unforeseen trouble, he said. Even so, it was a challenge convincing BIT Mining employees to move to Ethiopia from their previous domiciles in the U.S. or China, Yang said. “People obviously like to live and work in richer and safer countries,” he said. While a third of the facility’s operating team are foreign right now, the team will be composed of mostly locals down the line, he said. In the meantime, the company is on the lookout for new investments in the country — be them energy infrastructure projects, data centers for artificial intelligence (AI) purposes, or other bitcoin mining facilities. “There's plenty of opportunities in Ethiopia,” Yang said. “The AI thing… We've been studying it for the last six to nine months. We have the power. We have the people. We have the ability to do it. But [the whole process] is very capital heavy. Construction in the U.S. is a lot more expensive, so it's very hard to do a pilot experiment, but it's a lot easier to [try one] in Ethiopia.”",Finance|BIT Mining|Bitcoin Mining|Ethiopia,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 15:13:26

The average daily revenues for SCPs reached $17M in December 2024, the highest since April. The public DA layer market has grown increasingly competitive as other players like Avail, EigenDA, NEAR DA, and others continue to push for new partnerships and announcements. In December, blockchain activity surged with record DEX volumes despite crypto price drops. We highlight Hyperliquid's rise and Ethereum's challenges in the data availability market. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. After a spectacular November, most Smart Contract Platforms (SCPs) experienced significant price corrections in December. The Market Vectors Smart Contract Leaders Index (MVSCLE) declined by 12%, with ETH down 10% and SOL plunging 21%. Conversely, BTC demonstrated resilience, down only 4%, thanks to consistent buying from MicroStrategy (MSTR) and the exchange-traded products (ETPs). Notable token gainers in December included MNT (+38%) , TRX (TRX-USD) (+23%) , and SUI (SUI-USD) (+20%). Despite altcoins’ underperformance in the month, daily transactions across all chains reached a record high of 13.7M , surpassing November’s 13M. Revenue Comparison Notable Performers Notable Laggards Data Availability Market Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Outperformed Other Majors During December Pullback The average daily revenues for SCPs reached $17M in December 2024, the highest since April. Ethereum (ETH-USD) reclaimed its revenue leadership, generating $7M daily compared to Solana’s (SOL-USD) $4M . Despite emerging competitors like Sui, Base, and Hyperliquid, the top-earning chains in 2024 were Ethereum, Solana, TRX, BTC, and BNB. DEX trading volume reached an all-time high of $433B in December, exceeding November’s $380B. However, the gains were unevenly distributed. 18 of the 32 tracked chains recorded volume increases, led by Tron (TRON-USD) (+178%) and BNB (BNB-USD) (+54%). Notably, Solana’s DEX volume fell (-10%) while Ethereum’s was up (+27%) on the month. Chains such as Ton (-32%), Gnosis (GNO-USD) (-31%), and Scroll (-29%) saw the largest declines.

Top Blockchain Revenue Comparison Ethereum once dominated revenue generation, averaging five times the revenue of its closest competitor in 2023. However, its strategy to scale through Layer-2 (L2) blockchains - transactions processed off Ethereum and settled back to it - has redistributed economic value while other chains have gained users. Recall that Ethereum’s March 2024 upgrade created ""blob space,"" significantly reducing costs for L2s while boosting transaction capacity by ~100x. This shift allowed Ethereum to process more transactions but reduced its direct revenue share. In January 2023, Ethereum controlled 66% of SCP revenues; by December 2024, this had fallen to 41%. Lower blockspace prices and competition from chains like Solana and emerging players such as Sui, Base, and Hyperliquid also contributed to this decline. Despite these challenges, Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem. It continues to adapt by addressing community concerns about its economic model and the risks posed by centralized L2 sequencers. These centralized systems capture 70-90% of transaction fees and are susceptible to single points of failure.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Addressing Execution Layer Concerns Ethereum’s developers are actively exploring solutions to strengthen its execution layer and improve scalability. A key proposal is increasing the gas limit by 20%, enabling Ethereum to process more transactions per block. Gas measures resource utilization: a transfer between accounts consumes minimal gas, while complex operations like DEX trades consume significantly more. Currently, Ethereum targets 15M gas per block with a cap of 30M. This allows for approximately 59 simple transactions per second or 7 Uniswap (UNI-USD) trades. While increasing the gas limit could reduce fees by 10-30%, researchers like Dankrad Feist advocate for a more ambitious doubling of the gas limit to 60M . This would not match Solana’s throughput but would demonstrate Ethereum’s commitment to scaling its L1 capabilities to accommodate mass adoption of decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum’s governance model plays a crucial role in implementing changes. Unlike token-holder voting, changes to Ethereum are enacted by validators updating their software. As of December 2024, over 20% of validators signaled support for increasing the gas limit, and this proportion continues to grow. If more than 50% of the users adopt the software update, the change will be implemented network-wide. We think Ethereum’s evolution underscores its ability to adapt to the demands of a growing blockchain ecosystem. By addressing scalability and centralization challenges while maintaining its role as the backbone of decentralized finance and applications, Ethereum aims to solidify its leadership in an increasingly competitive environment. The Percentage of Ethereum Validators Raising Gas Limit is Increasing December’s Notable Performer - Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) +234% Hyperliquid Surges from 10% Market Share to 70% in One Year One of the themes of December was the radical success of the Hyperliquid project and its token, $HYPE, which returned (+234%) in December alone. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid launched its token and airdropped 27.5% of its total supply of $HYPE token to 94K users. Initially worth $1B, the value of this airdrop surged to $7.5B in value at the time of writing, making the $HYPE airdrop the largest in the history of crypto. In just one month of trading, Hyperliquid ranks as the 13th most valuable project in crypto at around $28B in fully diluted value. Hyperliquid Deep Dive Hyperliquid is a blockchain originally designed to optimize one application - a decentralized perpetual futures exchange (Perp DEX). It is technically a “Hybrid Blockchain” that should be considered in both the Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-3 (L3) categories. Hyperliquid operates in its own set of validators that form consensus, which technically makes it an L1. However, Hyperliquid also posts proof of its activity to Arbitrum (an L2), which makes it an L3. This framework was chosen because as an L1, Hyperliquid can create the architecture to greatly scale trading activity. At the same time because it is an L3, it can access Ethereum’s immense base of users and assets. Hyperliquid is successful because it created a better product, harnessed itself to a strong distribution mechanism, and cultivated a loyal community. In just under a year, Hyperliquid has not only attained status as the top Perpetual (Perp) Futures Decentralized Exchange ((DEX)) in crypto, but also currently hosts 5x the trading volume of its nearest competitor. In December, Hyperliquid’s exchange hosted $156B in trading volume; the protocol earned $10.5M in trading revenues in just the last week of the month. Hyperliquid’s success story begins with its product. It offers a better trading experience than most other DEXes because it is hosted on a purpose-built blockchain and optimized for high throughput. Hyperliquid can process 100K orders per second, whereas most competitors like GMX and Vertex can process several magnitudes less. Even dYdX, which has its own bespoke trading blockchain, can only process 2K orders per second. Additionally, Hyperliquid offers a cheaper product with a lower fee structure than its rivals. For example, in December 2024, Hyperliquid charged an average of 0.68 basis points (bps) per $ of trading volume vs. dYdX, who charged 2 bps per $. Hyperliquid also gives open trading rebates to anyone with enough liquidity on its platform. This open rebate system contrasts with most other perpetual futures exchanges, which only offer rebates through non-public side deals. Hyperliquid combines a better product and cheaper pricing with its ability to quickly onboard high-value users due to its close proximity to Ethereum. As a result of its L3 architecture, it can offer Ethereum users a relatively safer bridge and thus access $75B in application tokens, $111B in stablecoins, and $400B in ETH, all housed on Ethereum. dYdX, who created its own chain in the Cosmos, is unable to offer a comparably safe and simple asset bridging experience. Since launching its own chain in fall 2023, dYdX has not exceeded $600M in TVL in its 15-month history, whereas Hyperliquid currently holds $2.2B in TVL. Despite these advantages, Hyperliquid is a DEX, and these types of businesses tend to lack long-term competitive moats. This is because most DEXes are based on open-source code and offer features that are easy to copy. Because of this dynamic, each DEX has to find a way to glue users to its trading ecosystem. The solution that many choose is to introduce a token that can be used for the “governance” of the DEX. This token is often airdropped to users of the DEX as a reward for their activity. Many assume these tokens will eventually earn revenue from DEX usage and thus grant holders a stream of dividend-like rewards. As such, the effect of these airdrops is to give DEX users ownership shares in the DEX’s success. Decentralized Exchange ((DEX)) Airdrop Token Performance After Airdrop The airdrop “games” for DEXes arguably kicked off in mid-September 2020, with Sushiswap launching its SUSHI tokens in an attempt to steal Uniswap’s user base. Within five days of SUSHI’s airdrop, Uniswap created the UNI token and handed it out to its own users. The value of this UNI airdrop was $350M in 2020, and these same tokens are now worth around $1.4B . Thereafter, DEXes have competed for users by giving them valuable tokens. dYdX also launched a very successful airdrop in September 2021 when it gave its user base 75M token worth $1B . We consider Uniswap’s and dYdX’s airdrops successful because they catalyzed long-term business dominance in a sector of crypto without much competitive edge. Uniswap was the top DEX by volume every single month between July 2020 and October 2024, while dYdX held a similar crown amongst Perp DEXes between February 2021 and May 2024. While many other DEXes have launched airdrops, very few have been able to translate their token airdrops into success for their platforms’ businesses. These failures partly reflect the difficulty of building a community of DEX users because most traders are “mercenaries” who lack loyalty to an application. Often, traders who expect an airdrop will inflate their activity to satisfy the airdrop’s criteria; typically, tokens are allocated pro-rata based on trading volume to receive the highest number of tokens. This creates a feedback loop for many airdrop recipients creating fake activity, making a DEX appear more successful than reality, selling their tokens, and moving on to a fresh airdrop campaign. Thereafter, DEXes see volumes dry up, and their token prices decline as the inorganic activity that drove false usership statistics leaves. DEXes such as Gains, GMX (GMX-USD), Vertex, RabbitX, and many others once commanded significant market shares of DEX Perp trading volumes, but each has declined into obscurity. Hyperliquid’s Market Cap Exceeds All Peer Market Caps Combined Though it is early, Hyperliquid has avoided the fate of most crypto DEXes and has reached valuations not seen by previous DEX projects. This is because Hyperliquid has built a growth story founded upon becoming a general-purpose blockchain that will accommodate other applications besides its “hyper” successful Perp DEX. This is interesting because it bucks the trend of most other blockchains that start from the beginning as general-purpose blockchains that hope to land a “killer application.” Hyperliquid’s spot asset DEX already processed enough trading volume, $260M per day, to rank 8th among all DEXes. Because Hyperliquid is based upon EVM, it can attract developers from Ethereum who are seeking a chain that can better accommodate their applications’ use cases. Hyperliquid’s valuation, which stands around $28B , is more valuable than most blockchains and has yet to attract much of a developer community. If Hyperliquid is unable to meet the growth expectations of its community, the prisoner’s dilemma facing many newly rich $HYPE holders may quickly unravel. Once again, we can see another Icarian tale about crypto hubris. December’s Notable Performer - Mantle (MNT)(MANTLE-USD) +35% Total Value Locked Among Top Alt-DA Ethereum L2s Introduction to Mantle Mantle had a standout performance in December as it reached a series of technical milestones that further solidified its position as a leading ‘Alt-DA’ Ethereum L2. The market has responded enthusiastically as Mantle’s TVL surpassed $2B, and MNT’s price approached its all-time high set in April 2024. Mantle’s decentralized exchange ((DEX)) volumes indicated sustained user activity, measuring $1.4B in December after reaching back-to-back all-time highs of $1.6B and $2.3B in October and November. Total transactions increased to 12.1M in December, up from 9.9M and 10.0M in October and November, respectively. Mantle is an Ethereum L2 that hosts transactions on its own blockchain, posts proofs of that activity on Ethereum, and the full breadth of the data for that activity on a separate special-purpose network called ‘Mantle DA’ for data availability. This procedure contrasts with most Ethereum “roll-ups” like Arbitrum and Optimism, which post both the data and settlements on Ethereum. Technically, this classifies Mantle as a “validium” rather than a true L2 roll-up. As an 'Alt-DA' L2, Mantle DA uses a custom version of EigenLayer’s EigenDA technology to ensure the raw transaction data needed to verify commitments remains publicly accessible. Instead of posting transaction data directly to Ethereum blobs, Mantle posts only state commitments - referred to as 'settlements' - to Ethereum for validation. These settlements are cryptographic proofs summarizing the current L2 state, such as account balances. Mantle’s modular design enhances scalability and cost efficiency compared to rollups but introduces additional risk by relying on a system external to Ethereum. Thus far, these systems have been less popular than roll-ups because they have not assembled active ecosystems. By total value locked (TVL), Mantle leads alt-DAs at $2.08B in TVL but lags rollups Arbitrum One ($18.7B ), Base ($14.0B), and OP Mainnet ($7.40B). Mantle’s $1.6B of DEX volumes rank similarly, lagging Arbitrum’s ($33.7B), Base’s ($52.2B), and OP Mainnet’s ($5.3B ). However, Mantle claims 90% reduced costs compared to traditional Ethereum L2 rollups. If alt-DA L2s can securely sustain these cost savings, they may eventually surpass rollups in TVL. Mantle’s Key Developments Mantle achieved several significant milestones in December, reinforcing its position as a leading Alt-DA Ethereum Layer 2. First, Mantle announced a key partnership with Chainlink (LINK-USD), adopting Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). CCIP enables developers to create applications that seamlessly transfer tokens and communicate across multiple blockchains, making Mantle more attractive to projects requiring cross-chain functionality. Leveraging Chainlink’s reputation for secure, battle-tested code, this partnership highlights Mantle’s strategic focus on building brand network effects, onboarding liquidity, and attracting developers to its ecosystem. Mantle also announced integration with Succinct’s ‘SP1’ zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM), marking a critical step in the L2’s roadmap transitioning from an optimistic to a zero-knowledge ((ZK)) validity rollup. This is important because it reduces Mantle’s transaction finality times from seven days to one hour. Finality is important because it lets traders know that their trades are settled so they can redeploy capital elsewhere. This boosts capital efficiency by enabling tighter trading spreads, lower borrowing rates in DeFi markets, and improved access to assets for traders and lenders. Further, by aligning with Ethereum’s interoperability standards, this upgrade helps Mantle benefit from the growth of Ethereum’s broader L2 ecosystem. This can be considered devices adopting the USB standard; it allows Mantle to seamlessly “plug in” to a network of compatible blockchains, including rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism. Mantle’s interoperability advancements culminated in December with the integration of Compound III, a significant milestone highlighting the network’s growing liquidity and cross-chain capabilities. This upgrade introduced Ethena’s USDe stablecoin, Ignition’s wrapped Bitcoin FBTC, Mantle’s liquid staking token mETH, and wETH as new collateral options, further boosting Mantle’s DeFi ecosystem and network effects. To incentivize adoption, Mantle committed $10M in supply-side treasury liquidity on USDe markets and $1M in MNT rewards to incentivize users to interact with the protocol. However, at the time of writing, Mantle’s USDe market activity is relatively modest, with a 21% utilization rate, possibly reflecting cautious early adoption or a lack of immediate demand for borrowing. December’s Notable Laggard - Celestia (TIA)(TIA-USD) -41% Eclipse Accounted for ~95% of Celestia Blob Data in Late December Celestia’s Key Developments Down (-41%) , Celestia was one of December’s worst performers, despite recent traction in its core service: providing data availability services to other blockchains. The Data Availability Market As a modular data availability ((DA)) blockchain, Celestia focuses on securing transaction data while leaving execution to other layers. Data availability ensures that transaction data remains accessible for public validation without requiring all participants to store it entirely, a critical component for scaling high-throughput applications like gaming, logistics tracking, and real-time financial settlements. This approach to data availability can be thought of like a library where everyone can access the same book without needing to store their own copy, ensuring efficient access without overwhelming storage resources. Through these efficiency gains, DA layers like Celestia aim to enable the mass adoption of modular blockchain architectures, gaining traction through Ethereum’s scaling roadmap. So far, Celestia’s primary competitor in the data availability ((DA)) market has been Ethereum, though new entrants like EigenLayer DA, Avail, NEAR, and Sui are adding to the competition. Since the start of Q3, Ethereum has consistently received twice as much average weekly blob data as Celestia - that is, until the week of December 23rd. That week, Eclipse, a modular Ethereum L2 launched in early December using Celestia for data availability, saw a 4,300% surge in transactions, causing Celestia to process ~3.4x more blob data than Ethereum. This spike in demand was driven by Eclipse’s blockchain design, which generates significant data volume as part of its high-throughput operations. By year’s end, Eclipse accounted for ~95% of Celestia’s total blobs. Despite this influx, Eclipse remains a nascent ecosystem, with only ~$36M in bridge deposits and most of its transactions being unrelated to user activity. While this demonstrates Celestia’s ability to handle substantial data loads, its blob fees remain far lower than Ethereum’s, earning just ~$6K per week compared to Ethereum’s $921K . Year-to-date, Celestia has generated ~$72K in blob fees versus Ethereum’s ~$8.4M , highlighting Ethereum’s dominance in the data availability (DA) market. TIA, ETH, and the Data Availability Market Celestia’s Blob Fees Stagnated as Ethereum’s Grew Steadily in Q4 Celestia vs. Ethereum as Data Availability (DA) Products Celestia’s potential advantage as a data availability (DA) layer lies in its lower costs and innovative data availability sampling (DAS) architecture, which enables scalable and cost-efficient solutions for high-throughput applications. Referring back to our library analogy, data availability sampling is like each member of the library having a random assortment of pages of all the library’s books; this prevents each member from having to store each of the library’s books but ensures that each book can be reassembled if called upon. In the second half of 2024, Celestia’s blobs earned $50.9K in fees at an average cost of $0.19 per MB , ~1/60th the average cost of Ethereum’s blobs, which earned $4.90M at an average cost of $11.14 per MB . This affordability positions Celestia as a compelling option for lower-stakes applications, such as gaming or supply chain solutions. Despite Celestia’s affordability and efficiency, many projects continue to prioritize Ethereum’s blobspace due to its superior decentralization, security, and reliability. Combined with its robust Layer 2 ecosystem, Ethereum remains the preferred choice for mission-critical applications. Ethereum’s network effects are further amplified by ongoing innovation among its L2s, which are actively reducing the number of blobs they consume. If Ethereum successfully scales its blobspace through DAS or other methods while maintaining its superior security, it may limit opportunities for low-cost upstarts like Celestia to gain significant market share. TIA vs. ETH as Data Availability (DA) Investments As investments, the differing value accrual mechanisms of Celestia’s TIA and Ethereum’s ETH are also important factors to consider. In Ethereum’s DA model, blob fees are paid in ETH and burned, creating a deflationary effect on ETH’s supply. Ethereum’s recent blob fee growth may, therefore, be contributing to a potential bottom in the ETH/BTC ratio, which has been forming since mid-November. This deflationary mechanism, combined with ETH’s extensive adoption across on-chain markets, games, and Layer 2 blockchains, strengthens its position as “internet money.” In contrast, TIA’s DA service fees, which are paid in TIA, are distributed to validators as staking rewards. This model creates sell pressure on TIA markets, as validators must sell earned tokens to realize rewards, whereas Ethereum’s success as a DA layer creates a deflationary effect that benefits all ETH holders. Further, demand for TIA depends on Celestia’s ability to attract rollups and modular blockchains as customers. While this effectively positions TIA as an investment tied to Celestia’s adoption, its use cases are narrower compared to ETH, which benefits from broader retail money-like adoption and deflationary dynamics. As the DA market becomes increasingly commodified by other new entrants, TIA will need to establish a technical moat to lock in DA fees or develop its own value-accruing narrative like ETH’s money utility to remain competitive. The Broader Data Availability (DA) Market Ethereum’s Economic Security Provides a Moat Attracting Total Value Secured ((TVS)) The public DA layer market has grown increasingly competitive as other players like Avail, EigenDA, NEAR DA, and others continue to push for new partnerships and announcements. However, the real, sustainable differentiation these services offer remains to be proven. EigenDA, which launched in April 2024, leverages Ethereum’s validator set to provide a decentralized data availability solution. By reusing Ethereum’s security via “restaking,” EigenLayer positions itself as a cost-efficient alternative for rollups seeking reliable DA services without building separate consensus mechanisms. EigenDA has secured significant partnerships including Mantle and Celo. However, Mantle uses a custom (non-public) DA layer forked from EigenDA with significant modifications, most notably the removal of slashing conditions, and Celo’s transition from an L1 to an Ethereum L2 is in testnet, so its TVL is not yet reflected in EigenDA’s public DA layer’s total value secured (TVS). Avail, which went live in July 2024, similarly offers modular DA capabilities optimized for zero-knowledge rollups, targeting high-throughput applications like entertainment and social networks, illustrated by its partnerships with Lens and Sophon. NEAR DA has partnered with RSS3, a decentralized network that supports open AI and the Open Web, affording it the second-highest TVS despite earning de minimis fees relative to Ethereum and Celestia. Mysten Labs, the developers behind Sui, is the latest to join the trend, announcing the whitepaper for a decentralized storage and DA protocol called Walrus in September. Despite this diversity, many DA solutions offer comparable performance and cost structures, limiting their ability to stand out. Thus, Ethereum continues to dominate the DA market due to its superior network effects. User adoption and trust remain key strengths, with Ethereum’s blobspace benefiting from the security and decentralization of its mature validator set. Ethereum’s dominant developer ecosystem also reinforces its position with extensive tooling, SDKs, and compatibility with zk-rollups and optimistic rollups, locking in projects to its infrastructure. Additionally, Ethereum promotes interoperability and composability. A widely adopted DA layer promotes interoperability across various blockchains and rollups, fostering a broader ecosystem of composable applications. Ethereum’s DA solutions are also associated with economies of scale, as a larger user base can distribute costs (e.g., for storage or validation) and theoretically coordinate governance more effectively, reducing fees and improving technical upgrades for everyone. Understanding Slashable Stake and Total Value Secured (TVS) Lastly, it is important to understand the role of ‘economic security’ as it pertains to the data availability market, as it is this feature of Ethereum that arguably creates its biggest moat. In the data availability market, ‘economic security,’ quantified by ‘slashable stake,’ is the total value of staked assets at risk of being slashed (penalized) if validators act maliciously. This ensures validators are incentivized to maintain honest behavior, as they have significant financial stakes in the network’s security. Malicious behaviors include withholding critical data required for rollups or modular blockchains to verify their state, proposing blocks with incomplete or corrupted data, or colluding with other validators to make data unavailable. These actions could undermine the security and functionality of the network, disrupting applications and potentially leading to financial losses for users. While Total Value Locked (TVL) measures the value of assets directly held within a single blockchain or Layer 2, Total Value Secured (TVS) represents the cumulative value of all blockchains that rely on a DA layer for security and scalability. For example, Ethereum’s $46.9B in TVS reflects the value of its extensive and high-value rollup ecosystem, significantly higher than other public DA layers such as NEAR DA’s $1.87B and Celestia’s $0.95B in TVS.

Not being currently in the priority agenda, this at once shows a growing awareness on the part of the government and institutions of cryptocurrency as a viable financial tool. Bitcoin as a Means of Diversification Speaking to CNN Prima News, Michl suggested purchasing “a few Bitcoin” could be done as part of diversification. Any such move would have to be approved by the CNB’s seven-member board. Eventually, bank board member Janis Aliapulios added that, while there are no plans to actually purchase Bitcoin, at least for the time being, and the governor will not rule it out in principle. Meanwhile, the CNB is focused on building its stashes of gold, aiming to increase their proportion in the overall stash to 5% by 2028. Bitcoin versus Gold With its performance drawing attention to a 131% rise in value over the past year-very far ahead of gold’s 30%-the strong return has fueled debates on Bitcoin’s viability as a potential reserve asset. According to Anndy Lian, a specialist in blockchain, this is because Bitcoin can redefine traditional “safe” assets and promote financial decentralization and innovation. But the price volatility of Bitcoin may pose some risk in making it a national reserve, due to the impact of steep value swings on financial stability. US Bitcoin Act Gains Momentum Bitcoin isn’t only Europe’s darling. The Bitcoin Act in the US, spearheaded by Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, is one calling for a strategic reserve of Bitcoin. A bill that keeps gathering speed, the Bitcoin Act enjoys bipartisan support as it is also supported by Democratic Representative Ro Khanna. The prospects of this act have been strengthened by the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican majority in Congress. State-level initiatives, such as the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act in Pennsylvania, further demonstrate the viability of such policies. Bitcoin’s Potential as a Reserve Asset Analysts predict profound effects if Bitcoin becomes a staple reserve asset. According to Blockstream CEO Adam Back, Bitcoin could be worth as much as $1 million in the event of greater adoption. Adding Bitcoin to national reserves might upend global finance, wresting gold’s long-held hegemony and shifting toward a decentralized model for economic stability.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance shows potential for explosive gains in 2025, echoing SHIB and SOL’s transformative 2021 surges. Table of Contents The rise of Rexas Finance: A presale success story The numbers behind RXS: Why it’s the next big crypto What’s next for Rexas Finance? With coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Solana (SOL) , cryptocurrency investors saw shockingly high gains in 2021. While SOL jumped 24,630% to reach $260 ATH, SHIB shot over 33,000% to reach an all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008. These explosive increases transformed little investments into sums of life-changing value. The focus now is on Rexas Finance (RXS) , a cryptocurrency likely to follow a similar breakout path in 2025. Originally priced at $0.030 in presale stage 1, RXS has already climbed 490% from its current $0.175 pricing. Market experts estimate it might rocket to $17.50, providing an incredible 9,900% return on investment, transforming a $250 investment into $25,000 in 2025. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted The rise of Rexas Finance: A presale success story With its outstanding presale success, Rexas Finance created conditions before unprecedented expansion. Starting in September 2024 at $0.030, RXS jumped to $0.175 in stage 11, a 490% rise. With 389,492,531 RXS tokens sold and $34,786,592 raised, this rise has grabbed great interest. Such momentum suggests the possibility of RXS copying or even exceeding SHIB and SOL’s success stories. Still, what distinguishes Rexas Finance ? The project’s basis is its original value proposition: blockchain technology bridges actual resources. This invention has made Rexas Finance a game-changing participant in the crypto market. The Rexas Token Builder also allows anyone to tokenize their assets without writing a single line of code. This function democratizes asset tokenization, allowing people and companies to investigate blockchain-based ownership and trading. The numbers behind RXS: Why it’s the next big crypto The figures cannot lie. Initially priced at $0.030 at stage 1, RXS’s presale price at stage 11 has already increased 6x to $0.175; an additional increase is expected as the presale advances. With early investors promised a 100x return, analysts estimate RXS will reach $17.50 by 2025. Comparatively, a $250 investment at the present price may yield $25,000 — a return akin to the spectacular increases of SHIB and SOL in 2021. Furthermore, the maximum total quantity of RXS tokens is one billion, guaranteeing scarcity and long-term value. This limited supply and the rising demand driven by its creative ecosystem make RXS a top option for explosive development. Rexas Finance’s Certik audit, a monument to its strong security and dependability, boosts investor confidence even more. Its placement on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko further improves visibility so investors can monitor RXS’s real-time performance. These elements highlight the project’s dedication to openness and credibility. Unlike many crypto initiatives that depend on venture capital, Rexas Finance has adopted a community-driven strategy. This choice fits its aim of including private investors in transforming actual asset tokenization. Rexas Finance is offering an incredible $1 million RXS giveaway to encourage involvement. Twenty lucky winners will receive RXS valued at $50,000. Completing tasks and distributing the giveaway on social media will increase participants’ chances of winning, given that there have already been 710,257 entries. Rexas Finance solves one of the most urgent financial sector issues: the discrepancy between conventional assets and blockchain technology. Supporting several token standards — including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 — allows the platform to guarantee adaptability and fit. Rexas Finance introduces real estate, gold, and rare art onto blockchain networks, releasing liquidity and fresh investment possibilities. What’s next for Rexas Finance? With its current price of $0.175 as of writing and estimates of rising to $17.50 by 2025, RXS presents a rare opportunity for those looking for significant gains. Strong community support, creative elements of the project, and open operations set it apart in the packed crypto industry. The popularity of Shiba Inu and Solana in 2021 proved the transforming power of early cryptocurrency investments. Today, Rexas Finance is starting to emerge as the next great prospect. With its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization, outstanding presale growth, and aggressive price targets, RXS is positioned for significant large returns. Interested investors should consider grabbing their chance to join this unique project. A $250 investment in RXS at $0.175 can yield you a whopping $25,000 profit by the year 2025.

Donald Trump’s victory in the November U.S. presidential election and the positive outcome of Ripple’s case against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) catalyzed the first part of XRP’s current bullish cycled and propelled its price to an all-time high of $2.90 per token. However, the best is yet to come for the token as Trump’s plans for the crypto industry include drafting adequate regulation for the sector to boost the credibility and adoption of digital assets along. In addition, industry observers agree that Solana ($SOL) and Ripple ($XRP) would be the next in line to get a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved for their tokens once the new Chairman of the financial watchdog takes the reins. The latest rally that XRP experienced pushed it to become the third most valuable digital asset in the crypto space with a market capitalization of $139.02 billion. So far this year, the token has delivered gains of 16.3%. Considering that both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have brought in capital inflows of over $120 billion, the approval of such a vehicle for XRP will likely push its price above $3 in the near term. XRP Triple Bottom Could Propel its Price to $3 Per Token Shortly The price of XRP has been stalling and consolidating since early December as market participants took a breather to take some profits off the table after such tremendous gains. During this period, the price of XRP has bottomed three times at or near the $1.95 level. As a result, a bullish pattern called “triple bottom” has formed that could push the price to the $4 area shortly if confirmed. Triple bottoms indicate that there is a lot of pent-up demand at certain price point. Once market participants notice, the price starts to move higher as buyers open long positions with the expectation that FOMO will pressure late buyers to enter the trade. Data from Coinglass shows that open interest for XRP futures has been steadily increasing since the beginning of the year and that could explain why the token is up 16% thus far. For this triple bottom to be fully confirmed the price would have to surge above $2.5 first and then break the $3 area. If that happens, chances are that we will see XRP moving to the $4 and even $5 in mid to late January.

Behnam joins Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler on choosing the very last day of the administration of President Joe Biden as their final day running their respective agencies. As President-elect Donald Trump is again sworn in, his new administration will have fresh vacancies atop those commissions. ""We have welcomed new opportunities to modernize, build capabilities, and, with the support of the Congress, incorporate the innovations shaping our markets,"" he said in a Tuesday statement about his exit, first from the chairmanship and later – next month – from the commission itself. Behnam noted that the CFTC under his tenure ""responsibly engaged new entrants to support innovation."" He leaves the CFTC on the cusp of what's likely a future ascension to take over regulation of crypto spot markets, including the trading of bitcoin ( BTC ). In most of the legislative efforts that sought to establish U.S. rules of the road for the crypto sector, the derivatives watchdog takes a leading role. Behnam's Republican replacement will likely steer that new assignment if Congress finally approves a bill. While Behnam's agency got some credit from the crypto sector for being more reasonable than the SEC, it was also responsible for some of the heaviest enforcement actions against digital assets businesses.

The company is scrapping its third-party fact-checking program in the United States and rolling out a Community Notes system. Inspired by rival X (formerly Twitter), the program will allow users to flag misleading posts and add context directly. Meta wants to ditch what it calls “over-enforcement” and move back to its roots: free expression. The change couldn’t come sooner for many users. Meta’s platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, have often been criticized for being too strict, often censoring harmless content and stifling political debates. Millions of posts were removed daily last year, yet the company admits 10-20% of these takedowns may have been mistakes. That’s a staggering number when you consider the scale of its operations. Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, says the company wants to “ undo the mission creep ” and return to being a place where people can speak freely. Community Notes hands the power to users Meta will no longer write or control the notes or decide which ones are visible. Instead, users will draft and rate notes on flagged posts. To avoid bias, agreement from people with different perspectives will be required before a note is approved. Meta promises to show how diverse viewpoints contribute to the notes and will expand its reporting on moderation errors to build trust. The rollout begins in the United States over the next few months. People can already sign up on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads to be among the first contributors. Once live, Community Notes will replace Meta’s current content moderation tools, including the much-hated interstitial warnings that blocked posts until users clicked through. These will be replaced with smaller, less intrusive labels offering more context for those who want it. In December 2024, Meta removed millions of pieces of content every day. While this represented less than 1% of all posts, the sheer volume of mistakes exposed flaws in the system. Users frequently complained about being thrown into “Facebook jail” or having their posts unfairly flagged. AI to clean up moderation and boost efficiency Artificial intelligence is at the heart of Meta’s overhaul. The company has been quietly integrating large language models (LLMs) into its moderation processes. These AI systems provide a second opinion on flagged content before enforcement actions are taken. This has already reduced errors and sped up appeals for users who believe their posts were wrongfully removed. AI is becoming a core part of Meta’s broader strategy. On January 1, the company announced plans to introduce AI-generated user-profiles and content across its platforms. According to Connor Hayes, Meta’s Vice President of Product for Generative AI, these profiles will function like real users, creating and sharing posts autonomously. This decision has brought criticisms, but Hayes says it’s all about making platforms more dynamic and engaging. By late 2024, over 600 million users were actively using Meta’s AI-driven features each month. Chatbots in Messenger and advanced character creation tools have already been a hit. These tools allow users to create AI personas that interact seamlessly with others. It’s a glimpse into Meta’s vision of blending human and AI interactions across its platforms. Meta’s financial and strategic focus on AI Generative AI tools have already transformed Meta’s advertising business. Since their launch, more than 15 million ads have been created using these tools, with companies leveraging AI to craft hyper-targeted campaigns. Analysts believe these tools could open new revenue streams, especially in customer service. WhatsApp, for instance, is testing enterprise chatbots powered by AI, which could evolve into a multi-trillion-dollar market. Investors are optimistic. Jefferies analysts recently raised Meta’s stock price target to $715 per share, citing confidence in its AI-driven growth strategy. Meta’s stock surged 70% in 2024, far outpacing the S&P 500’s 24% gain. This performance is tied directly to Meta’s ability to monetize its AI tools and keep users engaged. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg is doubling down on AI across the board. At a recent conference, he revealed plans to embed generative AI into experimental products like Ray-Ban smart glasses and the Orion augmented reality headset. Despite its successes, Meta’s AI strategy isn’t without risks. Regulatory hurdles in the European Union are slowing the deployment of its AI tools, with stricter rules around data usage and transparency. Critics also warn about the potential for misinformation and low-quality content flooding platforms. AI-generated posts, while innovative, could make it harder for users to separate fact from fiction.

The token’s momentum has waned, and more data shows that its volume and social dominance have pulled back, So, how will all these fundamentals affect the Pepe price? Is Pepe Coin Price At Risk As Volume And Social Dominance Falls? Third-party data shows that the daily volume of Pepe coin has been in a downward trend as its price lost momentum. Data by CoinGecko shows that the daily volume dropped to $1.4 billion on Tuesday, down from over $18 billion in November. This volume has crashed to its lowest level in over two months. More data by LunarCrash shows that, while the social dominance has risen recently, it remains significantly lower than its highest levels last year. That is a sign that fewer people are posting about Pepe coin. Pepe Volume is Falling In theory, a sharp decline in a cryptocurrency’s volume and social dominance should be a bearish thing since it is a sign that interest is falling. However, in reality, such a big drop could be a good thing as it is usually a sign of accumulation by smart money investors. Pepe Social Dominance Pepe Price Technical Analysis As Chart Sends Mixed Signals The daily chart sends mixed signals about Pepe price . On the positive side, the token has held steady above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. It has also formed a break and retest pattern by dropping to the key support at $0.00001751, which was the highest level in May 2024 and the upper side of the cup and handle pattern. Such a retest is often seen as a continuation sign in the market. On the negative side, Pepe coin price has slowly formed a rising wedge chart pattern since December 20. This pattern is comprised of two ascending converging trendlines. It often leads to a bearish breakdown when they near their confluence levels. From a distance, there is a possibility that the coin is forming a head and shoulders chart pattern. Its head is at $0.0000283, while the right shoulder is at $0.000025 and the neck is at $0.000017. Like the wedge, the H&S pattern is often seen as a bearish pattern. This bearish view is in line with this Pepe price outlook . Pepe Coin Price Pepe Token Price Targets Therefore, Pepe may move at either direction at this point. The most likely scenario is where the rising wedge works and the token drops to the support at $0.00001715. A complete bullish breakout will be confirmed if the token rises above the right shoulder at $0.000026. Such a move will invalidate the head and shoulders pattern and point to moe gains in the longer term.

38660342,194696,1736265627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/68/38660342.jpeg,Metis Launches DSEQ Reboot to Enhance DeFi Ecosystem with ENKI as Key Partner,https://chainwire.org/2025/01/07/metis-launches-dseq-reboot-to-enhance-defi-ecosystem-with-enki-as-key-partner/,"Toronto, Ontario, January 7th, 2025, Chainwire In an impactful move for its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, Metis has launched its Decentralized Sequencer (DSEQ) Reboot. The Metis DSEQ Reboot campaign aims to redefine its DeFi landscape through aligned incentives and sustainable rewards for users and projects, blending decentralization with practical, value-driven solutions. The first participant of this initiative is ENKI, one of Metis’s longstanding ecosystem contributors, set to drive the reboot’s early-stage success and set the standard for future participants. Transforming the DeFi Ecosystem The DSEQ Reboot is an effort to improve the value flow of DeFi on Metis significantly. Metis’s approach integrates Decentralized Sequencers with Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to create a value stream that benefits every layer of the ecosystem. This initiative addresses critical gaps in the DeFi space by offering: Performance-Driven Rewards: Recognizing measurable success respective of any project stage, from initial idea to market domination, tying rewards to outcomes. Enhanced Liquidity: Strengthening liquidity pools to reduce slippage and improve token stability. User-Centric Opportunities: Providing expanded earning opportunities through diversified reward structures. “The DSEQ Reboot is a pivotal moment for Metis,” said Metis CEO Tom Ngo. “We’re not just innovating within our ecosystem; we’re working to set a new standard for how decentralized infrastructure can drive real-world impact in DeFi.” Why Decentralized Sequencers Matter Decentralized sequencers form a critical component of layer 2 blockchain infrastructure, ensuring security, scalability, and reliability. However, their potential continues to be underutilized in the Ethereum ecosystem. Metis’s DSEQ Reboot attempts to revitalize the decentralization narrative espoused by the Ethereum community by introducing: Value Realignment: Incentives that tie user success to protocol and node performance. LST Integration: Leveraging Liquid Staking Tokens as essential bridges between sequencer operations, DeFi applications, and users. Promoting Sustainability: Developing reward mechanisms that balance short-term returns with long-term ecosystem health. By (re)integrating decentralized sequencer operations with LSTs, Metis will continue to push forward a fundamental shift in how value flows through DeFi ecosystems, making the infrastructure more robust, adaptable, and rewarding for all stakeholders. ENKI: A Trusted Partner in a New Chapter ENKI’s involvement in the DSEQ Reboot is not a new collaboration but a continuation of its significant contributions to the Metis ecosystem over the past year. As a Liquid Staking Token protocol, ENKI has been instrumental in stabilizing liquidity and providing seamless DeFi options for users. ENKI's presence within the Metis ecosystem has become undeniably impactful, a testament to its innovative approach. With $4.53 million in total value locked, a staggering 99,330 METIS tokens deposited on its platform, and a hefty 6,110.05 METIS earned in rewards, ENKI has shown a clear example of how beneficial an LST protocol can be to a DeFi ecosystem. In this reboot, ENKI’s role evolves to introduce a new value stream for the DSEQ community. By participating in the reboot, ENKI will: Expand Earning Opportunities: Offer users sustainable rewards through innovative token delegation and liquidity mechanisms. Enhance Token Utility: Strengthen trading and liquidity through incentivized pools. Lead by Example: Set benchmarks for future protocols participating in the reboot. ENKI’s integration into this new version of DSEQ demonstrates how established projects can adapt to evolving ecosystem needs, ensuring ongoing value creation for users and the network. https://x.com/MetisL2/status/1876633543595393456 What This Means for DeFi The DSEQ Reboot underscores a larger trend in DeFi: the need for infrastructure that goes beyond the technical capability to deliver tangible value for participants. By focusing on decentralized sequencer operations, Metis addresses critical challenges that deter fluid value flow among protocols, incentive misalignment between projects and users, and gaps in user engagement. This initiative represents a shift toward more cohesive, value-driven ecosystems for the broader industry. It’s a model that other networks may soon follow as the benefits of aligning infrastructure with community incentives become increasingly clear. Looking Ahead As the DSEQ Reboot progresses, Metis plans to onboard additional protocols that align with its vision for DeFi revitalization. Future milestones include: Expanding LST integrations to enhance capital efficiency. Developing new DeFi primitives built on decentralized sequencer rewards. Fostering cross-protocol collaboration to drive innovation. For users, this marks the beginning of a rewarding journey filled with opportunities to engage, earn, and contribute to a burgeoning ecosystem. With ENKI leading the way, the stage is set for transformative growth within the Metis network. Participation and Next Steps For those eager to participate, ENKI’s platform provides a gateway to staking, liquidity, and sustainable rewards. Users can visit enkixyz.com to explore their offerings and join the DSEQ Reboot movement. Metis continues to explore new ways to advance DeFi infrastructure through collaborative initiatives and decentralized technologies.

The DEX to CEX trading volume ratio is calculated by dividing monthly decentralized exchange volume by centralized exchange volume and representing it as a percentage. Data from The Block and DefiLlama showed the DEX to CEX ratio crossed the 20% mark this week. However, the figure was based on incomplete January data and could change before February. January’s DEX to CEX percentage is at its highest point since May 2023, when the ratio hit 14% amid a broader market recovery following the challenges of 2022. You might also like: CFTC chair Rostin Behnam to resign on Trump’s inauguration day Does the DEX to CEX % signal a crypto shift? The 20% milestone could signal a potential shift in trading behavior as 2025 progresses. Analysts suggest this may reflect growing interest in decentralized platforms. Launchpads that simplify launching tokens, like Pump.fun, have incentivized investor appetite for low-cap virtual assets. These assets typically trade first on DEXs after launch. Major centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide web2-style access to digital assets. However, they are slower to list new coins, often waiting weeks or months before adding them in limited batches. Decentralized platforms such as Uniswap continue to play a significant role in crypto trading.

Over 44.6 billion SHIB were burned in 2024, highlighting consistent efforts to reduce supply and enhance value. New Bull Run on the Horizon? Despite the severe fluctuations, Shiba Inu (SHIB) performed quite well last year, experiencing a price increase of over 100%. The popular meme coin started 2025 on the right foot, jumping by 12% in the past week. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko According to some important factors, the price may just be heating up for a much more substantial move to the upside. One of those is the upcoming launch of TREAT. The reward token, which will incentivize users to engage with Shiba Inu’s protocols, including the layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium, will officially go live on January 14 . This development is another example of the growth of SHIB’s ecosystem in the past few years. It could boost investor confidence, leading to more people jumping on the bandwagon and a subsequent price rally for the second-largest meme coin. The next bullish element is the amount of Shiba Inu stored on exchanges. CryptoQuant’s data shows that the figure has recently dropped to levels last observed in the spring of 2021. This suggests a shift from centralized platforms toward private wallets, meaning reduced immediate selling pressure. Lastly, we will focus on the “InTheMoney” indicator (which measures the change in the number of SHIB investors currently sitting on paper profits). According to IntoTheBlock, it has risen by 1.10% on a 24-hour scale, entering bullish territory. As of the moment of this writing, approximately 57% of all Shiba Inu holders are profitable, while 36% remain underwater. This is a serious improvement compared to the stats witnessed in September 2023. Back then, almost 90% of those who had distributed funds to the self-proclaimed Dogecoin-killer were sitting on unrealized losses. Bonus: The Burning Mechanism Another factor that could contribute to a potential SHIB rally is the meme coin’s burning program. To the uninitiated ones, the team behind the meme coin launched the mechanism in 2022, aiming to reduce the tremendous token supply and drive the price up via scarcity. The burn rate has increased by nearly 35% in the past week, resulting in 83.4 million SHIB sent to a null address. The USD equivalent of the stash remains insignificant, but continuous efforts in the field might benefit the bulls. As CryptoPotato reported , in 2024, over 44.6 billion SHIB (worth around $1 million) were sent to a null address.

Hayes explained his reasoning and wrote, “My prediction is that the market peaks in mid to late March, so this equates to a removal of $180 billion worth of liquidity due to QT from January to March.” The Liquidity Factor Hayes points to the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening (QT) policy, which involves reducing the size of its balance sheet by $60 billion per month. This tightening has resulted in the removal of significant liquidity from the financial markets. Hayes predicts that by mid-March 2025, this policy will have drained $180 billion from the market, contributing to the peak of the crypto market. The downturn in 2022, according to Hayes, was a result of similar liquidity issues. When U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issued shorter-dated coupon bonds in place of longer-dated ones, it drained more than $2 trillion from the Fed’s reverse repo facility (RRP). This reduced liquidity triggered declines in both crypto and stock markets, particularly affecting large U.S. tech stocks. Short-Term Bullish Signal for Bitcoin Despite the overall market correction expected in the second quarter of 2025, Hayes believes there’s a short-term bullish signal for Bitcoin. He explained that the U.S. Treasury would be spending down its general account (TGA) at the Federal Reserve, which would inject liquidity into the market, benefiting Bitcoin’s price in the short term. Hayes also predicts that the reverse repo facility (RRP) will see its balance drop from $1.237 trillion to zero by the end of Q1 2025, further boosting liquidity. This surge in liquidity will likely come from money market funds (MMFs) withdrawing funds from the RRP to purchase higher-yielding treasury bills. This could add up to $237 billion into the market during the first quarter of 2025, which Hayes believes will fuel a final crypto market rally. Potential Challenges Ahead However, Hayes also expects a bearish factor that could affect the market in April: tax deadlines. With April being a significant tax month in the U.S., Hayes warns that these deadlines could pose a challenge for the crypto market, potentially contributing to a sharp correction after the March peak.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-07 16:04:15

The incoming president, of course, has made clear his friendliness towards bitcoin and crypto. Also worth consideration is the Republican sweep of the Senate and House of Representatives, where laws that might affect crypto will ultimately be passed. Andre Dragosch, Head of Research at Bitwise in Europe, spoke exclusively with CoinDesk about other factors affecting the divergence between bitcoin and stocks. ""My view on bitcoin versus S&P 500 is that the stock market has been negatively affected by the Fed's hawkish rate cut in December,"" said Dragosch. ""The Fed revised its planned rate cuts for 2025 to 2 rate cuts only, less than previously telegraphed and also less than previously anticipated by traditional financial markets"". At the same time, the DXY index, which measures the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of the major currencies, is up 5%, putting further pressure on risk assets. That might typically include a hurt on bitcoin, but Dragosch explains that it held up relatively well thanks to other factors, the ongoing bitcoin supply deficit on exchanges being among them. ""Bitcoin exchange balances have continued to drift lower despite profit-taking,"" he continued. Of late though, bitcoin and the S&P 500 have again begun moving closely together, their correlation hitting 0.88 (with 0 being no correlation and 1 begin absolute correlation) over the most recent 20-day moving average. ""While on-chain factors will likely provide a significant tailwind at least until mid-2025, the deterioration in the macro picture could pose short-term risks for bitcoin as well, especially on account of the still relatively high correlation with the S&P 500,"" Dragosch concluded.",Markets|Bitcoin|S&P 500,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 16:08:07

JasmyCoin ( JASMY ) fell to an intraday low of $0.035, marking an 11.45% decline from Monday’s high The crash coincided with declines across the broader crypto market. Bitcoin ( BTC ) slipped below $100,000, while previously hot tokens and meme coins cooled down. Jasmy, often referred to as Bitcoin’s Bitcoin, tumbled as futures market momentum faded. Its open interest in futures rose to over $66 million on Monday before retreating to $61.45 million on Tuesday. Open interest has remained within a narrow range in recent days.

This suggests a drop in demand for the cryptocurrency. Jasmy price forms a risky pattern Jasmy chart | Source: crypto.news JasmyCoin’s recent price action shows a risky double-top pattern at $0.041. The double-top pattern forms when an asset hits twin peaks with a neckline, which in this case is at $0.031. It is often seen as a sign of a potential reversal. JasmyCoin has fallen below both the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and the 50-period moving average. It is also trading near the bottom of the Murrey Math Lines range. There is a risk the token could drop to $0.028, the key support level last seen on December 20. This scenario would be confirmed if JasmyCoin breaks below the ascending trendline linking the lows of Dec. 20 and Jan.1. The bearish view would be invalidated if JasmyCoin rises above $0.041. A breakout above that level could open the door to more gains, with a possible target at the 23.6% retracement level of $0.050, representing a 38% upside from current levels.

The funds intend to bolster their Bitcoin reserves and offset increasing operational costs amidst shrinking profit margins. With energy prices continuing to climb, Bitcoin miners are facing mounting financial pressure, prompting them to accumulate reserves as a financial buffer to navigate the challenges of a competitive industry. Rising Energy Costs and Hash Rates Put Pressure on Bitcoin Miners’ Profits Bitcoin miners have increasingly used alternative financing methods as they face shrinking profitability due to rising energy costs and a higher network hash rate. The 2024 Bitcoin Halving event , which reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, has further complicated the situation. This has heightened the urgency for miners to manage rising costs effectively. Bitcoin miners stockpile coins to ride out profit squeeze https://t.co/BHL6j1HcVn — FT Technology News (@fttechnews) January 7, 2025 The report highlighted that the average cost of production for US-listed Bitcoin miners surged by 13% in the third quarter of 2024, reaching $55,950 per Bitcoin. When factoring in depreciation and stock-based compensation, this figure jumps to $106,000. Bitcoin’s price increase, which reached approximately $98,500 as of writing, has temporarily improved mining profitability. However, the growing computational power required to secure the Bitcoin network, as reflected in record-high hash rates, continues to challenge miners. This increased competition could offset the benefits of Bitcoin’s rising market value. Competing Energy Demands: AI and Bitcoin Mining The competition for energy resources in the US is not limited to Bitcoin mining. Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are also rapidly expanding their energy consumption. With access to substantial financial resources, AI companies pose a major challenge to Bitcoin miners. Russell Cann, Core Scientific’s chief development officer, noted that AI’s growing demand for energy will make it harder for Bitcoin miners to expand operations in the US. From an economic perspective, energy grids may prioritize powering AI data centers over Bitcoin mining facilities. As a result, many miners are exploring opportunities abroad. Mara Holdings, for example, plans to move half of its mining operations overseas by 2028, focusing on regions with surplus energy supplies, such as Kenya and the UAE. However, challenges remain. In Paraguay, crypto miners have encountered high energy costs despite the country’s energy surplus, complicating plans for expansion. You might also like Paraguayan Bitcoin Miners: New Energy Tariffs Will Kill Our Industry Global Opportunities for Bitcoin Miners To stay competitive, some miners are diversifying their operations. Companies like Hut 8 , Core Scientific, and Hive have begun offering their data centers to AI companies, tapping into the growing demand for computational power.

Per the announcement, the focus of this proposal is on operational sustainability and environmental commitments. The halving of Celo’s inflation rate would „fundamentally reshape the network’s economic landscape.“ Nicknamed the “Great Celo Halvening” would reduce the inflation rate from the current 2% to some 1%, slowing down the creation of new tokens and the selling pressure that comes from that inflation. The Great Celo Halvening has a good ring to it. wdyt? https://t.co/hibWcHsDf0 — Marek | Celo ℓ2 (@marek_) December 16, 2024 Speaking of the transaction fee restructuring, a new split has been proposed: 90% for network operations and 10% for carbon offset. This is a change from 80% burn and 20% carbon offset. The 90% would fund data availability, Layer 1 fees, sequencer and batcher operations, and revenue sharing with OP-Stack Superchain ecosystem. Additionally, the proposal noted, the L2 transition needs a new tokenomics model as it changes many network’s operational and security responsibilities. This new tokenomics model must account for reduced validator security role, operational sustainability, inflation management, and environmental leadership.

This update comes just days after Privasea raised $15 million in total following its recent Series A funding with participation from GSR and Amber. With its testnet beta launch on January 6th, DeepSea redefines how we approach data privacy in AI applications. But what does this mean for the internet of the near future? How does this apply to humans in their everyday lives? Let’s take a look at how DeepSea changes data privacy and security online. What is DeepSea? DeepSea is an evolution in secure computing and digital privacy. It allows AI systems to perform deep learning inference on encrypted data. Here’s how it works: FHE at Its Core: DeepSea uses Fully Homomorphic Encryption , allowing computations on data while it remains encrypted. This means your data can be analyzed or processed without ever being exposed in its raw form. User Empowerment: With DeepSea, users can engage with AI tech without sacrificing privacy. Whether it’s for healthcare, finance, or personal use, DeepSea ensures your data is safe from the moment it enters the system until it leaves. The Need for DeepSea Today, dAta privacy is no longer a luxury. Every day, cybercriminals target businesses, especially startups, where the focus on growth often overshadows security of their user database. People are products and your data is their new currency. Statistics reveal that 43% of data leaks occur in small businesses, making them prime targets. These breaches erode trust between organizations and people. DeepSea arrives at a time when privacy laws like GDPR are tightening, and the cost of non-compliance is soaring. With DeepSea, Privasea tackles these challenges head-on by ensuring that data privacy does not compromise the pace of innovation or functionality, particularly in AI and deep learning. Key Features of DeepSea’s Launch Dashboard Release : A new user interface where you can manage and monitor your privacy settings and data usage in real-time. Node Programs : The beta release includes the Workheart Node for physical proof-of-work and the Privanetix Node for high-performance computing tasks. Owners of Workheart Nodes will receive exclusive airdrops, empowering them to be at the forefront of this privacy revolution. Real-World Applications of DeepSea Identity Verification: The digital age has brought scams and bot accounts to new heights. Privasea’s ImHuman App , compatible with DeepSea, provides a solution. It verifies your humanity without compromising your identity. Instead of sharing sensitive details, you get a unique NFT as your proof of identity, secure from phishing or misuse. Healthcare: Imagine a world where your medical records are used to improve AI diagnostics without ever risking your personal health information. DeepSea makes this possible, preventing scenarios like the Ascension data breach that exposed 5.6 million patients. Now, every diagnosis, scan, or record can be processed securely. Small Businesses: For startups, DeepSea means scaling without the fear of becoming the next cybercrime statistic. By integrating AI for growth while maintaining compliance with privacy laws, businesses can focus on what they do best – innovate. To take this initiative even further, Privasea has also joined the Volvo CampX incubator in 2024 to allow for building more applications based on FHE and ML models. The DeepSea Advantage Privacy Without Compromise: DeepSea AI at your fingertips without its privacy pitfalls. No more choosing between innovation and security; it’s about having both available and accessible to you. Compliance Ready: As regulations evolve, DeepSea ensures organizations are ahead of the curve, turning potential liabilities into competitive advantages. User Trust: By safeguarding personal data, DeepSea fosters a new level of trust between users and technology providers, which is crucial in an era where trust is easily lost. Launch Details DeepSea’s testnet beta is available now , offering early adopters a chance to experience this new wave of privacy-focused computing. Privasea invites developers, businesses, and privacy advocates to join this journey, test our systems, and help shape a secure digital future. Privasea’s commitment goes beyond this launch alone. With plans for the Genesis release on January 27th and the full mainnet in Q1 2025, the team is building a movement towards a world where privacy is as integral as technology itself. About Privasea Founded with the vision of integrating privacy into the fabric of AI, Privasea has been backed by industry leaders like Binance Labs and OKX Ventures, positioning it as a pioneer in privacy computing. With DeepSea, Privasea isn’t just launching a network; it’s launching a safer, more private digital world for everyone.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-07 16:14:52

Warned About Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/second-major-resignation-after-sec-chairman-cftc-chairman-also-announces-he-will-resign-warned-about-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies/,"While US President-elect Donald Trump is expected to take office on January 20, the second major resignation has come after SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Speaking to the Financial Times, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Behnam said he will resign on January 20, the day Donald Trump is sworn in as president. Although Behnam did not provide a specific reason for his resignation, his resignation statement increased speculation about a possible change under the Trump administration. Trump is expected to appoint Republican CFTC commissioners Summer Mersinger or Caroline Pham as interim chair to replace Behnam. He Talked About Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies! CFTC Chairman Behnam made important statements regarding Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies while announcing his resignation to the FT. Behnam expressed concern about regulatory gaps in the U.S. crypto market, saying cryptocurrencies need to be more tightly regulated. Behnam, who expressed concern about the inadequacy of regulation of digital assets, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, said, “There is still a large part of the cryptocurrency space that is unregulated in the U.S. regulatory system, and given the huge demand for these products by both retail and institutional investors, the adoption of some traditional financial institutions poses a great risk and urgently needs to be filled.” During his tenure, Behnam made several critical moves, most notably spearheading a $4.3 billion settlement against Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and emphasizing the CFTC’s role in regulating digital commodities. While the replacement for CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam has not yet been announced, Trump has appointed crypto advocate Paul Atkins as the new SEC chairman, replacing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. *This is not investment advice.

The upcoming token burn is expected to create a further rush in $SLAP’s price – which is already up by 45.8% in the last seven days. This new cat meme coin is also giving stiff competition to established names such as Mog Coin (MOG) and Popcat (POPCAT) – which are up 27.8% and 9.9%, respectively, during the same duration. Excitement is reaching new heights as Catslap’s click-and-slap game takes the spotlight. Players are competing fiercely in the first season of the airdrop, where top performers will be rewarded with exclusive prizes. With just three days remaining until the season concludes, the anticipation is building as participants race to secure their spot among the winners. https://twitter.com/CatSlapToken/status/187635 4 113132204511 Meme Coins Like Catslap Can Benefit from the Crypto Boom Following much sideways momentum throughout 2022 and 2023 – the meme coin markets have shown a strong reversal following Bitcoin’s ascend to its all-time high (ATH) of $108K. One of the top growing markets in the digital asset space in 2024 has been meme coins – increasing from a $20 billion market cap to more than $120 billion throughout the year. Following the 500% surge, large-cap meme tokens such as Dogecoin took center stage – jumping by 385% in 2024. However, multiple new meme coins such as Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) have also collected enormous funds through their presale rounds. This opens the stage for brand new players such as Catslap – which aims to attract the attention of investors through its Slap-to-Earn ecosystem. After buying $SLAP tokens, token holders can compete in an addictive and hilarious slapping game – and rack up points on the ‘Slapometer’ leaderboard. The more you slap, the more rewards you can grab on this engaging ecosystem. Catslap Eyes a Massive 219% Price Surge Following the news about the $1 million burn event – $SLAP has jumped by more than 45% in a week – with a live price of $0.003157 per token. The token has a market cap of $25 milion, and a healthy 24-hour trading volume of $648,000. The $SLAP token boasts robust liquidity at $4.2 million, accounting for nearly a sixth of its market capitalization. With 54% of the liquidity set to be locked for six months, the team boasts a strong commitment to the project’s stability and long-term growth. Due to the favorable market conditions and recent price explosion – many predict a jump back to the all-time high (ATH) levels of $0.01007 – which would mark a 219% price increase from the current levels. This can also be achieved due to Catlsap’s stellar burn and buyback programs. According to the burn program , $SLAP tokens will be burned as the Slapometer count increases. So far, 466 million tokens out of the total 9 billion supply have been burned – valuing the burn program at $1.58 million. There is also a buyback program set in place, which takes place every 20 minutes. 300 million tokens have been purchased through this initiative – valued at over $1 million. Buyback and token burn programs typically enhance liquidity by driving higher secondary market demand. These initiatives help reduce price volatility and create an environment that attracts long-term growth-focused investors.

Cardano (ADA) also broke the $1 threshold to continue on the road to higher gains this January. However, according to data by Coinbase exchange, major flow from DOGE to ADA is witnessed due to its upcoming ground-breaking developments. Furthermore, as capital rotates from Dogecoin (DOGE) after bullish gains, another altcoin leads the investment funnel due to its competing performance and utility against Cardano (ADA). This makes this $0.14 altcoin the next moonshot crypto to acquire before its upcoming Coinbase listing after Trump takes office. Dogecoin (DOGE) Rally Capped at $0.38 After 20% Weekly Pump Dogecoin price has surged more than 20% in the past week due to Elon Musk actively promoting the meme culture and New Year hype. Over $413 million of DOGE tokens have been accumulated since the start of January, indicating bullish momentum for Dogecoin, as this month is considered one of the best 30 days for the DOGE price trend. Source: CoinMarketCap However, technical data shows strong resistance for Dogecoin at the $0.38 price level, and the dropping trading volume suggests weakened bullish pressure due to profit-booking. This trend has caused the DOGE to slow down below a strong price ceiling and is expected to consolidate to immediate support levels before the January 10 court order for Donald Trump. Cardano (ADA) Attracts Utility Investors Amid New Developments Cardano (ADA) is emerging as a major alternative for Dogecoin as profit makers start rotating capital amid ongoing developments. The expansion of the Lace wallet and Charles Hoskinson’s plans for Bitcoin integration in 2025 make the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem the center of attention for global traders under a crypto-friendly Congress. Experts believe Cardano (ADA) will react bullishly after Trump officially takes office on January 20, reclaiming the 2021 highs with a historic comeback. Cardano (ADA) has already gained over 23% in the last 7 days, and it sees the $1.39 price level as the next bullish target amid increasing market optimism and trading volume.

It’s basically a bet that prices will go higher. Why all this optimism? As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in the coming days, speculation is swirling that his administration might usher in a more crypto-friendly era. So, what does all this mean for Bitcoin’s future? Let’s dive deeper into the data, dissect the market sentiment, and explore what experts believe could unfold in the days and weeks to come. What Trump’s inauguration could mean for crypto As Trump prepares to be sworn in on Jan. 20, it’s shaping up to be a key moment for the digital asset industry, setting the stage for changes in how crypto is governed in the U.S. One of the immediate shake-ups will come from the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a polarizing figure in the crypto community known for his tough stance on digital assets. SEC’s current approach under SAB 121 requires publicly traded banks to record crypto holdings as liabilities, making large-scale crypto custody a financially unattractive endeavour. While Congress voted to scrap SAB 121 last year, the effort was vetoed by President Biden. Gensler’s departure could lead to a dramatic policy shift, as he is set to be replaced by former SEC Commissioner and crypto-friendly Paul Atkins. Meanwhile, Congressman French Hill has indicated that Republican leadership plans to prioritize a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto. This effort builds on the FIT 21 bill passed by the House in 2024, which aimed to end the tug-of-war between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over who gets to regulate crypto. While FIT 21 was hailed as a landmark moment, it didn’t come without controversy. Some industry insiders felt the bill was rushed and overly restrictive, particularly in its treatment of decentralized finance. Republican leaders have hinted that they may scrap FIT 21 and start fresh, with a focus on innovation while addressing concerns raised by the DeFi community. But beyond the immediate policy shifts, Trump’s inauguration could signal a key shift in tone. His campaign rhetoric positioned him as a “crypto president,” and the industry is eager to see if he’ll follow through on promises like establishing a U.S. Bitcoin reserve or creating a federal crypto council. Of course, none of this happens in isolation. The macroeconomic backdrop — interest rates, inflation data, and overall market sentiment — will play a critical role in shaping how crypto performs in the months ahead. Macroeconomic winds: what this means for Bitcoin This week, a string of crucial macroeconomic indicators will paint a picture of the U.S. economy’s health, and for the crypto industry, the implications are worth dissecting. The action kicks off with the Jan. 8 ADP National Employment Report, which will show how many new jobs the private sector added in December. Analysts are projecting 130,000 jobs — a slight dip from November’s 146,000. Jan. 9 brings another piece of the puzzle with the weekly jobless claims report. It recently hit an eight-month low, signalling that employers are holding onto workers despite the economic slowdown. If claims remain low, it might strengthen market sentiment, encouraging investors to take on more risk — which could benefit Bitcoin. On Jan. 10, all eyes will turn to the US Consumer Sentiment Index. This metric reflects how optimistic people feel about the economy and their willingness to spend. If the index comes in strong, it could spur risk-taking among investors, giving Bitcoin a potential boost. But there’s another twist: consumer sentiment often hints at inflation expectations. If people expect inflation to rise, Bitcoin might see renewed interest as a hedge against eroding purchasing power. However, the flip side is that inflation concerns might also embolden the Fed to raise rates, which could keep crypto gains in check. The week wraps up with the U.S. employment report and unemployment rate. Analysts expect 155,000 new jobs — down from November’s 227,000 — while unemployment is predicted to hold steady at 4.2%. Strong employment data usually lifts market confidence and increases interest in riskier assets like Bitcoin. On the other hand, weaker data might introduce caution, pulling investors toward safer bets. Eventually, the Federal Reserve’s position will become clearer later this month when the Federal Open Market Committee releases its meeting minutes. These will provide clues about the Fed’s thinking on rate cuts — or lack thereof — in 2025. Currently, markets are closely watching the upcoming FOMC meeting on Jan. 29. As of now, there is only a 9.1% chance the Fed will cut rates by another 25 basis points. For context, the Fed already cut rates by 25 bps in December and 50 bps in September. These rate cuts injected liquidity into the market, fueling Bitcoin’s rally by increasing the flow of money into riskier assets. However, during the December meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a hawkish tone, signaling that future rate cuts would be heavily dependent on upcoming economic data. With over a 90% likelihood that the Fed will keep rates unchanged later this month, the stance appears neutral for now. But any macroeconomic shock in the coming days — whether in the form of surprising inflation numbers or unexpected labor market data — could quickly alter the Fed’s trajectory, potentially impacting Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Crypto industry’s rising hopes The crypto market has always thrived on narratives, and the Trump administration’s incoming policies are shaping up to be a compelling one. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, recently tweeted about this shift, noting how the “Trump effect” has revitalized confidence within the U.S. crypto sector. 2025 is here and the Trump bull market is real. For Ripple, this is even more personal after Gensler's SEC effectively froze our business opportunities here at home for years. The optimism is obvious and very deserved. Today: ✅75% of Ripple’s open roles are now US-based, while… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 5, 2025 Ripple, which spent years resolving regulatory challenges under Gary Gensler’s SEC, has already experienced a sea change. Garlinghouse shared that 75% of Ripple’s open roles are now U.S.-based, a dramatic reversal from recent years when most hires were abroad. Even more striking, Ripple signed more U.S. deals in the six weeks following Trump’s election than in the previous six months — a telltale sign to the palpable optimism coursing through the industry. Meanwhile, Trump’s picks for key roles, including Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary and David Sacks heading the newly launched AI and Crypto Division, signal a pro-innovation stance that could fast-track growth. On a broader economic front, Hunter Horsley’s hypothesis adds more intrigue. He suggests that the Trump administration might unfreeze mergers and acquisitions, enabling large corporations to consolidate power further. Trump administration may unfreeze M&A. Large corporates — mag 7, etc — may finally be able to wield their market cap. Amazon could buy Instacart. Google could buy Uber. etc etc The big may get bigger, and the middle may shrink. If that happens, I think it will accelerate… — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) January 5, 2025 If tech giants like Amazon or Google start snapping up competitors, the narrative of mistrust toward centralized entities could grow even stronger. Crypto, which thrives on offering an alternative to traditional institutions, could find itself uniquely positioned to benefit from this consolidation wave, Horsley suggested. As the “big get bigger,” the decentralized promise of blockchain might resonate even more with individuals and businesses seeking independence from institutional overreach. Yet, optimism should be tempered with pragmatism. While the Trump administration’s early signals are pro-crypto, it’s critical to recognize that policy shifts take time. Nonetheless, the fact that these conversations are happening at the highest levels of government, coupled with the market’s renewed energy, is a strong signal that 2025 could mark a turning point for crypto. Where could Bitcoin go next? Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe, pointed to the Rainbow Chart in his recent tweet, a long-term indicator that categorizes Bitcoin’s price into various zones, ranging from “Fire Sale” to “Maximum Bubble Territory.” The Rainbow chart for #Bitcoin is a beautiful indicator. It tells that the previous cycle hasn't gone into the type of euphoria that we generally witness in a Bitcoin cycle. Due to that cycle, the expectations of this cycle have substantially lowered as PTSD kicks in.… pic.twitter.com/3meyQCLrca — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 5, 2025 Van de Poppe explains, “Anything beneath $110K is classified as ‘Accumulation,’ while the range between $110-150K is considered ‘Still Cheap.’” At present levels, Bitcoin remains in what he would call a buy zone — a signal that the market hasn’t yet reached the kind of euphoria typically seen in previous cycles. He attributes this to a kind of market PTSD, where scars from prior crashes have tempered bullish sentiment. However, he argues that this pessimism may be misplaced, noting, “People literally don’t expect how high and extreme this cycle is going to be. I think it will be substantially comparable to the 2014–2017 cycle.” According to the Rainbow Chart, reaching even the lower bounds of “red zones” — areas historically associated with market peaks—would require Bitcoin to surpass $250K, with some stages hitting $375K or higher as time progresses. But while van de Poppe paints an optimistic long-term picture, Benjamin Cowen zooms in on the short-term trajectory. Cowen notes that if Bitcoin revisits its short-term trendline, it could reach $120,000 by Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. If #BTC can tag this short-term trend line again, it would correspond to $120k by the inauguration (Jan 20th) pic.twitter.com/vjKQzXd57m — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) January 6, 2025 Cowen’s analysis aligns with the current market sentiment, where traders are eyeing key psychological levels like $120,000 as potential stepping stones for further gains. However, the Federal Reserve’s Jan. 29 meeting looms large, with over a 90% chance that rates will remain unchanged. While this neutrality might initially seem neutral, any unexpected macroeconomic shock — whether in employment data, inflation figures, or global markets — could lead to sharp corrections. For investors, staying informed, diversifying, and keeping a close eye on macroeconomic signals will be essential as this exciting cycle unfolds.

This move is seen as Ripple's push to enhance XRP Ledger’s utility and broaden its adoption. Despite these technological strides, XRP price movement has been deliberate, leaving investors debating its near-term potential. Ripple’s ongoing legal challenges with the SEC continue to cast a shadow, though many insiders believe a favorable resolution could ignite stronger price action. For now, Ripple XRP price has seen modest increases, hovering around critical levels, reflecting a cautious sentiment among traders.

Whether to wait for Ripple’s legal clarity or seek alternatives promising quicker returns remains the key question as the market closely watches XRP’s next steps.

As crypto ownership grows, remittance gateways may lose their positions. Remittance app downloads have slowed down in 2024 after several years of peak activity. They expanded in the past five years, but the latest trends show a reversal of usage. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, believes the shift may benefit stablecoin usage . Acquiring stablecoins is possible through decentralized trading and, in some cases, may not require an initial bank account. Stablecoin transfers are much faster and have virtually negligible fees and no commissions. The trend of using stablecoins for cross-border purposes has been noticed in the past few years but accelerated during the bull market of 2024. Most of the stablecoin activity is driven by retail remittances, with a smaller share of wholesale cross-border transfers. Interest in crypto-based remittances may increase in the coming months, as the election of Donald Trump has brought back talks of a remittance tax. Stablecoins are still traceable, but the exact destination and spending may remain difficult to trace. In the past, projects like Ripple aimed for a share of the remittance market. This time, Ripple hosts RLUSD, a newly minted stablecoin with minimal transaction costs. Solana has also led to an increase in USDC usage. The balance of stablecoins may shift as the Euro Area decreases reliance on USDT and focuses on compliant coins and tokens like USDC. Remittance market expands, but stablecoins catch up The remittances market is expected to expand by 3.93% in 2025, retaining a similar pace to its 2024 growth. On the other hand, stablecoins doubled their supply and increased their activity much more dramatically in the past year, both on centralized and decentralized exchanges. The biggest remittance flows are targeting India, Mexico, China, and the Philippines, which are also some of the most crypto-friendly regions. The availability of stablecoins on multiple chains has avoided the high gas fees on Ethereum, allowing for a viable alternative to the commissions of remittance apps. In 2024, estimated remittances to the most common destination countries reached $685B. India received $129.1B, becoming the leader in the category. Stablecoins have the capacity to take a share of the remittance market Stablecoins easily surpass those amounts, showing a capacity to carry a significant part of the remittances market. According to VISA’s statistics dashboard, stablecoins carried $28.7T in total transfers, including all automated trades. While it is difficult to estimate which transactions were actual remittances, the overall volumes show the ceiling is high, and stablecoins can absorb a big part of the remittance market. For the past 12 months, the stablecoin market has seen an increased usage of TRON-based and BSC-based USDT, which allows for negligibly low fees. The remittance market meets competition from the growing community of crypto owners, reaching 560M in the past year. In 2024, the number of owners expanded by around 6.8% , spreading to multiple regions where remittances are widely used. Crypto adoption increased with the growing supply of stablecoins, which were used as an intuitive payment tool. | Source: Triple-A The stablecoin market was one factor in expanding crypto adoption, as users flocked to USDT, USDC, and other assets for multiple purposes. Stablecoin supply grows to new peak The supply of stablecoins continued to expand in 2025, reaching 200.7B as of January 7. The prediction for the coming year is to double the supply, increasing their influence over the market. Based on VISA insights, more than 65% of stablecoin activities are not related to DEX or centralized markets, instead used for other untracked payments. Many of those payments may replace remittances sent through fintech apps. The exact effect of stablecoins may be hard to predict, and fintech-based remittances are expected to grow. Stablecoins may still require exchanging into a currency unless there is widespread adoption of direct USDT or USDC usage.

The token has since retraced below $5, marking an 8.58% decline from its all-time high. This pullback has sparked speculation about SUI’s future trajectory. Analysts now question whether the token will reclaim bullish momentum to break $6 or remain stuck in a bearish trend. Is Sui Price Heading for a Bullish Surge or Bearish Plunge? The crypto analyst highlights that Sui price token firmly maintains its position within an ascending channel on the daily chart. This trend showcases a promising bullish trajectory, gaining attention among market watchers. The analysis suggests a potential pullback to the $4.2385 support level, providing traders with a significant opportunity for bullish continuation. Such a scenario may bolster confidence in the token’s upward movement, encouraging additional buying activity. Looking ahead, the upward momentum points to notable price targets at $5.81, $6.81, and potentially higher levels. These targets align with the strengthening trend and ongoing positive sentiment surrounding the asset. Tweet SUI Technical Analysis The layer one soared to a new all-time high of $5.35 on January 6, marking a 20% weekly surge. The token, however, quickly retraced to $4.90, sparking debate over its future price movement. Meanwhile, Bitcoin experienced a market correction, dropping below $98,000 after briefly surpassing $102,000, leading to significant liquidations. Investors are now closely monitoring SUI’s trajectory amidst shifting market conditions and the broader impact of Bitcoin’s correction on altcoin performance. At the time of the report, the SUI price is trading at $4.9115, reflecting a slight increase of 0.38%. The current price action places it within a critical range, bordered by the $4.8656 support and the $6.00 resistance levels. This range indicates a consolidation phase, suggesting traders await a decisive breakout. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 45, trending downward from the overbought. This decline signals weakened bullish momentum, hinting at potential sideways or bearish price movement unless a reversal occurs. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) shows diminishing positive momentum with red bars emerging. Sui Price Chart: TradingView Sui price is at a pivotal stage, poised between bullish breakout potential and bearish continuation.

According to a survey conducted by local news agency News1, South Korean investors said they mostly prefer Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP. While XRP overtook the largest altcoin Ethereum in investor interest, Bitcoin maintained its top spot as the most preferred cryptocurrency in the country. The survey in South Korea continued for two days from December 24 to 26. 5,200 people participated in the survey. They asked the participants which cryptocurrency they preferred most when investing. As a result of the voting, Bitcoin came in first place. Ripple came in second and Ethereum (ETH) came in third. Dogecoin (DOGE) came in fourth place, followed by Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in fifth place. Experts who evaluated the survey results said that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was responsible for Bitcoin's first place. Because with the ETF approval, Bitcoin has become a highly preferred asset among institutional investors. The striking point in the survey results was that XRP was preferred over Ethereum. With these results, XRP once again proved that it is the favorite cryptocurrency of South Korean investors. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Striking Cryptocurrency Survey!

Despite climbing by almost 8% over the past week, BTC is yet to reclaim its recently established all-time high above $108,000. However, Bitcoin’s divergence from equities suggests a reduced correlation, raising hopes for a bullish 2025 and new all-time highs. Weakening Bitcoin-Equity Correlation There has been a notable shift in the correlation between cryptocurrency and equities, particularly Bitcoin and the S&P 500. Since Donald Trump was elected as the 47th US President in November 2024, the two markets have been closely tied. However, data from Santiment demonstrated Bitcoin gaining momentum, surging by over 3% in a single day compared to the S&P 500’s modest 0.4% rise. This divergence is significant, as it suggests Bitcoin might be decoupling from its perceived role as a “high-leveraged tech stock,” a reputation it has held for much of the past three years. Historically, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have achieved their strongest bull runs during periods of low correlation with traditional equity markets. Experts also suggest that Bitcoin is ripe for the next leg up, with a crucial milestone being $140,000 in the coming months. Crypto Market in Later Stages of Bull Cycle? This decoupling coincides with broader market indicators suggesting that the cryptocurrency market has entered the later stages of its current bull cycle, which began in January 2023. As noted by CryptoQuant data , Bitcoin has seen significant growth in both price and duration, supported by a substantial influx of new and existing investments. The percentage of Bitcoin traded for less than a month, measured by realized market cap (UTXO), has reached 36%. While this is lower than past cycle peaks, the long-term trend remains downward, indicating the market may peak by the first or the second quarter of 2025. In fact, analysts predict a sharp rise in this ratio 2-4 times before the market overheats, likely triggering the next bear cycle.

With its innovative features and a promising presale, Remittix could offer investors a chance at a 100x return, making it a must-explore opportunity for those seeking the next big crypto in the market. Be Part of the Biggest PayFi Revolution With Remittix While XRP's recent surge has captured significant attention in the crypto market, early SOL investors speculate that the emerging Remittix could soon surpass it. Despite its status as a newcomer in the DeFi industry, Remittix is proving itself to be one of the best utility and profit-oriented platforms due to its innovative PayFi solution. Designed on advanced and user-friendly blockchain technology, Remittix enhances traditional banking by enabling fast and transparent crypto-fiat transactions in the $190 trillion cross-border payments market. With its PayFi feature, Remittix lets its users convert over 50 cryptocurrencies into fiat and deposit funds into any global bank account. These conversion transactions are tamper-proof, with payment records securely stored on the blockchain. Apart from being incredibly efficient, these transactions are also easy to conduct. Users are also not burdened by huge and unnecessary fees. Remittix's native token , $RTX, powers these transactions and every other PayFi-based activity on the platform making it an important addition to any smart investors portfolio. Can Recent Pump.fun Push SOL to New Price Highs? The official Solana price jumped by over 14% this past week to trade above the $200 price mark. This price surge is attributed to Pump.fun transferring $55 million worth of SOL to the Kraken exchange. Pump.fun took this action on January 1, 2025, via two major transfers. According to Solscan data, the first transfer was worth $22.8 million. A little over an hour later, the second transfer worth $32.7 million was made. However, this isn't the first time Pump.fun's actions have contributed to SOL's surge. Last year, Pump.fun sent over $303 million in SOL to Kraken and sold more than $41 million. SOL analysts are predicting that if Pump.fun can manage to continue making these transfers throughout 2025, the official Solana price could hit $400 in no time. XRP Earns Spot in Top Three Crypto Ranking Once Again XRP experienced an impressive 13% increase over the past week, surpassing Tether's USDT stablecoin to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. This isn't the first time XRP has surpassed USDT in market charts; the previous occurrence was on December 1, which was influenced by Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election on November 5.

Following last year’s addition of Bitcoin rewards to the AVA Smart Program – Travala’s travel loyalty initiative in collaboration with the AVA Foundation – the Web 3.0 travel company is further integrating Bitcoin into its platform as part of its ongoing efforts to support real-world crypto adoption. The campaign offers three incentives in the month of January – two main prizes totaling $20,000 in Bitcoin for booking travel and referring new users, as well as $50 in Bitcoin for new users who complete a booking. Juan Otero, CEO of Travala, said, “Travel is about exploration and embracing new horizons, just like Bitcoin is for finance. “By rewarding our customers with Bitcoin incentives and encouraging crypto transactions for real-world services, we’re empowering them to journey further while participating in the financial revolution of our time.” The Bitcoin incentive is offered on top of regular loyalty rewards members receive under the AVA Smart Program, which provides up to 13% savings in the form of Bitcoin or AVA booking rewards, product discounts and payment discounts with specific tokens. Last month, the company announced that it surpassed over $100 million in gross yearly revenue in 2024 and unveiled its Treasury Reserve Plan comprising both Bitcoin and AVA to “enhance potential liquidity, support future expansion and reaffirm its commitment to driving blockchain innovation and adoption within the travel industry.” Since the company’s inception in 2017, Travala has been working towards bridging the gap between blockchain and travel. Recent integrations with travel marketplace giants Skyscanner and KAYAK have presented another avenue for increasing awareness of crypto travel among mainstream travelers and bolstering crypto adoption, with over 100 billion daily searches conducted across these two marketplaces alone.

This marks a significant shift for the platform, which previously limited user data sharing to cases linked to terrorism. According to Telegram’s latest Transparency Report and reporting from 404media, the app fulfilled 900 U.S. government requests, affecting 2,253 users in 2024. The majority of these requests occurred between October and December, following a policy update in September. This change expanded Telegram’s cooperation with law enforcement to include cases related to cybercrime, illegal goods sales, and online fraud. Before September, the app had only fulfilled 14 requests, affecting 108 users.

Shortly after, the platform clarified that it would provide phone numbers and IP addresses in response to valid legal orders beyond terrorism-related cases. Telegram has faced criticism for its dual role as a tool for free expression and a hub for illicit activity. Criminal networks reportedly use the app to trade hacked data, launder stolen cryptocurrency, and sell illegal goods. A United Nations report highlighted that unlicensed crypto exchanges advertise money laundering services on Telegram, with some claiming to move millions of dollars in stolen funds daily. This policy change raises questions about the balance between user privacy and law enforcement needs. While Telegram remains a vital tool for secure communication, its evolving stance on data sharing reflects increasing pressure on tech companies to address criminal misuse of their platforms.

The predictions came after Bitcoin crossed several new all-time highs in the last quarter of the past year. Bitcoin achieved an over 150% price boost compared to the beginning of 2024 and attained an all-time high of $108,268 on December 17 before correcting below $100,000. The coin, which is currently at a little over $99,920 at the time of writing, still has an over 125% year-on-year price increase. One prediction from a recent Galaxy Digital research report suggested that BTC would reach over $185,000 by Q4 2025. The prediction was similar to that of the asset management firm VanEck, which suggested that the coin would reach over $180,000 this year. Crypto service provider Matrixport ’s head of research, Markus Thielen, shared his views with CNBC, saying that Bitcoin would attain $160,000 in 2025. Thielen attributed the possible price spike to the increasing demand for Bitcoin ETFs. One of Standard Chartered’s analysts, Geoffrey Kendrick, suggested that Bitcoin was on its way to above $200,000 in 2025. Kendrick expected that institutional fund inflows into Bitcoin and BTC products would remain similar to or above the numbers seen in 2024. A professor at the University of Sussex also expected BTC to reach above $200,000. Other analysts, including Bit Mining’s Youwei Yang, Maple Finance’s Sid Powell, Prochain Capital’s David Tawil, Nexo’s Elitsa Taskova, and CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju, expect the coin to reach between $135,000 and $250,000 in 2025. Analysts believe Trump’s administration will be a major Bitcoin catalyst The analysts shared the belief that President Donald Trump’s incoming pro-crypto policies would significantly fuel Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. The Wolf of All Streets, also known as Scott Melker, discussed the members of Trump’s administration and their plans to boost the country’s Bitcoin and crypto dominance. Melker, who was discussing BTC’s price trajectory with CoinShares’s Head of Research, James Butterfill, and 10x Research’s CEO, Markus Thielen, explained that possible legislation under Trump’s leadership would create a more crypto-friendly environment and fuel its growth. Melker suggested that BTC reaching $250,000 would come sooner than the markets expected for the same reason. The Wolf of All Streets pointed out that David Sacks’s new position as the crypto czar would unite U.S. leaders in creating regulations supporting emerging technologies, including crypto, AI, and blockchain technology. Crypto investors also hope that the industry will achieve regulatory clarity under the direction of the crypto czar. On the other hand, Maple Finance CEO suggested in a recent interview that the growing investor interest in crypto investment products was driving crypto prices higher. The analyst revealed the positive net inflows experienced in gold markets after the launch of gold ETFs. Powell expected a similar situation to lead to massive inflows into BTC spot ETFs, likely pushing the coin’s price to the predicted $200,000+. CryptoQuant analyst speculates the end of the BTC bull run The Market Has Entered the Later Stages of the Current Bull Cycle “The long-term trend remains downward, which suggests that the market is likely to reach its cycle peak by Q1 2025, or at the latest by Q2 2025.” – By @DanCoinInvestor Full post 👇 https://t.co/U6eLo2kUOc pic.twitter.com/qkJArfnbRK — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 6, 2025 CryptoQuant’s analyst and Korea community manager, Crypto Dan, shared his thoughts in a January 6 post, suggesting that the Bitcoin bull run might be coming to an end. Crypto Dan explained that the crypto markets work in alternating cycles between price spikes and declines. The analyst confirmed that the markets always maintain an overall upward trend despite the fluctuations. Crypto Dan mentioned that the current phase may be the last phase in the bull run cycle that began in January 2023. The analyst predicted that the next few months would be characterized by sharp spikes in BTC trades before a cooldown. The overheated markets expected when the trade cycles spike sharply are expected to trigger bearish cycles further. The analyst further advised investors to keep their profit options open and exercise caution. Crypto Dan still divulged that he planned to make small sell-offs of his crypto holdings during the coming cycles. Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, also suggested that the crypto markets might experience multi-week selloffs. Stockton reportedly explained that the crypto market’s short-term outlook was bearish. However, the analyst still confirmed that her long-term view on Bitcoin remained bullish.

With AUSD, Agora’s flagship stablecoin product, van Eck is focused on solving the unique challenges these nations face. “With stablecoins, people in places like Argentina or India can save money without worrying about inflation or capital controls,” van Eck said in a recent interview with CoinDesk. “It’s a simple yet revolutionary tool that can change lives, especially when and where traditional banking systems fall short.” Van Eck has extensive experience as a tech investor and a family background in the gold sector — vanEck, the fund company founded by his grandfather, manages one of the world’s largest gold mining funds. Early on, Nick van Eck recognized BTC’s potential as a store of value and aligned himself with the principles of early Bitcoiners. This series is brought to you by Consensus Hong Kong.

Fresh off a two-week trip with his family to South America’s Patagonia region, van Eck spoke about the evolving role of stablecoins in emerging markets, the catalysts driving stablecoin adoption and the unique dynamics of the Asian market. In addition, he described Agora’s approach to building blockchain-based payment infrastructure and the importance of what he calls “credible neutrality.” What follows is a lightly edited transcript of our discussion. What’s been your journey from a technology investor to starting Agora? What sparked your interest in blockchain-based payments? I started my career investing at the private equity firm JMI Equity and knew I wanted to be an investor from an early age. I was working at a hedge fund in 2016 when I first got exposed to Bitcoin. The concept of Bitcoin as “digital gold” resonated with me, and I shared many beliefs with early Bitcoiners. That’s when I first got involved, but I continued to work as a tech investor for many years. During the DeFi summer of 2020, I was drawn back into crypto as applications like Uniswap and Aave made the idea of an open financial system tangible. For many globally, these tools were better than their existing financial systems. Blockchain enables people to save and earn money in ways that weren’t possible before, and it felt like the start of a revolution. So, about a year ago, I left VC firm General Catalyst to start Agora. How have your travels, including your latest trip to Patagonia, influenced your vision for Agora? I feel very fortunate to have traveled to parts of the world where access to financial services and opportunities is far more limited than what Americans often take for granted. Spending time in places like Argentina or India has made it clear to me just how diverse the world is in terms of opportunities and challenges. The idea of providing a financial instrument that allows someone to save money without worrying about inflation is incredibly valuable in places like Patagonia and Argentina. My grandmother was an immigrant who had a difficult childhood, growing up in conditions shaped by hyperinflation, capital controls and other financial challenges. I’ve seen similar situations in my travels, and while I didn’t live through them myself, those experiences made the realities of financial instability very real to me in a way that goes beyond intellectual understanding. What sets Agora and AUSD apart from other stablecoins like USDT or PYUSD? Firstly, we are credibly neutral. USDC, for example, shares half its income with Coinbase. Tether doesn’t have any partners, and PYUSD is essentially a PayPal subsidiary designed to compete with various remittance companies. We’re like a vanilla fiat coin. We take in a dollar, mint one AUSD, and that dollar is in a bank account somewhere. Our focus from day one has been to stay credibly neutral and concentrate on building the best digital dollar network without competing with our customers. We believe in an open model where we share revenue with the underlying applications or businesses using AUSD. Why are stablecoins so critical to the crypto ecosystem, especially in Asia? Stablecoins are the lifeblood of the crypto economy, just as money is for any economy. In Asia and Southeast Asia, they provide a stable unit of account in regions where access to financial services is limited and local currencies often face volatility. What’s often misunderstood is that stablecoins aren’t just about trading — they enable wealth preservation, lending and other financial services. For many people in emerging markets, they offer opportunities that traditional systems cannot. What challenges do stablecoins face in achieving widespread adoption? Regulation is the main hurdle. Businesses are keen to use stablecoins due to their cost efficiency and speed, but they need clarity on legal and compliance frameworks, like knowing who the licensed providers are. Stablecoins have gained traction in crypto-native spaces, but there’s still untapped potential in traditional markets like cross-border payments and B2B transactions. I think this is just the beginning of what’s going to be a twenty-year journey of mass adoption. How do you see the Asian market shaping global trends for stablecoins? Asia is uniquely positioned to drive stablecoin adoption due to its high demand for cross-border payments and latent dollar demand, a strong but unmet need for access to U.S. dollars in trade, savings or transactions. There are a lot of different countries in Asia, many of which are really wealthy but have a lot of high dollar demand rates. Southeast Asia, in particular, has a younger, underbanked population always on the lookout for more competitive financial services. With a smartphone, these people can access pretty attractive dollar-denominated opportunities like Aave and similar DeFi protocols without needing a bank account. How is Asia different from regions like the U.S. or Europe? The key difference is access to U.S. banks. In the U.S., financial services are readily available. Stablecoins fill a significant gap in Asia, however, offering a dollar-based financial tool for those without access to traditional banking. That’s why our focus is entirely on markets outside the U.S. In Hong Kong, you have a pretty good financial ecosystem, but outside of that developed market, there’s a lot of opportunity to provide better financial products. How do you see blockchain-based payments evolving over the next decade? I think you’ll see the majority of cross-border payments transition to stablecoins as opposed to the banking system using Swift today. You’ll also see a lot of foreign exchange trading settle on-chain. We’re excited to play very significant roles in both parts of those growth markets.",Consensus Hong Kong 2025 Coverage|chk2025|Agora|AUSD|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 17:51:02

According to Steve Hanke, a professor of Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University, establishing Bitcoin reserves is “the stupidest” idea. He argued that diverting savings into digital assets like Bitcoin would harm economic productivity and growth, he said in an X post on January 6. The post, accompanied by a video extract from Hanke’s interview with Jeremy Lin, saw the scholar explain that savings in Bitcoin are not used to fund real capital assets that drive production. Instead, these funds simply sit idle, similar to purchasing old art, without contributing to tangible projects that improve productivity. A US BITCOIN STRATEGIC RESERVE = A STUPID IDEA. Savings funneled into Bitcoin aren't building factories, creating jobs, or driving innovation. pic.twitter.com/VaH0p7Y835 — Steve Hanke (@steve_hanke) January 6, 2025 Economic prosperity rooted in productivity, not speculation Hanke emphasized that economic prosperity and improved living standards are rooted in increased productivity. He warned that failing to invest in productive assets could have long-term consequences for financial health. “It diverts weighting and savings into old masters that just, it just sits there and is never invested in bankable projects that actually produce anything and increase productivity in the economy. I’m completely opposed to it. I think it’s the stupidest idea,” he said. It is worth noting that Hanke has been a long-standing critic of Bitcoin and has opposed governments that embrace digital assets. For instance, he was among the vocal critics who predicted doom for El Salvador’s economy after the country declared Bitcoin as legal tender. Among his more notable recent comments on Bitcoin, in 2024, Hanke referred to cryptocurrency investors as “psychopaths,” citing findings from a psychological study conducted by researchers at the University of Toronto. Mixed reactions on Trump’s Bitcoin reserve idea Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, the President-elect has made moves to appeal to the crypto community, such as nominating cryptocurrency-friendly regulators. However, his stance on establishing a Bitcoin reserve continues to draw mixed reactions. At the same time, the odds of Trump making such a move within his first 100 days in office have diminished, particularly in betting markets. According to Polymarket, there is only a 31% chance the United States will have a Bitcoin reserve by April 29. Prediction on creating a Bitcoin reserve in the United States. Source: PolyMarket Overall, there has been increased pessimism regarding establishing a Bitcoin reserve. This sentiment was heightened by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who noted that the institution is not allowed to own Bitcoin. These remarks caused Bitcoin’s price to plunge significantly. Trump and his allies aim to position the U.S. as a global leader in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and a reserve is viewed as one of the key starting points.

The lawyer argues that Custodia Bank’s legal battle against the U.S. Federal Reserve is the “most important filed case” in the crypto industry. “At their core, Custodia Bank’s fight and Choke Point 2.0, go beyond digital assets, banking charters or blockchain. It’s about whether unelected bureaucrats can arbitrarily deny access to essential financial infrastructure, effectively picking winners and losers in the marketplace. It’s about whether government agencies can wield unchecked power to restrict lawful businesses from accessing the critical financial infrastructure necessary to survive and thrive in a free market economy. If these actions go unchallenged, it creates a dangerous precedent where regulatory bodies can quietly suppress entire industries they disfavor, stifling innovation, competition, and economic opportunity. Custodia and Choke Point 2.0 are much bigger than crypto. They define whether America remains a place where the rule of law protects free enterprise, or where bureaucratic discretion is allowed to dismantle it.” Deaton isn’t the only person talking about Operation Choke Point 2.0. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal recently argued that documents secured by the exchange show that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was attempting to sabotage a wide variety of activity in the crypto industry. Coinbase filed Freedom of Information Act requests related to the FDIC’s letters to banks about crypto services. Grewal says there is clear evidence of a deliberate effort by the government to stifle the growth of crypto in the US. “We finally got the unredacted OCP 2.0 letters from [the FDIC]. It took a court order but you can now read them for yourself… They show a coordinated effort to stop a wide variety of crypto activity – everything from basic BTC transactions to more complex offerings. Note that FDIC magically found TWO more pause letters in this search after saying before that it had complied with an earlier Court order. It’s hard to believe in their good faith when their sweater further unravels every time we pull on the thread. The new Congress should launch hearings on all this without delay.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

If completed, this could see prices revisit the mid-$70Ks. BTC’s price action since late November has evolved into what technical analysts call a “head and shoulders” (H&S) pattern, which foreshadows a bullish-to-bearish trend change. The first failed attempt to scale the $100,000 mark in November marked the first shoulder. That was followed by the head, marking a swift retreat to $92,000 from the record high of over $108,000 in the second half of December. Meanwhile, the 5% drop to nearly $97,000 hints at the formation of a right shoulder. If the sell-off persists and prices fall below the neckline – the horizontal trendline connecting the troughs of the two shoulders – the bearish head-and-shoulders reversal pattern would be confirmed. As of writing, the so-called neckline support was seen around $91,500. A break below this level could pave the way for a dip to roughly $75,000, with this figure determined using the measured move method. The method measures the vertical distance from the highest point of the head to the neckline and then subtracts the same from the neckline price point to arrive at a potential downside target. In technical analysis, traders examine charts for price patterns to predict future price movements.

To read full editions, subscribe . Before “AI” came to be synonymous with “agents,” there were far humbler AI projects with functional use cases. Grass was one such DePIN project on Solana. The Grass elevator pitch: Big Tech bad because it scrapes your data on the internet for their profit, Grass good because you can now use it to activate your idle internet bandwidth to sell that access. Rather than buying it from Big Tech, AI companies (or businesses that find it useful to track media sentiment) that want your textual data can now purchase it from you via Grass as an intermediary. Grass blew up mid-2024, growing to more than 2 million+ active nodes in less than a year. These nodes scrape about 90TB of data daily (about 445x less than Google), which is then sold to AI companies. The GRASS token airdropped in October, with multiple major CEX listings and a 380% appreciation since. That’s impressive considering most tokens see a down-only trend on TGE. It’s even more particularly impressive since GRASS farmers don’t suffer an opportunity cost, i.e., staking capital. The more costless it is to farm something, the higher tendency for a token to dump aggressively, but that hasn’t been the case for Grass. Based on @Daveeemor , Grass generates about $33 million in annualized revenues, which it plans to eventually share with its node operators and GRASS stakers. At a $702 million market cap today, that gives GRASS a 21.3x MC/F multiple. If one believes Grass can continue to scale as it did in 2024, that suggests a very attractive token valuation relative to other fee-generating DePIN protocols, like Helium or Akash, which trade at a much higher 265-334x MC/F multiple. In Q1 2025, Grass plans to introduce the ability to better capture real-time data with its “Live Context Retrieval” technology, enabling more performant and specific AI models that depend on time-sensitive information such as market trading.

However, with BTC regaining its upside momentum, the market might become favorable for institutional and retail investors in the upcoming days. Price Movement Poses Challenges For Short-Term Holders Technical expert and host of the Crypto Banter Show Kyle Doops has spotted a persistent trend among Bitcoin’s short-term holders . Data shows that the short-term holders are grappling with profitability challenges as fluctuating prices and shifting market dynamics take their toll. On-chain data shows a growing percentage of these investors are holding at or close to a loss, underscoring the rising difficulties of profiting from the movement of BTC’s price. This extended struggle of these short-term holders could lead to profit-taking , thereby hindering BTC’s upward momentum. Kyle Doops highlighted that these investors are struggling with profitability due to BTC’s sharp drop from its current all-time high of $108,000. According to the expert, this group has a significant impact on market sentiment, and their lower profitability suggests weakening demand and pessimistic conditions. As a result, corrections are more likely at this point as volatility increases. Meanwhile, Kyle Doops believes that even if Bitcoin’s potential for long-term growth is still intact, now is a good time to concentrate on risk management. With Bitcoin approaching key resistance levels, market watchers are closely observing the impact of the trend and BTC’s price movement in order to navigate the next major upswing. The development coincides with Bitcoin’s recent upswing to the $102,000 price level, signaling the potential for more growth. There are rising speculations within the community that the recent move marks the beginning of a price discovery phase. Daan Crypto Trades, a market expert and investor, claims that BTC’s price discovery phase has barely begun after examining the price action. His perspective is also backed by past cycle trends where Bitcoin witnessed substantial growth during its price discovery phase. Thus, the expert contends that the market is currently in the first full week of the year following the Halving event, which is usually the most bullish year of the cycle. This move marks a pivotal moment for the flagship asset as investors anticipate its move toward its all-time high . Bitcoin Maintaining A Positive Move BTC is presently maintaining a healthy price movement after its latest surge, attracting gains in the last few days. Investors’ and traders’ sentiment has risen sharply due to the move, indicating heightened optimism in BTC’s prospects. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $101,790, demonstrating a nearly 3% surge in the last 24 hours. Its market cap and trading volume have also increased by about 2.43% and 70% in the past day.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Halving|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|btc|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Crypto Banter Show|Daan Crypto Trades|Kyle Doops|Price Discovery,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-07 18:00:06

Expert Calls It A Realistic Goal For 2025 – Here’s Why Whether SUI will continue the trend and hit $6 remains the question in the minds of most traders and investors. The next resistance is set at $5.67, and a breakout past that level may give a way to higher prices. The overall market sentiment is good, and it seems the uptrend can sustain itself for much longer. Path To $6 SUI has been strong enough to break above the psychological mark of $4.80, and thus, the same has helped establish a solid support level that the investors are waiting for to increase the momentum to the upside. If SUI can break above the $5.67 resistance, it could just keep on climbing to $6. As for 2025 projections, they vary from $4.4 to $8.8, based on how the market behaves and where investors’ heads are at. That said, the unpredictable nature of the crypto market means a correction could hit at any moment, so caution wouldn’t hurt. Market Sentiment And Expert Insights The strength of SUI’s technical indicators and favorable market view have driven its increase. The general professional study on the token shows quite positive future prospects. Crypto analyst Investing Heaven has noted that more development is yet possible. Will $SUI Continue Its Climb? After a stunning 10x rally, SUI’s long-term chart suggests further upside potential in 2025. The rising trendline is key, acting as a foundation for continued growth.

According to Investing Heaven, technical patterns are in favor, with key moving averages and RSI levels indicating that SUI may continue its upward trend. There is no question that the news on SUI has positive sentiments, though one should recall the crypto market volatility. Corrections due to abrupt shifts in conditions or sentiment might appear at any moment. In general, analysts still believe SUI has solid reasons to navigate these potential blows and continue with a long-term trajectory upward.

Strong technicals point to a likely upward direction for SUI. If it breaks through $5.67, the altcoin could hit $6.

According to Cointelegraph , citing data from Apollo and BiTBO , this surge highlights an intense demand for Bitcoin in the ETF market, far outpacing its current supply. This supply-demand disparity emphasizes Bitcoin’s rising appeal among institutional investors and its potential impact on future prices. Key Highlights from December 1. ETF BTC Holdings Outpace Mining Output BTC Mined : 14,000 coins BTC Added to ETFs : 51,500 coins Demand-Supply Ratio : 272% higher demand compared to supply This stark imbalance underscores the growing dominance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in absorbing available BTC supply. 2. Insights from Jesse Myers Jesse Myers, co-founder of Onramp Bitcoin , commented on the situation: “The supply is insufficient to meet demand at current prices.” A price equilibrium adjustment is required to balance the market. Implications of the Demand-Supply Disparity 1. Increased Buying Pressure The intense accumulation by ETFs is reducing the available supply of Bitcoin in the market. This creates a scenario where rising demand could: Push prices higher as buyers compete for limited supply. Drive greater adoption of alternative investment vehicles like ETFs. 2. Institutional Confidence in Bitcoin ETFs are considered a gateway for institutional investors, offering regulated exposure to Bitcoin without direct ownership. The rapid increase in ETF holdings signals growing confidence among institutions in Bitcoin’s long-term value. 3. Supply Shock Potential The vast absorption of BTC by ETFs exacerbates the potential for a supply shock , particularly if retail demand surges during a bull market. How ETFs Are Reshaping Bitcoin’s Market Dynamics 1. Institutional Inflows U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted significant inflows, particularly following regulatory approvals: Fidelity, BlackRock, and ARK Invest are among the major players driving ETF adoption. 2. Impact on Mining Economics With ETF demand outstripping mining output: Miners may benefit from higher BTC prices due to reduced circulating supply. Mining operations may face increased scrutiny as their role in meeting demand becomes critical. 3. Long-Term Price Implications As ETFs secure large quantities of BTC, the available supply for trading diminishes, potentially leading to: Higher volatility during periods of increased demand. A steady upward trajectory for Bitcoin prices over the long term. FAQs What is driving the surge in ETF Bitcoin holdings? Institutional interest, regulatory clarity, and the accessibility of spot ETFs are key drivers behind the surge. How does the ETF demand affect Bitcoin miners? Miners could benefit from higher BTC prices as ETFs absorb supply, but they may also face increased pressure to scale production. What does the demand-supply imbalance mean for Bitcoin prices? The imbalance suggests a potential upward pressure on Bitcoin prices, especially if demand remains strong. Are spot Bitcoin ETFs a reliable indicator of institutional interest? Yes, the rapid growth in ETF holdings reflects heightened institutional interest in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Will the demand for Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow? Given the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a store of value and investment vehicle, demand for ETFs is likely to persist. Conclusion The 51,500 BTC added by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in December showcases the increasing demand for Bitcoin in regulated investment markets. With ETF demand significantly outpacing mining output, the resulting supply-demand imbalance could lead to heightened price pressures in the near term. As institutional participation grows, Bitcoin’s market dynamics are poised for further evolution, solidifying its role as a cornerstone of the digital asset ecosystem.

With XRP currently trading at $2.42 and a market cap of approximately $139.54 billion , this would represent a monumental leap for the cryptocurrency. Flag Pattern Analysis: XRP’s Potential Catalyst What is the Half-Mast Flag Pattern? A half-mast flag pattern is a bullish continuation pattern observed in technical analysis. It often signals the continuation of an existing upward trend after a period of consolidation. Brandt’s Insight Brandt pointed out on X that XRP’s weekly market cap chart currently exhibits a half-mast flag. He emphasized that this pattern must resolve successfully within six weeks to validate the bullish outlook. Failure to gain momentum could result in the pattern evolving into a less bullish or even bearish formation. XRP’s Current Market Standing As of now, XRP holds a strong position in the cryptocurrency market: Metric Value Current Price $2.42 Market Cap $139.54 billion 24-Hour Change +0.7% Despite recent regulatory challenges, Ripple has made significant strides in partnerships and use-case adoption, bolstering investor confidence. What a $500B Market Cap Means for XRP 1. Price Implications For XRP to achieve a $500 billion market cap , its price would need to surge to approximately $8.67 per token, assuming the current circulating supply remains constant. 2. Industry Impact A market cap of this magnitude would make XRP a formidable force in the crypto space, potentially surpassing Ethereum or challenging Bitcoin in terms of dominance. It would also solidify Ripple’s role as a leader in cross-border payments and blockchain technology adoption . 3. Investor Sentiment Such growth would likely attract: Institutional investors looking for significant returns. Increased retail interest due to media coverage and FOMO (fear of missing out). Challenges to Achieving $500B While Brandt’s prediction is optimistic, XRP faces several hurdles: 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Ripple’s ongoing legal battles with the U.S. SEC could deter institutional investors. A negative ruling could impact XRP’s adoption and price trajectory. 2. Market Dynamics The broader crypto market sentiment often influences XRP’s performance. Any bearish trend in Bitcoin or Ethereum could weigh down XRP’s price momentum. 3. Pattern Resolution The success of the half-mast flag pattern hinges on sustained bullish momentum within the next six weeks. Bullish Factors for XRP’s Growth Despite the challenges, several factors support Brandt’s bullish outlook: 1. Expanding Use Cases Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions continue to grow, strengthening XRP’s real-world utility. Adoption in cross-border payments positions XRP as a preferred choice for efficient transactions. 2. Increased Investor Confidence Recent price stability and gradual growth have attracted long-term investors. XRP’s resilience amid market fluctuations highlights its strong fundamentals. 3. Broader Market Trends A rising tide lifts all boats: a sustained crypto bull market could propel XRP’s price higher. FAQs What is the half-mast flag pattern Brandt refers to? The half-mast flag is a technical analysis pattern indicating a continuation of an upward trend after consolidation. Why is six weeks critical for XRP? Brandt suggests that if XRP’s market cap doesn’t gain momentum within six weeks, the current flag pattern may evolve into a less favorable formation. What would XRP’s price need to be for a $500B market cap? Assuming the current circulating supply, XRP’s price would need to reach approximately $8.67 . How does Ripple’s SEC case impact XRP’s growth potential? The SEC case remains a significant factor. A favorable outcome could accelerate growth, while a negative ruling could hinder adoption. Is $500B a realistic target for XRP? While ambitious, the target depends on factors like regulatory clarity, market dynamics, and the successful resolution of the flag pattern. Conclusion Peter Brandt’s prediction of a $500 billion market cap for Ripple (XRP) underscores the cryptocurrency’s potential in the evolving financial landscape. However, achieving this milestone hinges on technical chart performance , regulatory outcomes, and broader market conditions. For now, XRP’s strong fundamentals and growing use cases make it a cryptocurrency to watch as it navigates its path to potential new heights.

Why did BlackRock’s ETHA lead in inflows? BlackRock’s established reputation and strong investor trust likely contributed to ETHA’s dominant performance. How do ETF inflows impact Ethereum’s price? Large inflows typically reflect higher demand for Ethereum, which can positively influence its price through increased buying pressure. Are Ethereum ETFs risk-free?

The inflows signal strong institutional confidence in Ethereum, likely contributing to its long-term growth and stability.

Meanwhile, Solana and Dogecoin have staged remarkable comebacks as 2025 gets off to a bullish start. These tokens will likely surprise the upside this year, with Rollblock in particular tipped for head-spinning 50xmoves this year! Rollblock ($RBLK) Accelerates Toward GambleFi Dominance WithSoaring Sign-Ups Rollblock ($ RBLK ) is showing no signs of slowing down as it seeks to shake up the $500 billion online gambling sector with its revolutionary blockchain-backed betting platform. Thanks to the immutable Ethereum blockchain, a record of every transaction is now instantly verifiable on-chain, stamping out any allegation of bet tampering that has plagued the industry for decades. This means that gamers can explore the 7,000 gaming experiences on the Rollblock platform with peace of mind. A recently launched sports betting feature has also been met with incredible success and saw more than $1.75 million in wagers placed during December. This looks likely to double in January 2025. This revolutionary gaming protocol has taken in more than $8 million as more than 40,000 investors have bought into the presale before this Web3 gaming heavy hitter becomes a household name. These holdings can earn a generous passive income thanks to the Rollblock revenue share scheme, which takes up to 30% of the platform's revenue to buy up $RBLK, burning 60% of these coins and allocating the rest to stakers. Such a deflationary supply issuance is incredibly bullish for $RBLK price as it means the token will become increasingly scarce over time. This will maximize returns for long term holders while incentivizing prolonged ownership timeframes. Raoul Pal ‘Stupid Bullish’ On Solana’s ($SOL) 2025 Prospects Solana has bounced with strength into the new year, increasing by 15% in a week to reach $218. Solana is still down 7% on the monthly time frame after a recent sell-off caused it to tumble to $175. However, there are signs that Solana bulls are confident of a coming rally. Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal recently took to the X social media platform to post a Solana chart and explain that “the long-term Solana chart is stupid bullish.” One of the reasons for Pal’s enthusiasm is the upcoming Firedancer upgrade that will supercharge Solana’s TPS this year and could potentially send Solana north of $1,000. Dogecoin ($DOGE) Being Bought Up During Recent Dip Dogecoin has also had a phenomenal first week of 2025, climbing by more than 22% to reach $0.38. This surge has been influenced by Dogecoin whales who stepped in during the recent dip to accumulate behind the scenes. Dogecoin looks ready to test resistance at $0.40. The Dogecoin/BTC ratio also looks to be in an accumulation phase, which suggests a further rally from here. A breakout above this level would likely kick off a bullish rally for Dogecoin, and analysts are confident that Dogecoin could reach $1 during Q1 of this year. Rollblock Will Dominate The Coming Web3 Gaming Bull Market Solana and Dogecoin remain extremely bullish coins to hold for the coming bull run in 2025 and will likely deliver outstanding returns. However, Rollblock ($RBLK) continues to dominate thanks to its extraordinary momentum and comprehensive gaming offering. The $RBLK token is currently in stage 9 of its presale ICO for $0.0445, where tokens are selling rapidly as word spreads of the unique Rollblock offer.

38663658,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=119360,1736273476,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,CryptoQuant CEO Predicts Longest Bitcoin Bull Cycle in History,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/longest-bitcoin-bull-cycle-prediction/,"The current Bitcoin bull cycle might be unlike any other in the cryptocurrency’s history, according to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju . In a recent post on X, Ju suggested that steady inflows of new liquidity are fueling Bitcoin’s upward momentum, with untapped market potential poised to extend the cycle even further. If accurate, this projection could solidify Bitcoin’s position as a long-term asset class, ushering in a new era of sustained growth and adoption . What Makes This Bull Cycle Unique? 1. Consistent Liquidity Inflows Ju emphasized that the current market is seeing steady and sustainable liquidity , contrasting with previous cycles that often relied on speculative bubbles. Institutional Investment : Increased participation from traditional finance players, including Bitcoin ETFs, has brought more stability to the market. Retail Participation : Retail investors are also contributing to liquidity, driven by greater awareness and access to crypto markets. 2. Untapped Potential Emerging Markets : Countries like India, Brazil, and Turkey are witnessing a surge in crypto adoption, adding new layers of demand. New Financial Products : Innovations like Bitcoin-backed loans and decentralized financial products are expanding Bitcoin’s use cases. Historical Bull Cycles vs. Current Trends Cycle Start Year Duration Peak Price Key Driver First Cycle 2011 8 months $31 Early adoption. Second Cycle 2013 12 months $1,150 Increased exchange activity. Third Cycle 2017 18 months $19,600 Retail speculation. Fourth Cycle 2020 24 months $69,000 Institutional investment. Current Cycle 2023 Ongoing $108,000+ Sustainable liquidity inflows. The current cycle is characterized by slower but steadier growth , which Ju suggests could extend its duration beyond previous peaks. Factors Extending the Bull Cycle 1. Institutional Momentum ETFs : Products like BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF are attracting significant capital. Corporate Treasury Investments : Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla continue to hold Bitcoin, signaling long-term confidence. 2. Evolving Global Macro Trends Inflation Hedge : Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation is gaining recognition amid global economic uncertainties. Geopolitical Instability : Countries facing economic instability are turning to Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat currencies. 3. Technological Advancements Layer-2 Scaling Solutions : The Lightning Network and similar innovations are improving Bitcoin’s usability for everyday transactions. Cross-Chain Interoperability : Enhanced connectivity between Bitcoin and other blockchain ecosystems is increasing its utility. Potential Risks to the Bull Cycle 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Stringent regulations in major markets like the U.S. and EU could dampen momentum. Ongoing debates over stablecoins and CBDCs could shift investor focus away from Bitcoin. 2. Market Overheating Prolonged cycles often lead to over-speculation , increasing the risk of a sharp correction. 3. Black Swan Events Geopolitical crises or major technological failures could disrupt market dynamics. FAQs Why does Ki Young Ju believe this will be the longest Bitcoin bull cycle? Ju cites steady liquidity inflows and untapped markets as key factors driving sustained growth, unlike previous cycles that were often fueled by speculative mania. What could extend Bitcoin’s bull cycle further? New financial products, increased institutional participation, and adoption in emerging markets could continue to fuel the cycle. What risks could cut this bull cycle short? Regulatory changes, market overheating, and unforeseen events like major hacks or geopolitical crises could pose significant risks. How does this cycle compare to the 2017 bull run? Unlike 2017, which was largely driven by retail speculation , the current cycle is supported by institutional adoption and sustainable liquidity inflows . When might the current cycle peak? While no timeline is guaranteed, analysts suggest the current cycle could extend well into 2025 , depending on market conditions. Conclusion The current Bitcoin bull cycle has the potential to become the longest and most significant in history. With institutional backing , growing adoption, and steady liquidity, Bitcoin is moving toward greater mainstream acceptance. However, investors must remain vigilant about potential risks, as prolonged cycles often come with challenges.

Meanwhile, the trending utility meme coin Cutoshi (CUTO) is gaining momentum in presale and is expected to surpass SHIB and DOGE in 2025 to reach $1 and become the leading meme coin. Will Shiba Inu (SHIB) Regain Demand From 100-day SMA? During the recent rally, Shiba Inu broke out of the resistance of its month-long sideways congestion, and the price surged over 80% within a week to the $0.00003044 price level. However, the surge halted here as the price encountered bearish pressure, which caused Shiba Inu to drop over 20% to the $0.00002340 support level. Shiba Inu consolidated between this support and the $0.00002621 price level for the next two weeks, after which it again surged and encountered a crucial trendline when it reached $0.000033. Shiba Inu lost demand, and the price was corrected from this trendline to the 100-day SMA. The Shiba Inu price has been consolidated for the previous two weeks, close to the 100-day SMA, and currently trades at $0.00002276. Today, demand has increased, indicated by a 30% increment in trading volume. Additionally, the MACD oscillator indicated increasing bullish sentiment by moving above the signal line, implying a potential trend reversal if substantial demand returns. Dogecoin (DOGE) Continues In Consolidated Price Action In November 2024, the Dogecoin price, which had been steadily rising in an uptrend, received a massive boost due to the broader market turning bullish. This led Dogecoin to break out of the uptrend's upper trendline to undergo a 200%+ rally. However, demand dropped as the price reached $0.44, and Dogecoin entered a rising wedge pattern due to the reduced upward momentum. Dogecoin traded in this wedge for over three weeks, but due to increased bearish pressure, the price fell below the lower trendline and continued to consolidate above the $0.392 support level for a week. Dogecoin again plunged from this support level to the $0.2995 support level. It has been two weeks since then, and the price has been stuck in the $0.30-$0.34 range. At press time, Dogecoin trades at $0.338 after a 1.74% increase in the last 24 hours. Since Dogecoin has lost demand and is consolidating, the in-demand presale token Cutoshi (CUTO) has the potential to reach the $1 mark before the leader of meme coins. Cutoshi (CUTO): Hybrid ERC-20 Token Rivals DOGE Cutoshi is the viral hybrid altcoin that combines the practical, real-world benefits of utility tokens with the fun of a meme coin community to challenge top meme coins head-on. Since it offers the best of both worlds, Cutoshi offers sustained and long-term growth compared to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The project is inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision for blockchain technology and promotes a secure, private, and efficient decentralized economy. It also takes inspiration from the Chinese Lucky Cat, which, according to Chinese and Japanese folklore, is known for its power to bring good luck and prosperity to its owners. By combining these characteristics, Cutoshi has designed a memeFi ecosystem that appeals to both meme coin fans and DeFi enthusiasts. At the core of this ecosystem is the Cutoshi DEX, a cross-chain interoperable decentralized exchange where community members can swap their digital assets across multiple blockchains at unmatched speeds and for minimal fees. The native token, CUTO, is a crucial ecosystem element that powers the entire platform. Token holders can access unique features, such as the Cutoshi NFTs, and are eligible for special discounts at the Cutoshi merch shop. Community members can acquire CUTO by participating in token farming and competing against over 3,700 other members. The token can also be obtained at the presale, which offers it at $0.031 per CUTO in stage four. So far, the presale has raised $1.47 million and generated a 109% return for stage one investors. New investors will also make similar returns as the presale has a long way to go before the token lists on popular exchanges.

38663684,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=119356,1736273630,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,90% of Bitcoin Supply in Profit: Analyst Sees Bullish Momentum Ahead,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-supply-profit-bullish-trend/,"As Bitcoin’s price continues to rise, 90% of its total supply is currently in profit , according to crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr . . Highlighting this significant milestone on X, Adler suggested that the market is showing signs of a bullish trend , similar to the trajectory seen during Bitcoin’s 2017 cycle. He noted that, barring any unexpected “black swan” events, the current market conditions could sustain this upward momentum, with minimal pullbacks to the 80% profit level . Adler also speculated that the 2021 cycle might have followed this bullish pattern if not for the China mining ban that disrupted market dynamics. Key Insights into Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum 1. Profitability Milestone 90% Supply in Profit : A clear indication that most Bitcoin holders are seeing gains, signaling strong market sentiment. Historical Comparison : Similar conditions were observed during the 2017 bull run , which saw Bitcoin reach then-record highs. 2. Minimal Pullback Expected Adler predicts potential corrections could take Bitcoin’s profitable supply to 80% , but these are likely to be short-lived. Past cycles have shown that profitability levels between 80%-90% often precede new all-time highs. 3. Resilience Against Disruptions While the 2021 cycle faced challenges like China’s mining ban , the current market shows greater resilience with diversified mining operations and robust institutional adoption. Factors Driving Bitcoin’s Bullish Outlook 1. Institutional Adoption Increased participation from institutions, including ETFs and corporate treasuries, is stabilizing and bolstering the market. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla continue to expand their Bitcoin holdings, signaling long-term confidence. 2. Global Economic Conditions Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation , attracting both retail and institutional investors amid global economic uncertainty. 3. Regulatory Clarity The growing regulatory acceptance of Bitcoin, particularly in major markets like the U.S., is reducing uncertainty and fostering growth. Historical Parallels: 2017 vs. 2025 Metric 2017 Cycle 2025 Cycle Supply in Profit 90% (peak bull run) 90% (current trend) Major Disruptions None China’s mining ban (2021) recovery complete Market Sentiment Overwhelmingly Bullish Positive, with cautious optimism Institutional Involvement Minimal Significant, driving stability What Could Derail the Bullish Trend? Despite the positive outlook, certain factors could disrupt Bitcoin’s momentum: Black Swan Events : Geopolitical crises, regulatory crackdowns, or economic downturns. Profit-Taking by Whales : Large-scale sell-offs by early adopters or institutional players could trigger temporary corrections. Macro Market Shifts : Changes in global monetary policy or economic conditions impacting liquidity and risk appetite. FAQs What does it mean that 90% of Bitcoin supply is in profit? This indicates that 90% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply was acquired at prices lower than the current market price, reflecting strong gains for most holders. How does Bitcoin’s current cycle compare to 2017? The 2025 cycle shows similarities to 2017, with high profitability levels and strong market sentiment. However, the current cycle benefits from greater institutional involvement and regulatory clarity. What factors could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish trend? Continued institutional adoption. Growing use of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Regulatory clarity in major markets. Could there still be a significant correction? While minor pullbacks are expected, analysts like Adler suggest corrections will likely be limited to profitability levels of 80%. How did the 2021 mining ban affect Bitcoin’s market? China’s mining ban in 2021 caused a temporary drop in Bitcoin’s price and mining hash rate. However, the market has since rebounded as mining operations relocated to other regions. Conclusion With 90% of Bitcoin’s supply in profit , the current market reflects a strong bullish trend , reminiscent of the 2017 cycle . While potential risks remain, the growing influence of institutional investors, improved market resilience, and favorable global conditions point to a sustained upward trajectory.

Having predicted earlier that nation states adoption of Bitcoin will soar this year, Hougan noted that “the dominos start to fall.” Czech Republic Bitcoin Plans In a CNN Prima News interview , Aleš Michl, the Governor of the Czech National Bank, is weighing how to diversify the country’s reserves with Bitcoin. In the interview, he said there are no active strategies in place to make this move. While Michl said he favors the onboarding of Bitcoin as an asset diversifier for the Czech Republic, he said this decision is not solely his to make. He said there are seven members on the board whose say might also sway the ongoing discussion. Despite the lack of concrete plans, the Governor acknowledged that; “Bitcoin is an interesting option for diversification against other assets.” On his part, the Czech Republic National Bank executive said he plans to add just a few Bitcoin units with no plans to make a significant investment. This plan to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset aligns with the growing conversations in different nations. While Japan rejected the BTC reserve idea, different states in Switzerland continued to explore the plans. MicroStrategy bought 258,320 BTC in 2024, and with this, the focus on the top coin has grown over the past few months. While corporate firms are looking to borrow the MicroStrategy playbook, Matt Hougan predicted that governments will firm one of the three insatiable demand sources for Bitcoin this year. The three sources of insatiable demand in 2025: Companies, ETFs, and Governments. https://t.co/vatSG6wxgF — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) January 6, 2025 The Wait on Donald Trump Administration The Czech Republic is considering adopting Bitcoin as a strategic asset, marking a major advancement in the idea that started with Donald Trump. During his Presidential election campaign, Trump promised to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States. The crypto community is now very expectant following his victory. On his part, the President-elect is convening a crypto advisory council that will help look into the BTC strategy. Many industry leaders are in support of the plan, highlighting how it can help the country solve its growing debt challenge. However, the economic viability and longer-term impact on the US Dollar remain a concern that might derail the plans overall. In light of this, Peter Schiff proposed USACoin as an alternative to the BTC reserve plans, as reported earlier by Coingape. Bitcoin As Biggest Beneficiary Amid the growing conversations around the adoption of Bitcoin, the coin has a major prospect of continuing to grow. Notably, the top five Bitcoin price predictions for 2025 peg the coin at a range of $200,000 to $500,000, hingeing on its status as a reserve in most nations’ portfolios. Currently, the coin is down by 4.45% in 24 hours to $97,173.39. The coin dropped from a high of $102,712.48 as investors cooled off from the latest rally.

The move raises speculation about the impact of a change in leadership on Canada’s cryptocurrency landscape, particularly with Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre , a known crypto advocate, leading in recent polls. However, the future of cryptocurrency in Canada hinges largely on regulatory oversight by the Canadian Securities Administration (CSA) and its provincial counterparts. Key figures such as Mark Carney , a potential Liberal contender, advocate for strict stablecoin rules similar to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) , leaving the path forward uncertain. What Trudeau’s Resignation Could Mean for Crypto 1. Leadership Change and Policy Direction Pierre Poilievre’s Crypto Stance : A long-time advocate for Bitcoin (BTC) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Poilievre has previously criticized the Bank of Canada ’s monetary policies, calling for innovation in financial technologies. His leadership could promote crypto-friendly regulations , encouraging blockchain innovation and adoption. Mark Carney’s Approach : A former central banker and potential Liberal contender, Carney supports strict stablecoin regulations , aligning them with CBDC frameworks . His leadership could result in a more cautious, centralized approach to digital assets. 2. October 2025 Elections as a Turning Point The upcoming elections will determine whether Canada leans towards a decentralized crypto economy or retains a regulatory-heavy framework . Key Players Influencing Canada’s Crypto Future 1. Canadian Securities Administration (CSA) The CSA remains pivotal in shaping the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency. Stablecoins and Exchanges : The CSA has prioritized stablecoin regulation and increased scrutiny of crypto exchanges. Investor Protection : Provincial regulators have imposed strict measures to ensure transparency and reduce fraud. 2. Bank of Canada’s Stance on CBDCs The Bank of Canada has been exploring the potential launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) . A Poilievre-led government may focus on supporting decentralized alternatives over CBDCs. 3. International Influence Canada’s crypto policies are influenced by global frameworks, particularly those in the U.S. and Europe . Canada’s Crypto Landscape: Current State Adoption Trends : A growing number of Canadians are using cryptocurrency for investments and payments. Businesses are increasingly integrating blockchain technology into operations. Regulatory Environment : Canada has imposed strict rules on crypto exchanges and stablecoin issuers , aiming to protect consumers and maintain financial stability. Scenarios for Canada’s Crypto Future Scenario Policy Direction Impact on Crypto Conservative Leadership Lighter regulations, pro-crypto policies Boost in adoption and innovation Liberal Leadership Stricter stablecoin rules, CBDC focus Controlled growth, emphasis on regulation CSA Dominance Centralized oversight with balanced innovation Moderate growth with investor protection Potential Implications for the Global Crypto Ecosystem 1. Increased Adoption A crypto-friendly Canada could attract global businesses and startups, boosting North America’s position in the blockchain space. 2. Regulatory Harmonization Canada’s stance will likely influence crypto policies in neighboring countries and global markets. 3. Innovation and Competition Lighter regulations could accelerate innovation, fostering competition with crypto hubs like the U.S. and Europe . FAQs Why is Trudeau’s resignation significant for cryptocurrency? Trudeau’s resignation could pave the way for a new leadership more aligned with crypto-friendly policies, particularly if Pierre Poilievre wins the upcoming election. What role does the CSA play in Canada’s crypto regulations? The CSA oversees provincial regulations for crypto assets, focusing on investor protection and ensuring market transparency. How could Mark Carney’s policies impact crypto? As a potential Liberal leader, Carney’s advocacy for strict stablecoin rules could limit decentralized innovation while promoting CBDCs . What is the current state of cryptocurrency in Canada? Canada has a growing crypto ecosystem but faces strict regulations on exchanges and stablecoins , aiming to protect consumers. When will Canada’s crypto direction be decided? The October 2025 elections will play a critical role in shaping the country’s crypto policies and regulatory environment. Conclusion Justin Trudeau’s resignation marks a pivotal moment for Canada, potentially influencing its trajectory as a leader in the global crypto ecosystem . With the Conservatives favoring decentralization and Liberals emphasizing regulation, the October elections will determine whether Canada embraces blockchain innovation or maintains a cautious approach. The path forward will depend on leadership, the CSA’s oversight, and global trends, making this a crucial period for the Canadian crypto market.

In a new announcement, Binance says that it is adding futures contracts for COOKIE , the utility token for the marketing finance (MarketingFi) ecosystem Cookie DAO, artificial intelligence (AI) focused project Alchemist AI ( ALCH ) and AI agent-related project Swarms ( SWARMS ). Amid the listing news, COOKIE surged by double percentage points. COOKIE is trading for $0.64 at time of writing, up 11.1% in the last 24 hours.

In a recent update from CLO Paul Grewal, the court, presided over by Judge Catherine Polk Failla has granted its request for an interlocutory appeal. This case borders on the charges filed by the US SEC that Coinbase facilitated the trading of crypto asset securities. The Coinbase Victory Against US SEC At a Glance According to Judge Failla, the request for interlocutory appeal from Coinbase is now granted. This decision marks a major deviation from an earlier rejection of the exchange’s argument that assets on its platform do not constitute investment contract. Following this order, the case will now proceed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals with proceedings set for January. Meanwhile, the exchange scored another major win against the U.S FDIC recently. The FDIC suit hinges on request for documents based on the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

The AI feature is expected to summarize news notifications but has sometimes fabricated news on its iPhones much to the displeasure of readers and news publishers. Among the inaccurate news alerts, the AI feature alleged that Rafael Nadal has come out as gay and that a man accused of killing a US insurance boss had shot himself. Apple will roll out updates in the coming weeks The influx of inaccurate news has let to Apple saying it will update its AI feature in order to avoid further inaccurate news posting. According to the tech giant, an update will be rolled out in the coming weeks to correct the malfunctioning one. Apple said it is developing a software update that will further clarify when news notifications were summaries generated by the company’s Intelligence system. The AI is meant to summarise breaking news notifications but has in some instances invented entirely false claims. Apple responded this week when it said it was working to clarify that summaries were AI-generated, despite the BBC being the first to complain to the tech giant about its journalism being misrepresented in December. The BBC was told by Alan Rusbridger the former editor of the Guardian that Apple needed to go further and pull a product he said was clearly not ready. “The technology was out of control and posed a considerable misinformation risk,” Rusbridger who also sits on Meta’s Oversight Board that reviews appeals of the company’s content moderation decisions added. “Trust in news is low enough already without giant American corporations coming in and using it as a kind of test product,” he added on BBC Radio Four . Apple’s faulty feature was one of the AI tools released to users of some newer iPhones in December, including the iPhone 16, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max handsets, as well as on some iPads and Macs. “Apple Intelligence features are in beta and we are continuously making improvements with the help of user feedback,” Apple said in a statement to the BBC. “A software update in the coming weeks will further clarify when the text being displayed is summarization provided by Apple Intelligence. We encourage users to report a concern if they view an unexpected notification summary,” the tech company added . Journalist groups show disgruntlement with Apple Last week, Apple’s AI inaccurately summarised BBC app notifications to claim that Luke Littler had won the PDC World Darts Championship hours before it began. In November, a ProPublica journalist highlighted erroneous Apple AI summaries of alerts from the New York Times app suggesting it had reported that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been arrested. A further inaccurate summary of a New York Times story appears to have been published on January 6, relating to the fourth anniversary of the Capitol Hill riots. One of the world’s largest unions for journalists, the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has voiced its concerns saying Apple “must act swiftly” and remove Apple Intelligence to cut on misinforming the public. NUJ echoed priors calls by another journalism body, Reporters Without Borders (RSF). “At a time where access to accurate reporting has never been more important, the public must not be placed in a position of second-guessing the accuracy of news they receive.” Laura Davison, NUJ general secretary. RSF also said that Apple’s intervention was not enough and joined calls for the product to be taken offline. Apple is not alone in having rolled out generative AI tools that can create text, images, and more content when prompted by users, but with varying results. Google’s AI overviews feature, which provides a written summary of information from results at the top of its search engine in response to user queries, faced criticism last year for producing some erratic responses. At the time a Google spokesperson said that these were isolated examples and that the feature was generally working well.

Amid this market downturn, Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest digital asset by market capitalization, has dropped by more than 5%. $293 Million of Crypto Liquidation This significant price decline brought BTC down from $102,060 to $96,865 within mere hours, causing liquidations worth $293 million in just four hours, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . However, the liquidations continue to rise, suggesting that this price decline may not stop here. Data further reveals that out of the $293 million in liquidations, more than 90% came from long positions, with $266.18 million worth of longs liquidated, while short liquidations amounted to $25.7 million. Besides BTC, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) experienced price drops of 7%, 6.2%, 8.5%, and 8%, respectively. Meanwhile, XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, appears to be moving against the market trend, showing a 1.5% upward momentum. Reason Behind the Crypto Crash You might be wondering why the crypto market is experiencing a sudden crash. The reason lies in a sharp increase in U.S. Treasury yields over the last 10 years. Today, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a report highlighting that the December Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the private sector was 54.1, higher than November’s 52.1. This data not only impacted the cryptocurrency market but also led to a sharp decline in U.S. equities due to inflation concerns.

It makes too much sense for them not to. And apparently I’m not the only one . As someone who's watched this space evolve, let me explain why Bitcoin Layer 2 foundations should listen to Molly and I. For years, bitcoin was known as ""digital rock""—a solid store of value but not much else. But now with the explosion of Bitcoin Layer 2s, bitcoin is becoming a ""programmable rock."" These layers are adding functionalities like smart contracts and scaling solutions, making bitcoin more versatile than ever. But here's the thing: these projects raise millions of dollars from VCs and investors, and most of that money ends up sitting in fiat currencies like USD. That's a huge mistake. Why? Because fiat is a melting ice cube. Every year, it loses 5-10% of its value due to inflation. The longer you hold it, the less it's worth. On the other hand, bitcoin has a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of around 70% . If these foundations held their treasury in bitcoin instead of fiat, their runway wouldn't just stay the same—it would grow. Imagine having 70% more resources each year to fund developers, grants, and projects. That's the kind of edge that could make or break a Layer 2 ecosystem. Okay, okay, I get it — Bitcoin is volatile, and these foundations need some stability. Because of this, keeping 3 to 4 years of runway in fiat makes sense. It would help to cover short-term needs. But the rest? It should be in bitcoin. Over the long run, this strategy could double or even triple the runway of these foundations, giving them the time and resources they need to succeed. There's a precedent for this too. Remember EOS ? They raised $4.2 billion in 2018 and reportedly bought 164,000 bitcoin with it. Today, that bitcoin is worth around $16 billion—even though EOS itself fell off the map. Now, imagine if Bitcoin Layer 2 foundations did the same but actually used their bitcoin to grow and sustain their ecosystem. The potential is massive. At the end of the day, these foundations are building on Bitcoin. They believe in its future, so why not hold it in their treasuries? Bitcoin is the best store of value out there. If you're running a Bitcoin Layer 2 foundation, stop holding depreciating fiat, and start holding bitcoin. It's not just a smart move—it's the move. This article is a Take .

The interest in the Ethereum-based tokens is attributed to the utility features offered to token holders. The team envisions the NFTs as a key component of the evolving R0AR DeFi ecosystem, which is being developed with a focus on community involvement. The reason for this community-centric approach comes from the team’s firm commitment to building a decentralized DeFi platform that adheres to the core pillars of Satoshi’s blockchain vision while providing users with clear interfaces, simple on and off-ramps, and high levels of security. The NFTs consist of six features that will be revealed either after all 10,000 tokens are minted or within 90 days of the launch. The delayed reveal is intended to ensure a fair and transparent minting process, preventing early participants from gaining an advantage. In addition, the mint has been designed to prevent sniping from the team or any insiders, meaning that the rarest NFTs in the collection will be randomly distributed, giving everyone the chance to purchase the most valuable of the 10,000 tokens. Over 27% Of R0AR NFTs Minted on First Day Interest in the ERS NFTs has been evident since the start of the mint. Over 27% of the supply was minted in the first 24 hours. During the public sale, the NFTs are traded for 0.014 ETH, with a limit of 25 tokens per wallet address. The R0AR token presale, which has raised $4 million, saw early participants added to a whitelist, allowing them to mint a couple of days prior to the public mint. The team sees this as the first of many rewards that will be available to OG members of the R0AR community. The surge in minting activity has potentially been caused by a combination of short and long-term factors. Some traders are looking to take advantage of the fair mint that gives everyone the same chance of ending up with the rarest tokens in the collection, while long-term investors believe that holding the NFTs from day one will be the best way to maximize crypto rewards. R0AR ERS NFTs and Future Crypto Rewards The Pudgy Penguin ($PENGU) airdrop has put the concept of dropping new tokens into NFT holder wallets into the spotlight, as the $PENGU token’s market cap has found support above $2 billion. Some early R0AR community members and NFT holders are positioning themselves to potentially benefit from similar airdrops in the future. The R0AR team has emphasized from the beginning that this type of utility aligns with their long-term vision, and the $PENGU drop has highlighted its significance within the NFT market. Other important features are expected to include access to the R0AR Portal, a research and analytics platform that provides valuable insights into various crypto projects. Additionally, NFT holders could potentially benefit from NFT staking opportunities, allowing them to earn rewards and contribute to the platform’s growth. Exclusive features within the DeFi ecosystem related to trading and staking are also anticipated. To learn more about the NFT collection and the OpenSea mint, users can visit the Executive R0AR Society Collection page. About R0AR R0AR is a decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem dedicated to building a comprehensive platform for blockchain-based financial services. Through its various components, including the Executive R0AR Society NFTs and R0AR token, the platform will give users access to token trading, staking, and exclusive DeFi rewards.

Selling for $0.07 apiece, this crypto AI project promises exponential gains to those who join the Presale early, presenting it as a no-brainer to the investing community. Here’s how much profit FTM and XLM investors stand to make from this mystery AI project in 2025. Fantom Signal Imminent Growth Amid Positive Metrics Despite a recent downturn in the FTM market, Fantom has captured significant interest from crypto investors. FTM fell 2.16% to $0.79 after getting hit by a bearish wave, but rising network activities and critical technical indicators hint at an incoming recovery, though challenges remain. FTM trades within a strait, with a key support level at $0.731 and resistance at $0.967. Breaking out of the identified resistance zone could catapult the coin’s price to the psychological $1.08 mark. On the other hand, sliding below the $0.731 support could push the price to even lower regions. A descending triangle on FTM’s price chart suggests a significant move that could attract volatility in the short term. Fantom’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is neutral at 50.37, making the upcoming session crucial to determine which direction the price will follow. In the meantime, FTM has experienced a 31.65% weekly loss, bringing its price down to $0.68. Stellar Positioned For a Decisive Breakout Between October and December 2024, Stellar’s XLM witnessed dynamic price movements and trading patterns usually influenced by domineering forces. Market data shows an explosive surge in XLM’s price from October to mid-November, accompanied by a dip. XLM is entering a consolidation phase around $0.34, with a key support level at $0.31 and resistance at $0.38. Bollinger bands spotlight the support and resistance levels. Earlier, Stellar saw a surge in trading volume, suggesting rising participation in the XLM market. However, TV has since dropped as the asset ventures into a consolidation phase, implying a reduction in market activities. Expectations are for XLM to either break above the $0.31 resistance level or below the $0.38 support zone. Whichever direction the price goes will determine the asset’s behaviour in the long term. XLM is down 10.52% this week, crashing to $0.34.

On the other hand, Shiba Inu (SHIB) records price increases, but shrinking trading volume raises concerns over long-term performance. Together, these projects highlight contrasting paths in a competitive market. While established players navigate challenges, IntelMarkets steps forward as a future-ready contender. Backed by its Rodeum AI infrastructure and cutting-edge solutions like the Quantum X Wallet and autonomous trading robots, IntelMarkets is positioned to lead in 2025. With a focus on AI integration and quantum-proofing, it’s shaping the next era of blockchain innovation. Near Protocol Rises Again as Presale Enthusiasm Takes Center Stage Near Protocol, renowned for its scalable and secure blockchain solutions, has gained renewed attention with its recent presale activity. With over 4% of its market cap traded in the last 24 hours and a trading volume increase of nearly 21%, the numbers paint a clear picture of growing participation. Industry analysts point to Near Protocol’s focus on data sovereignty and decentralized AI integration as key factors driving this interest. The partnership with NTT DATA, through Meta Pool’s Enterprise Node Operators (ENO) program, is another significant milestone. By onboarding one of the first global consulting firms to operate a validator node, Near Protocol bolsters its decentralization and scalability. On the technical front, Near Protocol’s efficient sharding mechanism continues to stand out, enabling smooth transaction handling even with high volumes. With a fully diluted valuation of over $7 billion and a circulating supply of nearly 1.2 billion tokens, the ecosystem is demonstrating resilience and scalability. Shiba Inu Grows in Price Traders Wonder if the Volume Got Lost Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen its price climb to approximately $0.00002407, with a market cap exceeding $14 billion. However, a decline of over 2.5% in trading volume raises concerns about the memecoin’s ability to sustain its current price levels. This disparity between price and participation suggests limited engagement despite its vast circulating supply of over 589 trillion tokens. The upcoming launch of the TREAT token aims to expand the Shiba Inu ecosystem with features like advanced yield farming and SHIB Pay. Designed as a governance and reward token, TREAT could provide new utility to SHIB holders. However, reports of scams exploiting the token’s name highlight the risks associated with pre-launch periods in community-driven projects. On the technical side, SHIB faces resistance at the 26-day exponential moving average, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) below 50, signaling a bearish sentiment. Without a boost in trading volume, SHIB risks falling toward $0.00002100, while bulls need to break above $0.00002552 to regain control. The next move will determine whether Shiba Inu can maintain its relevance or falter under selling pressure. IntelMarkets (INTL) Leads the AI Agent Revolution Setting New Trends for 2025 While others wrestle with diminishing trading volumes and fleeting presale appeal, IntelMarkets (INTL) is rewriting the rulebook. With its Rodeum AI infrastructure at the core, this blockchain powerhouse is bringing decentralized applications into a new era.

The Elon Musk inspired altcoin created a cycle of wealth which resulted in countless traders making millions. The currency also became the first example of internet money backed behind just a community. However, since then, Dogecoin has lost considerable steam. Even popular ambassadors like the Dogecoin Millionaire have publically lost millions on their DOGE holdings. In that changing market, traders are now embracing alternatives. One popular choice includes DTX Exchange, a hybrid altcoin that’s changing how crypto holders interact with traditional assets. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Forecast Dogecoin (DOGE) has disappointed holders in the past few months despite being the most loved memecoin. The doge-themed currency has shed over 30% of its value since hitting local top at $0.44 in 2024. Key reasons behind the decline are the shift to utility altcoins as traders search for projects with tangible value. Despite being fueled by a loyal community, DOGE price is facing a major challenge in the short term. The lack of practical features offered by altcoin put it at a significant disadvantage in the market. Additionally, with a market cap surpassing $50 Billion, the project might have already seen its best days. On the technical charts, DOGE price has some minor room for upside. With a weekly RSI of 62, Dogecoin could continue its bullish direction if market conditions remain consistent. However, at the same time, if you’re looking for the most upside this cycle, it could be worth exploring some other projects with much better growth potential. What’s Driving Demand for DTX Exchange Instead of DOGE Traders are picking DTX Exchange over established players like Dogecoin and Rexas Finance because of its groundbreaking technology. The utility altcoin has proven its worth in the market with practical products, and massive demand in the market. While DOGE has already turned from a startup project into a multi-billion market cap project, DTX Exchange is just getting started. The platform has already raised over $11.3 Million in its democratized presale that is allowing retail traders to get in early. Traders can get tokens at a considerable discount compared to the listing price of $0.20. If the project follows the trajectory of other proven platforms, it could even end up surging over $10 after listing. Additionally, DTX Exchange is set to offer a series of new upgrades this year including the live trading feature on the exchange. Users can already use the Phoenix Wallet to custody over 120,000 assets, making the platform a leading stakeholder in the crypto world. So make sure you check out the presale and become an early adopter of the ecosystem. Early adopters are expected to get benefits like passive income, profit shares, and governance rights. With the market trending towards a bullish direction, DTX Exchange could be set to become one of the most promising ecosystems in the market.

38665779,https://coingape.com/?p=232423,1736278143,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Analyst Predicts XRP Price Breakout To $3, Here’s When",https://coingape.com/analyst-predicts-xrp-price-breakout-to-3-heres-when/,"Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has provided a bullish outlook for the XRP price despite its recent pullback. The analyst predicted that XRP could record a price breakout to $3 this month. XRP Price Breakout To $3 Could Happen This Month In an X post , Mikybull Crypto stated that the XRP price is imminent as the chart looks ready. His accompanying chart showed that the price breakout to this target could happen this month. The chart also showed that XRP could rally to $3.2, continue its uptrend, and reach the Fib 1.618 level at $3.7. This could ultimately pave the way for the crypto to reach its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.84. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the coin. He stated that XRP/BTC is just a few percent away from his local downside target, where he expects a bounce and continuation up. The crypto analyst added that this means that the Bitcoin price would need to experience a pullback quickly if XRP is to drop to earlier entry points. If not, it will just rip up from here. A Pullback To $2 Is Still On The Cards Crypto analyst CasiTrades predicted that the XRP price could still witness a pullback to as low as $2 before a continuation of the uptrend. The analyst stated she is growing more confident in the E wave, targeting the bottom support at $2.08. The analyst further remarked that the Ewave down aligns closely with BTC forming a C wave down. She added that the top trendline was recently tested and met with resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is forming a bearish trend, indicating downside momentum is building. However, in the long term, CasiTrades is still bullish on XRP’s future trajectory. Despite how bearish the RSI currently is, she noted that the coin could witness a bounce to between $3.35 and $3.37. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s analysis also showed XRP could enjoy a 470% rally. Analyst Reaffirms $27 Price Prediction In a recent X post, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto reaffirmed his $27 XRP price prediction. He stated that XRP will hit Fib 1.414 and Fib 2.0, converging around $13. When that rally happens, the analyst stated there will likely be a deep retracement, which could send XRP to around the $4 range. Egrag Crypto then predicted that the price could start the final surge to $27.

He accused the outgoing Biden administration of leaving behind an ‘economic mess,’ pointing to persistent inflation and the Fed’s aggressive monetary policies as key culprits. “We’re inheriting a difficult situation,” Trump said. “Inflation is still raging, and interest rates are far too high. They’re trying to make it even harder for us to fix this.” This only intensifies our expectations of a clash with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose rate policies have pushed borrowing costs to their highest levels in decades. Inflation cools, but borrowing costs still sting The Federal Reserve raised interest rates to a 20-year high between March 2022 and July 2023 as inflation soared to a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. While the Fed succeeded in bringing inflation down to 2.7% year-over-year in November 2024, it’s still above the central bank’s 2% target. At the same time, Americans are grappling with the consequences of those hikes. Mortgage rates have surged past 8%, while the 10-year Treasury yield has surged to 4.7%. This has left many wondering whether the Fed has lost control of its playbook. Historically, interest rates tend to drop during a Fed rate-cutting cycle. Yet, since the central bank began cutting rates in September 2024, long-term rates have moved in the opposite direction, climbing an unprecedented 110 basis points. Analysts are calling this a “market rebellion,” with investors essentially challenging the Fed’s ability to control inflation without triggering broader economic pain. For borrowers, the situation is bleak. Treasury auctions this week underscore the appetite for debt: $58 billion in three-year notes went on sale Monday, followed by $39 billion in reopened 10-year notes on Tuesday—the largest since 2007. Another $22 billion in 30-year bonds is set to follow. Corporations are also rushing to secure funding before market conditions worsen, taking advantage of narrow credit spreads and high investor demand. Despite these challenges, Trump has since made it clear he isn’t planning to fire Powell, whom he described as “political” during his campaign. Powell’s term doesn’t end until 2026, and he’s publicly said that he won’t resign even if Trump asks. “I made a lot of money, so I should have at least a say in monetary policy,” Trump believes. Politicians rake in massive gains while retail investors struggle While ordinary Americans feel the pinch of rising rates, members of Congress are cashing in. Stock trading by lawmakers outperformed the S&P 500 in 2024, with Democrats gaining an average of 31% and Republicans posting 26% gains. For context, the S&P 500 rose 24% during the same period, leaving retail investors in the dust. According to JPMorgan data, the average retail investor saw returns of just 3.7% last year, with many ending the year in the red. At least five members of Congress posted gains exceeding 100%, with Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio surging by 71% thanks to heavy investments in tech stocks. Meanwhile, hedge funds struggled to keep up, with only two major funds—DE Shaw (+36.1%) and Bridgewater China (+35%)—outperforming Congress. Democrats, in particular, have doubled down on tech. Nearly half of their portfolios are concentrated in technology stocks, with financial services trailing far behind at 13.4%. Republicans, on the other hand, are more diversified, favoring energy, consumer cyclicals, and financials alongside tech. But Trump plans to ban Congress from stock trading once and for all the moment he’s back in the Oval. Stagflation fears and the fight against the Fed Economists are now warning of stagflation—where high inflation combines with sluggish growth—as market dynamics change. Gold prices are up 29% since March, while the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has climbed to its highest level since late 2022. These two assets rarely rise together, but the unusual pairing means that markets are bracing for the return of inflation. “This move in long-term rates can’t be ignored,” Trump said. “Markets are fighting the Fed at a historic pace, and inflation is being priced back in.” The situation is eerily reminiscent of the dot-com bubble, with rate movements defying historical trends. Analysts are calling this an unprecedented “Fed versus market” showdown, with the stakes higher than ever. Borrowers are flooding debt markets to lock in funding before conditions worsen. Europe’s bond market has already set records, while Wall Street is eyeing a potential $200 billion January issuance, which would be the largest in history. Pension funds and insurers, flush with cash, are eager to secure high yields despite rising risks. This demand has driven corporate bond spreads to 30-year lows, creating a rare window of opportunity for issuers. Meanwhile, the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to meet again at the end of the month, just as Trump takes office. All eyes will be on Powell and his team as they tell us everything they want us to believe about the US economy.

According to technical analysis by crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA), Dogecoin is currently locked in a battle with a key resistance level defined by the macro 0.5 Fibonacci extension, which could determine whether the price can break through to higher levels above $0.4 or face renewed selling pressure. Moment Of Truth At Macro 0.5 Fibonacci Extension Resistance The Fibonacci extension indicator is a popular tool among technical analysts to identify price targets and resistance levels. In the case of Dogecoin, crypto analyst Kevin made use of this Fibonacci extension projected from the cryptocurrency’s low of around $0.15 in the middle of October. For Dogecoin, the macro 0.5 Fib extension represents a significant barrier that has held back upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gaussian Channel Turns Green On The 4-Hour Chart, Why A New ATH Above $1 Is Imminent This 0.5 Fib extension is also notable, considering that it is situated around an order block during Dogecoin’s most recent correction. Crypto analyst Kevin highlighted this resistance level as a “moment of truth,” emphasizing that a successful breach of this level is critical for DOGE to aim for the macro golden pocket. Considering recent market dynamics, Dogecoin’s ability to overcome this resistance will likely hinge on broader market movements, particularly on Bitcoin’s performance. #Dogecoin is in an all out battle with the macro 0.5 Fib extension. This is big resistance and is the key to make it back up to the macro golden pocket. #DOGE success here is going to fully depend on #BTC ability to breakout of its macro golden pocket. Moment of truth folks. pic.twitter.com/vWtfpVahv1 — Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) January 6, 2025 Bitcoin’s Role in Dogecoin’s Price Momentum Bitcoin, as the dominant cryptocurrency, mostly always sets the tone for the broader market, including other large market-cap altcoins like Dogecoin. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s inflows and its latest break above the $100,000 price level again in the past 24 hours have flowed into other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? Kevin noted this correlation between Dogecoin and Bitcoin, highlighting that Dogecoin’s movement into its macro golden pocket will depend on Bitcoin’s ability to break out of its own macro golden pocket. If Bitcoin manages to break out of its golden pocket, it could provide the momentum needed for Dogecoin to conquer its 0.5 Fibonacci resistance. However, a failure by Bitcoin could leave Dogecoin vulnerable to further consolidation or even another retracement downwards. The golden pocket refers to a specific range within the Fibonacci extension levels, typically the area between the 0.618 and 0.65 Fib extension levels. When referred to as a macro golden pocket, it indicates that the Fibonacci indicator is being applied to a larger time frame, such as weekly or monthly charts, and is on long-term price movements. In an earlier analysis, Kevin identified $0.49 as the “macro golden pocket.” Furthermore, he noted that this level is the first major resistance zone that Dogecoin bulls must push above for a bullish breakout. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.39, up by 25.5% in the past seven days.

Bittensor has seen a 30% increase in price over the past three days, showing strong growth potential. However, experts warn that if the price drops below $400, it could signal a bearish shift. On the other hand, Atua.ai and Bitgert have teamed up to integrate AI solutions into Bitgert’s decentralised platform to expand their presence in the Web3 ecosystem. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is reshaping the Web3 e-commerce market with its decentralized platform. Web3Bay allows users to buy and sell digital assets, enjoy reduced transaction fees, and participate in governance, all via its 3BAY token, currently in presale. With its expected launch price of $0.195, early buyers could see an impressive 6430% return on investment. Bittensor Trends as its Price Surges Bittensor trends have shown a 30% price increase in three days, indicating strong buying interest. The price has broken through the 200-day EMA, with bullish signals from candlestick patterns and RSI divergence pointing to potential gains. If Bittensor trends continue upward, analysts predict the price could surpass $1000. However, the market is still volatile, and if the price falls below $400, it could shift to a bearish trend. While current Bittensor trends suggest potential growth, analysts recommend caution. Atua.ai & Bitgert Aim to Enhance Web3 Ecosystem with AI Atua.ai, an AI platform for digital business, has teamed up with Bitgert, a decentralized crypto platform, to enhance the Web3 ecosystem. This partnership brings AI-driven solutions to Bitgert's crypto services, improving trading tools and user experience. Through this collaboration, Atua.ai users gain seamless access to a wide range of digital assets, boosting adoption. Additionally, Bitgert’s global reach opens new markets for Atua.ai, offering more opportunities for growth in industries like education, advertising, and entertainment. This alliance positions both companies for stronger brand presence and expansion within the web3 ecosystem. Web3Bay: Empowering Users with True Ownership Web3Bay is redefining e-commerce by giving users true ownership and governance. Built on layer-1 blockchain technology, it allows users to control their data and buy or sell digital assets while shaping the platform’s future. Unlike centralized platforms, Web3Bay allows users to vote on key decisions using the 3BAY token. This community-driven approach ensures the platform develops according to the needs of its users, fostering transparency and trust. Another key benefit of Web3Bay is lower transaction fees. By cutting out intermediaries, the platform reduces the fees typically charged by centralized e-commerce sites. This makes it easier for small businesses to thrive, creating a truly borderless marketplace where users can buy and sell digital assets at lower costs. Web3Bay also rewards active users through the 3BAY token. Users can earn rewards for participating in transactions, staking, and engaging with the platform, helping to build a loyal and active community. Additionally, Web3Bay caters to both crypto users and newcomers by supporting mainstream payment methods like PayPal. This bridges the gap between traditional Web2 commerce and the decentralized Web3 ecosystem, broadening its appeal. The 3BAY token is currently in presale, making impressive strides and raising over $460,000. The token is priced at $0.0039675 in its third stage. With an expected launch price of $0.1959, the token offers the potential for a 6430% ROI for users who join the presale early. Given Web3Bay’s potential to transform real-world applications, the token’s value is looking at sharp growth, signalling great returns for holders. Final Thoughts Recent Bittensor trends indicate potential growth, but analysts recommend caution due to market volatility. At the same time, Atua.ai and Bitgert have partnered up to enhance the Web3 ecosystem with AI-driven solutions. However, Web3Bay is already making significant strides in the Web3 space, as it emerges as the most exciting new opportunity, offering investors a community-driven, low-fee platform that bridges Web2 and Web3 commerce. With its 3BAY token currently priced at $0.0039675, now is the ideal time to buy the token to join the Web3Bay ecosystem and benefit from major returns in the future.

In an interview with CNN Prima News , Michl stated he was considering acquiring “a few Bitcoin” for diversification, though it would not constitute a major investment for the bank. The CNB board, composed of seven members, would need to approve any decision to acquire Bitcoin. Janis Aliapulios, an adviser to the board, clarified that the bank currently has no plans to invest in Bitcoin. “To sum up, CNB is now not considering buying crypto assets for its reserves. However, Governor Michl did not rule out further future debate on this topic,” Aliapulios told Cointelegraph . The bank will continue its diversification efforts through increased gold purchases, with plans to raise gold holdings to 5% of total assets by 2028, Aliapulios added. Bitcoin’s robust returns have made it an attractive potential reserve asset alongside gold. Over the past year, Bitcoin prices surged over 131%, compared to gold’s 30% rise, according to TradingView data. Michl’s comments indicate a growing trend among governments and institutions reassessing financial strategies to include Bitcoin. Anndy Lian, blockchain expert and author, remarked, “As more countries ponder this path, we might see a gradual redefinition of what constitutes a ‘safe’ reserve asset. If Bitcoin becomes a staple in national reserves, it could fundamentally alter the landscape of global finance, pushing for more decentralized and digital approaches to economic stability.” However, Lian also noted Bitcoin’s price volatility could be a “double-edged sword” for national reserves, potentially causing financial fluctuations. In the United States, Bitcoin’s status as a savings technology continues to gain traction. The Bitcoin Act, proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, advocates for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, further advancing its recognition as a reserve asset.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 19:34:00

Analyst Explained,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-the-us-china-trade-war-benefit-bitcoin-analyst-explained/,"Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies towards China could provide a significant boost to Bitcoin, according to market analysts. With plans for higher tariffs on imports from China and increasing economic pressure on the world's second-largest economy, Bitcoin is set to benefit. The Chinese yuan has been under significant pressure, falling to a 16-month low earlier this week, with analysts predicting further devaluations in the coming months, creating a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s growth. David Brickell, head of international distribution at FRNT Financial, draws parallels with the yuan devaluation in 2015, when bitcoin prices tripled in a short period of time. “The depreciation of the yuan will accelerate capital flight out of China,” Brickell said. “Bitcoin will be an obvious target for some of these flows, particularly with capital controls in place making it difficult to move funds out of China through traditional channels.” Related News: Analytics Company Researcher Says “I'm Not Buying Right Now” Despite Bitcoin's Decline, Explains Why Other analysts are equally optimistic about Bitcoin’s future during Trump’s presidency, with research firms Bernstein and Standard Chartered predicting that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025, while 10x Research predicts the cryptocurrency could rise to $120,000 by Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. The optimism stems from Trump’s campaign promises and key appointments. He made several pro-crypto promises during his campaign and nominated crypto-friendly figures to influential positions, including Paul Atkins as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission and David Sacks as chief artificial intelligence and crypto officer. Trump’s proposed tariffs compound China’s economic woes, including stagnant growth and a continuing housing downturn. In September, Beijing announced a $284 billion stimulus package, the biggest since the pandemic, to combat those challenges. But efforts to reassure international investors this week have done little to halt the yuan’s slide as Chinese regulators scramble to stabilize the currency, as reported by the Financial Times. *This is not investment advice.

The agreement provides CAD $25 million (about $17.4 million) in an unsecured, revolving credit facility that Sol Strategies will exclusively use to buy Solana ( SOL ) tokens. “I’m making this capital available to Sol Strategies because of how deeply I believe in both the corporate strategies and Solana itself,” Guoga said in a statement.

Sol Strategies is targeting opportunities across decentralized finance, validator operations, and liquidity provision. Guoga reiterated this strategy in a post on X, noting that the company will leverage the facility to grow its business. This includes expanding its SOL holdings, acquiring more validators, and securing liquidity to tap into other opportunities. Sol Strategies’ chief executive officer, Leah Wald, also commented on the agreement, highlighting that the company evaluated other financing options before settling on this facility. As for the investment plan, Wald noted: “Our staking strategy is tremendously successful, and we are confident that our expanded position in Solana will generate substantial returns for our shareholders while supporting the continued growth of the Solana ecosystem.” Sol Strategies can tap into the revolving credit any time up to January 6, 2027.

In addition, Judge Failla ruled that the district court proceedings will be paused while the appeal is considered. This decision is significant because it goes against an earlier ruling where the exchange’s argument that its assets are not investment contracts was rejected. The case will now move to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in January.

Behnam’s departure comes as the commission battles Kalshi over the regulator’s ban on political betting contracts, highlighting regulatory challenges in emerging financial markets. During his tenure, Behnam established himself as a staunch advocate for cryptocurrency oversight. His most notable achievement was securing a $4.3 billion settlement with crypto exchange Binance over regulatory violations. Behnam pushed for expanded CFTC authority over digital assets, arguing for clearer regulatory frameworks in congressional testimonies. Under his leadership, the agency intensified enforcement actions against crypto firms operating outside regulatory boundaries. The White House has not yet nominated a successor. Behnam’s exit raises questions about the future direction of digital asset regulation and the commission’s stance on novel financial products. Last January, Behnam said he was worried the then-recent approval of spot market Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would “magnify” the issues surrounding digital asset markets. According to Behnam , the goal of his enforcement actions was always to protect investors. “Without a regulatory framework, without that transparency, without those tools that we typically use as regulators, you are going to continue to see this fraud and manipulation. And putting aside the legitimacy and where this technology may go and what role it might play in our economy and commerce, the internet, digital assets generally… we just have to think about things from a regulatory and consumer protection standpoint. And I think that needs to be our guiding light in terms of driving this conversation, filling these regulatory gaps and creating this framework that’s ultimately going to protect American investors.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The head of the crypto asset manager Bitwise says on the social media platform X that investors may see a lot more companies adopting Bitcoin as a corporate strategy this year. “A major theme in 2025 is going to be the arrival of corporates: Bitcoin Standard Corporations. There are many private companies like Bitwise Investments that hold Bitcoin on the balance sheet as well. Exciting to see.” He also cites a report by crypto investor HODL15Capital that shows companies already holding Bitcoin are continuing to accumulate more BTC. He notes that the largest publicly-traded corporate holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, could offer companies a roadmap on how they could accumulate the top digital asset. “11 publicly-traded companies bought more Bitcoin since [December 30th, 2024] according to HODL15Capital. 2025 is going to see a lot of corporations joining the Bitcoin standard. [MicroStrategy founder Michael] Saylor has written the playbook for a movement.” Source: HODL15Capital/X Horsley also believes 2025 may bring about an explosion of tokenized small businesses that are focused on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) agents. “I think AI may lead to an explosion of companies and tokenized companies. The theory: A single person can use AI to make a much more niche version of a software service. For example, mobile-only CRM (customer relationship management) for independent electricians that need to conform to California laws. This can better serve long-tail markets. This could lead to an explosion of new ‘micro’/niche companies, that maybe do $100,000-$1 million a year. The creator could tokenize the company and in doing so gain two benefits: (A) pull forward the earnings, (B) allow customers to become shareholders and advocates. AI could massively increase the number of niche businesses. These could never go public, but could tokenize. It could be a major new long-tail capital market.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The firm has recently secured registration as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) from the Central Bank of Ireland. The firm’s Europe arm is now authorized to offer crypto trading and custodian wallet services in the fast-growing European market through this approval. This move cements HashKey’s growing reputation as a trusted and compliant player in the crypto industry. HashKey In Ireland: A Strategic Gateway to Europe The Central Bank of Ireland’s VASP registration is highly sought after by global crypto firms looking to establish a foothold in Europe. For HashKey, securing this license does not just represent a regulatory checkbox. It is a calculated move to access the European Union’s vast market under Ireland’s robust legal framework. Ireland’s burgeoning fintech sector and progressive stance on digital assets have made it a natural choice for global crypto firms. By planting its flag in Ireland, the Asia-based company positions itself to meet the growing demand for secure and regulated crypto services across Europe. This license allows the firm to compete with industry leaders like Coinbase, Crypto.com , and Gemini, which also have VASP registration in Ireland . The Track Record of Licensing Excellence HashKey Group’s reputation for compliance and innovation extends well beyond Ireland. The company has secured crypto-related licenses in some of the most regulated markets. This includes Singapore, Japan, and Bermuda amongst. Notably, in 2023, HashKey Exchange became one of the first platforms to earn a license under Hong Kong’s stringent new licensing regime . The company was greenlighted to offer retail crypto trading in the region. This pioneering spirit is further demonstrated by the launch of its Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, HashKey Chain. The network, which went live on the mainnet in Decembe r, was designed to improve scalability and lower transaction costs. This innovation strengthens its ecosystem, supporting decentralized applications (dApps) and asset tokenization. HashKey’s Expansive Ecosystem HashKey Group has built a wide range of services to meet the different needs of the crypto market. A key ecosystem component is HashKey Exchange, a licensed platform that allows regular users and businesses to trade cryptocurrencies. HashKey Capital is the company’s venture capital arm, investing in new blockchain projects and ideas. HashKey Global works to grow the company’s reach in international markets. HashKey OTC handles large crypto transactions directly between buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, HashKey Cloud offers secure cloud solutions powered by blockchain technology. Finally, HashKey Tokenization helps turn traditional assets into digital tokens, connecting traditional finance with blockchain. This diversified approach not only strengthens the exchange’s presence in the market. It also ensures its continued relevance across multiple sectors in the fast-changing crypto landscape.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin’s 17,250% surge and IntelMarkets’ $5.8M presale spark excitement, hinting at a transformative crypto future. Table of Contents IntelMarkets introduces the new crypto trading frontier The Dogecoin phenomenon: A 17,250% surge in 2024 Conclusion: Recently, two noteworthy events have captured attention in the cryptocurrency market: the remarkable 17,250% surge in the Dogecoin price and IntelMarkets’ presale, which successfully raised over $5.8 million. The cryptocurrency community is very excited about these two events, and with good cause. 2024 was a very noteworthy year for DOGE; its price shot up tremendously. Now, with IntelMarkets offering something fresh and innovative for crypto traders, many believe the next big rise could be on the horizon. IntelMarkets introduces the new crypto trading frontier IntelMarkets (INTL) is ready to take on a new challenge: redefine the art of trading in the crypto space. Designed on a dual-chain architecture both on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, IntelMarkets is built to scale and to be flexible for the traders. By utilizing advanced artificial intelligence and fusing it with decentralized technology, the platform has had a significant influence. A high-efficiency trading platform is the end product, providing retail traders with an equal opportunity to compete with enterprise giants and make whale-sized profits. IntelMarkets is still in its early stages, but its continuing presale has already raised over $5.8 million, indicating strong interest. The Intelli-Array technical analysis tool, one of INTL’s unparalleled AI features, assists traders in taking advantage of slippage gaps between various exchanges. In order to guarantee the security of digital assets, the platform is also developing the first Quantum-Proof wallet in history. It’s possible that INTL will reach $0.30 prior to its CEX IPO. The integration with Quantum X Wallet will allow INTL users to benefit from a highly secure, user-friendly wallet solution for managing their digital assets. This collaboration will also enhance trust and confidence in INTL’s offerings, making it an even more attractive choice for both individual and institutional users. Unlike other platforms that limit traders to a single blockchain, IntelMarkets gives the ability to choose between Ethereum and Solana, giving more freedom and opportunities to optimize their strategies. Be it a seasoned pro who thrives on high leverage or a beginner, IntelMarkets has something for everyone. Its fast execution and diverse asset pairs make it a go-to platform for all levels of expertise. The Dogecoin phenomenon: A 17,250% surge in 2024 Dogecoin (DOGE) is based on the well-known “Doge” Internet meme. Because Dogecoin was based on a dog joke, its developers envisioned it as a playful cryptocurrency that would appeal to a wider range of users than just the core Bitcoin audience. Currently, the Dogecoin price is around $0.38, with a market cap of over $57 billion. Dogecoin tops the list in talking about a meme coin success story. The value of the Dogecoin price increased to 17,250% till 2024. The Dogecoin price history perfectly represents the power of meme coins. Once considered a “fun” cryptocurrency, DOGE has grown into a bullish coin. Conclusion: The Dogecoin price had a spectacular rise in 2024 proves that the market is ready for new and exciting opportunities. With platforms like IntelMarkets offering advanced trading features like QuantumX Wallet it could be the next big thing. If IntelMarkets can build upon its presale success and deliver on its promises, it could very well be the next big crypto to watch. The future is looking promising especially for IntelMarkets and it’s time for interested investors to get in early before the next big wave hits.

In a blog post published on Jan 5, Buterin suggested that limiting global computing resources by up to 99% for one to two years could provide humanity with crucial time to prepare for the emergence of superintelligent AI systems. He stressed that such measures should only be taken if less restrictive options, like holding AI developers liable for damages, fail. “The goal would be to have the capability to reduce worldwide available compute by ~90-99% for 1-2 years at a critical period, to buy more time for humanity to prepare,” he writes. “The value of 1-2 years should not be overstated: a year of ‘wartime mode’ can easily be worth a hundred years of work under conditions of complacency.” To continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io",,EN,0,0,ETH,"{'name': 'The Defiant', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/101/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thedefiant,2025-01-07 19:47:03

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 19:50:00

Judge Katherine Polk Failla has granted the crypto exchange an interlocutory appeal, which lets the company take its case to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. What does that mean? It means Coinbase can challenge the SEC’s claims that it’s breaking federal securities laws by running an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer, and by selling unregistered securities through its staking program. For now, the district court case? Completely on hold. This decision comes after months of legal wrangling. Coinbase has been under fire, with the SEC accusing it of running operations that allegedly violate both the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933. But Coinbase has been saying their platform doesn’t fall under these laws, and now they have a chance to make their case to a higher court. Coinbase goes after SEC’s legal playbook A March 2024 ruling by Judge Failla was a mixed bag for Coinbase. She didn’t buy all of the SEC’s arguments, but she also didn’t dismiss everything Coinbase asked her to. The SEC has been pushing the claim that Coinbase’s operations, including its staking services, involve the sale of unregistered securities. Coinbase, though, argues that these services don’t meet the legal definition of a security, especially under the infamous Howey test—the same test the SEC has been slapping on every crypto project in sight. This appeal is a big deal. If the Second Circuit sides with Coinbase, it could completely change the trajectory of the case. Judge Failla herself admitted that an interlocutory appeal could “materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” Over the strenuous objection of @SECGov , Judge Failla has GRANTED our motion for leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal and STAYED the district court litigation. We appreciate the Court's careful consideration. On to the Second Circuit we go. pic.twitter.com/FuZ2jcYvfF — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) January 7, 2025 Translation: this appeal could kill most of the SEC’s case. Coinbase says that 75% of the SEC’s claims hinge on allegations tied to the Securities Exchange Act. If those get thrown out, what’s left? Just the SEC’s beef with Coinbase’s staking program. Now, why did Judge Failla say yes to the appeal? Because dragging this out in the lower court while the Second Circuit is already dealing with similar cases (like Ripple’s) would be a waste of everyone’s time. She pointed out that the SEC’s claims involve complex issues that deserve clarity—and fast. SEC worries about piecemeal appeals The SEC, of course, isn’t thrilled. They’ve been arguing that letting Coinbase appeal now could lead to a fragmented legal mess. They’re worried about multiple rounds of litigation, especially if the Second Circuit sends some claims back while Coinbase keeps appealing others. But Judge Failla didn’t see it that way. She called the SEC’s concerns “not unwarranted” but said that the potential for a Second Circuit reversal outweighs any risks of inefficiency. And then there’s the Major Questions Doctrine, which Coinbase has been waving like a flag. This legal argument says that regulatory agencies like the SEC can’t make sweeping economic rules without clear authorization from Congress. The SEC thinks Coinbase will resurrect this argument during the appeal. Judge Failla acknowledged the possibility but shrugged it off, emphasizing that the real issue here is getting clarity on securities law. Discovery chaos on hold for now Let’s talk about discovery, the pretrial phase where both sides gather evidence. It’s been a nightmare. Judge Failla has already extended the discovery deadlines twice because the process has been so messy. The SEC wants to dig into the ecosystems of 12 crypto tokens it named in its complaint, but that’s turning into a logistical black hole. Coinbase argued that pushing forward with discovery while the appeal is pending would be a waste of resources, and Judge Failla agreed. Here’s the thing though. By granting the appeal and pausing the case, the court is basically hitting pause on a ton of legal drama. Judge Failla described this decision as necessary to prevent “hardship” and maintain an “even balance.” In plain terms, she’s saying it’s better for everyone to wait and see what the Second Circuit decides before sinking more time and money into this. The SEC wasn’t happy about this either. They tried to argue that the March 2024 ruling had already narrowed the scope of the case and that pressing forward wouldn’t be a huge burden. But Judge Failla pointed out that if the Second Circuit overturns her earlier rulings, it could completely reshape the case, making any discovery done now irrelevant.

According to Whale Alert, a blockchain analytics platform, more than 1.6 trillion SHIB tokens, worth about $39 million, were transferred from Crypto.com to anonymous wallets. This has led to concerns as to whether there is a possibility of further upward surge for the popular meme cryptocurrency. Large Transactions Hint at Accumulation Activity In the last 24 hours there were several transactions with Shiba Inu, the largest one was the transfer of 1,636,940,000,000 SHIB tokens. These transactions were made from Crypto.com to private wallets whose addresses are unknown which is a typical behavior of ‘whales’. Although Crypto.com is not usually involved in the Shiba Inu ecosystem on a large scale, moving funds to private wallets is usually linked to accumulation by major investors. This whale move follows increased anticipation brought by the Treat Token launch which has sparked potential of a rally to SHIB price new ATH. Historically, similar measures are typically viewed as a signal for the price hike since they reflect the investors’ optimism. The SHIB price is currently at $0.00002196, which is a 9% decline in the past 24 hours, with a 39% surge in trading volume. Spike in Whale Inflows Signals Increased Interest According to IntoTheBlock, the Large Holders Inflow indicator, which measures wallets containing at least 0.1% of the SHIB token supply, increased. About 492.81 billion SHIB tokens were transferred to the wallets of whales in the same period, which marked an increase from the previous period. This inflow was accompanied by reduced outflows from these wallets of 382.94 billion SHIB, giving a net flow of about 109.87 billion SHIB. The accumulation by large holders intensifies the speculation of Shiba Inu price surge especially when whale activity tends to indicate changes in the market. Despite these moves, recent analysis has stirred speculations of Shiba Inu price never hitting $1. Shiba Inu Price Forms Bullish Patterns on Weekly Charts Shiba Inu price may be about to break out, according to technical analysis. Technical analysts have observed a cup-and-handle formation on the weekly chart, a technical pattern that signifies a potential increase in the price. An analyst known as “Strong” estimated that the SHIB price may surge to $0.000066651 if the token manages to break through the resistance level. Such a price trend can be seen in the token’s recovery to $0.00003329 in December from where it corrected to $0.0000186. SHIB has also retained its position as the largest ERC-20 token in terms of market capitalization further increasing its potential for growth. At the same time, market analysts have put forward quite optimistic price predictions for Shiba Inu in the current cycle. According to Javon Marks, a crypto market analyst, Shiba Inu price has recently broke above a long-term resistance trendline. As stated by Marks, a close above $0.00002 opens the path for even more SHIB price appreciation in 2025. According to Marks, the short term price target to look for is $0.000081 which is inline with the resistance zones seen in previous cycles. For the current bull market, he put the potential top at $0.000155. On the other hand, another analyst named Rose Premium noted a descending channel on the daily chart, and if the momentum continues, the price is expected to reach $0.00003236, $0.00003870, and $0.00004349.

Analytics Company Explains the Cause of Price Pressure,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-this-why-bitcoin-price-cant-break-a-new-record-analytics-company-explains-the-cause-of-price-pressure/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has flagged a potential concern for Bitcoin by pointing to a recent change in behavior among short-term wallets (STH). The firm stated in its statement that short-term investors who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days are increasingly selling their BTC, and if this trend continues, it could affect the BTC price. Alphractal’s analysis focuses on the “Accumulation and STH Distribution” metric, which tracks the inflow and outflow of Bitcoin from addresses held by short-term investors. Daily changes in this metric indicate a growing interest among these investors to sell their Bitcoin. “When analyzing the monthly change, it is clear how the STH supply moves in waves of accumulation and distribution, which is strongly correlated with Bitcoin’s price action,” Alphractal said. The firm noted that interest in accumulating Bitcoin has been steadily decreasing since December 5, which has put downward pressure on the BTC price. Related News: After Binance's Announcement, the AI Altcoin Whales are Active - Here are the Altcoins They Bought and Sold While Alphractal cautioned against overreacting to the current trend, it did acknowledge the sentiment-driven nature of the metric. “This does not preclude Bitcoin from rallying again in the future, as we saw in 2021,” the statement said. However, the firm noted that current behavior suggests many investors are motivated to take profits at current price levels, which could hinder any short-term price appreciation. The trend of distribution among short-term holders could be cautious for Bitcoin’s near-term prospects, especially if it gains momentum. However, as Alphractal noted, the metric is not decisive and could shift back toward accumulation, especially if market conditions improve or longer-term bullish factors come into play. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) has been showing strong performance lately. In the past week, its price rose by 6.07%, indicating renewed investor interest. While there was a slight dip of 0.53% over the past month, the six-month gain stands at an impressive 70.69%. This long-term upward trend highlights Bitcoin’s resilience and growing adoption. The current price ranges between $93,442 and $101,009, nearing the nearest resistance level at $103,706. Breaking this resistance could lead to an additional increase of about 2.67%. The next target would be the second resistance at $111,273, which is approximately 10% higher than current prices. The 10-day simple moving average of $99,019.91 is above the 100-day average of $97,553.03, suggesting positive momentum. Technical indicators support a bullish outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 63.10, below the overbought threshold, indicating room for further growth. The MACD level stands at 358.91, reinforcing the upward trend. However, if the price faces downward pressure, the nearest support level at $88,572 could provide stability, representing a potential decrease of around 12% from current levels. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has shown notable activity lately. Over the past week, its price rose by 8.70%, pointing to a short-term upward trend. Despite this, the past month saw a decrease of 9.03%, indicating some market volatility. Over six months, ETH’s price increased by 18.82%, reflecting strong growth in the longer term. Currently, ETH trades between $3399 and $3772. The nearest resistance level is at $3909. Surpassing this could lead to the next resistance at $4282, marking a potential rise of about 14% from the current price. On the other hand, the nearest support level sits at $3163. Falling to this point would mean a drop of approximately 7% from the current range. If the price dips further, the second support is at $2790. Technical indicators offer mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 51.08, showing a neutral market stance. The Stochastic oscillator is at 39.34, slightly tilting toward oversold conditions. The MACD level of 7.89 suggests possible bullish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $3654.57, above the 100-day SMA of $3569.35, which may indicate a positive trend.

According to Offchain Labs, the developer behind Arbitrum, the grant cements Arbitrum as the main blockchain infrastructure provider for Caliverse, Lotte's metaverse gaming platform. Offchain Labs shared the news at CES 2025, the technology tradeshow happening this week in Las Vegas, Nevada. A representative for the company declined to disclose the exact size of the grant ""at this stage."" It was technically awarded by the non-profit Arbitrum Foundation, which periodically doles out grants in $ARB tokens to help spur development in the Arbitrum ecosystem. ""Lotte is Arbitrum Foundation's largest grant recipient to date. And we're proud to be working with partners so closely aligned with our vision,"" said John Park, Head of Korea at The Arbitrum Foundation. Lotte's Arbitrum integration could signal renewed interest from traditional companies in building blockchain-based virtual worlds—the ""metaverse"" concept that earned mainstream buzz a few years ago but has since become less top-of-mind for many technologists and investors. Lotte first showed interest in releasing metaverse-related products in 2022 and announced that it was entering a ""strategic partnership"" with Arbitrum last year . Caliverse is mainly a venue where the South Korean megacompany experiments with emerging tech trends like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and crypto. Caliverse users can explore virtual worlds featuring differing kinds of media content and futuristic shopping experiences. The app currently features content from a grab-bag of big brands, ranging from 7-Eleven to the Tomorrowland music festival. Much of the content on Caliverse comes from fashion and beauty companies like Givenchy, MCM, and L’Occitane. Users can currently shop for those brands or experience concerts and other kinds of media within the Caliverse app. The new integration with Arbitrum means that blockchain users will be able to pay for certain services using crypto, and systems like in-game transactions could start running on-chain. The Arbitrum blockchain has become a popular choice among gaming platforms, with the network experiencing a 72% year-over-year growth in 2024 for gaming, according to Offchain Labs. According to a press release the company shared with CoinDesk, Arbitrum currently hosts 119 game titles and 23 gaming-focused blockchains through its Arbitrum Orbit stack, a customizable toolkit that lets developers create their own blockchains based on Arbitrum’s technology. “Arbitrum’s blockchain is the ideal home ground for Lotte Caliverse, delivering industry-leading 250ms block times that ensure high-quality performance within virtual worlds and gaming experiences,” said Steven Goldfeder, the co-founder and CEO of Offchain Labs. “With Arbitrum now powering Lotte Caliverse, in-game transactions will be seamlessly integrated on-chain and will eliminate transaction latency, providing users with a smooth, consumer-friendly experience that sets a new standard for Arbitrum-based interactions in virtual worlds.” Read more: Trading Platform Robinhood, Layer-2 Arbitrum Team Up To Offer Swaps To Users",Tech|Arbitrum|Lotte World|Gaming|Web3 gaming|AI|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|ARB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 20:00:00

January 23 and 25 are seen as historic dates, deciding the future trajectory of the Solana ecosystem. However, the speculations and uncertainties play a critical role in driving capital in and out, hinting at a bear-bull stalemate for the Solana price. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange (DTX) steals the spotlight after introducing the tokenized ETF trading feature for global traders on its all-in-one platform. This makes the DTX platform a better choice for SOL ETF enthusiasts in case of approval by the SEC, potentially yielding better gains than the Solana price due to the early-stage potential. You might also like: DTX Exchange, Shiba Inu, and Solana gear up for major Q1 2025 gains as the crypto slump fades Crucial upcoming deadlines for SOL ETF trigger speculations The upcoming decisions about the SOL ETF in January trigger a wave of speculations among traders despite high odds of approval. The SEC rejected form 19b-4 filings a month ago for two firms that applied for SOL ETF. This uncertainty before key deadlines approach impacts the Solana price to move rangebound. VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital have applications for an SOL ETF ETF pending, with January 25 as a critical deadline for SEC rulings. Despite Polymarket predicting 77% odds of SOL ETF approval, traders stay at the edge of their chairs as the Solana price can surge or drop according to any news about ETF approvals. Solana price remains rangebound below $218 threshold level The Solana price performed well at New Year compared to many altcoins, crossing the $215 threshold. However, since January 3, the Solana price traded rangebound below the $218 resistance level despite its quantum upgrade. Experts believe that speculations and uncertainty around SOL ETF have triggered this slowdown. Global traders believe in the bullish potential of the Solana price toward the $500 level in 2025. However, the current price momentum makes traders shift to other cryptocurrencies for bullish gains. This makes DTX Exchange a go-to altcoin after the ETF trading announcement, as traders rotate capital due to the potential reversal of the Solana price to immediate support levels before the Hush Money case ruling. DTX Exchange presale goes parabolic after ETF trading feature DTX Exchange emerges as a standout presale in 2024 with high demand for its cutting-edge trading features and unique hybrid model. The platform’s public presale is now in its seventh batch and has achieved remarkable success, with over 450,000 traders signing up on the website globally and raising an impressive 11.3 million. DTX Exchange continues to capture the interest of investors seeking portfolio diversification. The platform’s hybrid layer-1 blockchain supports trading 120,000+ assets across cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, equities, and CFDs. Furthermore, features quant and algo trading, 1000x leverage, and decentralized security have driven significant presale activity following its CoinMarketCap (CMC) pre-listing. Recent unique features, such as the 3% VIP Rebate System and tokenized ETF trading to remove traditional geographical barriers, have further solidified DTX Exchange’s reputation in the financial sector. With projections of 10,000% returns post-listing, traders are seizing the opportunity to acquire DTX tokens at the current presale price of $0.14, positioning themselves for explosive gains in 2025. Final thoughts As the Solana price remains range-bound due to SOL ETF approval uncertainties, DTX Exchange seizes the spotlight with its groundbreaking ETF trading feature. While traders await pivotal SEC decisions by January 25, DTX’s rapid presale growth and advanced platform features position it as a more immediate and promising opportunity for substantial gains in the ongoing bullish cycle.

It encountered resistance but is now undergoing a pullback. BNB started this year on a good note following an impressive recovery from the recent low. This puts the crypto back on a buying mode as it taps the $745 level yesterday following a positive weekly start. Unfortunately, the level stopped the bulls due to rejection and the price closed on a pullback. The potential level for a retest is $716. A hold at this level should bring buying pressure back into the market. But the bulls are currently regrouping as volatility turns low. However, the trend is still much more in their favour from a long-term perspective. Due to this, we can expect them to step back anytime soon as correction appears finished daily. As of now, there’s no room for a bearish action. Looking back from where the price bounced back to $400 in August 2024, BNB has seen a significant recovery so far but it appears to be staging a bigger move as it gathers momentum daily. A monthly close above the previous high could set the asset for a mega explosion. BNB Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Retaking yesterday’s high could fuel an increase to a minor resistance level of $761, followed by the $793.8 level, printed as the highest level so far. To confirm more upside movement, $800 is considered the key level for a breakup. In case of a drop, the $700 level may hold as a defence line for the bulls. If they fail to protect it, we may see a rollback to $683 and maybe $642.

This is an important change in the global finance world, as government leaders and central banks look at digital assets to manage their national reserves. Michl is Doing Everything to Strengthen its Nation’s Financial System Traditionally, foreign exchange reserves usually include assets like gold, foreign currencies, and government bonds. However, Bitcoin, often called “digital gold,” is increasingly viewed as a store of value. It may provide key advantages, such as protecting against inflation and helping with portfolio diversification. Meanwhile, the governor stated that buying Bitcoin is part of a broader plan to strengthen the Czech Republic’s financial system in the future. However, Michl’s proposal still needs approval from the CNB’s seven-member board. The board will consider the risks and benefits of adding a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin to the country’s reserves. Janis Aliapulios, an adviser to the board, affirmed that the bank is not planning a Bitcoin investment. However, the bank’s governor remains optimistic. Should the bank go ahead, it will be an important step in bringing digital assets into traditional financial systems. Saylor Pushes for Widespread Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy’s co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor, has not confined his Bitcoin advocacy to his own company. Saylor urged Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and its board to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset. He boldly predicted that doing so could drive the company’s assets to skyrocket to $5 trillion. Recently, he made a bold call for 60 public companies to issue equity to buy Bitcoin . Saylor’s bold stance highlights his belief in Bitcoin as a revolutionary financial tool. He sees it as unmatched in preserving value and driving growth. A Step Towards Financial Modernization Recall that in October 2024, Florida’s chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, urged the agency overseeing the state retirement funds to explore Bitcoin investments . While some states remain cautious, Florida’s consideration of Bitcoin for state pensions reflects a shift among U.S. public funds looking at crypto for growth and diversification. As digital assets continue to gain acceptance, Florida’s possible pivot signals its openness to innovation within traditional financial frameworks. If approved, Florida would join a small but growing roster of U.S. states exploring the role of crypto in state-managed retirement funds.

However, it currently looks set for a new wave following a 13% surge since the beginning of the year. Two weeks ago, SOL tested a low of $176 after correcting by over 30% in a month. The low level held strongly after twice failed attempts to nuke lower, and the price recovered, closing last year well above $180. The market opened long this new year as the bulls stepped back and the price rose steadily until it touched $223 yesterday. It dropped slightly off this level and now looks stalled at $215 due to low buying volume. A rise in the buying volume could facilitate more increase until the price recovers fully to the top. As we can see on the daily chart, the market is currently under the bulls’ radar. Meanwhile, Sol may pull back to the rising support line if it loses grip above the $200 level. A strong rebound from this support line should bring back the buying actions in the form of a double-bottom pattern. With the positive sentiment surrounding the market lately, we can say the bulls are back in control while several bears look trapped in the correction phase – which has now ended from a technical standpoint. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview If Sol manages to close above the $234.7 resistance this week, the next target resistance would be $247 and $264, where a major breakout lies. A new high may surface at around $280 and $300 in the near term. For a drop, the level to watch for a pullback is $202. Below it lies the holding $188 support along with the $176 low, where the price started to recover in late December.

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOMAGA.

Here’s a simple breakdown of why these coins are worth watching. Let's dive in! 1. Altura ($ALU): The Game-Changer in AI-Powered Gaming Altura is like a ""ChatGPT for gaming"" because it introduces smart, adaptive technology at the forefront. It’s a blockchain-based platform that allows game developers to create, distribute, and trade smart NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Unlike traditional NFTs, smart NFTs can evolve based on game progress or specific conditions, making them ideal for video games. Picture a virtual sword that grows stronger as your character levels up—that’s the kind of innovation Altura brings to gaming. The $ALU token powers this ecosystem by facilitating transactions, governance, and staking. Altura’s mission is to seamlessly integrate blockchain technology with gaming, providing developers and players with tools that redefine their experience. Why Altura Is Bullish Several factors highlight Altura’s massive growth potential: 1. AI Integration Altura leverages artificial intelligence to create smarter, more dynamic in-game assets. This integration enables immersive and engaging gameplay. As AI technology evolves and becomes increasingly integral to gaming, Altura’s unique capabilities are likely to drive substantial demand for the $ALU token. 2. Low Market Cap Altura currently has a relatively small market cap compared to other blockchain and gaming projects, offering significant room for growth. Low-cap projects often yield higher returns when they gain traction, making Altura a high-potential investment. 3. Not Listed on Major Exchanges Yet Altura’s potential is amplified by its absence from major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. These platforms boast a combined user base exceeding 300 million. Once $ALU is listed, the increased visibility and ease of trading could lead to a significant price surge. Price Predictions for Altura ($ALU) The recent rise in Altura’s price is just the beginning, according to experts. Here are some potential targets based on different scenarios: - Base Target: With a market cap of $1.5 billion, Altura could reach approximately $1.52 per ALU. This is the lowest expected target and could be achieved even in challenging market conditions, thanks to Altura’s solid foundation and ongoing innovation. - Bullish Target: A $3 billion market cap would push $ALU to around $3.03 per token. This target is realistic given the rising excitement around AI, gaming, and blockchain, as well as favorable market conditions. Altura’s strategic position in these booming sectors positions it to hit this milestone, especially during an altcoin rally. - Ultimate Ambition Target: In a cryptocurrency super cycle, Altura could achieve a market cap of $5 billion to $10 billion, translating to $5.05 to $10.10 per $ALU. Such growth would likely align with a broader market boom, where Bitcoin surpasses $240,000 and Ethereum exceeds $15,000. Altura’s pioneering role in the AI and gaming sectors could drive unprecedented growth in these conditions. 2. Fetch.ai ($FET): Pioneering Autonomous AI Solutions Fetch.ai stands out for its vision of creating an autonomous machine economy. The platform uses AI and blockchain to enable devices and applications to execute complex tasks without human intervention. Its use cases range from supply chain optimization to decentralized finance (DeFi). Why Fetch.ai Deserves Attention: - Real-World Applications: Industries like logistics, energy, and transportation are already utilizing Fetch.ai’s solutions. - Innovative Technology: Its decentralized AI network provides efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solutions. - Market Momentum: With industries increasingly adopting AI, Fetch.ai is poised for significant growth. 3. SingularityNET ($AGIX): The Hub for Decentralized AI SingularityNET is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create, share, and monetize AI services at scale. Known for its robust ecosystem and strong development team, it has become a top choice for AI innovation. Why SingularityNET Stands Out: - Diverse Use Cases: From healthcare to robotics, SingularityNET’s AI marketplace supports a wide array of applications. - Active Development: Continuous innovation by the team ensures the platform stays ahead of the curve. - Integration Potential: Its focus on interoperability makes it compatible with other blockchains and ecosystems, expanding its reach. Why Invest in AI Coins Now? The AI crypto sector is set for explosive growth in 2025 as industries integrate artificial intelligence into their operations. By investing in AI-focused cryptocurrencies like Altura, Fetch.ai, and SingularityNET, investors can position themselves at the forefront of this technological revolution. Conclusion For Q1 2025, Altura ($ALU) shines as the most promising AI coin, with potential returns of up to 30x. Its groundbreaking innovations in gaming and NFTs make it a standout choice. Meanwhile, Fetch.ai and SingularityNET offer compelling opportunities in broader AI and blockchain applications.

Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) performance in 2025 has not met expectations so far, although the year is still in its early stages. Despite its inability to hold above $100,000 and a 15% drop from the December all-time high of $108,000, analysts remain optimistic about BTC’s long-term outlook. Bitfinex Alpha shared its first report for the year with crypto.news, highlighting several positive indicators for Bitcoin. You might also like: Bitcoin ETFs record nearly $1b inflows as BTC rallies past $102k The report emphasized that Bitcoin’s “sell-side liquidity is drying up.” This is evident in the Liquidity Inventory Ratio metric, which has declined significantly over the past three months. The liquidity inventory measures how long the current supply can meet demand. Recent data shows this metric has dropped from 41 months in October to under seven months as of early 2025. “This significant decline aligns with the rallies observed in both Q1 and Q4 of 2024, indicating a tightening of available liquidity during periods of strong market activity,” the Bitfinex analysts wrote in their report. Bitcoin gained 61% during the last two months of 2024, fueled by U.S. election results that spurred a bull run, lifting altcoins as well. Many of these altcoins have since retraced, and analysts caution that a deeper pullback could occur in Q1 2025. Bitfinex analysts echoed this sentiment. However, they are convinced miner related metrics are also pointing to a decrease in downside pressure. Bitcoin miner activity, according to latest on-chain data, shows miners’ BTC flows to exchanges falling at a rapid pace. While miner selling increased slightly in November 2024, this profit-taking has slowed over the past month as BTC remained near the $100,000 level. Most miners are currently profitable, resulting in a sharp drop in BTC flows to exchanges. The net unrealized profit and loss for miners stands at a positive 0.5, indicating that miners remain in a strong financial position.

Users can purchase GoMining NFTs tied to the actual hashrate and earn BTC rewards as a result.

To read full editions, subscribe . Core Scientific got a lot of attention in 2024 for its hosting deals with cloud provider CoreWeave. But Hut 8’s plans to lease data center space to its own — for now unknown — AI hyperscaler may put it in an even stronger position than its rival, one analyst argues. Various bitcoin miners embarked on revenue diversification efforts last year — particularly after last year’s Bitcoin halving. This included a focus on building out HPC verticals to support AI applications . CORZ stock shot up roughly 300% in 2024 after emerging from bankruptcy and relisting on the Nasdaq last January. A Tuesday research note from Benchmark’s Mark Palmer followed the West Feliciana Parish Planning & Zoning Commission reportedly voting to approve Hut 8’s planned data center construction in Louisiana. It now seeks final approval. Palmer described this project as a likely “game-changer” for the company, noting: “We believe that HUT’s agreement with the unnamed AI hyperscaler could feature better economics on a per [megawatt] basis than CORZ is slated to realize in its deal.” The reason, he explains, was startup CoreWeave’s inability to offer support needed for CORZ to tap the project finance market. It instead agreed to provide most of the capital required to build the project. On the other hand, Palmer explains, Hut 8 having the backing of a large, established AI hyperscaler enables it to access the finance market to raise the $2.5 billion it plans to invest in Phase One of the West Feliciana Parish project. “The upshot is that HUT wouldn’t face the discount to its economics that CORZ had given CoreWeave’s fronting of the capex for its project,” he added. Hut 8 shares were trading for ~$24.85 at 1:45 pm ET, while CORZ stock was at ~$14.20. Though both were down more than 6% on the day at that time, Hut 8 had the YTD stock price gain edge on Core Scientific, +17% to -1%. Palmer’s price target for Hut 8 stock is $41. It’s safe to say we’ll be monitoring those shares as the miner’s data center project progresses. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Could Solana Hit $1K?,https://thecoinrise.com/avalanche-displays-strength-blockdags-usdt-referral-rewards-catch-on-could-solana-hit-1k/,"The Solana (SOL) forecast sees significant growth ahead, with expectations of reaching $1,000 by 2030. With a total value locked that tops $6 billion, Solana is advancing in adoption and ecosystem development. Meanwhile, the Avalanche price outlook is promising, anticipating a 50% increase, supported by resilience and key updates such as Avalanche 9000. Simultaneously, participation in BlockDAG’s (BDAG) presale is surging due to its appealing referral incentives, capturing widespread attention in the cryptocurrency community. Offering up to 10% USDT cashback for referrals and accumulating over $176.5 million in presale contributions, BlockDAG is emerging as a leading choice. Its compelling user incentives and growing community of over 170,000 make it a top candidate for the best crypto for 2025, drawing both experienced traders and new entrants. Solana Eyes $1,000 by 2030: A Vision of Growth The Solana (SOL) forecast is optimistic about its growth potential, with a potential peak at $1,000 by 2030. Known for its effective and scalable blockchain, Solana has secured a TVL of more than $6 billion, indicating strong ongoing support. The Solana (SOL) forecast combines positive and careful expectations, facing immediate resistance at $199.02 but maintaining long-term positivity due to advancements in its ecosystem. Key indicators, such as its high transaction speed and increasing developer engagement, reinforce its prospects for prolonged success. The outlook for Solana suggests a bright future, positioning it as a promising asset for enduring appreciation. Avalanche Price Outlook: Poised for a Positive Shift? The price trajectory for Avalanche remains cautiously positive as AVAX maintains its resilience amidst market fluctuations. The asset has faced challenges surpassing $40, even with the Avalanche 9000 upgrade, but a 12% increase is predicted by year’s end, potentially leading to a 50% rise. Currently, a bearish trend with low trade volumes marks the short-term outlook, with expected support at $32.2 from Fibonacci levels. Nonetheless, the long-term Avalanche price outlook is optimistic, targeting $50 and higher. For those looking at growth prospects, Avalanche represents a valuable opportunity despite present uncertainties.

The Avalanche price outlook is equally exciting with its anticipated rise, showcasing its ability to succeed despite market fluctuations. BlockDAG’s referral program, however, takes it a step further by combining immediate USDT incentives with the robust growth of its crypto presale . The initiative has already raised $176.5 million through the sale of over 17.7 billion BDAG coins, offering a compelling prospect for those looking for innovation and rewards in one solution.

Simultaneously, XYZVerse is capturing attention with projections of massive growth reaching 65,000% in 2025. These bold predictions are shaking up discussions in the crypto sphere. XYZVerse: The best new meme coin project A growing number of experts are turning their attention to XYZVerse — now projected to soar by 65,000% in 2025. Regarded as the best new meme coin project, XYZVerse serves as an exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution, where crypto degens can cash in on a red-hot market that merges the thrill of athletics and the energy of meme culture. Picture Polymarket hitting $1 billion in trading volume during the US presidential election. Now add the viral momentum of meme coins and the adrenaline rush of sports betting. That fusion is what makes XYZVerse so explosive — millions of sports fans could soon be jumping into the action, paving the way for potential thousand-fold gains. The XYZ presale alone aims for a 7,900% growth by the TGE, outpacing the likes of BOME’s 5,000% run and WIF’s 1,000% rally. Factor in the bullish market forecasts, and XYZVerse may well set the stage for 65,000% gains in 2025. Beyond hype, XYZVerse boasts rock-solid fundamentals. Audited smart contracts, a fully vetted team, and upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms give this project a strong defense. Better yet, the first-mover advantage is still up for grabs, making this an ideal entry point for those seeking bigger rewards once mainstream interest kicks in. Interested investors can grab XYZ tokens via presale to be part of the next crypto championship. XRP price On the daily chart, XRP continues its bullish ascent, establishing higher lows and highs within a broader range defined by $2.00 support and $2.90 resistance. Notably, significant buying activity drives upward movements, with a pullback to the $2.20–$2.30 range presenting strategic entry points for traders. Resistance zones between $2.75–$2.90 serve as profit-taking levels. The RSI at 61.66 indicates neutrality, with the stochastic oscillator at 91.92 and CCI at 113.03 also reflecting balanced conditions. Momentum at 0.162 and the MACD at 0.072 suggest a favorable buying outlook. Complementing these metrics, both EMA and SMA consistently signal bullish momentum across various timeframes. However, the HMA at 2.49876 advises caution, emphasizing the need for vigilance around price movements near this level. Conclusion In conclusion, XRP may present strong prospects but XYZVerse stands out with its unique blend of meme culture and sports, aiming for massive growth and community-driven success.

Altcoin season index | Source: Blockchaincenter.net An analysis of Bitcoin’s dominance and the crypto market capitalization excluding BTC can be used to determine whether the altcoin season will return anytime soon. BTC dominance is consolidating under 58%, as of Tuesday. Crypto market capitalization, excluding BTC, dipped to $1.41 trillion early on Tuesday, down from its peak of $1.64 trillion observed in December 2024. Even as total crypto market capitalization shrinks, it holds steady above support and technical indicators on the daily timeframe paint a bullish picture. A steady increase in crypto market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin, rallying towards the 2021 cycle top to the $1.71 trillion level could signal a recovery in the market and a likely return of the altcoin season. On-chain analysis of top altcoins on exchanges and token holders Supply of Bitcoin and top altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ) on exchanges can help ascertain the selling pressure on the tokens. The total number of holders is another key on-chain metric that can be used to determine the demand and relevance of an altcoin among traders. The Santiment chart below maps the total number of XRP and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) holders over the past three months. The chart points to a decline in Bitcoin and Ethereum’s exchange supply since the last week of November 2024. In the same timeframe, there is a consistent increase in the holders of XRP and DOGE. Alongside reducing selling pressure, there is high interest and demand for altcoins on exchanges. This is a key indicator for predicting whether altcoin season is expected to return in the ongoing market cycle.

Santiment data shows stablecoin supply held by whales holding upwards of $5 million has risen over 5% in the past 30 days. Higher stablecoin holdings are correlated with higher buying pressure and demand for Bitcoin and altcoins.

After a long streak of outflows, Bitcoin ETFs have observed a return of capital inflow from institutional investors. Farside Investors’ data shows that on January 3 and January 6, net flow to Bitcoin ETFs exceeded $900 million. On January 3 it was $908.1 million and on January 6 it was $978.6 million. US-based Bitcoin ETF flows | Source: Farside Investors The return of institutional interest and U.S. macroeconomic drivers could help sustain Bitcoin price above the $100,000 milestone. A K33 research report titled “Ahead of the Curve”, published on Tuesday, identifies strong new year ETF flows even as MicroStrategy slows down its Bitcoin purchasing spree. The past two trading days recorded the strongest days of institutional capital inflow since November 12. It is likely that the influx is driven by the pre-Trump inauguration positioning of firms or 2025 mandates for funds to invest, MicroStrategy’s small weekly Bitcoin purchase of 1,070 BTC failed to dampen trader sentiment on Tuesday. The report concludes that smaller ticket-size BTC purchases by MicroStrategy have been compensated by strong Bitcoin price performance and the rising ETF demands, signalling a robust crypto market.

Why Investors Are Choosing 1Fuel Over Tron And Kaspa As Their Main Investment,https://nulltx.com/looking-for-a-50x-why-investors-are-choosing-1fuel-over-tron-and-kaspa-as-their-main-investment/,"With 2025 expected to be a major bull market, many investors are weighing investment options. As the industry grows with more opportunities, investors and traders investigate the top cryptocurrencies to buy in 2025. Despite the prospects of Kaspa (KAS) and TRON (TRX), investors are excited about 1FUEL’s presale as it continues to gain traction. A hefty 50x bump in value is predicted for 2025, and this has become a major discussion point among the crypto community. Even though many have compared 1FUEL’s prospects to prominent altcoins like Kaspa (KAS) and TRX, this has a different appeal. Why More Investors Choose 1Fuel as their Main Investment In today’s competitive crypto market, raising over $1 million in a few weeks during the presale round is no minor accomplishment. Yet, this is only the beginning. Considering the token’s current price of $0.012, there is plenty of room for explosive growth. 1FUEL is likely to pump 50x upon launching. This makes it ideal for you if you want the best crypto to buy in 2025. With cutting-edge features, 1FUELis set to disrupt the crypto space. Its major objective is to make complex cross-chain transactions easy and secure. Cross-chain transactions are frictionless with 1FUEL’s 1-click cross-chain technology. This eliminates the overheads, including high network fees and difficulty navigating between several wallets. This privacy-focused wallet has a built-in privacy mixer and cold storage, which enable users to perform anonymous transactions and store their digital assets offline. This is indispensable with the growing cases of data breaches and hacks. 1FUEL offers juicy staking incentives. With up to 30% APR, investors are rewarded for holding OFT tokens. With this, investment in 1FUEL is the gateway to an additional income stream. Kaspa: A movement improving PoW consensus mechanism through innovation Kaspa (KAS) is carving a niche as a crypto that redefines speed and scalability as a proof-of-work blockchain. It uniquely supports high block rates while maintaining the level of security offered by proof-of-work environments. However, by leveraging the blockDAG architecture, Kaspa (KAS) outperforms traditional PoW blockchains. Scarcity is of utmost importance to a token’s long-term value. KAS is engineered for long-term sustainability with a low supply and a deflationary mechanism. A low market cap in crypto is often correlated with high growth potential. The scalability models suggest that KAS, with a low market cap under $200 million, has a lot of room to scale. It could turn out to be the best crypto to buy in 2025. TRON Enters 2025 with Steam, Sees 116% Yearly Growth TRON (TRX) is entering the new year with full steam. TRON’s (TRX) token holders rose to 58.85 million in early 2025, up from 36.22 million last year. Driven by staking and token burns, TRX has seen its value skyrocket to $2.15 billion, up 116.39% yearly. In 2024, TRX experienced a steep 48% year-on-year growth, with daily transfers averaging 2.05 million. Its total USDT transfers hit $5.46 trillion. TRON (TRX) is a payments blockchain that was launched in 2017. Originally, the project was created to provide full ownership rights to digital content creators. Built to create a decentralized Internet, TRX positions itself as a tool for developers to create dApps. The ability to create content and share directly with users without third-party overhead is an undeniable advantage of TRX. Conclusion Kaspa (KAS) is building the future of scalable blockchain solutions, improving the PoW consensus mechanism through efficiency and innovation. Also, TRX has seen its value skyrocket to $2.15 billion, up 116.39% yearly. The 1Fuel presale offers a great investment case for investors seeking the top cryptocurrencies to buy in 2025. There is no better moment to participate than now, at only $0.012. Take advantage of this chance now if you’re trying to figure out which cryptocurrency is best for your portfolio.

Rexas Finance emerges as a stronger contender than Shiba Inu for investors aiming to turn $500 into $10,000 this crypto cycle. Table of Contents Shiba Inu: Popular but with restrained growth Rexas Finance: The future of asset tokenization Why RXS could outshine SHIB Conclusion Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a meme token, boasting impressive community fanfare. However, in recent times, it has evolved into a more utility-focused cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, certain tokens have much higher growth potential. Rexas Finance (RXS) , currently priced at $0.175, could be a better option for investors looking to multiply their investments by up to 20x during this cycle. Shiba Inu: Popular but with restrained growth At the time of writing, Shiba Inu’s market cap was $12.89 billion, trading at $0.00002183. The technical chart provides evidence of a bullish reversal pattern called a ‘rounding bottom,’ indicating investor interest that could lead to a price recovery. According to some analysts, 2025 might see SHIB traversing from a minimum price of $0.0000176 to a maximum of $0.0000343 with an average cost of $0.0000356. Although the current predictions show potential for growth, Shiba Inu’s appeal is mostly based on speculation, which dilutes its long-term utility and growth capacity. Rexas Finance: The future of asset tokenization Rexas Finance aims to change the crypto industry by focusing on the tokenization of real-world assets. By tokenizing physical items such as real estate, RXS will create opportunities for fractional ownership, unlocking previously unavailable markets. So far in its presale stages, Rexas Finance has raised over $34.9 million and sold over 386 million tokens, a clear vote of confidence from investors. The presale is currently in stage 11, with RXS tokens priced at $0.175. Rexas Finance’s infrastructure, audited by CertiK, will ensure security and transparency. Notably, its presence on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko promotes trust and credibility. Rexas Finance, by targeting the $300 trillion real-world asset market, provides more room for growth than Shiba Inu.

Utility vs. Speculation: As SHIB focuses mostly on hype, RXS focuses on its utility. In today’s age, tokenizing assets serves a clear purpose and has a realistic market, attracting serious investors looking for long-term growth. 2. Growth forecast: Analysts estimate RXS potentially reaching $5 by the end of 2025 and up to $50 by 2026. A $500 investment could potentially yield higher returns than SHIB’s future growth projections. 3. Market potential: RXS targets the $300 trillion real-world asset space, which provides a huge opportunity for deployment and growth. Unlike SHIB, RXS has a broad scope. 4. Security and trustworthiness: The CertiK audit and robust blockchain system secure investments, making RXS a more appealing presale option. RXS predictions 1st Quarter: As the presale continues and interest in the tokenization model attains new highs, the token could exceed $1. 2nd Quarter: Significant interest in fractional ownership solutions could help RXS grow to $3 when listed on exchanges. 3rd Quarter: By the end of 2025, RXS might reach $5, branded as the future of asset tokenization. These estimates make RXS ideal for investors seeking higher returns. If the projected prices are reached, a $500 investment could grow to over $10,000, offering excellent potential for early investors. Conclusion While Shiba Inu benefits from community attention, its growth potential remains limited. Rexas Finance , with its asset tokenization strategy, successful presale results, and robust security measures, stands out as a more superior option for investors. With the expanding crypto market, projects with real-world use cases like RXS are well-positioned to deliver significant returns in 2025.

As one of the biggest gainers over the trailing 7-day period, Cardano is maintaining resilience above the $1 price mark. With the twist in the market, the roles of ADA has now come to the frontline. Cardano Whales and The Market Twist At the time of writing, ADA price was trading for $1.109, down by 8.59% in the past 24 hours. Amid the broad altcoin selloff, Cardano dropped from its intra-day high of $1.15 to a low of $1. Per an earlier ADA price analysis , the coin showed potential for a retest of its All-Time High (ATH) following its 24-hour breakout. Cardano managed to maintain the $1 support level, partly as a result of the impact of whales in the ecosystem. According to an X post from market analyst Ali Martinez, Cardano whales have acquired 10 million ADA in the past 24 hours. Whales bought 10 million #Cardano $ADA over the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/k7s2l00E1R — Ali (@ali_charts) January 7, 2025 As shown in the shared Santiment chart, the whale acquisition aligned with the rally recorded by Cardano price within the 24 hour period. This whales bet proves that many are convinced in the future growth potential of the coin. Ecosystem Updates to Complement ADA Whales Bet Over the past 7-days, the coin is still retaining an 18.83% rally, proving its inherent growth trend. While the ecosystem whales have validated the coin’s potentials, current ecosystem updates are complementing this push. As reported earlier by Coingape, the Cardano ecosystem has transitioned to its decentralized governance era or Age of Voltaire. To fully usher in this decentralized governance, the community budget and constitution need approval. According to Charles Hoskinson, getting these pending items approved will mark his last duty for the ecosystem . Beyond these governance that might make ADA an attractive asset, the protocol also have plans to introduce new products and chart more collaborations this year. Among its planned products include Bitcoin DeFi, Lace Wallet updates and Midnight Protocol among others. Flowing With the Ecosystem Tides Beyond its technical and fundamental strengths, the future of ADA also hinges on the broader market with Bitcoin as a reference. The coin still maintains a strong correlation with BTC and should the incoming Donald Trump administration favor Bitcoin, Cardano might benefit from the ripple effect. With products like XRP, Litecoin and Solana ETF now in view, a pro-crypto Presidency might see a Cardano fund filed in the near term.

38670025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=639438,1736286606,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38670025.jpeg,Here are the top memes with the most active buyers,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/here-are-the-top-memes-with-the-most-active-buyers/,"Meme tokens are expanding with new cohorts of buyers. Even older cults are drawing in new top holders, solidifying their position as top memes. Meme tokens are solidifying their positions as cults, by attracting new buyers and stressing long-term holdings. A new metric counts the recent wallets that accumulated enough tokens to join the top 1,000 ranks. The inflow of new wallets and the ability to enter the ranking also means the supply is not yet sniped by whales or held by a cabal. The selection of tokens by Cryptorank contains a mix of established, widely listed tokens, as well as those still relying heavily on DEX, such as Bongo Cat (BONGO). For smaller, less centralized tokens, a much smaller purchase is needed to join the 1,000 leaderboard. Most of the tokens, however, have a similar characteristic in being long-term cults with an ethos of holding. The assets also show a history of fewer than 70% drawdowns, though they have seen some turnover from traders. Meme cults are one of the last choices for those who prefer lower trading activity. For altcoins, without active, short-term trading, it would be almost impossible to achieve returns. Memes, however, offer a culture of ‘hodling’, which is more similar to owning Bitcoin (BTC). Top Solana memes compete with newly created tokens Meme cults also depend on making a significant purchase, with a long-term outlook. The recent lineup shows Gigachad (GIGA) saw the biggest accumulation into newly made wallets for a 15-day period. Based on Cryptorank data, new wallets bought $26.4M worth of GIGA, all of them entering the top 1,000 in the token’s rich list. GIGA is also widely held by wallets investing at least $1,000 and becoming a part of the community. The asset is near the top in terms of skin in the game, with 11,987 holders investing at least $1,000. GIGA is still at $787M market capitalization, awaiting a breakout to become another $1B token. The asset has all the signs of a cult community, which explains the inflows into DogWifHat (WIF). WIF also has a culture of long-term holding, while competing with BONK for the most loyal and widely known community. WIF attracted $13.6M in new wallet purchases. POPCAT had a similar performance, becoming the third-largest meme to spark new wallet creation. The recently trending assets follow the overall popularity selections and seem to be mostly driven by the list of Murad Mahmudov. New buyers are flowing into some of the safest, most widely distributed tokens on that list , including the recently hot FWOG, RETARDIO, and MICHI. BULLY and MEMES AI are two of the most successful crossovers of meme communities and AI agents. Together, they attracted $6.63M from new buyers. The metric also suggests better conviction that the meme can survive its short-term hype and continue for multiple market cycles. Solana ecosystem takes over memes With the exception of DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, Solana memes have taken up most of the spots in the top 20 of meme tokens, with few exceptions. The established memes also compete with newly launched assets on Pump.fun. Raydium’s weekly fees once again surpassed those of Ethereum, reaching $41.97M. The peak meme token activity on Solana also boosted Raydium and Jito as some of the biggest fee producers. More tokens are also managing to graduate to Raydium, as meme creators are becoming better at tapping new trends. Despite this, the most established cults are still considered a key part of long-term portfolios, while new memes require active trading strategies. Pump.fun also continues to produce over 50K tokens daily as its new baseline, often going above 60K new tokens. The relatively lower fees on Solana boosted DEX activity above Ethereum, in addition to becoming the go-to chain for AI agents. The recent addition of Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) also solidified Solana as the more suitable choice for active trading, as its ecosystem now contains a larger number of prominent memes.

In a message to his followers, Martinez claimed that the TD Sequential data on Bitcoin's hourly chart started to give a bullish signal. He added that this signal was formed just above the 200-hour moving average and the trend line, around $97,000. According to the analyst, if the support level at $97,000 and around can hold, the BTC price could bounce back. However, the analyst noted that if there is a break below $97,000, there will be a possibility of a drop to the $92,000 level. Related News: Is This Why Bitcoin Price Can't Break a New Record?

However, he claimed that no serious resistance level was seen on the upper side, only a small resistance zone of 107,000 BTC between $ 104,700 and $ 105,770. *This is not investment advice.

38669734,https://coingape.com/?p=232442,1736286626,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Crypto Market Crash: Why BTC, ETH, DOGE, & Other Altcoins Fell",https://coingape.com/crypto-market-crash-why-btc-eth-doge-other-altcoins-fell/,"The cryptocurrency market was in the red on Tuesday as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) and other digital assets tanked. The crypto market crash happened at the same time as other risk-off events across the global financial market due to higher US treasury yields, a more hawkish Fed, and increased macroeconomic risk. Why The Sudden Crypto Market Crash? Rising U.S. Treasury Yields Trigger Risk-Off Sentiment The crypto market has been declining today, and one of its leading causes was the increase in bond yields. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 4.70%, with the 30-year and 5-year U.S. Treasury yields also up at 4.61% and 4.50%, respectively. For context, higher bond yields make traditional investments more attractive, drawing capital away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. This shift also lead to further sell-off across other assets classes, including equities. The Nasdaq 100 dropped more than 1 percent and popular tech stocks including NVIDIA and Tesla suffered losses . For instance, Tesla stocks fell by 4.68% to $391.81 per share wiping off $19.24 of the share value. 2. Hawkish Federal Reserve Outlook Adds to Pressure Moreover, the stance of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy also played a big role in influencing investor perception. Minutes from the December meeting estimated lower interest rate cuts in 2025 than earlier projected. The reports before the Fed minutes unveiled a robust labour market with job openings climbing to a six-month high. This led to a question of a possible continued inflation, which would mean a stricter monetary policy. In the past, tighter policies have been unfavorable to the cryptocurrencies as the higher interest rates make the cryptocurrencies unattractive. Also, JOLTS job openings increased by 259,000 to 8.1 million in November 2024, which was the second straight month of growth. Professional services and finance were the best performers in the market. ISM Services PMI also pointed to the continuation of economic performance which stirred the fears of limited fed rate cuts in 2025. 3. Macro Uncertainty and Broader Economic Concerns Uncertainty in the U.S. economy has heightened market volatility. Fiscal policies under President Donald Trump and the looming debt ceiling have created investor unease. Rising fiscal deficits and unclear Treasury strategies add to the concerns, further impacting market confidence. Analysts, including Arthur Hayes, predict a short-term boost for crypto in Q1 2025 due to increased U.S. dollar liquidity. The Treasury’s spending could temporarily fuel gains for Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the need to refill the Treasury General Account and April’s tax season could reverse these gains, leading to a crypto market crash. Crypto-linked stocks like Coinbase and MicroStrategy have also suffered sharp declines. Rising bond yields and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance have intensified the sell-off. This downturn reflects the interconnected nature of global markets BTC, ETH, DOGE, And Altcoins Price Action Amid Crypto Market Crash The crypto market’s losses were pronounced, with major cryptocurrencies suffering steep declines and trading volumes surging amid the sell-off. Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped 5.04% to $96,713, falling below the $100,000 psychological support level.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance’s potential 16,800% surge could outshine analysts’ predictions for ADA and XRP in 2025. Table of Contents Cardano: Stable growth but modest returns XRP: Legal triumph might see it to $5 Rexas Finance: A rising star with potential Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market develops, 2025 will be a pivotal year for significant tokens and newly proposed projects. Industry analysts expect increases for well-known cryptocurrencies Cardano (ADA) and XRP, with estimates of $2.42 and $5, respectively. However, a new rival, Rexas Finance (RXS) , is attracting a lot of interest with predictions of $29.5, a stunning 16,800% increase from its present presale price of $0.175. Cardano: Stable growth but modest returns Cardano was trading at around $1.08 at the time of writing, a 2.09% decrease over the past 24 hours. A technical study indicates that ADA may see a spike, possibly attaining its year-to-date high of $1.326. The development of a declining wedge pattern, usually suggestive of a bullish reversal, supports this prognosis. Cardno’s developments, including the expansion of its smart contract ecosystem and the release of Plutus V3, have drawn developers and raised investor confidence. Long-term investors of Cardano have also been stepping up their stakes, indicating great faith in the project’s future. Although ADA’s returns have not been as spectacular as some other cryptocurrencies, its more controlled development gives a sense of security, which has attracted cautious investors. With a possible high of $2.42, analysts project the ADA price might vary from $0.81 to $1.93 in 2025. Though its growth path remains more cautious than other coins, Cardano is a good contender for long-term success because of its emphasis on scalability, sustainability, and a robust development community. XRP: Legal triumph might see it to $5 After the U.S. election, Ripple’s XRP surged over 400%. Optimism over the possibility of a more crypto-friendly legislative climate under incoming president Donald Trump has been a big factor driving this increase. Trump selected Paul Atkins — well-known for his positive attitude on digital assets — as the possible SEC chair. Many expect a change toward more flexible regulatory practices if Atkins takes over, opening the path for digital-asset ETFs and a more favorable attitude toward cryptocurrencies like XRP. Moreover, the New York Department of Financial Services recently approved Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, further strengthening XRP’s market position. This approval increases XRP’s acceptance and use case, strengthening Ripple’s digital payment system. Market experts project XRP’s value will reach $5 in 2025.

Rexas Finance seeks to let consumers tokenize and sell nearly any real-world asset — including real estate, art, goods, and intellectual property — worldwide. Through its creative approach to asset management and blockchain technology, Rexas Finance aims to transform the market through more inclusive, transparent, and efficient investments. Rexas Finance came to the limelight in September 2024 and has shown amazing expansion so far. Beginning in stage 1 of its presale at $0.03, the RXS token is now valued at $0.175 at stage 11, a 483% increase. By selling 389,634,933 tokens, Rexas Finance has raised $34,811,513 within this period, demonstrating great investor trust. In the first quarter of 2025, Rexas Finance plans to release its tokens on top-notch exchanges, a calculated action that analysts think could drive a price surge. With a potential 16,800% gain from its presale price, some market analysts estimate that Rexas Finance might reach $29.5 by mid-2025. Given the possibility of huge rewards, Rexas Finance is a convincing rival in the crypto market, particularly for those looking for higher-growth prospects than established players like Cardano and XRP. Conclusion Cardano and XRP are set for consistent expansion in 2025, with modest price gains for each token foreseen. However, new rivals like Rexas Finance, with their unique approach, present investors with the opportunity for more significant gains. The direction the market goes over the following months will determine if Cardano and XRP will keep their places or be passed by initiatives like Rexas Finance.

To read full editions, subscribe . Backpack, a crypto wallet and exchange popular among Solana users, has acquired FTX EU for $32.7 million. In buying the defunct exchange’s European arm, Backpack — which was started by FTX and Alameda alumni — gets access to more than 110,000 former FTX EU users, Backpack CEO Armani Ferrante told me. On top of that, it inherits FTX EU’s European regulatory license that will let European users trade perpetual futures, which are very popular among crypto traders. Ferrante said the deal was signed back in April of 2024, and Backpack spent the next eight months going through due diligence with regulators. In buying FTX EU, Backpack now becomes responsible for distributing bankruptcy claims to the exchange’s former customers . Ferrante formerly worked at Alameda Research, the research and trading firm that totally wasn’t commingling bank accounts with FTX. Backpack Wallet co-founder Tristan Yver, who just stepped back from an operational role at the company, was the head of strategy at FTX US. FTX is tied to Solana because it built its Serum DEX on the network in 2020 and is widely credited with helping put the network on crypto investors’ radars in Solana’s early days. Backpack has never been shy about the connection to FTX, and it’s pitching this acquisition partly as a way to get customers their funds back. “FTX EU users have been waiting for their distribution for too long. We believed that we could do it faster and more efficiently,” Ferrante said. Outside of those connections, this deal feels a bit surprising at first glance, because FTX obviously doesn’t have any staff or proprietary technology that Backpack can access. Backpack also now has to distribute bankruptcy claims, which it didn’t have to do before. Perhaps the most lucrative part of the deal is FTX’s MiFID II license that lets Backpack offer trading services including perps in Europe. Convincing regulators to reactivate the FTX license — which was suspended after the exchange’s collapse — was part of what took the deal so long to be finalized, Ferrante told me. Europe is a big trading market, and a large chunk of crypto trading volume comes in the form of perps, Ferrante said in an email. “Yet there are no compliant crypto perpetual futures offerings on the market right now in Europe.” A Coinbase spokesperson said the exchange bought an EU MiFID II entity last year, and it plans to “expand our derivatives offering from the EU in due course.” Crypto derivatives were also relevant to the only other FTX post-collapse acquisition: It sold the LedgerX derivatives platform to a Miami-based holding company for $50 million in 2023.

This strategic move comes with integrating its utility token on Solana and the upcoming launch of GoMining NFTs on Magic Eden. This bold leap, unveiled on Tuesday, paves the way for a seamless, accessible, and futuristic approach to earning bitcoin rewards. GoMining Merges Mining with Modern Blockchain Technology In a strategic move, GoMining announced that its utility token, GOMINING, will now operate as an SPL token on Solana’s blockchain. This integration means users can trade the token on Solana’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs), tapping into Solana’s high-speed, low-cost transaction capabilities. This development reflects GoMining’s commitment to making Bitcoin mining rewards accessible across multiple blockchain ecosystems. GoMining CEO Mark Zalan highlighted Solana’s ecosystem as a perfect fit for making Bitcoin mining more accessible. He emphasized that Bitcoin is a key part of the crypto world and should be available to everyone, regardless of the user’s blockchain preference. This move aligns with GoMining’s mission to bridge the gap between traditional mining operations and modern decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. GoMining Revolutionizes Mining Through Tokenized Hashrate What sets GoMining apart is its ability to tokenize hashrate, the computing power that drives Bitcoin mining, through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These unique digital asset classes provide a direct stake in mining operations. This allows users to earn BTC rewards without investing in expensive hardware or managing physical operations. Each NFT comprises performance metrics like power (TH/s) and energy efficiency (kW/TH). These energies enable effortless participation in Bitcoin mining. Owners can supercharge their digital miners by upgrading performance or trading their NFTs in a growing secondary market. With nearly 216,000 NFTs already sold, GoMining is proving that the future of mining lies in accessibility and innovation. This strategy emerges amid rising energy costs and challenges in the mining sector, as miners secure billions of Bitcoins to stay competitive and offset expenses. Scaling New Heights with Robust Infrastructure Behind the scenes, GoMining’s operations are powered by 350MW of mining capacity. Innovative installations in locations like Texas support this. This expansive infrastructure not only sustains the platform’s current user base. It also positions it to accommodate growing demand as crypto adoption surges. With a market capitalization of over $200 million, the GOMINING token is a testament to the platform’s success and scalability. Integrating with Solana would further solidify its position as a leader in combining blockchain efficiency with Bitcoin mining. Meanwhile, As GoMining NFTs prepare to debut on Magic Eden , the platform is poised to attract a diverse audience of crypto enthusiasts.
