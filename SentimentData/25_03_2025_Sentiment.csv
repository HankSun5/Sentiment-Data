He believes this decision is a turning point that will help unlock opportunities in the US market, which has historically been challenging for crypto firms due to regulatory hurdles. Speaking in an interview, Garlinghouse said the SEC’s decision to end its regulatory investigation into Ripple was significant. He noted that Ripple was one of the first crypto companies to face the SEC’s lawsuit, and that the company had incurred over $150 million in legal fees to fight the case. Despite the long battle, he expressed relief at the outcome, noting that it allows Ripple and the wider crypto industry to move forward with greater clarity and confidence. “It took longer than we wanted to prove that the SEC was on the wrong side of the law and history, but we are excited about the outcome,” Garlinghouse said. “This allows us to really unlock a U.S. market that has been very hostile to the crypto industry.” Related News: Important Interest Rate Statements from US President Donald Trump and FED Official Bostic - Is a Rate Cut on the Way? While Ripple faces regulatory challenges in the U.S., the company has focused its efforts overseas, with around 95% of its customers now made up of financial institutions outside the U.S. The company has partnerships with major banks and payment providers, including HSBC and BBVA. Garlinghouse also pointed to Japan as a promising market where Ripple technology adoption is increasing. “Markets like Japan are still being unlocked,” he said. “The global cross-border payments market is huge and there is a significant opportunity to modernize this market beyond the outdated SWIFT network.” Garlinghouse noted that the regulatory change in the US has already started to increase local interest in Ripple. He explained that since President Donald Trump’s election, Ripple has signed more deals in the US in the six weeks it has done in the previous six months. “These are very innovative technologies in terms of how they will reorganize the financial infrastructure of the United States for 10 to 20 years,” he explained, adding: “From payments to real estate and securities transactions, crypto is poised to reshape these industries.” Despite the positive momentum, Garlinghouse also said regulatory clarity is needed. Lawmakers including Senator Cynthia Lummis and Representative French Hill are working to define clear distinctions between cryptocurrencies, which are classified as commodities and securities. “Providing clear guidelines will allow financial institutions to engage with crypto with greater confidence,” Garlinghouse said. “The US has lagged behind global leaders in this space, but the tide is turning and we need to invest in our domestic industry.” *This is not investment advice.

42288022,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142851,1742856609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Whale’s Colossal $213M Binance Withdrawal Sparks Market Speculation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-binance-withdrawal/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The ever-watchful eyes of the blockchain have spotted a significant movement. A Bitcoin whale, a term we use for individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, has just executed a massive withdrawal from one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, Binance. Let’s dive into what this colossal transaction entails and what it might mean for the volatile crypto market. Decoding the Whale’s $213M Binance Withdrawal: What Happened? According to the eagle-eyed blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, a crypto whale initiated a withdrawal of 2,425 BTC from Binance within a mere 10-hour window. At current valuations, this staggering amount of Bitcoin is worth approximately $213 million. That’s not pocket change, even in the crypto world! Here’s a quick breakdown: Transaction: Withdrawal of Bitcoin (BTC) Amount: 2,425 BTC Exchange: Binance Value: Approximately $213 million (USD) Reporting Source: Lookonchain (via X, formerly Twitter) Timeframe: Within 10 hours It’s important to understand that these large transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, making them visible to tracking services like Lookonchain. This transparency is a core feature of blockchain technology, allowing us to observe these significant financial maneuvers in near real-time. Why Does a Massive Bitcoin Whale Transaction Grab Headlines? You might be wondering, “So what? People move money around all the time.” And you’d be right. However, in the crypto sphere, particularly with Bitcoin, whale movements are closely scrutinized for several key reasons: Market Impact: Large Bitcoin holders possess the power to influence market prices. Selling off a substantial amount of BTC can potentially trigger price drops, while moving it to cold storage might be interpreted as a long-term bullish signal. Market Sentiment Indicator: Whale activity is often seen as a barometer of market sentiment. Are whales accumulating, suggesting they anticipate price increases? Or are they distributing their holdings, perhaps signaling a potential downturn? Early Warning Signals: Monitoring whale transactions can sometimes provide early hints of broader market trends or shifts in investor confidence. However, it’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions. A Binance withdrawal of this magnitude doesn’t automatically guarantee immediate market chaos or a sudden price surge. There are numerous reasons why a whale might move such a large sum. Decoding the Intent: What’s Behind This Binance Withdrawal ? Speculation is rife whenever a significant crypto transaction occurs. Let’s explore some potential reasons behind this Bitcoin whale ‘s $213 million move: Possible Reasons Potential Market Interpretation Cold Storage: Moving BTC to a secure, offline wallet for long-term holding. Potentially bullish; suggests long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. OTC Deals: Preparing for over-the-counter (OTC) trades, which are large, private transactions typically executed outside of exchanges. Neutral to slightly bullish; indicates significant private market activity. Diversification: Shifting funds to other cryptocurrencies or asset classes. Potentially bearish for Bitcoin if the whale is reducing BTC holdings in favor of alternatives. Regulatory Concerns: Moving funds due to evolving regulatory landscapes in certain jurisdictions. Mixed; could be bearish if perceived as a lack of confidence in exchange security or regulatory compliance, but could also be neutral if simply proactive risk management. Personal Reasons: Whales, like any investors, have diverse financial strategies and needs. The withdrawal could be for personal or business-related purposes unrelated to market speculation. Neutral; no direct market signal. As you can see, deciphering the exact motivation behind a whale’s move is often guesswork. Without direct insight into the whale’s intentions, we’re left to analyze the transaction within the broader context of the crypto market . Navigating Market Speculation: Market Impact of Whale Moves The immediate market impact of this Binance withdrawal remains to be seen. While large withdrawals can sometimes precede periods of price stability or even upward movement (if interpreted as a move to long-term storage), they don’t always dictate immediate market direction. Here’s what to keep in mind regarding potential market reactions: Broader Market Conditions: The overall health of the crypto market, macroeconomic factors, and global events play a much larger role in price fluctuations than individual whale transactions. Exchange Flows: It’s important to look at net exchange flows – are more Bitcoins flowing into or out of exchanges in general? This provides a broader picture of market sentiment. Order Books and Liquidity: The depth and liquidity of Bitcoin order books on exchanges will influence how easily large sell orders (if any were to follow this withdrawal) could be absorbed without causing significant price slippage. Media Narrative: How news outlets and social media interpret and amplify this event can also influence short-term market reactions, regardless of the underlying fundamentals. Key Takeaways: What Does This Mean for You and the Crypto Market ? So, what should you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, make of this $213 million Bitcoin whale withdrawal from Binance ? Stay Informed, Not Alarmed: Whale transactions are part of the crypto ecosystem. Stay informed about these movements, but avoid knee-jerk reactions based solely on single transactions. Look at the Bigger Picture: Analyze whale activity in conjunction with broader market trends, news, and technical indicators. Don’t isolate this single event. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never make investment decisions based solely on headlines or speculation. Conduct thorough research and understand your own risk tolerance. Volatility is Inherent: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Whale movements are just one factor contributing to this volatility. In conclusion, while the $213 million Bitcoin whale withdrawal from Binance is undoubtedly a noteworthy event, it’s essential to view it within a balanced perspective. It’s a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the constant interplay of various factors influencing price movements. Keep your eyes on the market, stay informed, and remember that responsible investing involves careful analysis and a long-term perspective.

42288413,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142854,1742857206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Grim Inflation Forecast: Federal Reserve Warns 2% Target Delayed Until 2027,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/grim-inflation-forecast-fed-2027/,"Are you bracing for continued economic uncertainty? Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic has delivered a sobering update on the battle against inflation, suggesting the fight will be longer and harder than previously anticipated. For those navigating the volatile cryptocurrency markets, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is crucial. Let’s dive into Bostic’s concerning inflation forecast and what it could mean for you. Dashed Hopes: 2% Inflation Target Pushed to 2027 In a recent statement that has financial markets buzzing, Raphael Bostic indicated that the Federal Reserve’s cherished 2% inflation target is unlikely to be achieved until early 2027. This is a significant revision, pushing back previous estimates and signaling a more persistent inflationary environment than many had hoped for. Previous Expectations vs. Reality: Earlier projections suggested a return to the 2% target sooner, but persistent inflationary pressures are proving more stubborn. Bostic’s Stance: Despite the extended timeline, Bostic reiterated the importance of reaching the 2% goal, underscoring the Fed’s commitment to price stability. Impact on Crypto: Prolonged high inflation can erode the purchasing power of fiat currencies, potentially making assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more attractive as hedges. Interest Rate Cuts: Fewer and Further Between? The prospect of interest rate cuts has been a closely watched indicator for investors across all markets, including crypto. Bostic’s latest remarks suggest a recalibration of expectations regarding monetary policy easing. Initially, the market anticipated two rate cuts this year. However, Bostic now suggests that only one rate cut is likely. This reduced pace of easing reflects the ongoing struggle to tame inflation. Here’s a breakdown of the evolving outlook: Timeline Previous Expectation Current Outlook (Bostic) 2024 Rate Cuts Two One Inflation Target 2% Earlier than 2027 Early 2027 Fed Response to Economic Weakness Aggressive easing Responsive easing This shift in expectations could influence cryptocurrency markets. Higher interest rates typically make riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, less appealing compared to safer, yield-bearing investments. Conversely, anticipation of rate cuts can fuel bullish sentiment in the crypto space. The Federal Reserve’s Balancing Act: Economic Outlook and Inflation Bostic’s comments reflect the delicate balancing act the Federal Reserve is currently undertaking. The central bank is tasked with managing inflation while also ensuring the health of the broader economy. The economic outlook remains uncertain, and the Fed must navigate these choppy waters carefully. According to Bostic, the Fed remains data-dependent and will respond as needed if the economy weakens. This suggests a flexible approach, but the primary focus appears to be firmly on controlling inflation, even if it means delaying rate cuts and potentially slowing economic growth. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors: Monitor Inflation Data: Keep a close watch on inflation reports (CPI, PCE) as these will heavily influence the Fed’s decisions and market reactions. Interest Rate Sensitivity: Understand how changes in interest rate expectations can impact crypto asset valuations. Higher rates can create headwinds, while lower rates can provide tailwinds. Economic Resilience: Assess the overall economic outlook. A weakening economy could prompt a more dovish Fed stance, potentially becoming positive for risk assets like crypto in the medium term, despite initial negative reactions to growth concerns. Long-Term Perspective: Bostic’s 2027 inflation timeline is a long-term forecast. Crypto investors should maintain a long-term perspective, considering that short-term volatility is inherent in these markets. Navigating the Economic Headwinds: What’s Next? President Bostic’s revised inflation forecast serves as a stark reminder that the fight against rising prices is far from over. The path to the 2% target is proving to be longer and more arduous than initially hoped. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, this economic backdrop requires careful consideration and strategic planning. The reduced likelihood of aggressive interest rate cuts in the near term means that the environment may remain challenging for risk assets. However, the inherent characteristics of cryptocurrencies, such as their decentralized nature and potential as inflation hedges, could still make them attractive in the long run. Staying informed, adapting to evolving economic data, and maintaining a balanced investment approach will be key to navigating these uncertain times.

42288670,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-eyes-1-milestone-as-eth-shib-face-tough-hurdles-ahead-of-2025-mainnet-launch/,1742857224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/42288670.jpeg,BlockDAG Eyes $1 Milestone as ETH & SHIB Face Tough Hurdles Ahead of 2025 Mainnet Launch,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-eyes-1-milestone-as-eth-shib-face-tough-hurdles-ahead-of-2025-mainnet-launch/,"Recent analysis of Shiba Inu (SHIB) prices reveals ongoing attempts to surpass the $0.00001240 mark. However, consistent selling pressure has managed to keep the price under control. Ethereum (ETH) is also struggling. Since December 2024, it has lost over half its value, leading to concerns about further price drops as traders speculate on the possibility of reaching a new low. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is preparing for its 2025 mainnet launch. The altcoin has seen a remarkable 2,380% increase since its first presale batch. As its network becomes operational, it’s expected to attract significant institutional attention, reduce available supply, and push prices upward. Market experts believe BDAG could reach $1 following the launch, positioning it as a prime crypto purchase today before it escalates further. SHIB Price: Can Bulls Break $0.00001240? Recent Shiba Inu price evaluations point to a crucial period as the price fluctuates within a specific range. SHIB has challenged the $0.00001240 resistance level several times but faced selling pressure, leading to price retractions toward the $0.00001180 support level. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have recently shown overbought conditions, coinciding with price resistance, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests a shift toward bearish momentum. Previous movements indicated a slight recovery when SHIB found support at lower levels. As traders keep an eye on these indicators, the future direction of SHIB prices remains a focal point for market analysts. ETH Price: Has It Hit Bottom? The current price trend for Ethereum indicates continuing uncertainty, with the cryptocurrency lingering near its recent lows. Having shed over 50% of its value since December 2024, ETH faces the possibility of further declines, sparking debates among analysts about whether it has bottomed out. A particular concern is Ethereum’s pricing relative to Bitcoin, which has dropped to its lowest ETH/BTC ratio since mid-2020. If Bitcoin’s value decreases further, it could drag down Ethereum’s dollar value even more. Although some predict a recovery later in 2025, Ethereum’s current market position remains precarious and demands careful analysis. BlockDAG’s Mainnet Launch Approaches—Will It Reach $1 Soon? BlockDAG’s upcoming 2025 mainnet launch signifies its evolution from a successful presale crypto to a fully functional ecosystem. A presale indicates market demand, but a live network demonstrates actual performance. Early adopters have secured over 18.8 billion BDAG coins, contributing to $205 million in total sales, making it one of the largest crypto presales ever. As the launch approaches, substantial BDAG holdings are expected to grow, boosting liquidity. This development moves the altcoin beyond mere speculation, establishing it as a network with tangible utility and a viable economy. Institutional stakeholders typically position themselves ahead of significant market changes, securing their stakes before retail buyers become involved. The transition of BlockDAG to a publicly traded entity is likely to attract considerable capital from venture capitalists and affluent buyers, securing supplies before demand surges. Once BDAG begins trading freely across various exchanges, supply restrictions could tighten further. Large stakeholders are less inclined to sell, decreasing availability and increasing price pressures. Retail buyers who wait for clear signals may encounter much higher entry prices as demand grows and trading volumes increase. The value of BDAG has already increased by 2,380%, rising from $0.001 in its initial batch to $0.0248 in the latest Batch 27. Analysts foresee a significant price adjustment ahead, with projections of reaching $1 by 2025 and potential peaks of over $20 by 2027. BDAG’s current valuation remains a small fraction of its anticipated worth, reinforcing its status as a top crypto to buy today before market dynamics and institutional involvement transform the landscape. Key Insights on SHIB, ETH, & BlockDAG Shiba Inu continues to struggle within a tight range, with analysis indicating repeated challenges at the $0.00001240 resistance. Conversely, Ethereum is still seeking stability. After a 50% fall, its price struggles to establish a definitive low, and while a rebound is possible, the market remains uncertain. BlockDAG, however, is not waiting for the market to stabilize. With a 2,380% increase since its first presale batch, it is outperforming most projects even before its mainnet launch. Once BDAG becomes operational, its value is expected to skyrocket. Market analysts are already targeting a $1 value for 2025, a significant rise from its current price in Batch 27, making BDAG the top crypto to consider purchasing today.

The ETFs are expected to launch later this year, pending regulatory approval and the signing of a definitive agreement. In addition to the ETFs, Trump Media plans to introduce Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) under the Truth.Fi brand. This will provide investors with more tailored investment options. Complementing the Trump Brand With WLFI Still, the ETFs and SMAs will be part of TMTG’s broader financial strategy, which includes an investment of up to $250 million. These funds will be custodied by Charles Schwab, a major financial institution, ensuring a structured and secure investment framework.

Imagine creating a rug that perfectly matches your vision, all through the power of AI! This isn’t just about adding another product line; it’s about democratizing design. Arcade is leveraging the power of models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, making sophisticated design tools accessible to everyone. This move signifies a broader trend of AI integration across various sectors, and for those in the crypto space, it mirrors the decentralized and accessible ethos many projects champion. ‘Match My Room’: AI-Powered Personalization One of the standout features accompanying this expansion is “Match My Room.” This clever tool lets you upload a photo of your room, and the AI platform analyzes the existing décor to generate rug designs that harmonize with your space’s color palette and style. Here’s a quick look at how ‘Match My Room’ enhances the design process: Color Harmony: Ensures your new rug complements your existing furniture and wall colors. Style Integration: AI understands the overall style of your room to suggest suitable rug designs. Visual Preview: Get a visual idea of how the rug will look in your space before making a purchase. While the AI is adept at color matching, it’s worth noting that replicating intricate patterns from existing décor is still a developing area. However, as a tool for ensuring color coordination, ‘Match My Room’ is incredibly useful. This feature embodies the user-centric approach that is becoming increasingly vital in the tech world, much like the focus on user experience in successful crypto platforms. Funding Fuels Future Growth: $42 Million Raised To propel this expansion and further platform development, Arcade has announced a successful $25 million Series A funding round . This brings their total funding to an impressive $42 million. This significant capital injection speaks volumes about investor confidence in Arcade’s vision and potential within the burgeoning AI-driven design market. Here’s a breakdown of what the funding will be used for: Area Purpose Hiring Expanding the team to support growth and innovation. Platform Development Enhancing existing features and developing new AI-powered tools. New Product Categories Expanding beyond rugs and jewelry to include ceramics, pillows, and potentially apparel and leather goods. This funding round was led by prominent investors like Laura Chau from Canaan Partners and Kirsten Green from Forerunner, further validating Arcade’s market position and future prospects. The involvement of such established names highlights the growing interest in AI-powered commerce solutions. Designing Your Dream Rug: How it Works Creating your custom rug on the Arcade AI platform is a straightforward and engaging process: Material Selection: Choose from a range of rug materials, starting with affordable options like hand-tufted wool and extending to luxury materials like cashmere and alpaca. Text Prompt Input: Describe your desired rug design using a text prompt. Think of it as instructing the AI artist. AI Generation: Arcade’s AI, powered by Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, generates rug designs based on your prompt. Sample Approval: Once you’ve chosen a design, Arcade connects you with a manufacturer who sends you a free sample for approval before you commit to a purchase. While prices for rugs start at around $400, Arcade emphasizes offering more accessible luxury compared to traditional high-end retailers. This approach of blending AI-driven customization with accessible pricing could be a winning formula in the evolving e-commerce landscape. More Than Just Design: Dream Boards and Seller Programs Arcade isn’t just about creating and buying; it’s fostering a community of design enthusiasts. The “Dream Boards” feature functions like Pinterest boards, allowing users to curate and share collections of products based on themes. This social aspect enhances user engagement and discovery within the platform. For those looking to monetize their creativity, Arcade offers a seller program. Users can earn a 5% commission on each sale of their designs, up from the previous 2.5%. An affiliate program and an entrepreneur program further incentivize content creators and influencers to participate and earn higher commission rates. This is akin to the creator economy principles seen in many blockchain-based platforms, rewarding users for their contributions. Early Success and Future Categories Despite being in beta for its jewelry offering since September 2024, Arcade boasts an impressive 650,000 jewelry designs generated. While purchase data and seller earnings remain undisclosed, the design generation numbers are a strong indicator of user engagement and the platform’s appeal. Looking ahead, Arcade plans to introduce ceramics and pillows as new product categories, with potential expansions into apparel and leather goods hinted at by founder Mariam Naficy. Chain belts are also mentioned as a near-future addition. This continuous expansion strategy suggests Arcade is aiming to become a comprehensive home goods and lifestyle design platform, powered by AI. Conclusion: The Future of Design is AI-Powered Arcade’s expansion into rug design and home goods is a compelling example of how generative AI is moving beyond niche applications and entering mainstream consumer markets. By combining user-friendly design tools with AI-driven personalization and a focus on accessible luxury, Arcade is positioning itself at the forefront of the future of design and e-commerce.

With Stellar pushing aggressive network upgrades, Tezos launching high-impact community initiatives, and Qubetics flipping the table with real-world asset tokenization, 2025’s crypto scene isn’t just buzzing—it’s blowing up. Community members who’ve been watching from the sidelines are now eyeing which project might actually become the next crypto to hit $1. And with prices shifting fast and narratives evolving daily, it’s time to unpack what’s real, what’s hype, and what could be the most slept-on opportunity this year. While Stellar and Tezos are rolling out new campaigns with bold moves, Qubetics is coming in hot with something totally different. It’s not just another token promising big things—it’s building a complete ecosystem where physical and digital assets can finally break free from the traditional finance bottleneck. The Qubetics marketplace is bridging the gap between blockchain tech and everyday utility in a way that past projects just couldn’t nail. And with its fast-moving presale and jaw-dropping ROI projections, there’s a reason people are saying Qubetics might be the next crypto to hit $1—and sooner than expected. Real Utility in Action: How Qubetics Bridges the Digital and Physical World Qubetics isn’t just another coin trying to ride the wave—it’s solving actual, long-standing headaches in the asset world. Its biggest power move? A tokenized asset marketplace that lets people and businesses fractionalize everything from real estate to rare collectibles into tradable digital tokens. That means more people can now afford to own a piece of previously out-of-reach assets—think: someone in their 20s buying into prime real estate or an independent creator tokenizing intellectual property without needing a middleman. All of this is happening in a secure, scalable environment designed to cater to every type of user. This isn’t theory—it’s infrastructure. Qubetics functions as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, meaning it’s bringing multiple leading blockchains into one unified system. That kind of backend magic translates to fewer silos and more seamless transactions. For example, a local business could tokenize part of its equity for community funding, while a farmer in another country could tokenize commodity yields to gain access to better liquidity. It’s a global fix for a very global problem—and exactly the type of utility play that makes Qubetics a serious contender for the next crypto to hit $1. Qubetics Presale ROI: Why This Might Be the Next Crypto to Hit $1 The Qubetics presale isn’t just active—it’s exploding. Sitting at Stage 27 with a current token price of $0.1300, this presale has already raised over $15.4 million with 503 million $TICS tokens sold and more than 23,700 holders jumping in. Here’s where it gets wild: each presale stage only lasts 7 days, and by every Sunday at 12 AM, the price jumps by 10%. And yeah, you read that right—every. single. week. The return projections are jaw-dropping. If you grabbed $TICS today and it reaches just $1, that’s a 669.13% ROI. At $5? You’re looking at a 3,745.67% ROI. Stretch that to $6 or $10 and you’re talking 4,514.80% and 7,591.33% respectively. And if $TICS hits $15 after the Q2 2025 mainnet launch, we’re talking a legendary 11,437% ROI. For example, if someone drops $100 right now, they’d get 769 tokens. If $TICS reaches $15, that’s a staggering $11,437 return. With the Qubetics presale moving this fast and returns this bold, it’s already being talked about as the best crypto presale of the year—and possibly the next crypto to hit $1 before some even realize what’s happening. Stellar Goes Full Speed with Network Upgrades and Ecosystem Boosts Stellar’s not holding back this year. According to CoinCentral, it’s been pushing hard to make its network faster and leaner. One of the biggest changes includes the implementation of Soroban, a native smart contracts platform designed to elevate decentralized finance and app-building on Stellar. This isn’t some far-off idea—it’s already live, making Stellar’s infrastructure way more attractive to developers who’ve been hesitant in the past. These moves are part of a broader effort to decentralize power and drive user adoption in real-world scenarios. But that’s not the only shift in gear. Stellar has also introduced fee reductions and throughput enhancements, which make transactions not just cheaper, but smoother and way more scalable. These network upgrades come at a critical time when Ethereum gas fees continue to be a roadblock for everyday users. With all of this happening, Stellar isn’t just tweaking things—it’s setting itself up to compete directly with more mainstream smart contract platforms. Tezos’ Trailblazers Program Sets the Stage for Long-Term Impact Tezos has officially rolled out its boldest move yet: the Trailblazers initiative. According to Blockchain.News, this program is designed to onboard creators, developers, and projects into the Tezos ecosystem with a focus on grassroots growth. Backed by a clear $15 million commitment, this campaign isn’t about flashy marketing—it’s about building real infrastructure and user bases from the ground up. The initiative focuses on three main tracks: creative arts, real-world asset tokenization, and DAO tooling—all huge in terms of blockchain’s future. The Trailblazers campaign comes with grants, hackathons, mentorship, and even long-term collaboration opportunities. The network is tapping into talent hubs in North America, Latin America, and emerging markets, helping bring diverse perspectives and regional adoption into the picture. The idea is to expand beyond traditional crypto communities and build meaningful use cases around the Tezos blockchain. With a strong emphasis on user empowerment and ecosystem decentralization, this move could reposition Tezos as not just another smart contract chain, but one of the most forward-thinking platforms heading into 2025. Why All Eyes Are on These Three: The Final Word In a year where every token is shouting for attention, only a few are actually putting in the work. Qubetics is rolling out a real-world marketplace with utility that goes beyond speculation, and its presale numbers and ROI projections alone make it a major contender for the next crypto to hit $1. Stellar, meanwhile, is delivering big-time with smart contract innovations and leaner, faster infrastructure. And Tezos? It’s making grassroots cool again with its Trailblazers initiative, setting the tone for real growth. Whether someone’s watching for long-term development, network upgrades, or explosive entry points, these three are commanding attention. Now might just be the best time to join this crypto presale, especially for those hunting down the best crypto presale, crypto pre sale, or top crypto presale before the wave hits. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics the next crypto to hit $1?

42289259,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142896,1742858459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Workflow Automation: Fair-Code Pioneer n8n Secures $60M Funding,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-workflow-automation-n8n-funding/,"The world of developer tools is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Companies that empower developers to seamlessly integrate AI into their workflows are not just gaining traction; they are experiencing explosive growth. n8n, a startup pronounced “enay-ten,” stands as a prime example. By strategically pivoting its workflow automation platform to embrace AI in 2022, n8n witnessed a staggering 5X surge in revenue, with growth doubling in just the last two months. This phenomenal success has culminated in a fresh injection of capital. Bitcoin World has confirmed that n8n has successfully raised €55 million ($60 million) in Series B funding, valuing the company at approximately €250 million ($270 million), according to sources close to the deal. This significant funding round underscores the immense potential and investor confidence in AI-driven workflow automation solutions. Explosive Growth in AI Workflow Automation Drives n8n’s $60M Funding Based in Berlin, n8n now boasts an impressive portfolio of over 3,000 enterprise clients and around 200,000 active users. This Series B funding round, led by Highland Europe, with participation from HV Capital and existing investors Sequoia, Felicis, and Harpoon, will be instrumental in fueling n8n’s continued technological advancements and strategic expansion into key markets like the U.S., which already accounts for more than half of its user base. While n8n keeps its revenue figures private, the substantial customer numbers, encompassing both free and paid subscriptions, speak volumes about its market penetration and the rising demand for efficient AI workflow automation tools. This funding is a testament to the transformative power of AI in reshaping how businesses approach automation. The Rise of Low-Code and No-Code Automation: n8n’s Fair-Code Foundation Founded in 2019, n8n initially gained momentum by catering to developer teams seeking low-code automation and no-code automation solutions. These solutions simplified the intricate process of connecting diverse applications without extensive coding. However, n8n’s unique appeal extended beyond mere technical utility. The company distinguished itself by championing “fair code,” an evolved concept stemming from open source principles. Fair code ensures that while developers can freely utilize open-source code, commercial applications built upon it adhere to principles that fairly compensate the original creators or the open-source community. Jan Oberhauser, n8n’s founder and CEO, is a prominent advocate for fair code, even managing a dedicated website to promote the concept. This commitment to ethical and community-driven development has resonated deeply within the developer community. AI as a Rocket Ship: How AI Integration Fueled n8n’s Success While n8n’s foundation in fair code and its strong open-source community presence, evidenced by over 70,000 GitHub stars, contributed to its initial growth, the integration of AI acted as a true catalyst, propelling the company into hypergrowth. Workflow automation and AI, particularly generative AI, are inherently synergistic. This synergy is also recognized by n8n’s competitors like Tines and Workato, and broader automation players like UiPath. Generative AI elevates automation by minimizing technical complexities, making it even more accessible than traditional low-code or no-code approaches. It streamlines the process of connecting applications and services, reducing the manual effort involved. Natural Language Workflow Automation: Simplifying Development with AI Recognizing the transformative potential of AI early on, Oberhauser and his team began integrating AI into n8n’s platform about a year and a half ago. Their vision was to drastically reduce the coding burden for developers by enabling them to express automation instructions in natural language. Instead of writing lengthy code to perform tasks like sending emails, users can now simply use natural language prompts. Oberhauser describes it as, “It’s a prompt to build workflow.” For instance, users can input instructions like, “get information from X and send it to Y,” and n8n’s AI-powered platform translates this into functional workflow automation . This intuitive, natural language interface significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developers and accelerates the automation process. Fair Code and Community: Pillars of n8n’s Innovative Approach N8n’s product architecture is designed to be compatible with various Large Language Models (LLMs), offering users flexibility and interoperability. This allows users already leveraging specific LLMs to seamlessly integrate them with n8n’s platform. Furthermore, n8n thrives on a vibrant and extensive contributor community. Active on platforms like GitHub and community forums, these contributors provide support, share knowledge, and develop and utilize workflow templates. N8n also offers a library of pre-built workflow templates, further accelerating the adoption and ease of use of its platform. This strong community engagement, coupled with the fair code ethos, creates a powerful ecosystem of collaboration and innovation. The Future is Now: Embracing AI for Workflow Automation Despite the initial hype surrounding AI and generative AI, the adoption of n8n’s AI-powered features was initially slow. However, a tipping point was reached last year, coinciding with a broader surge of interest and investment in AI coding tools, exemplified by companies like Poolside, Codeium, and Magic. End-users also began actively seeking practical applications of AI. Ultimately, n8n’s user-friendliness and tangible utility, combined with the AI revolution, solidified its value proposition for both users and investors. David Blyghton, the Highland Europe general partner who spearheaded the investment, emphasized this point, stating, “Everyone is trying to leverage AI but struggling to find practical use cases. The design, scale, and throughput of n8n is what allows people to adopt it.” Oberhauser confirms that market adoption has caught up, with approximately 75% of n8n’s customers now actively utilizing its AI-powered tools. This remarkable adoption rate underscores the transformative potential of fair code and no-code automation , now amplified by the power of AI.

Despite recent price appreciation, investor wariness remains fueled by skepticism towards long-term upside and saturation. Meanwhile, there's a new star in the altcoin world that's causing serious interest. Remittix (RTX)—a use-case-based cryptocurrency with real-world utility—is seeing increased volume and early investment, and now analysts are calling it one of the most promising projects of the year. Dogecoin Price Soars, but Investors are Cautious Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently priced at $0.1828, 7.41% higher. Its market cap is $27.17 billion, and its trading volume is a whopping 111.95% higher at $1.16 billion. Source: Tradingview Despite the volume spike, investors are staying away. Dogecoin's strong reliance on social media trends and meme culture has turned it into a casualty of brutal pullbacks. Although a continued favorite, DOGE's limited utilization and development keeps the majority of serious investors on the sidelines, requiring more than smoke before justifying new positions. Cardano Gains Strength, But Meets Resistance Cardano (ADA ) is currently at $0.7356, having posted a 4.41% price gain. The token's market capitalization is at $25.92 billion, while its volume is up 72.94% at $883.31 million. Source: Tradingview Cardano is picking up steam with volumes rising, but most investors do not want to buy at this stage. Past slow rollouts and failure to gain traction in DeFi have led some to question its potential for growth. Even with strong fundamentals of ADA, it might not be able to produce explosive growth without some enormous new catalyst—leading most traders to look at newer altcoins with greater potential for upside. Remittix (RTX): The Altcoin With Blazing Volume Growth and Real Utility Remittix (RTX) is also among the fastest-growing altcoins of 2024. Priced at $0.0734, only at the moment, the project has already earned $14 million+ and sold over 521 million tokens already in presale. While DOGE and ADA are already considered by some to be legacy coins, Remittix is just getting started—and that’s where the magic happens. It’s a PayFi solution that gives users and merchants across the globe instant, fee-free crypto-to-fiat transactions. Its application is obvious: freelancers, traders, and consumers globally can accept crypto and make fiat payments in seconds, free and instant. That’s why volume is accelerating so rapidly—and why most investors believe that RTX can return 100x in the next cycle. Why Smart Money Is Rotating Into Remittix Instead Of Meme Coins The meme-pump investors may look at DOGE or even new entrants such as POPCAT. But those looking at real adoption and survival are now looking at tokens such as Remittix. It exceeds hype—it provides function. To illustrate, if a freelancer who's working on a project for a U.S. client can receive payment in crypto and simultaneously exchange the funds for local currency via Remittix’s platform, there's no friction. This focus on actual problem-solving is the reason Remittix is gaining speed so rapidly, and why authorities are calling it the most underappreciated altcoin out there. Join the Remittix Presale Before Listings If you are attempting to identify the next altcoin that possesses what it takes to outperform DOGE and ADA, Remittix could be your best bet. Last Word Dogecoin and Cardano remain major parts of the crypto universe, but their potential may be capped by present valuations and a seasoned investor base. Meanwhile, Remittix is taking the lead, expanding rapidly, and addressing actual problems in the world with its PayFi approach. Investors waiting on DOGE and ADA are already piling into RTX—and based on the volume spike, they’re not the only ones. If you are looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2024, Remittix might be the most explosive one to look out for in the times to come. With demand soaring, the Remittix presale is quickly advancing to the next phase. Early access is a special opportunity to buy at low prices before exchange listings drive prices to lofty heights.

And the application process for companies wishing to obtain operating permits from the regulatory Financial Services Agency is famously complicated. As such, many larger companies have chosen to buy existing exchanges. They have found that M&A deals can be a faster way to launch than starting their own exchanges from scratch. Examples include the NASDAQ-listed Coincheck , which began life as a small startup. Following a crippling 2018 hack, the firm was later bailed out and then taken over by the securities giant Monex Group.

Just when you thought Dogecoin was all about memes and moon shots, the Dogecoin Foundation has dropped a bombshell that signals serious intentions. They’ve officially announced the creation of a substantial DOGE reserve , purchasing a cool 10 million DOGE – that’s about $1.8 million at current prices! This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a strategic move designed to solidify Dogecoin’s position in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Let’s dive into what this means for DOGE and the future of crypto payments. What’s the Buzz Around the Dogecoin Foundation’s DOGE Reserve? The Dogecoin Foundation , the non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the growth and development of Dogecoin, is stepping up its game. This 10 million DOGE reserve isn’t just sitting idly; it’s a deliberate investment aimed at fostering the utility of Dogecoin. Partnering with House of Doge, a project focused on Dogecoin-centric initiatives, the Foundation is sending a clear message: they’re serious about Dogecoin being more than just a meme coin. They envision it as a practical, fast, and reliable Dogecoin payment solution for everyday transactions. Here’s a breakdown of what we know so far: Significant Investment: A 10 million DOGE purchase demonstrates a tangible commitment from the Dogecoin Foundation. Strategic Partnership: Collaboration with House of Doge suggests a coordinated effort to build Dogecoin’s ecosystem. Payment Focus: The initiative is explicitly designed to promote Dogecoin as a viable payment option. Future Announcements: House of Doge hints at upcoming strategic partnerships, suggesting further expansion and integration plans are in the works. Why a Reserve for Dogecoin Payments? You might be wondering, why a reserve specifically? Well, it’s all about building confidence and infrastructure. A dedicated DOGE reserve can be utilized in various ways to support the Dogecoin ecosystem and encourage its use as a Dogecoin payment method. Think of it as a war chest ready to be deployed for initiatives that drive adoption. Here are some potential benefits of establishing this reserve: Funding Development: The reserve could be used to fund development projects aimed at improving Dogecoin’s technology, speed, and scalability. Incentivizing Adoption: It could support programs that incentivize merchants and businesses to accept DOGE as payment. Community Initiatives: The funds could be directed towards community-led projects that promote Dogecoin awareness and usage. Stability and Liquidity: While not its primary purpose, a reserve can contribute to market stability and liquidity in certain situations. DOGE Price Reaction and the ETF Hype: What’s Next? The market reacted positively to the news, with DOGE experiencing a 10% surge, reaching $0.19. However, it’s crucial to keep things in perspective. Despite this recent bump, DOGE is still down 40% over the past four months. The volatility of the cryptocurrency market is always a factor, and while this news is positive, sustained growth requires more than just announcements. Adding another layer of intrigue to the Dogecoin narrative are the three DOGE ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) filings currently under review by the SEC, as reported by The Block. The potential approval of a DOGE ETF could be a game-changer, opening the doors to institutional investment and broader market accessibility. DOGE ETF Filings Under SEC Review: Factor Potential Impact of DOGE ETF Approval Institutional Investment Increased capital inflow from institutional investors seeking crypto exposure. Market Accessibility Easier for traditional investors to invest in DOGE without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Price Volatility Potentially reduced volatility due to larger, more stable investment flows (though crypto volatility is inherent). Mainstream Legitimacy Further validation of Dogecoin as a legitimate digital asset within the financial system. Dogecoin’s Bold Move: A Sign of Maturing Cryptocurrency? The Dogecoin Foundation’s initiative is more than just a positive headline for DOGE; it reflects a broader trend within the cryptocurrency space. As the market matures, we’re seeing a shift from purely speculative investments towards projects with tangible utility and real-world applications. Dogecoin, often seen as the quintessential meme coin, is now actively seeking to solidify its position as a practical payment solution. This reserve is a concrete step in that direction. Key Takeaways: Utility is Key: The focus is shifting towards cryptocurrencies with real-world use cases beyond just trading. Foundation Support Matters: Active foundations are crucial for driving development and adoption within crypto ecosystems. ETFs are a Catalyst: Regulatory developments like ETF approvals can significantly impact market growth and accessibility. Community and Meme Power: Dogecoin’s unique community and meme-driven origins remain a powerful asset in its journey. Conclusion: Is Dogecoin Barking Up the Right Tree? The Dogecoin Foundation’s launch of a 10 million DOGE reserve is undoubtedly a significant development. It signals a serious commitment to making Dogecoin a viable Dogecoin payment option and moves beyond its meme coin origins. While challenges remain, and the volatile crypto market always presents uncertainties, this initiative, coupled with potential ETF approvals, paints a potentially bright future for Dogecoin. Whether this bold leap will truly propel DOGE to mainstream adoption remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Dogecoin is not just sitting back and memeing – it’s actively building and evolving.

The financial products will bear the Truth.fi brand and are expected to appear this year in the United States and abroad. The financial products will be known collectively as America-First Investment Funds and available through Crypto.com’s broker-dealer Foris Capital. They will include funds tracking cryptocurrency as well as “securities with a Made in America focus spanning diverse industries such as energy,” according to a statement . America-First financial products come in a few flavors The ETFs will be launched alongside Truth.Fi Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs). SMAs are managed portfolios created to meet an investor’s specifications. TMTG will invest up to $250 million in the ETFs and SMAs.

Once launched, these ETFs will be available on the Crypto.com App for our more than 140 million users around the world.” Cronos (CRO) is the Crypto.com governance token. CRO traded at $0.080 early on March 24, reached a peak of $0.099 at 11:30 p.m. GMT and settled down to $0.095 at the time of writing.

As its price increases and trading volumes soar, everyone is asking how much a $1,000 investment in Ripple (XRP) today will be worth in five years' time. Alongside XRP, analysts are closely watching Remittix (RTX) , an emerging payment-focused altcoin already making waves. With low entry pricing and strong fundamentals, could RTX outperform XRP over the long haul? XRP Price Prediction: Is $10 Realistic By 2029? Ripple (XRP) is currently trading at $2.46, up 3.02%, with a market cap of $143.61 billion. Its daily trading volume has climbed 65.44% to $3.25 billion, reflecting a resurgence in demand. XRP has been the default blockchain for cross-border financial transactions for a while. With clearer regulatory footing and restored institutional and banking attention, experts are optimistic about its next five years. Conservative forecasts have XRP at $5–$10 by 2029. A $10 XRP price means an investment of $1,000 today turns into roughly $4,000 good growth but not life-changing wealth. Remittix (RTX): The 100x Early-Stage Altcoin Remittix (RTX) is taking the world by storm as one of the most talked-about altcoins in the payment industry. Built on a PayFi model that enables instant, fee-less crypto-to-fiat settlements, RTX has a specific use case for freelancers, digital enterprises and consumers at large. Priced at just $0.0734, Remittix has already raised $14+ million in funding and sold more than 521 million tokens in its presale. Whereas XRP is pushing institutional corridors, Remittix is solving for the individual, allowing users to get paid in cryptocurrency and exchange it to fiat in real-time without intermediaries. Analysts believe RTX has the fundamentals and timing to potentially return up to 100x over the course of the next five years, making it one of the top early-stage altcoins of 2024. $1,000 in Remittix vs XRP: What Could It Be Worth In 2029? A $1,000 investment in XRP today could realistically be worth $3,000-$5,000 in five years if adoption continues to increase and it moves into double digits. Not bad but it pales in comparison to what's available with Remittix. If RTX moves from $0.0734 to even $7, a $1,000 investment today would be worth $95,000. At more ambitious projections of $10+, you're looking at six-figure returns. This enormous potential, combined with Remittix's working payment product, is why traders are calling it this cycle's XRP but with better timing for entry. Why Smart Investors Are Preferring Utility-Driven Altcoins Like Remittix Problem-solving tokens work better. XRP demonstrated as much by making payments center stage but Remittix is rewriting the script with a retail-facing, instant-use experience. With outrageous remittance fees still affecting millions of individuals globally, Remittix offers a low-fee, decentralized alternative. An African or South American freelancer can accept crypto with RTX and trade it for fiat instantly without bank fees or waiting times. That kind of usability is not hype; it's the reason Remittix is receiving serious investment from investors who weren't able to get in on the early XRP, SOL and MATIC runs. How to Buy Remittix (RTX) Before the Price Goes Up Further XRP still has potential, especially as regulatory clarity increases and financial partnerships expand. But its 100x growth days are likely behind it. Remittix, on the other hand, is just beginning. With a clear use case, low token price and expanding presale, RTX could be the best crypto for massive returns over the coming five years. If you're reading this and are wondering where to put your next $1,000 in crypto, consider the token that can turn it into $100,000. Remittix might just be the opportunity you've been waiting for. Remittix is available via its official presale, where early users can get the best rate before exchange listings are launched. With over 521 million tokens sold and increasing demand, the chance to get in early is rapidly diminishing.

A recent survey reveals a compelling trend: a significant majority of financial advisors in the United States are planning to ramp up their exposure to cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a clear signal that the financial establishment is increasingly embracing digital assets, but in a measured and familiar way. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto investment strategy and why financial advisors are turning to crypto ETFs . The Rising Tide of Crypto ETF Investment Among Financial Advisors According to a new report from TMX VettaFi, a noteworthy 57% of financial advisors in the US are set to increase their holdings in crypto ETFs . This data, reported by CoinDesk, stems from a comprehensive survey conducted by TMX VettaFi, a subsidiary of TMX Group. The survey paints a picture of growing confidence and strategic allocation towards digital assets within traditional finance. Interestingly, a substantial 42% of advisors intend to maintain their current positions, indicating a steady belief in their existing crypto allocations. Only a tiny fraction, a mere 1%, expressed plans to reduce their crypto ETF positions. This overwhelmingly positive sentiment underscores a significant shift in how financial professionals are viewing and incorporating cryptocurrencies into their clients’ portfolios. Why the Surge in Crypto ETF Interest from Financial Professionals? What’s driving this bullish outlook on crypto ETFs among financial advisors ? Cinthia Murphy, senior investment strategist at TMX VettaFi, sheds light on the reasons behind this trend. She highlights the appeal of “ crypto equity ETFs ,” which invest in publicly listed companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency industry. Think companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, both frequently cited examples in this space. Murphy points out that these products resonate with advisors because they are “easy to understand and control.” This ease of understanding is crucial for financial advisors who need to explain investment strategies to clients, many of whom may be newer to the world of crypto. Here are some key factors contributing to the increased interest: Familiarity and Regulation: ETFs are well-established investment vehicles with a clear regulatory framework, making them a comfortable entry point into crypto for advisors and clients alike. Diversification within Crypto: Crypto equity ETFs offer diversification by investing in multiple companies related to the crypto ecosystem, rather than directly holding volatile cryptocurrencies. Accessibility and Liquidity: ETFs are easily bought and sold on traditional stock exchanges, providing liquidity and accessibility that direct crypto ownership may lack. Client Demand: Increasing client interest in cryptocurrency exposure is likely prompting advisors to seek out suitable and regulated products like crypto ETFs . Crypto Equity ETFs: A Strategic Avenue for US Market Exposure The focus on crypto equity ETFs is particularly interesting. These ETFs don’t directly hold Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, they provide exposure to the crypto market by investing in companies that are involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This could include: Crypto Miners: Companies involved in the mining of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Crypto Exchanges: Platforms that facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies. Technology Companies with Crypto Holdings: Publicly listed companies that hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets, like Tesla or MicroStrategy. Blockchain Technology Companies: Businesses developing and utilizing blockchain technology across various industries. By investing in crypto equity ETFs , financial advisors can offer their clients exposure to the potential upside of the crypto market while mitigating some of the risks associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership. This approach aligns with a more traditional investment strategy , making it palatable to a broader range of investors and advisors within the US market . Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape: Considerations and Actionable Insights While the survey data is overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial to approach crypto ETFs with informed awareness. Here are some important considerations for both financial advisors and investors: Consideration Details Volatility: Even though crypto equity ETFs offer indirect exposure, they are still subject to the volatility of the underlying crypto market and the performance of the companies they hold. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and related ETFs is still evolving. Changes in regulations can impact the performance and viability of these investments. Company-Specific Risks: Investing in crypto equity ETFs means exposure to the risks associated with the individual companies within the ETF, in addition to broader market risks. Due Diligence: Thorough research and understanding of the specific crypto equity ETFs , their holdings, and their investment strategy are essential before investing. Actionable Insights: For Financial Advisors: Explore crypto equity ETFs as a potential tool to meet growing client demand for crypto exposure in a regulated and familiar format. Conduct thorough due diligence and educate clients about the risks and rewards. For Investors: If you are interested in gaining exposure to the crypto market but prefer a less direct approach, consider researching crypto equity ETFs . Understand the ETF’s holdings and risk profile before investing. Consult with a financial advisor to determine if crypto ETFs align with your overall investment strategy . Conclusion: A Strategic Shift Towards Crypto ETFs The survey data from TMX VettaFi sends a clear message: crypto ETFs are gaining significant traction among financial advisors in the US market . The preference for crypto equity ETFs highlights a strategic and measured approach to incorporating digital assets into portfolios. As the crypto landscape matures and regulatory clarity increases, we can expect this trend of institutional and advisor adoption of crypto ETFs to continue. This is not just about chasing hype; it’s about smart, strategic allocation in a rapidly evolving financial world. The increasing interest from financial advisors in crypto ETFs signals a significant step towards mainstream acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance.

According to House of Doge, the reserve serves as a proof of concept that highlights Dogecoin’s potential for seamless and efficient transactions. “The launch of Dogecoin Reserve is a significant step in House of Doge’s vision to make Dogecoin a fast and reliable payment option for businesses and shoppers everywhere,” the company said in a press release. The initiative includes innovative technology that allows merchants to accept Dogecoin payments instantly at the checkout, eliminating traditional blockchain transaction waiting times and providing the same level of trust as traditional payment methods.

While some predict a potential 300% rally in April, others aren’t convinced the momentum will last. With volatile price swings and limited real-world use, whales appear to be shifting their focus toward emerging utility-driven projects like Remittix (RTX) . As PEPE flirts with breakout territory, investors weigh hype against practical long-term potential. Whale Activity Sparks Speculation Around Pepe Coin’s Next Move Pepe continues to ride the unpredictable waves of meme coin mania. It is currently priced at $0.000007926 and has a hefty 24-hour trading volume topping $611.2 million as of March 21, 2025. After delivering an eye-catching 106.4% rally earlier this month, PEPE gave back some of those gains amid broader market corrections, leaving traders to wonder if the next move is a bounce or a break. Despite the volatility, PEPE remains a favorite among meme coin loyalists, with Pepe price prediction as intense as ever. Its rapid rise and equally swift retracement show just how reactive the token is to internet sentiment and whale activity. Analysts remain split; some, like CoinCodex , predict a strong upswing to $0.000025 by June, representing a potential 200%+ climb. Others, including Changelly , expect PEPE to oscillate between $0.0000094 and $0.0000155, with an average price projection around $0.0000151. This wide range reflects the nature of PEPE itself: a coin fueled less by technical strength and more by cultural momentum. Its value hinges not only on market structure but on the virality it can spark. As April approaches, investors are watching closely to see whether whales double down or begin shifting to tokens with more grounded utility. Either way, PEPE’s meme-powered presence ensures it stays in the spotlight, whether as a 300% gainer or just another missed rocket. Whales Shift Focus From PEPE to High-Utility Tokens Like Remittix While Pepe Coin continues to grab attention with its unpredictable swings, a growing number of crypto traders are quietly shifting focus to a project that offers more than speculation. Remittix (RTX) , a rising PayFi contender, is proving that blockchain can do more than entertain it can solve real-world problems. Designed to streamline cross-border transactions, Remittix enables instant crypto-to-fiat transfers straight into bank accounts, eliminating delays, conversion headaches and unwanted scrutiny from financial gatekeepers. With institutions tightening their grip on how money moves, demand is rising for tools that allow users to stay in control. Remittix stands out for letting individuals send crypto while the receiver gets a standard bank deposit, with no traceable link back to a blockchain transaction. That’s a big deal in regions where banking restrictions are heavy or where financial autonomy is at risk. The market seems to agree. With over $14 million already raised and RTX tokens still priced at $0.0734, the presale has quickly become one of the most watched in 2025. Analysts are forecasting an 800% surge before launch, with post-listing projections climbing even higher. Pepe price prediction remains a heated subject and while PEPE fans debate whether another 300% run is possible in April, early Remittix backers are already positioning themselves for what could be a 10x breakout.

The official also sees asset-backed stablecoins as a means to potentially resurrect the gold standard. Alexander Shokhin, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs ( RSPP ), is convinced that no government would like to see its sovereign rights as a money issuer challenged but recognizes the general consensus in Russia that crypto can be employed in cross-border payments. Business lobby group urges Russian government to consider using cryptocurrencies The authorities in Moscow should analyze the prospects for using cryptocurrencies in light of President Donald Trump’s decision to establish a strategic reserve of Bitcoin and other digital coins in the U.S. The head of the RSPP expressed this opinion in an interview released on Sunday. The organization, over which Shokhin presides, promotes the interests of businesses in the Russian Federation and is one of the oldest lobby groups in the country. It was founded in 1991 when it succeeded the USSR’s Scientific and Industrial Union. Speaking to the Tass news agency, he described cryptocurrencies as an “encroachment on the sovereign rights” of governments to issue money, adding that no central bank would want to face competition from other money issuers without the ability to control the issuing. “But it seems that it has long been agreed that crypto can be used in cross-border settlements,” Shokhin remarked at the same time. He pointed out that in the context of the financial restrictions imposed on Russian business entities, cryptocurrency has found its place among payment instruments. “Well, after Trump said that the United States will now become the crypto capital of the world and is already accumulating crypto reserves, so to speak, at least in Ethereum and Bitcoin, we also need to look at it somehow,” the lobbyist elaborated. Shokhin backs idea of launching settlement system with stablecoins and gold Alexander Shokhin emphasized that Russia should approach the matter carefully, avoiding the establishment of other money issuing centers while at the same time exploiting the benefits of using digital financial assets, including to conduct international settlements. The RSPP executive further highlighted that this possibility has been addressed within proposals to create a new payment and settlement system, alternative to the U.S. dollar-based system and using stablecoins tied to different assets. He suggested that Russia could think about creating a payment and settlement system similar to the International Monetary Fund’s special drawing rights but one introducing additional assets and reserves in the form of gold. “That is, in a sense, returning to the gold standard and to exchange-traded commodities with prices that have been stable for 10 or more years. Such calculations are being made,” the official revealed in the interview. Some officials in Russia still hoping for a crypto reserve President Trump’s initiative to set up a cryptocurrency reserve with bitcoin and other coins seized by the authorities in the United States was met with little enthusiasm by policy makers across Europe, including the Russian Federation. Governor of the Central Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina made it clear she didn’t see any circumstances under which cryptocurrency could enter the monetary authority’s reserves. The Ministry of Finance “has not heard about the creation of a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies in Russia,” Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev was recently quoted as stating. Nevertheless, the idea has had its backers in Russia. In December, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev urged the finance ministry to assess the feasibility of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. And last week, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, Evgeny Masharov, proposed forming a government crypto fund to keep digital assets confiscated in criminal proceedings.

Solana (SOL) prompts speculation for its potential massive growth but Remittix continues to gain momentum through its successful funding campaign that sold over 521 million tokens for $0.0734 each and raised more than $14 million. The big question is: which of these two will truly deliver a massive rally in 2025? Solana’s Recent Recovery and Key Levels SOL/USD Hourly Chart (Binance). Source: TradingView. Image shows SOL breaking the $140 key resistance The Solana price experienced a 7% increase during one day leading to its position at $141.69 after a difficult March period. Technical signals indicate a potential market correction after the token succeeded in breaking above two benchmarks starting from $137 before reaching $140. The Relative Strength Index in the hourly timeframe recently crossed 80 levels indicating overbought territory where price drops may soon occur. Technical analysts believe $137 will function as an entry point for additional buying if the price returns to that level. The price falling beneath $137 marks a potential trend change yet many investors plan to monitor Solana because the token might return to previous levels after dropping. A sense of precaution remains necessary because the Fear & Greed Index demonstrates a wariness level positioned at 31 or 45 according to different information sources. A limited price increase is expected due to bear market conditions since investors remain hesitant about market trends. Some Solana price forecasters predict it will reach between $112 and $179 in the next month but other analysts expect the token to rise beyond these levels in a long-term perspective. A hypothetical 60x growth requires Solana to expand into an intense bull market that may be catalyzed by increasing user engagement and major institutional backing and strategic partnerships. Introducing Remittix: The 60x Contender The past performance levels of Solana remain unattainable as RTX altcoin maintains increased investor interest through its payment solution. Through this new project users can exchange digital assets directly to local currency while the system focuses on building user-friendly transaction features for daily use. To provide market-accessibility Remittix integrates cryptocurrency with traditional finance through an efficient payment system which avoids time-demanding processes while eliminating high fees. User numbers on the platform would expand quickly through payment provider connections with remittance businesses. The pre-sale phase of Remittix succeeded in collecting more than $14 million through sales exceeding 521 million tokens at each token costing $0.0734. Analysis indicates that broad acceptance of Remittix will lead to a 60x rise in token value like what has occurred during successful market adoption. New market demand will generate significant value increases for Remittix because its market capitalization remains lower than Solana. How Remittix Could Outshine Solana The extensive features of Solana including its chain reliability and numerous dApps and institutional attraction sometimes act as both advantages and disadvantages in the crypto space. Large systems need extended periods to reach new dimensions while facing overwhelming competition because their advancement depends mainly on developer participation. The Remittix platform exists to let users change crypto into fiat currency in short periods while skipping complex learning or multiple exchange steps. The solution's basic operation potentially attracts many more users swiftly while excluding those users who dislike complex multi-exchange activity. Due to its low price below $1, Remittix appeals to investors who want to benefit from projects with small market capitalization. The projection for Remittix usage growth by some analysts makes a 60-times price increase plausible since straightforward altcoins with consumer-focused value propositions historically experience strong adoption. The supporters of Remittix suggest its single-step solution provides better marketing potential alongside simpler explanation when compared to more complex chain technologies. Conclusion Solana blockchain maintains its position as a promising platform thanks to its strong fundamentals yet uncertainty exists regarding its ability to reach the 60x extensive price target of. The coin’s success likely hinges on consistent development, developer loyalty, and a broader crypto bull run. The digital token to real payment feature operated by Remittix functions smoothly with minimal formalities. New network participants could join under the proposed cryptocurrency-to-cash exchange method thus creating achievable conditions for achieving a 60x increase.

42290762,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=717484,1742860805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42290762.jpeg,The Cyclicality Of Bitcoin: What The Cyclical Crests Say About A BTC Top,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/the-cyclicality-of-bitcoin/,"Tony “The Bull” Severino, a well-followed crypto analyst, recently took to the social media platform X to share a detailed breakdown of Bitcoin’s historical price behavior. The analysis uses a cyclical lens that many in the crypto community (both bulls and bears) agree holds significant relevance. Notably, Tony Severino focuses on the concept of Bitcoin’s four-year cycles and how troughs and crests have consistently marked the periods of greatest opportunity and greatest risks for investing in Bitcoin. This analysis comes in light of Bitcoin’s recent price correction below $90,000 in March. Cycles Define Sentiment: From Troughs Of Opportunity To Crests Of Risk Severino’s analysis starts from a foundational belief shared across the crypto industry. The widely-held belief is that Bitcoin operates in clearly defined cycles, usually lasting around four years, mostly in relation to its halving cycles. His technical outlook is based on Bitcoin’s cycle indicator on the monthly candlestick timeframe chart that goes as far back as 2013. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? Why A Fall To $63,000 Is Possible If This Resistance Holds As shown in the chart below, Bitcoin has gone through four definitive cycles in its history. These cycles, he explains, should be viewed from “trough to trough.” The troughs are the darkest moments in the market, but they also represent the point of maximum financial opportunity. As these cycles progress, Bitcoin transitions through periods of increasing optimism, eventually arriving at what the analyst calls the “cyclical crest.” These crests, highlighted in red in his chart, are the periods where Bitcoin has reached its point of maximum financial risk. This is relayed in the ensuing price actions, with the Bitcoin price topping out right after passing each cyclical crest. Bitcoin passed through its crest in the current market cycle just before reaching its all-time high of $108,786 in January 2025. If past cycles are any indication, the coming months could reveal whether a top is already in. Right-Translated Peaks: Is BTC Running Out Of Time In This Cycle? Bitcoin has been on a correction path since February and is currently down by 20% from this $108,786 price high. The Bitcoin price has even gone ahead to correct as low as $78,780 in the second week of March, triggering reactions as to whether the crypto has already reached its peak price this cycle. Related Reading: Inverse Head And Shoulders Breakout Suggests Bitcoin Price Is Headed To $300,000 However, Bitcoin might not be in the woods yet, as not all crests are followed immediately by market tops. Severino pointed out that past cycles have featured “right-translated” peaks where Bitcoin continued to rise slightly even after crossing the crest. The 2017 bull run was the most right-translated, with price action staying strong for some time after the red-zone crest. In contrast, other cycles began reversing not long after reaching this point of maximum risk. Bitcoin appears to have already passed the red crest based on Severino’s model, but this does not confirm a top is in just yet. Instead, it means that the margin for error is rapidly narrowing. The longer BTC continues to correct after this point, the more elevated the risk of a bearish phase becomes. BTC is attempting to regain bullish momentum at the time of writing, trading at $87,300 after rising 3.6% in the past 24 hours. Many other analysts argue that the Bitcoin price could still chart higher territory this year before a definitive top is confirmed.

A transfer involving 167M XRP has polarized the community, while Solana’s significant decrease prompts doubts on its ability to maintain critical support levels. Amid these fluctuations, BlockDAG (BDAG) has excelled, amassing over $205.5M in its presale and establishing itself as a significant contender in the cryptocurrency sphere. With an advanced blockchain architecture that resolves longstanding inefficiencies and anticipated listings on 10 major CEXs, could BDAG lead the upcoming surge in crypto advancements? Continue reading to explore. XRP Whale Action Sparks Speculation A recent XRP whale action has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency world. An anonymous entity moved 167M XRP, valued at roughly $367 million, between unidentified wallets. This transaction occurred during a market slump, with XRP’s price falling nearly 5% in the past day. Such large-scale transfers frequently ignite speculation regarding their potential impact on the market. While some view this XRP whale action as a tactical accumulation in anticipation of a market upswing, others see it as a prelude to a major sell-off, possibly leading to further declines in XRP’s price. Keeping an eye on these XRP whale actions is essential for understanding market dynamics and predicting future price trends. Explore the Latest Solana (SOL) Price Prediction Solana (SOL) has recently seen a sharp decline, dropping over 7% in a single day to $118.76, sparking concerns about a possible retest of the $100 support level. This pessimistic view is driven by a decrease in meme coin interest, the release of 11.16 million SOL by FTX’s bankruptcy estate, and general market weakness. Technical analysis indicates SOL breaking below the crucial $136 support, suggesting a bearish trajectory. Analysts believe that if these support levels give way, Solana might approach the $100 mark again, making this Solana (SOL) price prediction vital for market participants. BlockDAG Solves Key Blockchain Challenges—Secures $205.5M! The domain of cryptocurrency has often shifted with the introduction of groundbreaking solutions. Bitcoin pioneered decentralized finance, while Ethereum brought smart contracts into the blockchain ecosystem. Despite their innovations, both platforms face ongoing issues with balancing security, speed, and decentralization—the core blockchain trilemma. BlockDAG has made significant strides in overcoming these hurdles by implementing Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, which allows for the simultaneous confirmation of multiple transactions. This method contrasts with the linear processing of traditional blockchains, enabling BlockDAG to eliminate bottlenecks without sacrificing security or efficiency. Central to this innovation is the Phantom GhostDAG protocol, which offers a level of decentralization that avoids the congestion typical of Ethereum’s network. Moreover, BlockDAG’s design promotes an environmentally friendly Proof-of-Work model, demonstrating that scalability does not need to undermine security or environmental sustainability. This advanced technology has set BlockDAG on a path toward broad adoption in both its infrastructure and community involvement. Having raised $205.5 million, attracted 170,000 unique holders, and witnessed a 2,380% increase in price since its first presale batch, BlockDAG’s progress is evident. With the price now at $0.0248 in Batch 27 and predictions of a rise to $1 post-listing, the upcoming Keynote 3 announcements and 10 CEX listings are expected to boost liquidity and further demand. For those considering the best long-term crypto, BlockDAG represents a formidable option. It addresses fundamental blockchain constraints, and delaying involvement could mean missing significant opportunities. Market Movements in Focus Recent XRP whale action has reignited discussions, with a substantial transfer of 167M tokens causing uncertainty about future market trends. Concurrently, Solana’s significant fall below crucial support levels has prompted discussions on the likelihood of a drop to $100. The instability in these assets keeps the market on alert. Contrasting with this, BlockDAG is advancing steadily, having raised over $205.5 million from crypto presale funding and supported by 170,000 unique holders. Its adoption of Phantom GhostDAG protocol and DAG technology addresses some of the most persistent inefficiencies in blockchain technology. With its price up 2,380% since the initial batch and Batch 27’s rate of $0.0248 quickly increasing, hesitating could mean losing out on what could be an exponential growth phase.

When Bitcoin dominance slows, liquidity flows into high-risk, high-reward assets, and meme coins tend to be the first to benefit. In 2021, Shiba Inu (SHIB) made early buyers rich when millions of retail traders flooded into the market. In 2023, PEPE skyrocketed from obscurity to a multi-billion-dollar market cap in weeks. Now, in 2025, the cycle is starting again. And this time, in a downturn for the wider market at large, early investors are looking at the high-flying presale FloppyPepe (FPPE) instead of Shiba Inu. Why Meme Coin Buying Season Has Arrived Market sentiment plays a huge role in meme coin performance. Historically, meme coins explode when three conditions align: Bitcoin stabilizes, dips, or trends sideways → Investors look for more volatile opportunities. Retail traders re-enter the market during or after a dip → Meme coins thrive on engagement, memes, and community activity. Early-stage projects gain traction before major breakouts → Low market caps and immunity from the market’s rollercoaster allow for exponential upside. Following the dip at the beginning of this week, on-chain data has shown a rise in meme coin wallet activity, with a growing number of new holders accumulating presale tokens. This suggests both Whales and presale adopters are preparing for signs of the next breakout. SHIB vs. FPPE – Which One Has More Upside? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a legend in the meme coin space, no doubt. However, its growth potential in 2025 is limited. In fact, since the turn of the year, SHIB is down more than 35% . SHIB already has a $8 billion market cap. While it can and should still rise again, its potential for 1000x gains is long gone. Burn mechanisms help price action, but they don’t create the kind of viral momentum of newer projects. Its biggest rally happened in 2021. Since then, SHIB has trended downwards to the tune of 85% away from its peak. Clearly, meme coins need new narratives to recapture investor attention. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , on the other hand, is at the earliest presale stage, meaning it has a fraction of SHIB’s market cap and significantly more room to grow. Why FPPE Could Be the Best Pick in This Buying Season Despite appearances, FPPE isn’t a typical meme coin hoping to ride a trend and disappear as fast as it appeared. It’s an AI-powered ecosystem designed to generate engagement indefinitely. Meme-o-Matic AI Generator → Unlike SHIB, FloppyPepe creates viral content automatically. This ensures that it remains relevant in times such as these when the markets cool off. FloppyX AI Agent → Analyzes trends, generates memes, and turns market sentiment into shareable content. A first-of-its-kind tool in the meme coin space. Deflationary Tokenomics → 1% of every transaction is burned, reducing supply over time—something SHIB still struggles to implement effectively. Presale Price Advantage → While SHIB is already trading at a $8 billion market cap, FPPE is still in its first presale phase, offering the lowest possible entry price. What History Tells Us About Buying Early The biggest meme coin gains come from early-stage investments. SHIB’s early buyers saw 70,000,000%+ gains. PEPE’s early adopters turned $100 into six figures in weeks. Dogecoin’s long-term holders became millionaires after years of accumulation. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is in its accumulation phase. This means investors have a rare chance to get in before mass adoption. Meme Coins Reward Those Who Back Themselves Meme coins aren’t usually about utility. They’re about community, momentum, and timing. Right now, early investors are shifting their focus from established names like SHIB to high-upside opportunities like FPPE, whose use of AI could revolutionize how meme coins are perceived in the space. History shows that buying in early meme coin presales delivers the highest returns. And with FloppyPepe integrating AI-driven engagement tools and deflationary mechanics, it could be positioned as the next big meme coin breakout of 2025.

According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, whales in the Bounce ( AUCTION ) market have been greatly influencing the altcoin’s price action for the past week, causing massive swings in both directions. Bounce Finance is a decentralized auction platform enabling auctions for various assets, such as physical assets tokenized on the blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). AUCTION tokens are used for governance, staking, and fees for participating in auctions or creating NFTs on the platform. Lookonchain says that in the last several days, whales sent over 14% of the circulating supply of AUCTION to Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by volume, and OKX. Those deposits presumably led to coins being sold on the open market, which ultimately caused prices to plummet. Says Lookonchain, “AUCTION Whales deposited 1.08 million AUCTION ($48.6 million, 14.26% of the total supply) into Binance and OKX again, causing the price to plummet by 50%. Pay attention to price changes.” Source: Lookonchain/X At time of writing, AUCTION has not recovered, currently trading at $20.93 with a market cap of $137 million. AUCTION is ranked as the 363rd-largest crypto asset by market cap.

This development comes as USDC becomes the first dollar-backed stablecoin approved for circulation under Japan’s stablecoin regulatory framework. Circle’s entry into the Japanese market is facilitated through its local entity, Circle Japan KK, and strategic partnerships, including a joint venture with SBI Holdings. Circle Launches USDC in Japan With SBI According to a recent blog post , Circle has received formal approval to launch the USDC stablecoin in Japan. The approval was granted by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) under the country’s updated stablecoin regulations. USDC is the first and only global dollar stablecoin approved for use in Japan. This sets a precedent for other stablecoins seeking entry into Japan’s regulated financial system. SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, will lead the initial launch of USDC on March 26. The launch will mark the start of the integration of the stablecoin across the country’s digital asset exchanges. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, remarked “We are honored to bring USDC to businesses and consumers in the market, and with Circle Japan KK and the strong support of SBI Holdings and leading exchanges, USDC is positioned as a secure and transparent digital dollar that meets the needs of Japan’s evolving digital economy.” Major Japanese Exchanges Set to List USDC Alongside SBI VC Trade, other major exchanges in Japan are preparing to offer the USDC stablecoin. Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer are among the top exchanges that plan to support USDC trading soon. Consequently, the move will improve the liquidity and availability of the stablecoin within Japan’s digital asset market. These platforms will enable both retail and institutional users to access USDC through regulated channels. The partnerships represent an effort to integrate Circle’s financial infrastructure into Japan’s digital economy. The listings are part of a broader strategy to support the compliant use of stablecoins in payments and settlements. President & CEO of SBI Holdings, Yoshitaka Kitao added, “We believe this initiative will enhance financial accessibility and drive digital asset innovation, aligning with our broader vision for the future of payments and blockchain-based finance in Japan.” Circle’s local presence through Circle Japan KK allows it to work directly with exchange operators. This structure supports regulatory compliance and operational alignment with Japanese financial standards. USDC Utility in Digital Finance Circle’s entry into Japan includes plans to support a wider range of use cases for USDC. These include payments, settlements, cross-border finance, and treasury operations. Additionally, stablecoin issuer will work with financial institutions and technology providers to develop new applications for digital dollars. This effort aims to strengthen the local digital finance ecosystem. Circle is positioning USDC as a fully-reserved, transparent, and compliant stablecoin. The reserves are held in cash and cash-equivalent assets at regulated institutions, with monthly third-party attestations. Meanwhile, the stablecoin issuer recently established a local entity in Dubai to meet regulatory standards and support its operations within the Dubai International Financial Centre.

XRP is expected to witness one last price correction before it rallies to a new ATH of $4. XRP Price Witnessing Corrective Structures Before New ATH In a TradingView post , Prophecy Trading highlighted the XRP price as one of the crypto assets currently experiencing a corrective structure. He remarked that XRP is showing strength despite this structure, and its current patterns align with historical market cycles . Specifically, the analyst noted that these patterns resemble the price action from September 2017 , a final wave 5 rally. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the altcoin could rally to a new ATH of $4.5 next month. While giving a technical breakdown of the its price action, Prophecy Trading noted that the altcoin has remained resilient, consolidating instead of breaking down, which indicates a strong underlying structure. He then proceeded to provide a macro market alignment, highlighting the parallel with the 2017 bull run. The crypto analyst noted that the XRP price’s correction phase now mirrors its 2017 structure, aligning with the moment before its parabolic move. He also alluded to the stock market correlation , noting that the broader macro trends, including the mega-cap stock movements, also support the prediction of one last rally before the cycle concludes for XRP and other assets. Prophecy Trading affirmed that if historical patterns hold, a wave 5 blow-off top could occur for the price. If that happens, he remarked that there would be a broad market rally leading to a final euphoric push. Momentum Has Shifted For Price In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades revealed that there is a bullish divergence forming on the RSI for the XRP price, which means momentum may be shifting even though the price has not reacted. She added that sellers are exhausted and that buyers may step in. CasiTrades noted that the the asset’s price is holding strong, having reached the 0.618 golden retracement at $2.36. She added that this area acts as a pivotal support level and could mark the wave 4 bottom in the subwave Elliot Wave count . If that is the case, the analyst predicts that the next wave up would target higher highs, with the resistance at $2.70. She revealed that the key levels to watch are $2.36, which is the current support; $2.70, which is the local resistance to flip; $3.05 and $3.40, which are the macro continuation targets; and $3.80, which is the all-time high test. CasiTrades affirmed that the larger bullish structure remains valid, and a breakout could soon occur. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.45, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Altcoin|CasiTrades|Coinmarketcap|Elliot Wave Count|Golden Retracement|Prophecy|Stock Market|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-25 00:30:05

Ongoing debate has focused on how the coins could be vulnerable to the kind of bank runs that paralyzed the financial system during past financial crises. Bloomberg noted that the Trump administration and Congress were both pushing to cement the growing importance of stablecoins, with two bills designed to give stablecoins a bigger role in the global payments infrastructure already running through the House and Senate. Washington’s interest, including vocal support from President Donald Trump, helped encourage the steady flow of new money into the stablecoins sector—even as other sectors of the crypto industry struggled—bringing the total value to over $230B. However, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that the bill lacked the basic safeguards necessary to ensure that stablecoins did not blow up the entire financial system. She added that the bill allowed stablecoin issuers to invest in risky assets, including assets that were bailed out in 2008. The Reserve Primary Fund broke its intended peg to the dollar as investors lost confidence in the $785M in Lehman Brothers’ debt backing it, which triggered the broader run on money-market funds that spread chaos through the financial system. Stablecoin bill faces systemic bank run risk President Trump’s latest push for stablecoin regulation at the Digital Asset Summit signalled major catalysts ahead for crypto markets. The Senate Banking Committee voted 18-6 on March 13th to advance the bill regulating stablecoin. GC Cooke, the founder and CEO of Brava, claimed that banks were desperately launching stablecoins to save themselves, adding that JP Morgan, Citi, and Charles Schwab knew what was coming. However, Senator Warren expressed less faith in the bill, saying that anyone who thought the U.S. taxpayer would not be called on–whether directly or indirectly–to bail out these guys was kidding themselves. Reportedly, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Financial Stability Oversight Council called attention to these run risks in multiple papers published last year, and various central bankers have spoken about the risks in recent speeches. “If a run on a large stablecoin were to occur, liquidation of the assets backing the stablecoin could be disruptive, especially if those assets were linked to other funding markets.” -Lisa D. Cook, a governor on the Federal Reserve’s board Matthew Bisanz, a financial regulatory partner at Mayer Brown, doubted whether a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin that is denominated in U.S. dollars could be vulnerable to a run because the coin can always pay the redeemer in U.S. dollars. He, however, acknowledged that if those dollars were deposited at a bank and the bank needed to liquidate assets to fund withdrawals by the stablecoin holders, then there could be a run. But that would be the same type of run that could happen to any fractional reserve depository.

During a March 11 hearing, lawmakers dug into how stablecoins could jazz up payments without Uncle Sam breathing down our necks.

If the bill is passed, stablecoin issuers would need to be licensed and back their tokens one-to-one with approved assets like cash, short-term US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and money-market funds. However, a professor emeritus at George Washington University Law School, Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., published a policy report last month calling attention to some of the vulnerabilities that the proposed legislation did not address. Wilmarth pointed out that even safe, short-term US Treasury bills, which would be allowed into reserves in the proposed legislation, were vulnerable to bank runs and had been frozen up during previous crises. He also noted that Circle’s USDC only managed to recover its peg in 2023 after federal regulators stepped in to cover all of Silicon Valley Bank’s uninsured depositors. Former Federal Reserve board member Nellie Liang held a different opinion, saying that the recent amendments to the GENIUS Act would force stablecoin issuers to hold cash-like assets, which should be safe even in the run. She added that reserve assets had to be ‘very safe and very liquid’ for stablecoins to function without causing or posing risk to financial stability, Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Users of the prediction markets platform can now deposit funds into their Polymarket wallet with SOL. Polymarket Unveils Solana Deposits After Integration After weeks of speculation, Polymarket rolled out Solana (SOL) deposits for users of the platform. According to a post on X , users can now fund their Polymarket wallets with SOL, a key upgrade in the quest toward expansion. “Starting today, you can now make deposits into your Polymarket wallet using Solana,” read the announcement. Prior to the integration with Solana, Polymarket users could only fund their accounts with Circle’s USDC stablecoin. The push to embrace SOL deposits aligns with Polymarket’s desire to increase platform activity using a fast-rising blockchain. SOL, the sixth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $71.6 billion, has an active ecosystem that sizzles with activity. Onchain data indicates active wallets reaching 11 million amid rising daily trading volumes for SOL. While Polymarket reached 450,000 monthly active users in early 2025, activity on the prediction market platform has waned. The platform’s integration with Solana will open it to a new demographic beyond stablecoin users. Solana Rallies By 6% Following The Announcement In the minutes following Polymarket’s integration, Solana’s price spiked by nearly 7% to trade at $140. On the seven-day charts, Solana is coasting on a 10% upswing as it puts claims for a steep correction behind it. SOL daily trading volumes have soared by an incredible 143% over the last day to settle at $4.18 billion. Experts are terming the spike as the catalyst for SOL to reach $1,000 after weeks of consolidation. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has backed Layer 1 blockchains over Layer 2 solutions, noting heightened security and speed. Polymarket’s integration follows Yakovenko’s expression of regret over a controversial Solana ad , apologizing to the community for dabbling in “culture wars.” “The ad was bad, and it’s still gnawing at my soul,” said Yakovenko. “I am ashamed I downplayed it instead of just calling it what it is – mean and punching down on a marginal group.” The post Polymarket Integrates Solana, Enables Deposits With SOL appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|Polymarket|Solana (SOL)|Solana Price,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|USDC,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-25 00:57:39
