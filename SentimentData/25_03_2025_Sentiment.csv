He believes this decision is a turning point that will help unlock opportunities in the US market, which has historically been challenging for crypto firms due to regulatory hurdles. Speaking in an interview, Garlinghouse said the SEC’s decision to end its regulatory investigation into Ripple was significant. He noted that Ripple was one of the first crypto companies to face the SEC’s lawsuit, and that the company had incurred over $150 million in legal fees to fight the case. Despite the long battle, he expressed relief at the outcome, noting that it allows Ripple and the wider crypto industry to move forward with greater clarity and confidence. “It took longer than we wanted to prove that the SEC was on the wrong side of the law and history, but we are excited about the outcome,” Garlinghouse said. “This allows us to really unlock a U.S. market that has been very hostile to the crypto industry.” Related News: Important Interest Rate Statements from US President Donald Trump and FED Official Bostic - Is a Rate Cut on the Way? While Ripple faces regulatory challenges in the U.S., the company has focused its efforts overseas, with around 95% of its customers now made up of financial institutions outside the U.S. The company has partnerships with major banks and payment providers, including HSBC and BBVA. Garlinghouse also pointed to Japan as a promising market where Ripple technology adoption is increasing. “Markets like Japan are still being unlocked,” he said. “The global cross-border payments market is huge and there is a significant opportunity to modernize this market beyond the outdated SWIFT network.” Garlinghouse noted that the regulatory change in the US has already started to increase local interest in Ripple. He explained that since President Donald Trump’s election, Ripple has signed more deals in the US in the six weeks it has done in the previous six months. “These are very innovative technologies in terms of how they will reorganize the financial infrastructure of the United States for 10 to 20 years,” he explained, adding: “From payments to real estate and securities transactions, crypto is poised to reshape these industries.” Despite the positive momentum, Garlinghouse also said regulatory clarity is needed. Lawmakers including Senator Cynthia Lummis and Representative French Hill are working to define clear distinctions between cryptocurrencies, which are classified as commodities and securities. “Providing clear guidelines will allow financial institutions to engage with crypto with greater confidence,” Garlinghouse said. “The US has lagged behind global leaders in this space, but the tide is turning and we need to invest in our domestic industry.” *This is not investment advice.

42288022,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142851,1742856609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Whale’s Colossal $213M Binance Withdrawal Sparks Market Speculation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-binance-withdrawal/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The ever-watchful eyes of the blockchain have spotted a significant movement. A Bitcoin whale, a term we use for individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, has just executed a massive withdrawal from one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, Binance. Let’s dive into what this colossal transaction entails and what it might mean for the volatile crypto market. Decoding the Whale’s $213M Binance Withdrawal: What Happened? According to the eagle-eyed blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, a crypto whale initiated a withdrawal of 2,425 BTC from Binance within a mere 10-hour window. At current valuations, this staggering amount of Bitcoin is worth approximately $213 million. That’s not pocket change, even in the crypto world! Here’s a quick breakdown: Transaction: Withdrawal of Bitcoin (BTC) Amount: 2,425 BTC Exchange: Binance Value: Approximately $213 million (USD) Reporting Source: Lookonchain (via X, formerly Twitter) Timeframe: Within 10 hours It’s important to understand that these large transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, making them visible to tracking services like Lookonchain. This transparency is a core feature of blockchain technology, allowing us to observe these significant financial maneuvers in near real-time. Why Does a Massive Bitcoin Whale Transaction Grab Headlines? You might be wondering, “So what? People move money around all the time.” And you’d be right. However, in the crypto sphere, particularly with Bitcoin, whale movements are closely scrutinized for several key reasons: Market Impact: Large Bitcoin holders possess the power to influence market prices. Selling off a substantial amount of BTC can potentially trigger price drops, while moving it to cold storage might be interpreted as a long-term bullish signal. Market Sentiment Indicator: Whale activity is often seen as a barometer of market sentiment. Are whales accumulating, suggesting they anticipate price increases? Or are they distributing their holdings, perhaps signaling a potential downturn? Early Warning Signals: Monitoring whale transactions can sometimes provide early hints of broader market trends or shifts in investor confidence. However, it’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions. A Binance withdrawal of this magnitude doesn’t automatically guarantee immediate market chaos or a sudden price surge. There are numerous reasons why a whale might move such a large sum. Decoding the Intent: What’s Behind This Binance Withdrawal ? Speculation is rife whenever a significant crypto transaction occurs. Let’s explore some potential reasons behind this Bitcoin whale ‘s $213 million move: Possible Reasons Potential Market Interpretation Cold Storage: Moving BTC to a secure, offline wallet for long-term holding. Potentially bullish; suggests long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. OTC Deals: Preparing for over-the-counter (OTC) trades, which are large, private transactions typically executed outside of exchanges. Neutral to slightly bullish; indicates significant private market activity. Diversification: Shifting funds to other cryptocurrencies or asset classes. Potentially bearish for Bitcoin if the whale is reducing BTC holdings in favor of alternatives. Regulatory Concerns: Moving funds due to evolving regulatory landscapes in certain jurisdictions. Mixed; could be bearish if perceived as a lack of confidence in exchange security or regulatory compliance, but could also be neutral if simply proactive risk management. Personal Reasons: Whales, like any investors, have diverse financial strategies and needs. The withdrawal could be for personal or business-related purposes unrelated to market speculation. Neutral; no direct market signal. As you can see, deciphering the exact motivation behind a whale’s move is often guesswork. Without direct insight into the whale’s intentions, we’re left to analyze the transaction within the broader context of the crypto market . Navigating Market Speculation: Market Impact of Whale Moves The immediate market impact of this Binance withdrawal remains to be seen. While large withdrawals can sometimes precede periods of price stability or even upward movement (if interpreted as a move to long-term storage), they don’t always dictate immediate market direction. Here’s what to keep in mind regarding potential market reactions: Broader Market Conditions: The overall health of the crypto market, macroeconomic factors, and global events play a much larger role in price fluctuations than individual whale transactions. Exchange Flows: It’s important to look at net exchange flows – are more Bitcoins flowing into or out of exchanges in general? This provides a broader picture of market sentiment. Order Books and Liquidity: The depth and liquidity of Bitcoin order books on exchanges will influence how easily large sell orders (if any were to follow this withdrawal) could be absorbed without causing significant price slippage. Media Narrative: How news outlets and social media interpret and amplify this event can also influence short-term market reactions, regardless of the underlying fundamentals. Key Takeaways: What Does This Mean for You and the Crypto Market ? So, what should you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, make of this $213 million Bitcoin whale withdrawal from Binance ? Stay Informed, Not Alarmed: Whale transactions are part of the crypto ecosystem. Stay informed about these movements, but avoid knee-jerk reactions based solely on single transactions. Look at the Bigger Picture: Analyze whale activity in conjunction with broader market trends, news, and technical indicators. Don’t isolate this single event. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never make investment decisions based solely on headlines or speculation. Conduct thorough research and understand your own risk tolerance. Volatility is Inherent: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Whale movements are just one factor contributing to this volatility. In conclusion, while the $213 million Bitcoin whale withdrawal from Binance is undoubtedly a noteworthy event, it’s essential to view it within a balanced perspective. It’s a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the constant interplay of various factors influencing price movements. Keep your eyes on the market, stay informed, and remember that responsible investing involves careful analysis and a long-term perspective.

42288413,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142854,1742857206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Grim Inflation Forecast: Federal Reserve Warns 2% Target Delayed Until 2027,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/grim-inflation-forecast-fed-2027/,"Are you bracing for continued economic uncertainty? Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic has delivered a sobering update on the battle against inflation, suggesting the fight will be longer and harder than previously anticipated. For those navigating the volatile cryptocurrency markets, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is crucial. Let’s dive into Bostic’s concerning inflation forecast and what it could mean for you. Dashed Hopes: 2% Inflation Target Pushed to 2027 In a recent statement that has financial markets buzzing, Raphael Bostic indicated that the Federal Reserve’s cherished 2% inflation target is unlikely to be achieved until early 2027. This is a significant revision, pushing back previous estimates and signaling a more persistent inflationary environment than many had hoped for. Previous Expectations vs. Reality: Earlier projections suggested a return to the 2% target sooner, but persistent inflationary pressures are proving more stubborn. Bostic’s Stance: Despite the extended timeline, Bostic reiterated the importance of reaching the 2% goal, underscoring the Fed’s commitment to price stability. Impact on Crypto: Prolonged high inflation can erode the purchasing power of fiat currencies, potentially making assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more attractive as hedges. Interest Rate Cuts: Fewer and Further Between? The prospect of interest rate cuts has been a closely watched indicator for investors across all markets, including crypto. Bostic’s latest remarks suggest a recalibration of expectations regarding monetary policy easing. Initially, the market anticipated two rate cuts this year. However, Bostic now suggests that only one rate cut is likely. This reduced pace of easing reflects the ongoing struggle to tame inflation. Here’s a breakdown of the evolving outlook: Timeline Previous Expectation Current Outlook (Bostic) 2024 Rate Cuts Two One Inflation Target 2% Earlier than 2027 Early 2027 Fed Response to Economic Weakness Aggressive easing Responsive easing This shift in expectations could influence cryptocurrency markets. Higher interest rates typically make riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, less appealing compared to safer, yield-bearing investments. Conversely, anticipation of rate cuts can fuel bullish sentiment in the crypto space. The Federal Reserve’s Balancing Act: Economic Outlook and Inflation Bostic’s comments reflect the delicate balancing act the Federal Reserve is currently undertaking. The central bank is tasked with managing inflation while also ensuring the health of the broader economy. The economic outlook remains uncertain, and the Fed must navigate these choppy waters carefully. According to Bostic, the Fed remains data-dependent and will respond as needed if the economy weakens. This suggests a flexible approach, but the primary focus appears to be firmly on controlling inflation, even if it means delaying rate cuts and potentially slowing economic growth. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors: Monitor Inflation Data: Keep a close watch on inflation reports (CPI, PCE) as these will heavily influence the Fed’s decisions and market reactions. Interest Rate Sensitivity: Understand how changes in interest rate expectations can impact crypto asset valuations. Higher rates can create headwinds, while lower rates can provide tailwinds. Economic Resilience: Assess the overall economic outlook. A weakening economy could prompt a more dovish Fed stance, potentially becoming positive for risk assets like crypto in the medium term, despite initial negative reactions to growth concerns. Long-Term Perspective: Bostic’s 2027 inflation timeline is a long-term forecast. Crypto investors should maintain a long-term perspective, considering that short-term volatility is inherent in these markets. Navigating the Economic Headwinds: What’s Next? President Bostic’s revised inflation forecast serves as a stark reminder that the fight against rising prices is far from over. The path to the 2% target is proving to be longer and more arduous than initially hoped. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, this economic backdrop requires careful consideration and strategic planning. The reduced likelihood of aggressive interest rate cuts in the near term means that the environment may remain challenging for risk assets. However, the inherent characteristics of cryptocurrencies, such as their decentralized nature and potential as inflation hedges, could still make them attractive in the long run. Staying informed, adapting to evolving economic data, and maintaining a balanced investment approach will be key to navigating these uncertain times.

42288670,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-eyes-1-milestone-as-eth-shib-face-tough-hurdles-ahead-of-2025-mainnet-launch/,1742857224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/42288670.jpeg,BlockDAG Eyes $1 Milestone as ETH & SHIB Face Tough Hurdles Ahead of 2025 Mainnet Launch,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-eyes-1-milestone-as-eth-shib-face-tough-hurdles-ahead-of-2025-mainnet-launch/,"Recent analysis of Shiba Inu (SHIB) prices reveals ongoing attempts to surpass the $0.00001240 mark. However, consistent selling pressure has managed to keep the price under control. Ethereum (ETH) is also struggling. Since December 2024, it has lost over half its value, leading to concerns about further price drops as traders speculate on the possibility of reaching a new low. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is preparing for its 2025 mainnet launch. The altcoin has seen a remarkable 2,380% increase since its first presale batch. As its network becomes operational, it’s expected to attract significant institutional attention, reduce available supply, and push prices upward. Market experts believe BDAG could reach $1 following the launch, positioning it as a prime crypto purchase today before it escalates further. SHIB Price: Can Bulls Break $0.00001240? Recent Shiba Inu price evaluations point to a crucial period as the price fluctuates within a specific range. SHIB has challenged the $0.00001240 resistance level several times but faced selling pressure, leading to price retractions toward the $0.00001180 support level. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have recently shown overbought conditions, coinciding with price resistance, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests a shift toward bearish momentum. Previous movements indicated a slight recovery when SHIB found support at lower levels. As traders keep an eye on these indicators, the future direction of SHIB prices remains a focal point for market analysts. ETH Price: Has It Hit Bottom? The current price trend for Ethereum indicates continuing uncertainty, with the cryptocurrency lingering near its recent lows. Having shed over 50% of its value since December 2024, ETH faces the possibility of further declines, sparking debates among analysts about whether it has bottomed out. A particular concern is Ethereum’s pricing relative to Bitcoin, which has dropped to its lowest ETH/BTC ratio since mid-2020. If Bitcoin’s value decreases further, it could drag down Ethereum’s dollar value even more. Although some predict a recovery later in 2025, Ethereum’s current market position remains precarious and demands careful analysis. BlockDAG’s Mainnet Launch Approaches—Will It Reach $1 Soon? BlockDAG’s upcoming 2025 mainnet launch signifies its evolution from a successful presale crypto to a fully functional ecosystem. A presale indicates market demand, but a live network demonstrates actual performance. Early adopters have secured over 18.8 billion BDAG coins, contributing to $205 million in total sales, making it one of the largest crypto presales ever. As the launch approaches, substantial BDAG holdings are expected to grow, boosting liquidity. This development moves the altcoin beyond mere speculation, establishing it as a network with tangible utility and a viable economy. Institutional stakeholders typically position themselves ahead of significant market changes, securing their stakes before retail buyers become involved. The transition of BlockDAG to a publicly traded entity is likely to attract considerable capital from venture capitalists and affluent buyers, securing supplies before demand surges. Once BDAG begins trading freely across various exchanges, supply restrictions could tighten further. Large stakeholders are less inclined to sell, decreasing availability and increasing price pressures. Retail buyers who wait for clear signals may encounter much higher entry prices as demand grows and trading volumes increase. The value of BDAG has already increased by 2,380%, rising from $0.001 in its initial batch to $0.0248 in the latest Batch 27. Analysts foresee a significant price adjustment ahead, with projections of reaching $1 by 2025 and potential peaks of over $20 by 2027. BDAG’s current valuation remains a small fraction of its anticipated worth, reinforcing its status as a top crypto to buy today before market dynamics and institutional involvement transform the landscape. Key Insights on SHIB, ETH, & BlockDAG Shiba Inu continues to struggle within a tight range, with analysis indicating repeated challenges at the $0.00001240 resistance. Conversely, Ethereum is still seeking stability. After a 50% fall, its price struggles to establish a definitive low, and while a rebound is possible, the market remains uncertain. BlockDAG, however, is not waiting for the market to stabilize. With a 2,380% increase since its first presale batch, it is outperforming most projects even before its mainnet launch. Once BDAG becomes operational, its value is expected to skyrocket. Market analysts are already targeting a $1 value for 2025, a significant rise from its current price in Batch 27, making BDAG the top crypto to consider purchasing today.

The ETFs are expected to launch later this year, pending regulatory approval and the signing of a definitive agreement. In addition to the ETFs, Trump Media plans to introduce Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) under the Truth.Fi brand. This will provide investors with more tailored investment options. Complementing the Trump Brand With WLFI Still, the ETFs and SMAs will be part of TMTG’s broader financial strategy, which includes an investment of up to $250 million. These funds will be custodied by Charles Schwab, a major financial institution, ensuring a structured and secure investment framework.

Imagine creating a rug that perfectly matches your vision, all through the power of AI! This isn’t just about adding another product line; it’s about democratizing design. Arcade is leveraging the power of models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, making sophisticated design tools accessible to everyone. This move signifies a broader trend of AI integration across various sectors, and for those in the crypto space, it mirrors the decentralized and accessible ethos many projects champion. ‘Match My Room’: AI-Powered Personalization One of the standout features accompanying this expansion is “Match My Room.” This clever tool lets you upload a photo of your room, and the AI platform analyzes the existing décor to generate rug designs that harmonize with your space’s color palette and style. Here’s a quick look at how ‘Match My Room’ enhances the design process: Color Harmony: Ensures your new rug complements your existing furniture and wall colors. Style Integration: AI understands the overall style of your room to suggest suitable rug designs. Visual Preview: Get a visual idea of how the rug will look in your space before making a purchase. While the AI is adept at color matching, it’s worth noting that replicating intricate patterns from existing décor is still a developing area. However, as a tool for ensuring color coordination, ‘Match My Room’ is incredibly useful. This feature embodies the user-centric approach that is becoming increasingly vital in the tech world, much like the focus on user experience in successful crypto platforms. Funding Fuels Future Growth: $42 Million Raised To propel this expansion and further platform development, Arcade has announced a successful $25 million Series A funding round . This brings their total funding to an impressive $42 million. This significant capital injection speaks volumes about investor confidence in Arcade’s vision and potential within the burgeoning AI-driven design market. Here’s a breakdown of what the funding will be used for: Area Purpose Hiring Expanding the team to support growth and innovation. Platform Development Enhancing existing features and developing new AI-powered tools. New Product Categories Expanding beyond rugs and jewelry to include ceramics, pillows, and potentially apparel and leather goods. This funding round was led by prominent investors like Laura Chau from Canaan Partners and Kirsten Green from Forerunner, further validating Arcade’s market position and future prospects. The involvement of such established names highlights the growing interest in AI-powered commerce solutions. Designing Your Dream Rug: How it Works Creating your custom rug on the Arcade AI platform is a straightforward and engaging process: Material Selection: Choose from a range of rug materials, starting with affordable options like hand-tufted wool and extending to luxury materials like cashmere and alpaca. Text Prompt Input: Describe your desired rug design using a text prompt. Think of it as instructing the AI artist. AI Generation: Arcade’s AI, powered by Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, generates rug designs based on your prompt. Sample Approval: Once you’ve chosen a design, Arcade connects you with a manufacturer who sends you a free sample for approval before you commit to a purchase. While prices for rugs start at around $400, Arcade emphasizes offering more accessible luxury compared to traditional high-end retailers. This approach of blending AI-driven customization with accessible pricing could be a winning formula in the evolving e-commerce landscape. More Than Just Design: Dream Boards and Seller Programs Arcade isn’t just about creating and buying; it’s fostering a community of design enthusiasts. The “Dream Boards” feature functions like Pinterest boards, allowing users to curate and share collections of products based on themes. This social aspect enhances user engagement and discovery within the platform. For those looking to monetize their creativity, Arcade offers a seller program. Users can earn a 5% commission on each sale of their designs, up from the previous 2.5%. An affiliate program and an entrepreneur program further incentivize content creators and influencers to participate and earn higher commission rates. This is akin to the creator economy principles seen in many blockchain-based platforms, rewarding users for their contributions. Early Success and Future Categories Despite being in beta for its jewelry offering since September 2024, Arcade boasts an impressive 650,000 jewelry designs generated. While purchase data and seller earnings remain undisclosed, the design generation numbers are a strong indicator of user engagement and the platform’s appeal. Looking ahead, Arcade plans to introduce ceramics and pillows as new product categories, with potential expansions into apparel and leather goods hinted at by founder Mariam Naficy. Chain belts are also mentioned as a near-future addition. This continuous expansion strategy suggests Arcade is aiming to become a comprehensive home goods and lifestyle design platform, powered by AI. Conclusion: The Future of Design is AI-Powered Arcade’s expansion into rug design and home goods is a compelling example of how generative AI is moving beyond niche applications and entering mainstream consumer markets. By combining user-friendly design tools with AI-driven personalization and a focus on accessible luxury, Arcade is positioning itself at the forefront of the future of design and e-commerce.

With Stellar pushing aggressive network upgrades, Tezos launching high-impact community initiatives, and Qubetics flipping the table with real-world asset tokenization, 2025’s crypto scene isn’t just buzzing—it’s blowing up. Community members who’ve been watching from the sidelines are now eyeing which project might actually become the next crypto to hit $1. And with prices shifting fast and narratives evolving daily, it’s time to unpack what’s real, what’s hype, and what could be the most slept-on opportunity this year. While Stellar and Tezos are rolling out new campaigns with bold moves, Qubetics is coming in hot with something totally different. It’s not just another token promising big things—it’s building a complete ecosystem where physical and digital assets can finally break free from the traditional finance bottleneck. The Qubetics marketplace is bridging the gap between blockchain tech and everyday utility in a way that past projects just couldn’t nail. And with its fast-moving presale and jaw-dropping ROI projections, there’s a reason people are saying Qubetics might be the next crypto to hit $1—and sooner than expected. Real Utility in Action: How Qubetics Bridges the Digital and Physical World Qubetics isn’t just another coin trying to ride the wave—it’s solving actual, long-standing headaches in the asset world. Its biggest power move? A tokenized asset marketplace that lets people and businesses fractionalize everything from real estate to rare collectibles into tradable digital tokens. That means more people can now afford to own a piece of previously out-of-reach assets—think: someone in their 20s buying into prime real estate or an independent creator tokenizing intellectual property without needing a middleman. All of this is happening in a secure, scalable environment designed to cater to every type of user. This isn’t theory—it’s infrastructure. Qubetics functions as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, meaning it’s bringing multiple leading blockchains into one unified system. That kind of backend magic translates to fewer silos and more seamless transactions. For example, a local business could tokenize part of its equity for community funding, while a farmer in another country could tokenize commodity yields to gain access to better liquidity. It’s a global fix for a very global problem—and exactly the type of utility play that makes Qubetics a serious contender for the next crypto to hit $1. Qubetics Presale ROI: Why This Might Be the Next Crypto to Hit $1 The Qubetics presale isn’t just active—it’s exploding. Sitting at Stage 27 with a current token price of $0.1300, this presale has already raised over $15.4 million with 503 million $TICS tokens sold and more than 23,700 holders jumping in. Here’s where it gets wild: each presale stage only lasts 7 days, and by every Sunday at 12 AM, the price jumps by 10%. And yeah, you read that right—every. single. week. The return projections are jaw-dropping. If you grabbed $TICS today and it reaches just $1, that’s a 669.13% ROI. At $5? You’re looking at a 3,745.67% ROI. Stretch that to $6 or $10 and you’re talking 4,514.80% and 7,591.33% respectively. And if $TICS hits $15 after the Q2 2025 mainnet launch, we’re talking a legendary 11,437% ROI. For example, if someone drops $100 right now, they’d get 769 tokens. If $TICS reaches $15, that’s a staggering $11,437 return. With the Qubetics presale moving this fast and returns this bold, it’s already being talked about as the best crypto presale of the year—and possibly the next crypto to hit $1 before some even realize what’s happening. Stellar Goes Full Speed with Network Upgrades and Ecosystem Boosts Stellar’s not holding back this year. According to CoinCentral, it’s been pushing hard to make its network faster and leaner. One of the biggest changes includes the implementation of Soroban, a native smart contracts platform designed to elevate decentralized finance and app-building on Stellar. This isn’t some far-off idea—it’s already live, making Stellar’s infrastructure way more attractive to developers who’ve been hesitant in the past. These moves are part of a broader effort to decentralize power and drive user adoption in real-world scenarios. But that’s not the only shift in gear. Stellar has also introduced fee reductions and throughput enhancements, which make transactions not just cheaper, but smoother and way more scalable. These network upgrades come at a critical time when Ethereum gas fees continue to be a roadblock for everyday users. With all of this happening, Stellar isn’t just tweaking things—it’s setting itself up to compete directly with more mainstream smart contract platforms. Tezos’ Trailblazers Program Sets the Stage for Long-Term Impact Tezos has officially rolled out its boldest move yet: the Trailblazers initiative. According to Blockchain.News, this program is designed to onboard creators, developers, and projects into the Tezos ecosystem with a focus on grassroots growth. Backed by a clear $15 million commitment, this campaign isn’t about flashy marketing—it’s about building real infrastructure and user bases from the ground up. The initiative focuses on three main tracks: creative arts, real-world asset tokenization, and DAO tooling—all huge in terms of blockchain’s future. The Trailblazers campaign comes with grants, hackathons, mentorship, and even long-term collaboration opportunities. The network is tapping into talent hubs in North America, Latin America, and emerging markets, helping bring diverse perspectives and regional adoption into the picture. The idea is to expand beyond traditional crypto communities and build meaningful use cases around the Tezos blockchain. With a strong emphasis on user empowerment and ecosystem decentralization, this move could reposition Tezos as not just another smart contract chain, but one of the most forward-thinking platforms heading into 2025. Why All Eyes Are on These Three: The Final Word In a year where every token is shouting for attention, only a few are actually putting in the work. Qubetics is rolling out a real-world marketplace with utility that goes beyond speculation, and its presale numbers and ROI projections alone make it a major contender for the next crypto to hit $1. Stellar, meanwhile, is delivering big-time with smart contract innovations and leaner, faster infrastructure. And Tezos? It’s making grassroots cool again with its Trailblazers initiative, setting the tone for real growth. Whether someone’s watching for long-term development, network upgrades, or explosive entry points, these three are commanding attention. Now might just be the best time to join this crypto presale, especially for those hunting down the best crypto presale, crypto pre sale, or top crypto presale before the wave hits. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics the next crypto to hit $1?

42289259,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142896,1742858459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Workflow Automation: Fair-Code Pioneer n8n Secures $60M Funding,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-workflow-automation-n8n-funding/,"The world of developer tools is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Companies that empower developers to seamlessly integrate AI into their workflows are not just gaining traction; they are experiencing explosive growth. n8n, a startup pronounced “enay-ten,” stands as a prime example. By strategically pivoting its workflow automation platform to embrace AI in 2022, n8n witnessed a staggering 5X surge in revenue, with growth doubling in just the last two months. This phenomenal success has culminated in a fresh injection of capital. Bitcoin World has confirmed that n8n has successfully raised €55 million ($60 million) in Series B funding, valuing the company at approximately €250 million ($270 million), according to sources close to the deal. This significant funding round underscores the immense potential and investor confidence in AI-driven workflow automation solutions. Explosive Growth in AI Workflow Automation Drives n8n’s $60M Funding Based in Berlin, n8n now boasts an impressive portfolio of over 3,000 enterprise clients and around 200,000 active users. This Series B funding round, led by Highland Europe, with participation from HV Capital and existing investors Sequoia, Felicis, and Harpoon, will be instrumental in fueling n8n’s continued technological advancements and strategic expansion into key markets like the U.S., which already accounts for more than half of its user base. While n8n keeps its revenue figures private, the substantial customer numbers, encompassing both free and paid subscriptions, speak volumes about its market penetration and the rising demand for efficient AI workflow automation tools. This funding is a testament to the transformative power of AI in reshaping how businesses approach automation. The Rise of Low-Code and No-Code Automation: n8n’s Fair-Code Foundation Founded in 2019, n8n initially gained momentum by catering to developer teams seeking low-code automation and no-code automation solutions. These solutions simplified the intricate process of connecting diverse applications without extensive coding. However, n8n’s unique appeal extended beyond mere technical utility. The company distinguished itself by championing “fair code,” an evolved concept stemming from open source principles. Fair code ensures that while developers can freely utilize open-source code, commercial applications built upon it adhere to principles that fairly compensate the original creators or the open-source community. Jan Oberhauser, n8n’s founder and CEO, is a prominent advocate for fair code, even managing a dedicated website to promote the concept. This commitment to ethical and community-driven development has resonated deeply within the developer community. AI as a Rocket Ship: How AI Integration Fueled n8n’s Success While n8n’s foundation in fair code and its strong open-source community presence, evidenced by over 70,000 GitHub stars, contributed to its initial growth, the integration of AI acted as a true catalyst, propelling the company into hypergrowth. Workflow automation and AI, particularly generative AI, are inherently synergistic. This synergy is also recognized by n8n’s competitors like Tines and Workato, and broader automation players like UiPath. Generative AI elevates automation by minimizing technical complexities, making it even more accessible than traditional low-code or no-code approaches. It streamlines the process of connecting applications and services, reducing the manual effort involved. Natural Language Workflow Automation: Simplifying Development with AI Recognizing the transformative potential of AI early on, Oberhauser and his team began integrating AI into n8n’s platform about a year and a half ago. Their vision was to drastically reduce the coding burden for developers by enabling them to express automation instructions in natural language. Instead of writing lengthy code to perform tasks like sending emails, users can now simply use natural language prompts. Oberhauser describes it as, “It’s a prompt to build workflow.” For instance, users can input instructions like, “get information from X and send it to Y,” and n8n’s AI-powered platform translates this into functional workflow automation . This intuitive, natural language interface significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developers and accelerates the automation process. Fair Code and Community: Pillars of n8n’s Innovative Approach N8n’s product architecture is designed to be compatible with various Large Language Models (LLMs), offering users flexibility and interoperability. This allows users already leveraging specific LLMs to seamlessly integrate them with n8n’s platform. Furthermore, n8n thrives on a vibrant and extensive contributor community. Active on platforms like GitHub and community forums, these contributors provide support, share knowledge, and develop and utilize workflow templates. N8n also offers a library of pre-built workflow templates, further accelerating the adoption and ease of use of its platform. This strong community engagement, coupled with the fair code ethos, creates a powerful ecosystem of collaboration and innovation. The Future is Now: Embracing AI for Workflow Automation Despite the initial hype surrounding AI and generative AI, the adoption of n8n’s AI-powered features was initially slow. However, a tipping point was reached last year, coinciding with a broader surge of interest and investment in AI coding tools, exemplified by companies like Poolside, Codeium, and Magic. End-users also began actively seeking practical applications of AI. Ultimately, n8n’s user-friendliness and tangible utility, combined with the AI revolution, solidified its value proposition for both users and investors. David Blyghton, the Highland Europe general partner who spearheaded the investment, emphasized this point, stating, “Everyone is trying to leverage AI but struggling to find practical use cases. The design, scale, and throughput of n8n is what allows people to adopt it.” Oberhauser confirms that market adoption has caught up, with approximately 75% of n8n’s customers now actively utilizing its AI-powered tools. This remarkable adoption rate underscores the transformative potential of fair code and no-code automation , now amplified by the power of AI.

Despite recent price appreciation, investor wariness remains fueled by skepticism towards long-term upside and saturation. Meanwhile, there's a new star in the altcoin world that's causing serious interest. Remittix (RTX)—a use-case-based cryptocurrency with real-world utility—is seeing increased volume and early investment, and now analysts are calling it one of the most promising projects of the year. Dogecoin Price Soars, but Investors are Cautious Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently priced at $0.1828, 7.41% higher. Its market cap is $27.17 billion, and its trading volume is a whopping 111.95% higher at $1.16 billion. Source: Tradingview Despite the volume spike, investors are staying away. Dogecoin's strong reliance on social media trends and meme culture has turned it into a casualty of brutal pullbacks. Although a continued favorite, DOGE's limited utilization and development keeps the majority of serious investors on the sidelines, requiring more than smoke before justifying new positions. Cardano Gains Strength, But Meets Resistance Cardano (ADA ) is currently at $0.7356, having posted a 4.41% price gain. The token's market capitalization is at $25.92 billion, while its volume is up 72.94% at $883.31 million. Source: Tradingview Cardano is picking up steam with volumes rising, but most investors do not want to buy at this stage. Past slow rollouts and failure to gain traction in DeFi have led some to question its potential for growth. Even with strong fundamentals of ADA, it might not be able to produce explosive growth without some enormous new catalyst—leading most traders to look at newer altcoins with greater potential for upside. Remittix (RTX): The Altcoin With Blazing Volume Growth and Real Utility Remittix (RTX) is also among the fastest-growing altcoins of 2024. Priced at $0.0734, only at the moment, the project has already earned $14 million+ and sold over 521 million tokens already in presale. While DOGE and ADA are already considered by some to be legacy coins, Remittix is just getting started—and that’s where the magic happens. It’s a PayFi solution that gives users and merchants across the globe instant, fee-free crypto-to-fiat transactions. Its application is obvious: freelancers, traders, and consumers globally can accept crypto and make fiat payments in seconds, free and instant. That’s why volume is accelerating so rapidly—and why most investors believe that RTX can return 100x in the next cycle. Why Smart Money Is Rotating Into Remittix Instead Of Meme Coins The meme-pump investors may look at DOGE or even new entrants such as POPCAT. But those looking at real adoption and survival are now looking at tokens such as Remittix. It exceeds hype—it provides function. To illustrate, if a freelancer who's working on a project for a U.S. client can receive payment in crypto and simultaneously exchange the funds for local currency via Remittix’s platform, there's no friction. This focus on actual problem-solving is the reason Remittix is gaining speed so rapidly, and why authorities are calling it the most underappreciated altcoin out there. Join the Remittix Presale Before Listings If you are attempting to identify the next altcoin that possesses what it takes to outperform DOGE and ADA, Remittix could be your best bet. Last Word Dogecoin and Cardano remain major parts of the crypto universe, but their potential may be capped by present valuations and a seasoned investor base. Meanwhile, Remittix is taking the lead, expanding rapidly, and addressing actual problems in the world with its PayFi approach. Investors waiting on DOGE and ADA are already piling into RTX—and based on the volume spike, they’re not the only ones. If you are looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2024, Remittix might be the most explosive one to look out for in the times to come. With demand soaring, the Remittix presale is quickly advancing to the next phase. Early access is a special opportunity to buy at low prices before exchange listings drive prices to lofty heights.

And the application process for companies wishing to obtain operating permits from the regulatory Financial Services Agency is famously complicated. As such, many larger companies have chosen to buy existing exchanges. They have found that M&A deals can be a faster way to launch than starting their own exchanges from scratch. Examples include the NASDAQ-listed Coincheck , which began life as a small startup. Following a crippling 2018 hack, the firm was later bailed out and then taken over by the securities giant Monex Group.

Just when you thought Dogecoin was all about memes and moon shots, the Dogecoin Foundation has dropped a bombshell that signals serious intentions. They’ve officially announced the creation of a substantial DOGE reserve , purchasing a cool 10 million DOGE – that’s about $1.8 million at current prices! This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a strategic move designed to solidify Dogecoin’s position in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Let’s dive into what this means for DOGE and the future of crypto payments. What’s the Buzz Around the Dogecoin Foundation’s DOGE Reserve? The Dogecoin Foundation , the non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the growth and development of Dogecoin, is stepping up its game. This 10 million DOGE reserve isn’t just sitting idly; it’s a deliberate investment aimed at fostering the utility of Dogecoin. Partnering with House of Doge, a project focused on Dogecoin-centric initiatives, the Foundation is sending a clear message: they’re serious about Dogecoin being more than just a meme coin. They envision it as a practical, fast, and reliable Dogecoin payment solution for everyday transactions. Here’s a breakdown of what we know so far: Significant Investment: A 10 million DOGE purchase demonstrates a tangible commitment from the Dogecoin Foundation. Strategic Partnership: Collaboration with House of Doge suggests a coordinated effort to build Dogecoin’s ecosystem. Payment Focus: The initiative is explicitly designed to promote Dogecoin as a viable payment option. Future Announcements: House of Doge hints at upcoming strategic partnerships, suggesting further expansion and integration plans are in the works. Why a Reserve for Dogecoin Payments? You might be wondering, why a reserve specifically? Well, it’s all about building confidence and infrastructure. A dedicated DOGE reserve can be utilized in various ways to support the Dogecoin ecosystem and encourage its use as a Dogecoin payment method. Think of it as a war chest ready to be deployed for initiatives that drive adoption. Here are some potential benefits of establishing this reserve: Funding Development: The reserve could be used to fund development projects aimed at improving Dogecoin’s technology, speed, and scalability. Incentivizing Adoption: It could support programs that incentivize merchants and businesses to accept DOGE as payment. Community Initiatives: The funds could be directed towards community-led projects that promote Dogecoin awareness and usage. Stability and Liquidity: While not its primary purpose, a reserve can contribute to market stability and liquidity in certain situations. DOGE Price Reaction and the ETF Hype: What’s Next? The market reacted positively to the news, with DOGE experiencing a 10% surge, reaching $0.19. However, it’s crucial to keep things in perspective. Despite this recent bump, DOGE is still down 40% over the past four months. The volatility of the cryptocurrency market is always a factor, and while this news is positive, sustained growth requires more than just announcements. Adding another layer of intrigue to the Dogecoin narrative are the three DOGE ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) filings currently under review by the SEC, as reported by The Block. The potential approval of a DOGE ETF could be a game-changer, opening the doors to institutional investment and broader market accessibility. DOGE ETF Filings Under SEC Review: Factor Potential Impact of DOGE ETF Approval Institutional Investment Increased capital inflow from institutional investors seeking crypto exposure. Market Accessibility Easier for traditional investors to invest in DOGE without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Price Volatility Potentially reduced volatility due to larger, more stable investment flows (though crypto volatility is inherent). Mainstream Legitimacy Further validation of Dogecoin as a legitimate digital asset within the financial system. Dogecoin’s Bold Move: A Sign of Maturing Cryptocurrency? The Dogecoin Foundation’s initiative is more than just a positive headline for DOGE; it reflects a broader trend within the cryptocurrency space. As the market matures, we’re seeing a shift from purely speculative investments towards projects with tangible utility and real-world applications. Dogecoin, often seen as the quintessential meme coin, is now actively seeking to solidify its position as a practical payment solution. This reserve is a concrete step in that direction. Key Takeaways: Utility is Key: The focus is shifting towards cryptocurrencies with real-world use cases beyond just trading. Foundation Support Matters: Active foundations are crucial for driving development and adoption within crypto ecosystems. ETFs are a Catalyst: Regulatory developments like ETF approvals can significantly impact market growth and accessibility. Community and Meme Power: Dogecoin’s unique community and meme-driven origins remain a powerful asset in its journey. Conclusion: Is Dogecoin Barking Up the Right Tree? The Dogecoin Foundation’s launch of a 10 million DOGE reserve is undoubtedly a significant development. It signals a serious commitment to making Dogecoin a viable Dogecoin payment option and moves beyond its meme coin origins. While challenges remain, and the volatile crypto market always presents uncertainties, this initiative, coupled with potential ETF approvals, paints a potentially bright future for Dogecoin. Whether this bold leap will truly propel DOGE to mainstream adoption remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Dogecoin is not just sitting back and memeing – it’s actively building and evolving.

The financial products will bear the Truth.fi brand and are expected to appear this year in the United States and abroad. The financial products will be known collectively as America-First Investment Funds and available through Crypto.com’s broker-dealer Foris Capital. They will include funds tracking cryptocurrency as well as “securities with a Made in America focus spanning diverse industries such as energy,” according to a statement . America-First financial products come in a few flavors The ETFs will be launched alongside Truth.Fi Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs). SMAs are managed portfolios created to meet an investor’s specifications. TMTG will invest up to $250 million in the ETFs and SMAs.

Once launched, these ETFs will be available on the Crypto.com App for our more than 140 million users around the world.” Cronos (CRO) is the Crypto.com governance token. CRO traded at $0.080 early on March 24, reached a peak of $0.099 at 11:30 p.m. GMT and settled down to $0.095 at the time of writing.

As its price increases and trading volumes soar, everyone is asking how much a $1,000 investment in Ripple (XRP) today will be worth in five years' time. Alongside XRP, analysts are closely watching Remittix (RTX) , an emerging payment-focused altcoin already making waves. With low entry pricing and strong fundamentals, could RTX outperform XRP over the long haul? XRP Price Prediction: Is $10 Realistic By 2029? Ripple (XRP) is currently trading at $2.46, up 3.02%, with a market cap of $143.61 billion. Its daily trading volume has climbed 65.44% to $3.25 billion, reflecting a resurgence in demand. XRP has been the default blockchain for cross-border financial transactions for a while. With clearer regulatory footing and restored institutional and banking attention, experts are optimistic about its next five years. Conservative forecasts have XRP at $5–$10 by 2029. A $10 XRP price means an investment of $1,000 today turns into roughly $4,000 good growth but not life-changing wealth. Remittix (RTX): The 100x Early-Stage Altcoin Remittix (RTX) is taking the world by storm as one of the most talked-about altcoins in the payment industry. Built on a PayFi model that enables instant, fee-less crypto-to-fiat settlements, RTX has a specific use case for freelancers, digital enterprises and consumers at large. Priced at just $0.0734, Remittix has already raised $14+ million in funding and sold more than 521 million tokens in its presale. Whereas XRP is pushing institutional corridors, Remittix is solving for the individual, allowing users to get paid in cryptocurrency and exchange it to fiat in real-time without intermediaries. Analysts believe RTX has the fundamentals and timing to potentially return up to 100x over the course of the next five years, making it one of the top early-stage altcoins of 2024. $1,000 in Remittix vs XRP: What Could It Be Worth In 2029? A $1,000 investment in XRP today could realistically be worth $3,000-$5,000 in five years if adoption continues to increase and it moves into double digits. Not bad but it pales in comparison to what's available with Remittix. If RTX moves from $0.0734 to even $7, a $1,000 investment today would be worth $95,000. At more ambitious projections of $10+, you're looking at six-figure returns. This enormous potential, combined with Remittix's working payment product, is why traders are calling it this cycle's XRP but with better timing for entry. Why Smart Investors Are Preferring Utility-Driven Altcoins Like Remittix Problem-solving tokens work better. XRP demonstrated as much by making payments center stage but Remittix is rewriting the script with a retail-facing, instant-use experience. With outrageous remittance fees still affecting millions of individuals globally, Remittix offers a low-fee, decentralized alternative. An African or South American freelancer can accept crypto with RTX and trade it for fiat instantly without bank fees or waiting times. That kind of usability is not hype; it's the reason Remittix is receiving serious investment from investors who weren't able to get in on the early XRP, SOL and MATIC runs. How to Buy Remittix (RTX) Before the Price Goes Up Further XRP still has potential, especially as regulatory clarity increases and financial partnerships expand. But its 100x growth days are likely behind it. Remittix, on the other hand, is just beginning. With a clear use case, low token price and expanding presale, RTX could be the best crypto for massive returns over the coming five years. If you're reading this and are wondering where to put your next $1,000 in crypto, consider the token that can turn it into $100,000. Remittix might just be the opportunity you've been waiting for. Remittix is available via its official presale, where early users can get the best rate before exchange listings are launched. With over 521 million tokens sold and increasing demand, the chance to get in early is rapidly diminishing.

A recent survey reveals a compelling trend: a significant majority of financial advisors in the United States are planning to ramp up their exposure to cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a clear signal that the financial establishment is increasingly embracing digital assets, but in a measured and familiar way. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto investment strategy and why financial advisors are turning to crypto ETFs . The Rising Tide of Crypto ETF Investment Among Financial Advisors According to a new report from TMX VettaFi, a noteworthy 57% of financial advisors in the US are set to increase their holdings in crypto ETFs . This data, reported by CoinDesk, stems from a comprehensive survey conducted by TMX VettaFi, a subsidiary of TMX Group. The survey paints a picture of growing confidence and strategic allocation towards digital assets within traditional finance. Interestingly, a substantial 42% of advisors intend to maintain their current positions, indicating a steady belief in their existing crypto allocations. Only a tiny fraction, a mere 1%, expressed plans to reduce their crypto ETF positions. This overwhelmingly positive sentiment underscores a significant shift in how financial professionals are viewing and incorporating cryptocurrencies into their clients’ portfolios. Why the Surge in Crypto ETF Interest from Financial Professionals? What’s driving this bullish outlook on crypto ETFs among financial advisors ? Cinthia Murphy, senior investment strategist at TMX VettaFi, sheds light on the reasons behind this trend. She highlights the appeal of “ crypto equity ETFs ,” which invest in publicly listed companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency industry. Think companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, both frequently cited examples in this space. Murphy points out that these products resonate with advisors because they are “easy to understand and control.” This ease of understanding is crucial for financial advisors who need to explain investment strategies to clients, many of whom may be newer to the world of crypto. Here are some key factors contributing to the increased interest: Familiarity and Regulation: ETFs are well-established investment vehicles with a clear regulatory framework, making them a comfortable entry point into crypto for advisors and clients alike. Diversification within Crypto: Crypto equity ETFs offer diversification by investing in multiple companies related to the crypto ecosystem, rather than directly holding volatile cryptocurrencies. Accessibility and Liquidity: ETFs are easily bought and sold on traditional stock exchanges, providing liquidity and accessibility that direct crypto ownership may lack. Client Demand: Increasing client interest in cryptocurrency exposure is likely prompting advisors to seek out suitable and regulated products like crypto ETFs . Crypto Equity ETFs: A Strategic Avenue for US Market Exposure The focus on crypto equity ETFs is particularly interesting. These ETFs don’t directly hold Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, they provide exposure to the crypto market by investing in companies that are involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This could include: Crypto Miners: Companies involved in the mining of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Crypto Exchanges: Platforms that facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies. Technology Companies with Crypto Holdings: Publicly listed companies that hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets, like Tesla or MicroStrategy. Blockchain Technology Companies: Businesses developing and utilizing blockchain technology across various industries. By investing in crypto equity ETFs , financial advisors can offer their clients exposure to the potential upside of the crypto market while mitigating some of the risks associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership. This approach aligns with a more traditional investment strategy , making it palatable to a broader range of investors and advisors within the US market . Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape: Considerations and Actionable Insights While the survey data is overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial to approach crypto ETFs with informed awareness. Here are some important considerations for both financial advisors and investors: Consideration Details Volatility: Even though crypto equity ETFs offer indirect exposure, they are still subject to the volatility of the underlying crypto market and the performance of the companies they hold. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and related ETFs is still evolving. Changes in regulations can impact the performance and viability of these investments. Company-Specific Risks: Investing in crypto equity ETFs means exposure to the risks associated with the individual companies within the ETF, in addition to broader market risks. Due Diligence: Thorough research and understanding of the specific crypto equity ETFs , their holdings, and their investment strategy are essential before investing. Actionable Insights: For Financial Advisors: Explore crypto equity ETFs as a potential tool to meet growing client demand for crypto exposure in a regulated and familiar format. Conduct thorough due diligence and educate clients about the risks and rewards. For Investors: If you are interested in gaining exposure to the crypto market but prefer a less direct approach, consider researching crypto equity ETFs . Understand the ETF’s holdings and risk profile before investing. Consult with a financial advisor to determine if crypto ETFs align with your overall investment strategy . Conclusion: A Strategic Shift Towards Crypto ETFs The survey data from TMX VettaFi sends a clear message: crypto ETFs are gaining significant traction among financial advisors in the US market . The preference for crypto equity ETFs highlights a strategic and measured approach to incorporating digital assets into portfolios. As the crypto landscape matures and regulatory clarity increases, we can expect this trend of institutional and advisor adoption of crypto ETFs to continue. This is not just about chasing hype; it’s about smart, strategic allocation in a rapidly evolving financial world. The increasing interest from financial advisors in crypto ETFs signals a significant step towards mainstream acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance.

According to House of Doge, the reserve serves as a proof of concept that highlights Dogecoin’s potential for seamless and efficient transactions. “The launch of Dogecoin Reserve is a significant step in House of Doge’s vision to make Dogecoin a fast and reliable payment option for businesses and shoppers everywhere,” the company said in a press release. The initiative includes innovative technology that allows merchants to accept Dogecoin payments instantly at the checkout, eliminating traditional blockchain transaction waiting times and providing the same level of trust as traditional payment methods.

While some predict a potential 300% rally in April, others aren’t convinced the momentum will last. With volatile price swings and limited real-world use, whales appear to be shifting their focus toward emerging utility-driven projects like Remittix (RTX) . As PEPE flirts with breakout territory, investors weigh hype against practical long-term potential. Whale Activity Sparks Speculation Around Pepe Coin’s Next Move Pepe continues to ride the unpredictable waves of meme coin mania. It is currently priced at $0.000007926 and has a hefty 24-hour trading volume topping $611.2 million as of March 21, 2025. After delivering an eye-catching 106.4% rally earlier this month, PEPE gave back some of those gains amid broader market corrections, leaving traders to wonder if the next move is a bounce or a break. Despite the volatility, PEPE remains a favorite among meme coin loyalists, with Pepe price prediction as intense as ever. Its rapid rise and equally swift retracement show just how reactive the token is to internet sentiment and whale activity. Analysts remain split; some, like CoinCodex , predict a strong upswing to $0.000025 by June, representing a potential 200%+ climb. Others, including Changelly , expect PEPE to oscillate between $0.0000094 and $0.0000155, with an average price projection around $0.0000151. This wide range reflects the nature of PEPE itself: a coin fueled less by technical strength and more by cultural momentum. Its value hinges not only on market structure but on the virality it can spark. As April approaches, investors are watching closely to see whether whales double down or begin shifting to tokens with more grounded utility. Either way, PEPE’s meme-powered presence ensures it stays in the spotlight, whether as a 300% gainer or just another missed rocket. Whales Shift Focus From PEPE to High-Utility Tokens Like Remittix While Pepe Coin continues to grab attention with its unpredictable swings, a growing number of crypto traders are quietly shifting focus to a project that offers more than speculation. Remittix (RTX) , a rising PayFi contender, is proving that blockchain can do more than entertain it can solve real-world problems. Designed to streamline cross-border transactions, Remittix enables instant crypto-to-fiat transfers straight into bank accounts, eliminating delays, conversion headaches and unwanted scrutiny from financial gatekeepers. With institutions tightening their grip on how money moves, demand is rising for tools that allow users to stay in control. Remittix stands out for letting individuals send crypto while the receiver gets a standard bank deposit, with no traceable link back to a blockchain transaction. That’s a big deal in regions where banking restrictions are heavy or where financial autonomy is at risk. The market seems to agree. With over $14 million already raised and RTX tokens still priced at $0.0734, the presale has quickly become one of the most watched in 2025. Analysts are forecasting an 800% surge before launch, with post-listing projections climbing even higher. Pepe price prediction remains a heated subject and while PEPE fans debate whether another 300% run is possible in April, early Remittix backers are already positioning themselves for what could be a 10x breakout.

The official also sees asset-backed stablecoins as a means to potentially resurrect the gold standard. Alexander Shokhin, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs ( RSPP ), is convinced that no government would like to see its sovereign rights as a money issuer challenged but recognizes the general consensus in Russia that crypto can be employed in cross-border payments. Business lobby group urges Russian government to consider using cryptocurrencies The authorities in Moscow should analyze the prospects for using cryptocurrencies in light of President Donald Trump’s decision to establish a strategic reserve of Bitcoin and other digital coins in the U.S. The head of the RSPP expressed this opinion in an interview released on Sunday. The organization, over which Shokhin presides, promotes the interests of businesses in the Russian Federation and is one of the oldest lobby groups in the country. It was founded in 1991 when it succeeded the USSR’s Scientific and Industrial Union. Speaking to the Tass news agency, he described cryptocurrencies as an “encroachment on the sovereign rights” of governments to issue money, adding that no central bank would want to face competition from other money issuers without the ability to control the issuing. “But it seems that it has long been agreed that crypto can be used in cross-border settlements,” Shokhin remarked at the same time. He pointed out that in the context of the financial restrictions imposed on Russian business entities, cryptocurrency has found its place among payment instruments. “Well, after Trump said that the United States will now become the crypto capital of the world and is already accumulating crypto reserves, so to speak, at least in Ethereum and Bitcoin, we also need to look at it somehow,” the lobbyist elaborated. Shokhin backs idea of launching settlement system with stablecoins and gold Alexander Shokhin emphasized that Russia should approach the matter carefully, avoiding the establishment of other money issuing centers while at the same time exploiting the benefits of using digital financial assets, including to conduct international settlements. The RSPP executive further highlighted that this possibility has been addressed within proposals to create a new payment and settlement system, alternative to the U.S. dollar-based system and using stablecoins tied to different assets. He suggested that Russia could think about creating a payment and settlement system similar to the International Monetary Fund’s special drawing rights but one introducing additional assets and reserves in the form of gold. “That is, in a sense, returning to the gold standard and to exchange-traded commodities with prices that have been stable for 10 or more years. Such calculations are being made,” the official revealed in the interview. Some officials in Russia still hoping for a crypto reserve President Trump’s initiative to set up a cryptocurrency reserve with bitcoin and other coins seized by the authorities in the United States was met with little enthusiasm by policy makers across Europe, including the Russian Federation. Governor of the Central Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina made it clear she didn’t see any circumstances under which cryptocurrency could enter the monetary authority’s reserves. The Ministry of Finance “has not heard about the creation of a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies in Russia,” Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev was recently quoted as stating. Nevertheless, the idea has had its backers in Russia. In December, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev urged the finance ministry to assess the feasibility of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. And last week, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, Evgeny Masharov, proposed forming a government crypto fund to keep digital assets confiscated in criminal proceedings.

Solana (SOL) prompts speculation for its potential massive growth but Remittix continues to gain momentum through its successful funding campaign that sold over 521 million tokens for $0.0734 each and raised more than $14 million. The big question is: which of these two will truly deliver a massive rally in 2025? Solana’s Recent Recovery and Key Levels SOL/USD Hourly Chart (Binance). Source: TradingView. Image shows SOL breaking the $140 key resistance The Solana price experienced a 7% increase during one day leading to its position at $141.69 after a difficult March period. Technical signals indicate a potential market correction after the token succeeded in breaking above two benchmarks starting from $137 before reaching $140. The Relative Strength Index in the hourly timeframe recently crossed 80 levels indicating overbought territory where price drops may soon occur. Technical analysts believe $137 will function as an entry point for additional buying if the price returns to that level. The price falling beneath $137 marks a potential trend change yet many investors plan to monitor Solana because the token might return to previous levels after dropping. A sense of precaution remains necessary because the Fear & Greed Index demonstrates a wariness level positioned at 31 or 45 according to different information sources. A limited price increase is expected due to bear market conditions since investors remain hesitant about market trends. Some Solana price forecasters predict it will reach between $112 and $179 in the next month but other analysts expect the token to rise beyond these levels in a long-term perspective. A hypothetical 60x growth requires Solana to expand into an intense bull market that may be catalyzed by increasing user engagement and major institutional backing and strategic partnerships. Introducing Remittix: The 60x Contender The past performance levels of Solana remain unattainable as RTX altcoin maintains increased investor interest through its payment solution. Through this new project users can exchange digital assets directly to local currency while the system focuses on building user-friendly transaction features for daily use. To provide market-accessibility Remittix integrates cryptocurrency with traditional finance through an efficient payment system which avoids time-demanding processes while eliminating high fees. User numbers on the platform would expand quickly through payment provider connections with remittance businesses. The pre-sale phase of Remittix succeeded in collecting more than $14 million through sales exceeding 521 million tokens at each token costing $0.0734. Analysis indicates that broad acceptance of Remittix will lead to a 60x rise in token value like what has occurred during successful market adoption. New market demand will generate significant value increases for Remittix because its market capitalization remains lower than Solana. How Remittix Could Outshine Solana The extensive features of Solana including its chain reliability and numerous dApps and institutional attraction sometimes act as both advantages and disadvantages in the crypto space. Large systems need extended periods to reach new dimensions while facing overwhelming competition because their advancement depends mainly on developer participation. The Remittix platform exists to let users change crypto into fiat currency in short periods while skipping complex learning or multiple exchange steps. The solution's basic operation potentially attracts many more users swiftly while excluding those users who dislike complex multi-exchange activity. Due to its low price below $1, Remittix appeals to investors who want to benefit from projects with small market capitalization. The projection for Remittix usage growth by some analysts makes a 60-times price increase plausible since straightforward altcoins with consumer-focused value propositions historically experience strong adoption. The supporters of Remittix suggest its single-step solution provides better marketing potential alongside simpler explanation when compared to more complex chain technologies. Conclusion Solana blockchain maintains its position as a promising platform thanks to its strong fundamentals yet uncertainty exists regarding its ability to reach the 60x extensive price target of. The coin’s success likely hinges on consistent development, developer loyalty, and a broader crypto bull run. The digital token to real payment feature operated by Remittix functions smoothly with minimal formalities. New network participants could join under the proposed cryptocurrency-to-cash exchange method thus creating achievable conditions for achieving a 60x increase.

42290762,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=717484,1742860805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42290762.jpeg,The Cyclicality Of Bitcoin: What The Cyclical Crests Say About A BTC Top,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/the-cyclicality-of-bitcoin/,"Tony “The Bull” Severino, a well-followed crypto analyst, recently took to the social media platform X to share a detailed breakdown of Bitcoin’s historical price behavior. The analysis uses a cyclical lens that many in the crypto community (both bulls and bears) agree holds significant relevance. Notably, Tony Severino focuses on the concept of Bitcoin’s four-year cycles and how troughs and crests have consistently marked the periods of greatest opportunity and greatest risks for investing in Bitcoin. This analysis comes in light of Bitcoin’s recent price correction below $90,000 in March. Cycles Define Sentiment: From Troughs Of Opportunity To Crests Of Risk Severino’s analysis starts from a foundational belief shared across the crypto industry. The widely-held belief is that Bitcoin operates in clearly defined cycles, usually lasting around four years, mostly in relation to its halving cycles. His technical outlook is based on Bitcoin’s cycle indicator on the monthly candlestick timeframe chart that goes as far back as 2013. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? Why A Fall To $63,000 Is Possible If This Resistance Holds As shown in the chart below, Bitcoin has gone through four definitive cycles in its history. These cycles, he explains, should be viewed from “trough to trough.” The troughs are the darkest moments in the market, but they also represent the point of maximum financial opportunity. As these cycles progress, Bitcoin transitions through periods of increasing optimism, eventually arriving at what the analyst calls the “cyclical crest.” These crests, highlighted in red in his chart, are the periods where Bitcoin has reached its point of maximum financial risk. This is relayed in the ensuing price actions, with the Bitcoin price topping out right after passing each cyclical crest. Bitcoin passed through its crest in the current market cycle just before reaching its all-time high of $108,786 in January 2025. If past cycles are any indication, the coming months could reveal whether a top is already in. Right-Translated Peaks: Is BTC Running Out Of Time In This Cycle? Bitcoin has been on a correction path since February and is currently down by 20% from this $108,786 price high. The Bitcoin price has even gone ahead to correct as low as $78,780 in the second week of March, triggering reactions as to whether the crypto has already reached its peak price this cycle. Related Reading: Inverse Head And Shoulders Breakout Suggests Bitcoin Price Is Headed To $300,000 However, Bitcoin might not be in the woods yet, as not all crests are followed immediately by market tops. Severino pointed out that past cycles have featured “right-translated” peaks where Bitcoin continued to rise slightly even after crossing the crest. The 2017 bull run was the most right-translated, with price action staying strong for some time after the red-zone crest. In contrast, other cycles began reversing not long after reaching this point of maximum risk. Bitcoin appears to have already passed the red crest based on Severino’s model, but this does not confirm a top is in just yet. Instead, it means that the margin for error is rapidly narrowing. The longer BTC continues to correct after this point, the more elevated the risk of a bearish phase becomes. BTC is attempting to regain bullish momentum at the time of writing, trading at $87,300 after rising 3.6% in the past 24 hours. Many other analysts argue that the Bitcoin price could still chart higher territory this year before a definitive top is confirmed.

A transfer involving 167M XRP has polarized the community, while Solana’s significant decrease prompts doubts on its ability to maintain critical support levels. Amid these fluctuations, BlockDAG (BDAG) has excelled, amassing over $205.5M in its presale and establishing itself as a significant contender in the cryptocurrency sphere. With an advanced blockchain architecture that resolves longstanding inefficiencies and anticipated listings on 10 major CEXs, could BDAG lead the upcoming surge in crypto advancements? Continue reading to explore. XRP Whale Action Sparks Speculation A recent XRP whale action has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency world. An anonymous entity moved 167M XRP, valued at roughly $367 million, between unidentified wallets. This transaction occurred during a market slump, with XRP’s price falling nearly 5% in the past day. Such large-scale transfers frequently ignite speculation regarding their potential impact on the market. While some view this XRP whale action as a tactical accumulation in anticipation of a market upswing, others see it as a prelude to a major sell-off, possibly leading to further declines in XRP’s price. Keeping an eye on these XRP whale actions is essential for understanding market dynamics and predicting future price trends. Explore the Latest Solana (SOL) Price Prediction Solana (SOL) has recently seen a sharp decline, dropping over 7% in a single day to $118.76, sparking concerns about a possible retest of the $100 support level. This pessimistic view is driven by a decrease in meme coin interest, the release of 11.16 million SOL by FTX’s bankruptcy estate, and general market weakness. Technical analysis indicates SOL breaking below the crucial $136 support, suggesting a bearish trajectory. Analysts believe that if these support levels give way, Solana might approach the $100 mark again, making this Solana (SOL) price prediction vital for market participants. BlockDAG Solves Key Blockchain Challenges—Secures $205.5M! The domain of cryptocurrency has often shifted with the introduction of groundbreaking solutions. Bitcoin pioneered decentralized finance, while Ethereum brought smart contracts into the blockchain ecosystem. Despite their innovations, both platforms face ongoing issues with balancing security, speed, and decentralization—the core blockchain trilemma. BlockDAG has made significant strides in overcoming these hurdles by implementing Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, which allows for the simultaneous confirmation of multiple transactions. This method contrasts with the linear processing of traditional blockchains, enabling BlockDAG to eliminate bottlenecks without sacrificing security or efficiency. Central to this innovation is the Phantom GhostDAG protocol, which offers a level of decentralization that avoids the congestion typical of Ethereum’s network. Moreover, BlockDAG’s design promotes an environmentally friendly Proof-of-Work model, demonstrating that scalability does not need to undermine security or environmental sustainability. This advanced technology has set BlockDAG on a path toward broad adoption in both its infrastructure and community involvement. Having raised $205.5 million, attracted 170,000 unique holders, and witnessed a 2,380% increase in price since its first presale batch, BlockDAG’s progress is evident. With the price now at $0.0248 in Batch 27 and predictions of a rise to $1 post-listing, the upcoming Keynote 3 announcements and 10 CEX listings are expected to boost liquidity and further demand. For those considering the best long-term crypto, BlockDAG represents a formidable option. It addresses fundamental blockchain constraints, and delaying involvement could mean missing significant opportunities. Market Movements in Focus Recent XRP whale action has reignited discussions, with a substantial transfer of 167M tokens causing uncertainty about future market trends. Concurrently, Solana’s significant fall below crucial support levels has prompted discussions on the likelihood of a drop to $100. The instability in these assets keeps the market on alert. Contrasting with this, BlockDAG is advancing steadily, having raised over $205.5 million from crypto presale funding and supported by 170,000 unique holders. Its adoption of Phantom GhostDAG protocol and DAG technology addresses some of the most persistent inefficiencies in blockchain technology. With its price up 2,380% since the initial batch and Batch 27’s rate of $0.0248 quickly increasing, hesitating could mean losing out on what could be an exponential growth phase.

When Bitcoin dominance slows, liquidity flows into high-risk, high-reward assets, and meme coins tend to be the first to benefit. In 2021, Shiba Inu (SHIB) made early buyers rich when millions of retail traders flooded into the market. In 2023, PEPE skyrocketed from obscurity to a multi-billion-dollar market cap in weeks. Now, in 2025, the cycle is starting again. And this time, in a downturn for the wider market at large, early investors are looking at the high-flying presale FloppyPepe (FPPE) instead of Shiba Inu. Why Meme Coin Buying Season Has Arrived Market sentiment plays a huge role in meme coin performance. Historically, meme coins explode when three conditions align: Bitcoin stabilizes, dips, or trends sideways → Investors look for more volatile opportunities. Retail traders re-enter the market during or after a dip → Meme coins thrive on engagement, memes, and community activity. Early-stage projects gain traction before major breakouts → Low market caps and immunity from the market’s rollercoaster allow for exponential upside. Following the dip at the beginning of this week, on-chain data has shown a rise in meme coin wallet activity, with a growing number of new holders accumulating presale tokens. This suggests both Whales and presale adopters are preparing for signs of the next breakout. SHIB vs. FPPE – Which One Has More Upside? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a legend in the meme coin space, no doubt. However, its growth potential in 2025 is limited. In fact, since the turn of the year, SHIB is down more than 35% . SHIB already has a $8 billion market cap. While it can and should still rise again, its potential for 1000x gains is long gone. Burn mechanisms help price action, but they don’t create the kind of viral momentum of newer projects. Its biggest rally happened in 2021. Since then, SHIB has trended downwards to the tune of 85% away from its peak. Clearly, meme coins need new narratives to recapture investor attention. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , on the other hand, is at the earliest presale stage, meaning it has a fraction of SHIB’s market cap and significantly more room to grow. Why FPPE Could Be the Best Pick in This Buying Season Despite appearances, FPPE isn’t a typical meme coin hoping to ride a trend and disappear as fast as it appeared. It’s an AI-powered ecosystem designed to generate engagement indefinitely. Meme-o-Matic AI Generator → Unlike SHIB, FloppyPepe creates viral content automatically. This ensures that it remains relevant in times such as these when the markets cool off. FloppyX AI Agent → Analyzes trends, generates memes, and turns market sentiment into shareable content. A first-of-its-kind tool in the meme coin space. Deflationary Tokenomics → 1% of every transaction is burned, reducing supply over time—something SHIB still struggles to implement effectively. Presale Price Advantage → While SHIB is already trading at a $8 billion market cap, FPPE is still in its first presale phase, offering the lowest possible entry price. What History Tells Us About Buying Early The biggest meme coin gains come from early-stage investments. SHIB’s early buyers saw 70,000,000%+ gains. PEPE’s early adopters turned $100 into six figures in weeks. Dogecoin’s long-term holders became millionaires after years of accumulation. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is in its accumulation phase. This means investors have a rare chance to get in before mass adoption. Meme Coins Reward Those Who Back Themselves Meme coins aren’t usually about utility. They’re about community, momentum, and timing. Right now, early investors are shifting their focus from established names like SHIB to high-upside opportunities like FPPE, whose use of AI could revolutionize how meme coins are perceived in the space. History shows that buying in early meme coin presales delivers the highest returns. And with FloppyPepe integrating AI-driven engagement tools and deflationary mechanics, it could be positioned as the next big meme coin breakout of 2025.

According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, whales in the Bounce ( AUCTION ) market have been greatly influencing the altcoin’s price action for the past week, causing massive swings in both directions. Bounce Finance is a decentralized auction platform enabling auctions for various assets, such as physical assets tokenized on the blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). AUCTION tokens are used for governance, staking, and fees for participating in auctions or creating NFTs on the platform. Lookonchain says that in the last several days, whales sent over 14% of the circulating supply of AUCTION to Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by volume, and OKX. Those deposits presumably led to coins being sold on the open market, which ultimately caused prices to plummet. Says Lookonchain, “AUCTION Whales deposited 1.08 million AUCTION ($48.6 million, 14.26% of the total supply) into Binance and OKX again, causing the price to plummet by 50%. Pay attention to price changes.” Source: Lookonchain/X At time of writing, AUCTION has not recovered, currently trading at $20.93 with a market cap of $137 million. AUCTION is ranked as the 363rd-largest crypto asset by market cap.

This development comes as USDC becomes the first dollar-backed stablecoin approved for circulation under Japan’s stablecoin regulatory framework. Circle’s entry into the Japanese market is facilitated through its local entity, Circle Japan KK, and strategic partnerships, including a joint venture with SBI Holdings. Circle Launches USDC in Japan With SBI According to a recent blog post , Circle has received formal approval to launch the USDC stablecoin in Japan. The approval was granted by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) under the country’s updated stablecoin regulations. USDC is the first and only global dollar stablecoin approved for use in Japan. This sets a precedent for other stablecoins seeking entry into Japan’s regulated financial system. SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, will lead the initial launch of USDC on March 26. The launch will mark the start of the integration of the stablecoin across the country’s digital asset exchanges. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, remarked “We are honored to bring USDC to businesses and consumers in the market, and with Circle Japan KK and the strong support of SBI Holdings and leading exchanges, USDC is positioned as a secure and transparent digital dollar that meets the needs of Japan’s evolving digital economy.” Major Japanese Exchanges Set to List USDC Alongside SBI VC Trade, other major exchanges in Japan are preparing to offer the USDC stablecoin. Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer are among the top exchanges that plan to support USDC trading soon. Consequently, the move will improve the liquidity and availability of the stablecoin within Japan’s digital asset market. These platforms will enable both retail and institutional users to access USDC through regulated channels. The partnerships represent an effort to integrate Circle’s financial infrastructure into Japan’s digital economy. The listings are part of a broader strategy to support the compliant use of stablecoins in payments and settlements. President & CEO of SBI Holdings, Yoshitaka Kitao added, “We believe this initiative will enhance financial accessibility and drive digital asset innovation, aligning with our broader vision for the future of payments and blockchain-based finance in Japan.” Circle’s local presence through Circle Japan KK allows it to work directly with exchange operators. This structure supports regulatory compliance and operational alignment with Japanese financial standards. USDC Utility in Digital Finance Circle’s entry into Japan includes plans to support a wider range of use cases for USDC. These include payments, settlements, cross-border finance, and treasury operations. Additionally, stablecoin issuer will work with financial institutions and technology providers to develop new applications for digital dollars. This effort aims to strengthen the local digital finance ecosystem. Circle is positioning USDC as a fully-reserved, transparent, and compliant stablecoin. The reserves are held in cash and cash-equivalent assets at regulated institutions, with monthly third-party attestations. Meanwhile, the stablecoin issuer recently established a local entity in Dubai to meet regulatory standards and support its operations within the Dubai International Financial Centre.

Rising nearly 2% within the last day, BTC maintains its dominant market position, boasting a total market capitalization close to $1.74 trillion. With nearly 19.84 million BTC circulating from its limited supply of 21 million, investor enthusiasm is evident. On the technical front, the recent symmetrical triangle breakout on Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart signals strong bullish sentiment. Breaking decisively above the critical pivot point of $86,462, BTC surged toward a significant resistance level at $89,024. This rally marks a critical turning point, although BTC has now entered a mild corrective phase, illustrating natural short-term profit-taking. The key level to watch closely is $86,400, as holding this support could catalyze another bullish upswing toward resistances of $90,750 and $92,800. Bullish breakout triggered at pivot $86,462. Current correction at resistance $89,024. Crucial support at $86,400 for bullish continuity.

Ongoing debate has focused on how the coins could be vulnerable to the kind of bank runs that paralyzed the financial system during past financial crises. Bloomberg noted that the Trump administration and Congress were both pushing to cement the growing importance of stablecoins, with two bills designed to give stablecoins a bigger role in the global payments infrastructure already running through the House and Senate. Washington’s interest, including vocal support from President Donald Trump, helped encourage the steady flow of new money into the stablecoins sector—even as other sectors of the crypto industry struggled—bringing the total value to over $230B. However, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that the bill lacked the basic safeguards necessary to ensure that stablecoins did not blow up the entire financial system. She added that the bill allowed stablecoin issuers to invest in risky assets, including assets that were bailed out in 2008. The Reserve Primary Fund broke its intended peg to the dollar as investors lost confidence in the $785M in Lehman Brothers’ debt backing it, which triggered the broader run on money-market funds that spread chaos through the financial system. Stablecoin bill faces systemic bank run risk President Trump’s latest push for stablecoin regulation at the Digital Asset Summit signalled major catalysts ahead for crypto markets. The Senate Banking Committee voted 18-6 on March 13th to advance the bill regulating stablecoin. GC Cooke, the founder and CEO of Brava, claimed that banks were desperately launching stablecoins to save themselves, adding that JP Morgan, Citi, and Charles Schwab knew what was coming. However, Senator Warren expressed less faith in the bill, saying that anyone who thought the U.S. taxpayer would not be called on–whether directly or indirectly–to bail out these guys was kidding themselves. Reportedly, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Financial Stability Oversight Council called attention to these run risks in multiple papers published last year, and various central bankers have spoken about the risks in recent speeches. “If a run on a large stablecoin were to occur, liquidation of the assets backing the stablecoin could be disruptive, especially if those assets were linked to other funding markets.” -Lisa D. Cook, a governor on the Federal Reserve’s board Matthew Bisanz, a financial regulatory partner at Mayer Brown, doubted whether a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin that is denominated in U.S. dollars could be vulnerable to a run because the coin can always pay the redeemer in U.S. dollars. He, however, acknowledged that if those dollars were deposited at a bank and the bank needed to liquidate assets to fund withdrawals by the stablecoin holders, then there could be a run. But that would be the same type of run that could happen to any fractional reserve depository. Lutnick and Bessent say legitimizing stablecoins helps strengthen the U.S. dollar 📣 Congress is hashing out the stablecoin scene while kicking CBDCs to the curb!

If the bill is passed, stablecoin issuers would need to be licensed and back their tokens one-to-one with approved assets like cash, short-term US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and money-market funds. However, a professor emeritus at George Washington University Law School, Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., published a policy report last month calling attention to some of the vulnerabilities that the proposed legislation did not address. Wilmarth pointed out that even safe, short-term US Treasury bills, which would be allowed into reserves in the proposed legislation, were vulnerable to bank runs and had been frozen up during previous crises. He also noted that Circle’s USDC only managed to recover its peg in 2023 after federal regulators stepped in to cover all of Silicon Valley Bank’s uninsured depositors. Former Federal Reserve board member Nellie Liang held a different opinion, saying that the recent amendments to the GENIUS Act would force stablecoin issuers to hold cash-like assets, which should be safe even in the run. She added that reserve assets had to be ‘very safe and very liquid’ for stablecoins to function without causing or posing risk to financial stability, Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Users of the prediction markets platform can now deposit funds into their Polymarket wallet with SOL. Polymarket Unveils Solana Deposits After Integration After weeks of speculation, Polymarket rolled out Solana (SOL) deposits for users of the platform. According to a post on X , users can now fund their Polymarket wallets with SOL, a key upgrade in the quest toward expansion. “Starting today, you can now make deposits into your Polymarket wallet using Solana,” read the announcement. Prior to the integration with Solana, Polymarket users could only fund their accounts with Circle’s USDC stablecoin. The push to embrace SOL deposits aligns with Polymarket’s desire to increase platform activity using a fast-rising blockchain. SOL, the sixth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $71.6 billion, has an active ecosystem that sizzles with activity. Onchain data indicates active wallets reaching 11 million amid rising daily trading volumes for SOL. While Polymarket reached 450,000 monthly active users in early 2025, activity on the prediction market platform has waned. The platform’s integration with Solana will open it to a new demographic beyond stablecoin users. Solana Rallies By 6% Following The Announcement In the minutes following Polymarket’s integration, Solana’s price spiked by nearly 7% to trade at $140. On the seven-day charts, Solana is coasting on a 10% upswing as it puts claims for a steep correction behind it. SOL daily trading volumes have soared by an incredible 143% over the last day to settle at $4.18 billion. Experts are terming the spike as the catalyst for SOL to reach $1,000 after weeks of consolidation. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has backed Layer 1 blockchains over Layer 2 solutions, noting heightened security and speed. Polymarket’s integration follows Yakovenko’s expression of regret over a controversial Solana ad , apologizing to the community for dabbling in “culture wars.” “The ad was bad, and it’s still gnawing at my soul,” said Yakovenko. “I am ashamed I downplayed it instead of just calling it what it is – mean and punching down on a marginal group.” The post Polymarket Integrates Solana, Enables Deposits With SOL appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|Polymarket|Solana (SOL)|Solana Price,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|USDC,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-25 00:57:39

Back in 2021, Solana skyrocketed from around $1.50 to $258, delivering over 16,000% gains. Now, AI-driven analysis is pointing toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a high-upside performer. The project is in Phase 3 presale. Investors acquired are more than 6400 presale tokens to produce a dynamic level of investor support worth $4.5 million. Mutuum Finance Phase 3 has already sold out over 60% of it. Those entering now can expect 200% returns worth $0.06 during the exchange launch period. Investors have a limited period remaining before the phase closes. Analysts predict parabolic gains to $4, positioning MUTM as the next altcoin to experience a Solana-like breakout. Solana’s 2021 Meteoric Rise: A Blueprint for Altcoin Potential In 2021, Solana (SOL) delivered one of the most legendary bull runs in crypto history, skyrocketing from around $1.50 to an all-time high of $258, an astonishing 16,000% gain. This explosive rally was fueled by its high-speed, low-cost blockchain technology, rapid DeFi and NFT adoption, and strong institutional backing. The network’s ability to handle thousands of transactions per second positioned it as a major Ethereum competitor, drawing massive investor interest. Solana’s surge serves as a benchmark for emerging altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which analysts speculate could replicate a similar trajectory if adoption, innovation, and market sentiment align. Mutuum Finance Presale Investors show growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because they continue to support its project development regardless of Cardano’s market performance. During the pre-sale phase investors achieved an outstanding milestone by providing more than $4.5 million in funding for reaching 6400 participants. The token value of Mutuum Finance tokens showed growth during Phase 3 initial stages and continues increasing toward its launch price expectation of $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Lending System Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework which combines Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish straight loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P exchanges because this system represents a superior way of managing worldwide assets. Users benefit from automated security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. Strategic Growth & Community Rewards The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing (staking rewards) mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings of new exchanges will improve inter-user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its first users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to gain traction as analysts highlight its potential for massive growth, mirroring Solana’s historic 2021 rally. More than 6,400 investors have already contributed $4.5 million, and Phase 3 presale has surpassed 60% completion. A limited opportunity remains for investors to secure MUTM tokens at early-stage prices before its expected surge to $4. Act now to be part of the next potential altcoin breakout and participate today.

USDC ( USDC ) will first be listed on the “SBI VC Trade” crypto exchange under a joint venture between its parent firm — Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings — and Circle’s Japanese entity Circle Japan KK, Circle said in a March 24 statement. The news comes three weeks after SBI VC Trade secured an industry-first regulatory approval on March 4 to list USDC under the Japan Financial Services Agency’s stablecoin regulatory framework. Circle is also looking to list USDC on Binance Japan, bitbank and bitFlyer in the near future. Japan’s bitbank and bitFlyer are two of the country’s largest crypto exchanges, having processed more than $25 million each over the last day with over 1.85 million visits to their websites in the last month. The regulatory approval comes after two years of back-and-forth negotiations with regulators, banking partners and industry players, Circle’s Jeremy Allaire said in a March 24 X post. “[This] unlocks tremendous opportunities not just in trading digital assets, but more broadly in payments, cross border finance and commerce, FX,” he added.

Meme coins dominate headlines, and Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) leads a new kind of movement. While classic players like Celestia and Terra Classic continue building solid ecosystems, Pablo is blazing a trail through icy myth-filled realms with deflationary tokenomics and insane ROI. As of now, Pablo’s journey has reached the 16th location—Crystal Cove—and it’s turning heads across the web3 world. The buzz around meme coins is real. The recent surge in tokens like Bonk and TURBO proves there’s serious money behind the madness. Arctic Pablo Coin is tapping into that exact wave—but with something no one else is offering: a mystical, cinematic narrative wrapped in a community-driven ecosystem. It’s not just about buying crypto—it’s about joining a mythic expedition where every token unlocks a story, a location, and a chance to build wealth while exploring Earth’s hidden mysteries. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Meme Coin Adventure Arctic Pablo Coin throws the rulebook out the frosty window in a world flooded with rinse-and-repeat meme coins. Picture this: a lone explorer on a snowmobile slicing through the Arctic tundra, hunting down treasure-filled realms like Crystal Cove, Icebound Bastion, and Forgotten Fjord. Each location unlocks a chapter in a mythical journey—and a new chance for wealth. At the time of writing, Arctic Pablo Coin is priced at just $0.000083, and over $2 million has already been raised. With a launch price of $0.008, early believers are staring at a 9552.41% ROI. Put it this way: a simple $100 investment at this location could transform into $9,638.55 at launch. This isn’t just hype—it’s math. Pablo’s journey is heating up, and this location could close anytime. Don’t get left behind. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin one of the best crypto coins to buy right now isn’t just the narrative (although, let’s be real—it’s legendary). It’s the numbers. With a total supply of 221.2 billion APC tokens, a tightly designed burn mechanism, and a presale divided into exclusive locations instead of stages, Pablo isn’t playing around. Each week, unsold tokens are permanently burned on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), locking in scarcity and potential price pumps. But here’s the real kicker: 66% APY staking. Stake your APC tokens and watch them multiply like penguins in mating season. Staked coins are vested for two months from the launch date—just enough time for your bag to bulk up without lifting a finger. It’s a low-effort, high-reward strategy that turns passive holding into an active growth engine. It’s one of the Best Crypto Coins to Buy. Celestia (TIA): The Scalable Rollup Layer That’s Playing the Long Game While meme coins steal the spotlight, Celestia (TIA) is over here laying the groundwork for an entirely new kind of blockchain future. It’s modular, sleek, and built to solve one of crypto’s biggest headaches: scalability. Currently, TIA is trading around $10.74, and the coin saw massive hype during its airdrop, with many early holders seeing solid returns. Even after the hype cooled, Celestia’s utility-driven architecture continues to make it one of the best crypto coins to buy for serious builders and long-term believers. But here’s the rub—it’s not exactly a playground for degen traders chasing quick flips. Celestia is for those who believe in the evolution of blockchain infrastructure. It’s steady, thoughtful, and designed to scale the web3 world without crumbling under pressure. And while the staking yields and burn mechanics aren’t as splashy as Arctic Pablo Coin’s, Celestia offers an opportunity to get in early on the backbone of a modular future. Think of it like investing in Amazon Web Services before anyone knew what cloud computing was. Terra Classic (LUNC): The Phoenix That Just Might Rise Again No crypto list is complete without a comeback story—and Terra Classic (LUNC) fits that bill like a glove. After the infamous collapse of Terra in 2022, most people wrote off LUNC as dead weight. But a funny thing happened on the way to crypto’s graveyard—Terra Classic refused to die. Fast forward to today, and LUNC is making some real moves. This coin is clawing its way back into relevance with a passionate community, regular token burns, and updated governance structures. It might not have the headline-grabbing presale of Arctic Pablo or the modular tech of Celestia, but it has an army of diamond hands still fighting for a second chance. Currently priced at around $0.00012, LUNC has plenty of room to run. The circulating supply is massive, but consistent burns and revived developer interest are helping trim the fat. The LUNC burn rate has topped 100 billion tokens, showing a serious push from the community to restore its former glory. Still, suppose nostalgia, community strength, and comeback vibes are your thing. In that case, Terra Classic might just belong on a shortlist of the best crypto coins to buy—especially at its current dirt-cheap valuation. Final Thoughts: What are the best crypto coins to buy right now? Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Celestia, and Terra Classic each offer unique value propositions—but one stands out for immediate ROI potential. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just building hype; it’s creating a movement. With a narrative-rich presale model, 66% APY staking, deflationary tokenomics, and the potential for a 9552% return, this coin is rewriting the meme coin rulebook. But only one of these is nearing the end of its current low-price location—and that’s Arctic Pablo Coin. With prices set to rise and this presale location ending any moment, it’s now or never. Join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now and secure your spot in crypto’s next big adventure. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs: What makes Arctic Pablo Coin one of the best crypto coins to buy right now? Arctic Pablo Coin offers a 9552% ROI potential, 66% APY staking, and a narrative-rich presale model that separates it from standard meme coins. How is Celestia different from other crypto projects? Celestia uses modular blockchain architecture to separate data availability from execution, allowing developers to scale without compromise. Is Terra Classic still a good investment in 2025? Terra Classic has revived community engagement and token burns despite its past, offering long-shot potential for high-risk investors. The post Momentum Is Wild, Don’t Blink!

He clarified in another post that the USD1 stablecoin it is not yet tradable, cautioning the community against scams using the same name. The official X page for WLFI has since quoted his tweet with an official warning, which stated that USD1 is not yet tradable and that users need to beware of scams. pic.twitter.com/zXXG3LCESB — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) March 24, 2025 CZ’s warning to his followers Hours before CZ warned users about potential scams linked to USD1, he revealed in a post that the smart contract of the self-proclaimed “World Liberty Financial USD” stablecoin has been deployed on BSC. “Welcome to @BNBChain!” His tweet read . “According to BSCScan, the smart contract was deployed 20 days ago. Build!” He concluded with an applause emoji. World Liberty Financial USD (USD1) on BSCScan. Source: BSCScan The post triggered excitement from users, with many claiming these are just signs that BNB season is about to begin in full swing. CZ’s clarification post came hours later. “I was told since this post, a lot of scammers created coins with the same name. The official USD1 is not tradable yet. Please do not fall for the scams,” it read . It was an attempt to keep his followers, many of whom are greatly influenced by his tweets, safe because even though he referred to it as “the official USD1,” CZ’s comment isn’t an actual indicator that there is an official partnership between Binance and World Liberty Financial. Some users responded to his warning by criticizing his “spontaneous” posting style, pointing out that the community may take his posts completely out of context, which could create misunderstandings. Talks of a WLFI-stablecoin began last year, triggering ethical concerns and complications WLFI, the Trump family-linked crypto project, revealed plans to create and issue its own stablecoin last year October according to sources quoted by Decrypt. The stablecoin is designed to hold a steady value that is pegged to the US dollar, but back in October, when the news first broke, it was revealed the World Liberty team was in the process of determining how to make the financial product safe before bringing it to market. The moves that followed seemed to confirm a potential stablecoin venture, even including the appointment of Rich Teo, co-founder of stablecoin issuer Paxos, as World Liberty’s stablecoin and payment lead. It has been months since then, and it is now about to become a reality despite the concerns. World Liberty is already a very controversial business entity because of its links to the former—and now present—president of the US. However, the thought of Trump and his business partners issuing their own stablecoin is even more controversial as it poses regulatory hurdles spanning securities classification, financial licensing, AML/KYC compliance, reserve transparency, and political sensitivities. For stablecoins to retain their stability, they need to be heavily collateralized. Take popular stablecoin issuer Circle for example; it reportedly holds billions worth of dollar-denominated assets at regulated American financial institutions to back its billions worth of stablecoin, USDC, currently in circulation. Some projects, like Terra, have tried to circumvent this method of fiat collateralization, sometimes by using crypto as a backing, but they have failed. Terra’s method was successful for over a year until UST’s price collapsed to zero in May 2022, wiping out about $60 billion in value and triggering a bloody response from the broader crypto market. More questions about how the USD1 will be promoted to market How WLFI will address the problem of reserve transparency remains to be seen. However, the onboarding of experienced figures in the stablecoin industry like Rich Teo suggests WLFI is aware of the potential challenges. Despite the potential legal and regulatory strife, having its own USD1 stablecoin could offer the World Liberty team huge profits. Like banks, stablecoin issuers rake in cash by reinvesting customer deposits in yield-bearing products like US Treasury bills. Tether, the company behind USDT, reported a record $5.2 billion profit in the first half of 2024 alone. Revenue generated from having its own USD1 stablecoin could boost World Liberty’s future plans, but issuing a new stablecoin in an already saturated field is no easy task. It would require deals with top crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase and Binance, to make the asset available to a large swath of users. However Binance currently has a “strategic commercial partnership” with First Digital Labs, issuer of the fifth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, FDUSD while Coinbase co-issues USDC, the second largest, along with Circle. Notably, another Trump venture, the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) reached a nonbinding agreement with Crypto.com on launching a series of exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded products (ETFs) on Monday. However, there was no mention of any potential collaboration between the projects on any impending stablecoin projects. The importance of stablecoins to the ecosystem has become apparent in the past couple of years. They have become the go-to assets for traders who want to preserve their funds even while the market fluctuates. They can also be used as dollar equivalents in markets where dollars are restricted or inaccessible, making them important bridges between crypto and traditional financial markets.

The projection is based on the breakout of a multi-year “bull flag” formation, traditionally seen in technical analysis as a continuation pattern that may precede upward momentum. This development comes as market participants reassess XRP price role in the broader digital asset landscape. XRP Price Could Hit $1,452 as Analyst Spots Bull Flag Breakout Analyst “Steph is Crypto” took to the X platform to present a long-term bullish chart for XRP price. According to the shared analysis , the Ripple token is breaking out of a multi-year bull flag pattern dating back to 2018. This formation is a continuation signal in technical analysis, pointing to upward momentum after consolidation. The breakout above the downward-sloping channel marks a shift in price structure. Steph suggests that the XRP price could reach as high as $1,452.81 over the coming years. This forecast is based on the length of the initial flagpole projected from the breakout point. More so, “Steph is Crypto” chart indicates that XRP price may now be entering a new phase of movement after years of consolidation. Source: X Expressing his optimistic Ripple price prediction, the analyst added, “I don’t even want to give you this #XRP price target! You’re definitely not bullish enough.” Similarly, a recent report speculate that Michael Saylor could diversify MicroStrategy’s portfolio by allocating $21 billion from Bitcoin into XRP. Analysts suggest such a move could trigger a parabolic rally in XRP price, potentially pushing it toward the $1,000 mark. Additional Technical Breakout Around $2.48 In a recent video update , Steph is Crypto highlighted a second technical breakout. This time, a descending wedge pattern was identified, a structure associated with trend reversals. The XRP price was shown crossing above the wedge’s resistance level, trading around the $2.48 mark. The analyst chart suggested this move could act as an entry point for traders. The projected target from the wedge breakout is $3.36, representing a potential 37.98% gain from current levels. Source: X More so, analyst Dark Defender also shared bullish crypto market sentiments, projecting the top altcoin could reach $77.7 in the current bull cycle. His forecast relies on Exponential Fibonacci levels and Elliott Wave theory, pointing to a multi-phase rally.

The asset has moved past the $87,000 level, gaining approximately 5.2% over the past week and 3.4% in the last 24 hours. This uptick in performance marks a notable contrast to the steady downtrend observed in recent weeks, offering traders renewed momentum and sparking discussions around broader market sentiment. One of the key developments supporting this shift appears to be rising liquidity on major exchanges. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlighted that the amount of ERC-20 stablecoins held on Binance has reached a new all-time high, now surpassing $31 billion. Binance continues to lead in trading volume among centralized exchanges, making this metric particularly important for analyzing near-term price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Shows Stronger Recovery Signs—Upside Move in Focus Stablecoin Accumulation and Investor Sentiment According to Darkfost’s analysis on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, the increasing stablecoin reserves suggest growing confidence among Binance users. These funds may represent capital being positioned for reentry into crypto markets, potentially signaling a wave of buying pressure. Additionally, Binance may be accumulating stablecoins to manage liquidity for ongoing investor demand or hedging strategies. Notably, stablecoin balances on exchanges are often used as an indicator of future market participation. When reserves increase, it typically reflects investor readiness to deploy capital into assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While this trend does not guarantee immediate upward price movement, it generally aligns with improving sentiment and rising demand. 📈Stablecoin on Binance ATH ! The amount of stablecoins (erc-20) available on Binance has just reached a new all-time high, surpassing $31 billion.

These “cost basis” levels represent the average entry price for groups of investors segmented by how long they’ve held their Bitcoin. Monitoring these ranges helps assess which price levels may act as support or resistance in the market. Kesmeci identified four key price bands: $85,000 for holders between 1 to 4 weeks, $89,000 for 3 to 6-month holders, $98,000 for 1 to 3-month holders, and $63,000 for those holding between 6 to 12 months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stuck In A Loop? Here’s Why $87,000 Could Be Crucial These zones are important because short-term investors often react to these levels—either taking profit or exiting when the price approaches their average entry cost.

Don’t Miss Its Soon-Ending Bonus",https://thecoinrise.com/after-pepes-surge-btfd-coin-is-one-of-the-top-new-meme-coins-to-join-in-march-2025-dont-miss-its-soon-ending-bonus/,"In the Wild West of crypto, timing is everything. If you were around during Pepe Coin’s ICO and didn’t hop on board, you probably watched in horror as early buyers laughed their way to the bank. Pepe Coin launched at a tiny fraction of a cent, only to explode into meme coin royalty. The regret? Real. But don’t worry, the universe is handing you a second chance—BTFD Coin. With only one stage left in its presale, BTFD Coin is offering early believers an opportunity that might just rival Pepe’s historic rise. Over $6.41 million raised, 11,500 investors locked in, and the Bulls Squad leading the charge—this might be the meme coin presale you were waiting for. Not to mention, everyone’s hopping in to grab that LAUNCH100 bonus before it expires on March 30th! Is it one of the top new meme coins to join in March 2025 ? Most likely. Pepe Coin: From Underdog to Meme Coin Titan Pepe Coin didn’t just enter the market—it dominated it. Launched at a mere fraction of a penny, this frog-themed sensation skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high that made early buyers ridiculously rich. The secret to its success? Hype, community strength, and a wave of FOMO had everyone scrambling to get in. Listings on major exchanges, viral memes, and a rapidly expanding user base turned this joke coin into serious money. At its peak, Pepe Coin’s market cap soared into the billions, proving that meme coins can be more than just internet jokes—they can be wealth generators. Now, here’s the kicker: Every single person who missed out on Pepe has one thing in common—they wish they had acted sooner. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Meme Coin Movement? Fast forward to today, and another contender is stepping into the meme coin arena: BTFD Coin. Not just another face in the crowd, this token is built with a vision, a community, and a strategy to make waves. At the heart of BTFD Coin is the Bulls Squad, a team of four unique characters symbolizing different investor mindsets. Whether you’re a cautious planner like Nerdy Bull or a full-send investor like Raging Bull, this coin is designed to unite all types of crypto enthusiasts under one banner. Here’s where things get interesting. Right now, BTFD Coin is in Stage 15 of its meme coin presale , priced at $0.0002 per token. Once Stage 16 rolls in, that price will climb, and analysts predict an initial exchange listing at $0.0006. What does that mean for you? A 200% return on investment before the party even gets started. But dream a little bigger. If BTFD Coin follows the same trajectory as Pepe, reaching a potential high of $0.006, that’s a mind-blowing 2900% ROI: A $4,000 investment today at $0.0002 per token would get you 20 million BTFD Coins. At the projected listing price of $0.0006, that stash would be worth $12,000. If BTFD Coin surges to $0.006, that same $4,000 could transform into a staggering $120,000. Why BTFD Coin Stands Out Unlike meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD Coin brings real utility and a strong community. It features high-APY staking rewards, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and a roadmap designed for long-term growth. Plus, with over 71 billion tokens already sold, the demand is undeniable. Final Call: Your Last Chance at One of the Top New Meme Coins to Join in March 2025 BTFD Coin is nearing its final presale stage. With Stage 16 being the last stop before listing, this is the ultimate “buy the dip” moment before the price climbs. If you missed Pepe Coin’s explosive rise, consider this your shot at redemption. The window is closing fast. Don’t be the one wishing you had bought in sooner. Secure your BTFD Coins now and strap in for what could be the next big meme coin breakout.

Reuters reported on March 24 that Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin said his office subpoenaed Robinhood last week to get information on its marketing materials and the number of Massachusetts-based users that traded sports events contracts on college basketball tournaments. Galvin said he was concerned the trading platform was “linking a gambling event on a popular sports event that’s especially popular to young people to a brokerage account.” “This is just another gimmick from a company that’s very good at gimmicks to lure investors away from sound investing,” he added. Robinhood launched a prediction markets hub on March 17 that would be initially available through the Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated prediction platform Kalshi and would feature event contracts on college basketball tournaments and the May federal funds rate. A Robinhood spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the event contracts “are regulated by the CFTC and offered through CFTC-registered entities.” “Prediction markets have become increasingly relevant for retail and institutional investors alike, and we’re proud to be one of the first platforms to offer these products to retail customers in a safe and regulated manner,” the spokesperson said. Robinhood Markets (HOOD) share price remained relatively flat after the close of trading on March 24 after an over 9% jump over the day to close at $48.36, according to Google Finance. Robinhood is up nearly 30% so far this year but has fallen from its Feb. 14 all-time peak of $65.28. Source: Google Finance The CFTC and Galvin’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Event contracts are agreements that allow users to bet on the outcome of essentially anything, from sports games to election outcomes and the price of cryptocurrencies.

Last month, Robinhood scrapped event contracts allowing for bets on the Super Bowl a day after launching the products after the CFTC asked it to. The Massachusetts probe also requested Robinhood hand over internal communications about the decision to roll out the recent college basketball events contracts after the CFTC’s request to stop the Super Bowl contracts. The CFTC also reportedly asked Kalshi and Crypto.com early last month to explain how both of their Super Bowl event contracts complied with derivatives regulations.

The bills together, if passed into law, would clear the way for Arizona to establish strategic digital assets reserves composed of existing assets confiscated through criminal proceedings in addition to newly invested public funds. The Republicans hold a 33-27 majority in Arizona’s House of Representatives, giving both bills a decent chance of passing. Source: Bitcoin Laws However, according to Bitcoin Laws, the final hurdle could be the state’s Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs. Hobbs has a history of vetoing bills before the House, having blocked 22% of bills in 2024 — the highest rate of any state governor. Arizona’s two crypto bills explained The two bills recently approved by Arizona’s House Rules Committee are the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill (SB 1373) and the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025). The Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill (SB 1373) focuses on establishing a strategic digital assets reserve made up of digital assets seized through criminal proceedings to be managed by the state’s treasurer. The treasurer would be limited to investing no more than 10% of the fund’s total value each fiscal year. However, they would also be able to loan the fund’s assets in order to increase returns, provided that doing so doesn’t increase financial risks. The Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025) specifically deals with Bitcoin ( BTC ). The bill proposes allowing Arizona’s Treasury and state retirement system to invest up to 10% of its available funds into Bitcoin. Additionally, SB 1025 would also allow for the state’s Bitcoin reserve to be stored in a secure, segregated account inside a federal Bitcoin reserve, should one be established. Related: US states lead in strategic Bitcoin reserve creation — Will Trump deliver on his BTC promise? While Arizona is now considered to be leading the race to establish a state-based digital asset reserve, several other states are hot on its heels. On March 6, the Texas Senate passed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill (SB-21) by a vote of 25-5. The Texan bill still needs to pass the House and get the governor’s signature to pass into law. Following this vote, a new bill was introduced by Democrat Representative Ron Reynolds to cap the size of the previously uncapped reserve to $250 million. Utah also recently passed Bitcoin legislation , but all references to the establishment of a strategic reserve were removed at the last moment. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma House passed its Bitcoin Reserve Bill HB1203, 77-15 on March 25. That bill will now head to the state’s senate.

The accusation came is the latest episode in a lengthy legal battle and persistent advocacy led by key figures in the crypto community, like Coinbase’s Chief Legal Office, Paul Grewal. Grewal shared a post on X accusing the Treasury Department of attempting to sidestep the legal ruling of the court. He revealed that the announcement of the lifting of the sanctions contain an illegal moot clause, which does not align with legal precedence and fails to prevent a future sanction. The @USTreasury 's response to the unambiguous mandate of the Fifth Circuit on Tornado Cash has been a study in chaos. It's time for the district court to do what was ordered months ago.

Fikre, where the FBI’s removal of a plaintiff from the No Fly List did not prevent legal proceedings, as the court recognized that the agency could reinstate its prior decision at any time. Coinbase CLO accuses U.S. Treasury of attempting legal maneuver Grewal described the Treasury’s legal maneuvering as a “study in chaos”, arguing that the agency is yet to comply with the court’s order. He said: “It’s time for the district court to do what was ordered months ago. Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment on Count 1 must be granted, and TC’s designation must be held unlawful and set aside” The legal battle over Tornado Cash has become a defining case for the cryptocurrency industry testing the limits of the government and regulatory authority over decentralized and open-source technology. While the Treasury’s decision to remove Tornado Cash from the SDN list was a milestone moment, Grewal and other advocates remain concerned that the agency’s actions leave the door open for future restrictions. Alex Pertsev, co-founder of Tornado cash, who was previously arrested in the Netherlands on money laundering charges, was released on house arrest February 2025 after serving 64 months in prison. Co-founder Roman Semenov remains at large, while Roman Storm was arrested in August 2023 in Washington state and has been in a legal battle with the Department of Justice (DOJ) since then. He’s out on a $2-million bail and has seen overwhelming support from personalties and organizations with crypto interests. While this reversal is welcome, it does not go far enough. @alex_pertsev remains under house arrest in Europe for his alleged role in building Tornado Cash. It is time for all charges against him to be dropped. Developers should not be held criminally liable for writing code that… — Perianne (@PerianneDC) March 21, 2025 Tornado Cash’s legal battle with OFAC In August 2022, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash, alleging that it laundered over $7 billion including about $455 million for North Korea’s Lazarus Group. This led to its founders also being charged with money laundering and sanctions violations. Coinbase and other prominent voices in the crypto community launched a lawsuit challenging the Treasury’s actions. In November 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Treasury does not have the legal authority to sanction Tornado Cash, adding that the smart contracts used by the protocol to mask crypto transactions do not constitute property under federal law. The judge, Don Willett stated that “We readily recognize the real-world downsides of certain uncontrollable technology falling outside of OFAC’s sanctioning authority.” However, the sanctions remained until March 21, 2025, when the Treasury announced that it was lifting the sanctions on Tornado Cash and removing it from the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged the evolving technological and legal landscape, stating “Digital assets present enormous opportunities for innovation and value creation for the American people.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

PEPE is at a decisive point, testing its $0.00000650 support level—a zone that could determine its short-term future. A successful hold may invite renewed buying, but a drop could lead to further losses. At the same time, Official Trump (TRUMP) has tumbled by 80%, falling from its high of $74.59 to $13.41. Investors are questioning whether a recovery is even possible. While these projects battle volatility, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention with a key partnership. Its recent collaboration with SpaceDev, a respected blockchain development company, has supercharged its growth. With its presale surging beyond $205.5 million and BDAG priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, many see this as one of the most promising cryptos to buy before it hits the broader market. PEPE Tests a Key Support Zone as Traders Await Its Next Move PEPE finds itself at a crucial support zone near $0.00000650. According to crypto analyst Chandler, this level is make-or-break. If PEPE manages to hold above it, there’s potential for a recovery that could reignite interest among traders. A bounce from this point could trigger fresh buying activity, restoring bullish sentiment. However, if PEPE loses its grip and falls below this support, sellers may take over, driving the price lower. For now, investors are watching and waiting, looking for clear signals before deciding whether to re-enter or stay on the sidelines. TRUMP Coin Plunges 80%—Does It Have a Chance to Bounce Back? Official Trump (TRUMP) has taken a major hit, dropping 80% from $74.59 to just $13.41. This sharp decline has raised concerns about the coin’s future prospects. While some traders still hope for a rebound, the market appears cautious. For TRUMP to recover, it would need a significant injection of buying interest—something that isn’t guaranteed in today’s climate. Some speculate a price rally could push TRUMP to $100 by April 2025, but this remains highly uncertain. Analysts warn that without a major catalyst to renew confidence, TRUMP’s prospects remain unclear, and further declines are not off the table. BlockDAG’s Partnership with SpaceDev Fuels a Surge in Buyer Interest As PEPE and TRUMP navigate uncertainty, BlockDAG is charting an entirely different course. Its strategic partnership with SpaceDev is laying the groundwork for rapid ecosystem expansion. SpaceDev brings extensive blockchain expertise that is set to boost BlockDAG’s efficiency, scalability, and overall adoption. BlockDAG CEO Antony Turner has called this collaboration a major leap forward, while SpaceDev CTO Juan Manuel Sobral sees BDAG as a future leader in blockchain. SpaceDev will play a key role in enhancing BlockDAG’s developer ecosystem, overseeing grants, and optimizing network infrastructure—further expanding BDAG’s potential. These developments are already translating into tangible results. BlockDAG’s presale has exceeded $205.5 million, with batch 27 priced at $0.0248 and selling out fast. Unlike many speculative tokens, BDAG is focused on building a robust blockchain ecosystem, prioritizing real-world use cases and sustainable growth. Analysts suggest BDAG’s upcoming exchange listings could push its price significantly higher, making the current presale one of the last opportunities to buy before the market takes over. What Lies Ahead for PEPE, TRUMP, & BlockDAG? PEPE faces a defining moment. Whether it holds its key support level will shape its near-term direction—either sparking a bounce or inviting deeper losses. TRUMP remains in a steep decline, with little evidence of an imminent turnaround unless market sentiment shifts dramatically. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is in full momentum mode. Its partnership with SpaceDev is paving the way for broader adoption and innovation, and with its presale topping $205.5 million, BDAG stands out as one of the most promising crypto projects heading into 2025. Buyers are flocking to secure BDAG before it lists on major exchanges, positioning BlockDAG as a serious contender for the best new crypto to buy right now .

Dogecoin (DOGE), meanwhile, approaches a decisive support level, sparking discussions about whether a trend reversal is ahead. Amid this shifting landscape, BlockDAG (BDAG) continues its remarkable rise. With its value already up 2,380%, BDAG’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. The BDAG800 bonus, offering an incredible 400% extra coins, is now in its final phase. As the presale nears completion, buyers are seizing this limited-time opportunity before the bonus window closes. Cardano (ADA) Trading Volume Jumps 58% Despite Price Dip Cardano’s trading volume has surged by 58.36% to reach $1.77 billion, even though its price dropped by 9.3% over the last 24 hours. This increase in volume suggests renewed interest from traders, many of whom are either capitalizing on short-term price swings or preparing for a possible price recovery. ADA is now testing a key support zone between $0.73 and $0.80. Market analysts believe that holding this range could be vital for ADA to stabilize and regain momentum. Should buyers maintain their presence at these levels, there’s potential for ADA to push toward resistance at $1.14. If support holds firm, the increased trading volume may indicate strengthening market confidence. Dogecoin (DOGE) Nears Critical Support as Traders Await a Turnaround Dogecoin appears to be nearing an important turning point. After peaking at $0.4846, it has moved through a correction phase. Now, DOGE is approaching the $0.1822 support zone, which could be pivotal for its next move. Technical indicators point to the completion of a wave C pattern—often a sign that a reversal might be close. If DOGE rebounds from this level and the RSI begins to recover, a shift to bullish momentum could soon follow. However, if it drops below $0.0816, the potential for further downside remains. Investors are watching carefully to see whether a trend change is confirmed before anticipating stronger upward movement. BlockDAG’s Presale Momentum Builds as 400% Bonus Nears Expiry BlockDAG’s BDAG800 bonus has attracted major attention, offering buyers an extra 400% in BDAG coins. With the token’s price already up 2,380% since the presale began, excitement continues to grow. So far, over 18.8 billion BDAG tokens have been sold, and the presale has raised more than $205.5 million. Early adopters have seen impressive gains, and with BlockDAG moving toward its $600 million target, the chance to enter at the current price is quickly disappearing. There’s heightened anticipation as BlockDAG prepares to launch on more than ten major exchanges. Analysts are forecasting a $1 valuation by 2025, backed by BlockDAG’s strong presale success and expanding user base. As the BDAG800 bonus window narrows, this could be a final opportunity for buyers to secure additional BDAG before regular rates return. What’s Next for ADA, DOGE, & BlockDAG? Cardano’s recent surge in trading volume suggests active interest, even as it tests critical support. If that level holds, ADA could be poised for a rebound. Similarly, Dogecoin’s proximity to key support offers the potential for a price reversal, though confirmation is still pending. In contrast, BlockDAG’s upward momentum remains strong. With its 400% bonus still in play and exchange listings coming soon, BDAG offers an exciting chance for those looking for future growth. As its presale approaches the finish line, many are viewing BlockDAG as one of the most promising opportunities in the current market.

Gox shuffled a total of 12,000 Bitcoin worth over $1 billion on March 6 and another 11,833 Bitcoin on March 11. Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain said in a March 25 post to X that one of the previous transfers this month ended up in the crypto exchange Bitstamp. Spot On Chain speculates the 893 Bitcoin “sent to the warm wallet will be moved out shortly too.” Source: Spot On Chain Arkham data shows the exchange still holds about 35,000 Bitcoin worth $3.1 billion across wallets it controls. Many speculate significant movements from Mt. Gox could mean creditor payouts are around the corner. Creditors have the option to receive their payouts in Bitcoin. A July 2024 Reddit poll following the exchange’s first payout found creditors were not rushing to sell their Bitcoin payouts. Mt. Gox fell into bankruptcy in early 2014 after suffering an 850,000 Bitcoin loss in one of the biggest crypto hacks ever recorded. Before the security breach, it was the largest Bitcoin exchange, handling around 70-80% of trades. After its bankruptcy in February 2014, a Tokyo court appointed a trustee to manage the bankruptcy proceedings and compensate creditors with the exchange’s assets. Related: Mt. Gox moves $2.2B of Bitcoin, adding to BTC selling pressure However, last October, the trustee in charge of the exchange’s Bitcoin stash extended the deadline , pushing it by a full year to Oct. 31, 2025, claiming many creditors “still have not received their repayments because they have not completed the necessary procedures for receiving repayments.” Last December, Mt. Gox also moved over 24,000 Bitcoin , worth nearly $2.5 billion, to an unknown address after the cryptocurrency hit a milestone of $100,000.

The answer lies in Qubetics ($TICS), an emerging force in the industry that has already secured millions in presale funds. While many tokens promise innovation, few truly deliver— Qubetics is rewriting that narrative as one of the top crypto presale. Meanwhile, Story Protocol is shaping the future of decentralized intellectual property, integrating Claude’s Modular Content Platform (MCP) to streamline content creation. And Helium Network Token (HNT) is rapidly expanding in Mexico, connecting over 2.3 million people through its decentralized wireless network. Qubetics: The Future of Global Transactions Qubetics is a cutting-edge blockchain project designed to redefine financial connectivity. It eliminates the inefficiencies of traditional remittance systems by offering seamless, near-instant cross-border transactions. This means businesses, freelancers, and enterprises can move capital globally without the usual headaches of high fees, slow processing times, and currency conversion limitations. For example, imagine a logistics company needing to pay suppliers across multiple countries. Traditional banking channels would involve delays, high transaction costs, and unnecessary intermediaries. With Qubetics, those transactions are near-instant, with ultra-low fees, eliminating friction and enhancing cash flow efficiency one of the top crypto presale. Qubetics Presale Gains Momentum—Early Participants Secure Massive ROI Potential The Qubetics crypto presale is already making waves in its 27 stage, with over 503 million $TICS tokens sold and more than 23,700 token holders securing their share of this rapidly growing ecosystem. At its current price of $0.1300, those who recognized the potential early have positioned themselves for life-changing returns. The momentum is undeniable—Qubetics has already raised over $15.4 million, and the demand is only increasing as more people realize what’s unfolding. For those who got in early, the potential upside is staggering. Imagine securing $TICS when the presale first began—those early participants are already seeing exponential growth in their holdings. But even at this stage, the potential returns are still massive. A $500 investment at $0.1300 would acquire 3,846 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, that $500 turns into $3,846. If it surges to $10, that same $500 transforms into an incredible $38,460—a staggering 7,591% ROI. With supply steadily decreasing and presale stages advancing, the window of opportunity is closing fast. Once the presale ends, there’s no going back to these prices. Those who secure their position now could be looking at one of the top crypto presale. Story Protocol (IP): Pioneering Decentralized Content Creation Story Protocol is transforming how intellectual property is managed on-chain. By integrating Claude’s Modular Content Platform (MCP), the protocol allows creators to structure and commercialize their work more efficiently. This modular approach ensures that content can be reused, licensed, and monetized across multiple platforms without legal bottlenecks. At ETHDenver 2025, Story Protocol showcased these advancements to a receptive audience, highlighting its commitment to revolutionizing decentralized content ownership. Additionally, the recently updated technical roadmap promises new scalability enhancements, further improving the user experience for content creators looking to leverage blockchain’s potential. Helium Network Token (HNT): Expanding Connectivity in Mexico Helium Network Token (HNT) continues to push the boundaries of decentralized wireless networks. In February 2025, the project secured a partnership with Movistar, one of Mexico’s largest telecom providers, to expand Helium’s coverage to approximately 2.3 million new users. This move positions Helium as a serious contender in the telecommunications industry, challenging traditional centralized providers. Alongside network expansion, the Helium Wallet App received a significant update (v2.11.7), addressing critical bugs and improving the overall user experience. However, price forecasts suggest a potential downtrend, with some analyses projecting HNT could decline from $4.10 to $0.96 by the end of 2025. Why Qubetics Stands Out While Story Protocol innovates in the intellectual property sector and Helium strengthens decentralized connectivity, Qubetics is directly solving one of blockchain’s most persistent challenges—frictionless financial transactions. One of the top crypto presale numbers speak volumes, signaling strong community confidence. With blockchain adoption accelerating, Qubetics is positioned as a crucial infrastructure layer for the digital economy. For those looking to be part of a project that combines real-world utility with groundbreaking financial potential, the Qubetics presale is one event that cannot be overlooked. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other crypto projects? Qubetics is focused on real-world financial solutions, particularly cross-border transactions, offering ultra-low fees and near-instant transfers. How does Story Protocol benefit content creators? By integrating Claude’s MCP, Story Protocol enhances content modularity, allowing creators to monetize their work more effectively on a decentralized network. What is the latest update on Helium Network Token (HNT)? Helium expanded its network in Mexico through a partnership with Movistar, bringing connectivity to over 2.3 million users.

These products will include digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Crypto.com Coin (CRO), along with other securities focused on American industries, such as energy. The launch is expected later this year, pending regulatory approval. Crypto.com will provide the backend technology, custody solutions, and crypto supply. Notably, this is just the latest in a series of crypto projects backed by Trump and his family. They’ve released several NFT collections, memecoins, and even their own DeFi protocol, World Liberty Financial (WLFI). The funds are expected to launch later this year, pending approval, and are expected to be available worldwide, including in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, through existing platforms and brokerages. Despite challenges, Cronos climbed over 18% due to market excitement and momentum. In December, Cronos hit a yearly high after reports of a meeting between the Crypto.com CEO and the U.S. President, along with a legal resolution with the SEC. However, CRO has since dropped 30%. Today’s news has brought new liquidity to the altcoin. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes expressed excitement about partnering with Crypto.com and Yorkville America to launch investment products that focus on supporting American businesses, innovative technologies, and crypto ventures. These funds aim to strengthen the U.S. economy without being influenced by political agendas. Kris Marszalek, co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com, shared that he is proud of the partnership and excited to support the launch of these new ETFs, including the first-of-its-kind basket of tokens, featuring CRO. The ETFs will launch alongside Truth.Fi Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs). Both the ETFs and SMAs are part of TMTG’s financial services strategy, with TMTG planning to invest up to $250 million, managed by Charles Schwab. However, A Cronos ETF could be the biggest political crypto scandal since the TRUMP token. U.S. Presidents are not supposed to be involved in private business, especially with foreigners.

The filing revealed that the Israel-based crypto and stock trading platform brought in $12.6 billion in total revenue and $192 million in net income for 2024. In 2023, it reported $3.89 billion in revenue and just $15.3 million in profit. The numbers show a massive increase year over year. The company hasn’t yet said how much it plans to raise or what the share price will be. That information will come in a later filing when eToro is ready to launch the actual sale. The IPO is being led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS, and Citigroup. Both the company and some of its shareholders are planning to sell shares as part of the offering. eToro shows profit growth as crypto makes a comeback under Trump About 96% of eToro’s revenue in 2024 came from crypto, according to the filing. Crypto prices shot up last year after Donald Trump returned to the White House and took a pro-crypto stance. That policy change helped platforms like eToro, which lets users buy and sell crypto along with stocks, see a surge in demand. Founded in 2007, eToro runs a trading app that allows users to follow and copy popular traders. It has more than 38 million users across 75 countries, based on a recent company statement. The company first tried to go public in 2021 through a $10.4 billion merger with a special purpose acquisition company backed by Betsy Cohen, but the deal was canceled in 2022. Last year, eToro raised $250 million in a funding round that gave it a new valuation of $3.5 billion. That round included investors like ION Group, SoftBank Vision Fund II, and Velvet Sea Ventures. In the U.S., eToro ran into problems with regulators. In September 2024, the company’s American division, eToro USA LLC, agreed to pay a $1.5 million fine and restrict which crypto assets it offered to U.S. customers. The penalty was part of a settlement with the SEC, which accused the platform of operating as an unregistered broker and clearing agency. The company signed a cease-and-desist order but didn’t admit or deny the charges. The filing didn’t include any predictions for 2025 or forward-looking statements. It focused only on past performance. That leaves investors to decide whether the 2024 surge can last, especially since the company is so heavily tied to crypto markets, which are still volatile even under favorable policies. eToro didn’t say how many shares it would issue or what valuation it’s targeting now. But the last known private valuation was $3.5 billion, which is a steep drop from the canceled SPAC deal’s $10.4 billion figure. Whether the IPO beats or matches that number will depend on how crypto performs in early 2025 and how much investors believe in the company’s long-term growth. In a related development, Kraken, another crypto exchange, is also planning to go public, though a bit later than eToro. According to its own SEC filing, Kraken is working with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to raise up to $1 billion in debt ahead of an expected IPO in early 2026. The debt won’t be used to run daily operations. Instead, it will help Kraken expand before it enters public markets. One of the unnamed participants in the talks told the SEC that the final amount could be as low as $200 million, depending on how the talks go. The company is also thinking about raising equity along with the debt, but nothing has been finalized yet. Terms like the structure and total amount may change in the coming months. In a public statement, Kraken said, “We are always exploring strategic paths toward Kraken’s Mission: accelerating the global adoption of crypto. We remain fully focused on investing in this goal.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

As of today, BTC trades at approximately $88,025, representing a 6.2% increase over the past week. This recovery follows a volatile period where the asset experienced significant resistance below the $85,000 price level. While this upward price action has brought renewed optimism to the market, analysts are also highlighting underlying factors that could influence Bitcoin’s near-term direction. One of the most notable trends is a spike in leverage, signaling that derivative traders may be playing a larger role in driving price movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Futures Data Shows Bullish Long/Short Ratio – Details Bitcoin Open Interest Surges, Signaling High-Leverage Activity According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant analyst IT Tech, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) has reached a record high above $32 billion. Open Interest refers to the total value of outstanding derivative contracts—such as futures and options—that have not yet been settled. A rising OI alongside a rising price can indicate growing bullish sentiment, but it can also be a signal of increased risk if the market becomes overly leveraged. IT Tech noted that while the rally has sparked enthusiasm, it comes with a caveat. “High OI combined with rapid price increase often leads to liquidation cascades if the trend reverses,” the analyst wrote. If bulls fail to maintain momentum, over-leveraged positions may be liquidated, triggering a sharp correction. Monitoring sudden shifts in OI and price will be critical in the coming days.

Javon Marks, a technical analyst active on X, suggested that Bitcoin may be in the early stages of another major breakout. “Bitcoin looks to be working on another massive bullish breakout,” Marks said, adding that altcoins could soon follow suit. On the other hand, analyst Ali offered a more cautious outlook, citing the TD Sequential indicator as a potential sign of an upcoming short-term top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Under Threat?

Moo Deng just might. It climbed 3.65% in the last 24 hours, with trading volume popping by nearly 26%. Meanwhile, SPX6900 made a major statement, soaring 23.56% in one day and 67.60% on the week. That kind of surge doesn’t go unnoticed in meme coin land, where sentiment moves like lightning and FOMO drives fast action. But as impressive as these daily swings are, they still pale next to what BTFD Coin is pulling off during its ongoing meme coin presale. With over $6.41 million already raised and more than 71 billion tokens sold, BTFD isn’t just another player—it’s the one commanding the spotlight. Backed by a full Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY staking, and a projected moon price of $0.006, this project is rapidly becoming the hottest name among the best new meme coins to invest in now . BTFD Coin’s $6.41M Presale Has the Bulls Charging What happens when a coin offers 2X tokens, 90% APY staking, a live P2E game, and a projected 2900% ROI? It becomes the most talked-about meme coin presale of 2025. BTFD Coin, now in Stage 15 and priced at just $0.0002, has already raised over $6.41 million. And it’s not slowing down. With only one stage left before listing, early buyers are rushing in to Own the Dip and run with the Bulls. Analysts are already eyeing the $0.006 moon price post-listing. That’s a 2900% climb from today’s presale price. To put that into perspective, if someone threw $5,000 into BTFD at $0.0002, they’d get 25 million tokens. When BTFD hits $0.0006 listing price, that’s $15,000. But if it hits the projected $0.006? That turns into $150,000. That’s life-changing money—off a meme coin that hasn’t even listed yet. And here’s the cherry on top—the limited-time LAUNCH100 code that doubles your tokens. Yes, 2X. Every BTFD purchase before March 30 gets you twice as many tokens. That’s not just a deal—it’s a rocket launcher for returns. Bulls, this is the last chance to stake your claim before the price goes beast mode. Getting in is easy. Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with ETH or BNB, head to the presale page , connect your wallet, enter how much BTFD you want, and hit buy. Be sure to apply the LAUNCH100 code in all caps before finalizing the transaction to activate the bonus. Claim your tokens when the presale ends—and start earning through staking and gaming right away.

The Bitcoin ( BTC ) whale added 2,400 Bitcoin — worth over $200 million — to their stash on March 24, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence said in an X post. Data shared by the firm shows that despite some sales in February, after the latest purchase, the whale holds over 15,000 Bitcoin in its wallet , worth over $1.3 billion, at current prices. “A $1 billion Bitcoin Whale just withdrew $200 million of Bitcoin this morning from Binance,” Arkham said. The whale started acquiring Bitcoin five days ago after selling off its stash when Bitcoin’s price was between $100,000 and $86,000 in February. CoinGeck data shows on Feb. 1, Bitcoin was worth over $104,000, but it steadily declined to hit a low of $78,940 on Feb. 28. Source: Arkham Intelligence The whale movement comes amid a recent Bitcoin price rebound. Bitcoin has been trading $81,000 and $88,000 in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko, with a price surge of 3% on March 24, distancing itself from its $76,900 low on March 11. Bitcoin whale wakes from slumber At the same time, another Bitcoin whale has woken up after eight years of dormancy, moving over 3,000 Bitcoin, worth $250 million, in one transaction on March 22. “His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today — and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years,” Arkham said in a March 22 X post. Another huge Bitcoin holder, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with approximately $11.6 trillion in assets under management, has been steadily accumulating more Bitcoin over the last week as well, according to Arkham. Across 15 transactions, the asset manager bought an extra 4,054 Bitcoin, giving it a total stash of 573,878, worth over $50 billion, data on Bitbo’s Bitcoin treasury tracker shows . BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also led a rally of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, snapping a five-week net outflow streak by clocking a net inflow of $744.4 million. The bulk of net inflows came from BlackRock’s iShares, which recorded $537.5 million, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $136.5 million. Bitcoin whales weren’t the only ones accumulating more crypto. Lookonchain used Arkham data to track a lone Ether whale who added 7,074 Ether ( ETH ) to its stash on March 21, worth $13.8 million. Source: Lookonchain Ether has been moving between $1,876 and $2,097 in the last seven days, CoinGecko data shows . It’s still down over 57% from its all-time high of $4,878, which it hit in November 2021. However, its open interest surged to a new all-time high on March 21, and the number of addresses with at least $100,000 worth of Ether started rising at the beginning of March , from just over 70,000 addresses on March 10 to over 75,000 on March 22.

42298927,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=699164,1742872787,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42298927.jpeg,Bitcoin is just another trade to Wall Street—and it’ll dump it in the end like always,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-is-just-another-trade-to-wall-street/,"According to Standard Chartered, Bitcoin is still just another trade to Wall Street. It’s being grouped with tech stocks and traded like one. It gets picked up when it’s useful and tossed when it’s not. The bank said on Monday that Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq is now around 0.5, and earlier this year, it went up to 0.8. At the same time, its link with gold has collapsed. Since January, that correlation dropped to zero at one point. Now it’s just above 0.2. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote in the report, “Bitcoin trading is highly correlated to the Nasdaq over short time horizons.” He said this trend is why Bitcoin should be looked at as another big tech trade. Kendrick added, “If it were included [in a tech basket], the implication would be more institutional buying as BTC would serve multiple purposes in investor portfolios.” This isn’t new. Wall Street keeps switching how it sees crypto. One month, it’s a tech play. The next month it’s a “hedge against the traditional system.” But Kendrick didn’t deny that hedge idea. He said , “In reality… the need for such hedges is very infrequent.” Standard Chartered adds Bitcoin to tech stock experiment Mag 7B Meanwhile, Standard Chartered has also made up a new index called the Mag 7B. That one takes the Magnificent 7 tech stocks — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — but kicks Tesla out and adds Bitcoin in its place. Kendrick said that since December 2017, Mag 7B outperformed the regular Mag 7 by about 5%. That happened in five out of seven calendar years, even though the lead in 2022 was tiny. On average, Mag 7B returned about 1% more per year than Mag 7. He said the gains weren’t massive but were consistent. He also compared Bitcoin’s volatility to Nvidia’s over a longer period. Since January 20, when Donald Trump took office again, Bitcoin has dropped about 16%, and Nvidia is down 12%. Meanwhile, Tesla has crashed 36%. That’s more like ether, which has fallen 38% in the same time. Kendrick said, “Investors can view Bitcoin as both a hedge against [traditional finance] and as part of their tech allocation.” He added that Bitcoin’s role in portfolios is getting more solid and that this dual purpose might attract more money, especially now that it’s being adopted more by institutions. Volatility from Trump’s tariffs puts Bitcoin under pressure Since Trump started pushing tariffs again, Bitcoin dropped around 5% for the year. Standard Chartered said that’s not surprising, since Bitcoin tends to react to macroeconomic triggers. The bank pointed to two specific patterns: Bitcoin usually moves up when money supply (M2) grows, and down when the U.S. dollar index (DXY) rises. Those two relationships are still active. Traders are now waiting for relief in Q2, hoping that Bitcoin will bounce as the market gets more clarity on tariffs. But the White House has kept markets guessing. U.S. stock futures were flat Monday night, March 24. That came after a day when major indexes had surged on hopes that Trump would scale back his plans. The S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both down 0.1%, while the Dow Jones futures dropped 43 points. The hesitation came after gains earlier that day, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. According to their report, the White House may reduce the scope of the upcoming tariffs, which are supposed to go live on April 2. Morgan Stanley says market bounce won’t last long On the same Monday, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson spoke to CNBC’s Fast Money . He called the current rebound a “low-quality rally.” He said that it started off with a short squeeze, and now it’s being driven by small technicals, like earnings revisions stabilizing in some of the Mag 7 names. Wilson said, “The last couple of days, though, stocks have acted better, and that can take the index higher. How high? 5,900. So, we’re almost there.” The market had a strong start to the week. On Monday, the S&P 500 rose 1.8% and closed at 5,767.57. That’s still about 6% below its record high. The Dow added nearly 600 points, and the Nasdaq Composite went up by more than 2%. The Magnificent Seven were a big part of that rally. Those include Apple, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla. Tesla saw its best daily gain since November. But Wilson doesn’t think that momentum will last long. He wrote in his Monday note that the rally has limits. “Stronger seasonals, lower rates and oversold momentum indicators support our call for a tradeable rally from ~5500,” he said. He also mentioned that a weaker dollar and stabilized earnings estimates from the big tech stocks could bring capital back to U.S. equities. But after that short-term move, he warned, the volatility isn’t going anywhere. Wilson added, “Whatever rally we’re getting now, we think probably end up fading into earnings, into May and June. Then, we’ll probably make a more durable low later in the year.” He blamed the weakness in markets not on tariffs but on fundamentals and technicals. “The reason the markets are lower over the course of the last three or four months has nothing to do with tariffs,” Wilson said. “It’s mostly to do with the fact that earnings revisions have rolled over. The Fed stopped cutting rates. You had stricter enforcement on immigration. You have [Department of Government Efficiency]. All of those things are growth negative.” At press time, Bitcoin was worth exactly $87,722. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Bitcoin hovered near $87,000, leading a broader rally in altcoins. Solana and ETH were also showing strong recovery on Tuesday. Investor sentiments have improved following reports that the White House is considering a more moderate stance on tariffs, easing concerns over potential economic disruptions. The White House is reportedly shifting toward a more “targeted” approach in implementing Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, rather than a broad application. The global cryptocurrency market cap rose to $2.85 trillion, marking a 2.05% increase over the past 24 hours. Trading activity surged, with total market volume reaching $87.37 billion, up 60.12% from the previous day. Bitcoin (BTC) price today Bitcoin traded at $86,866.24 up around 1% in the past 24 hours. The coin’s 24-hour trading range was between $85,890.56 and $88,758.73. Bitcoin’s market dominance slipped by 0.31% over the day to 60.54%. Bitcoin climbed back above $88,000 on Monday, extending its weekend gains as the broader cryptocurrency market moved higher. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted in an X post on Monday that Bitcoin could climb to $110,000 before pulling back to $76,500. Hayes pointed to the US Federal Reserve’s dovish stance on inflation and President Trump’s flexible approach to tariffs as potential catalysts that could ease market concerns and bolster investor confidence. Ethereum (ETH) price today Ethereum (ETH) price was showing a strong recovery on Tuesday. The token was up around 3.5% to trade at $2,063.37. The intraday low and high were $1,990.96 and $2,101.98, respectively. Trading volume for the coin shot up over 72% to $14.5 billion. XRP and SOL price today XRP price was down 0.26%, trading at $2.42 after hitting an intraday high of $2.50. On March 24, CoinShares released its latest Weekly Crypto Asset Flow report, highlighting net inflows into the crypto market for the week ending March 21—the first in six weeks. XRP ranked second, attracting $6.7 million in inflows. The recent inflows may indicate growing speculation on the approval of a US XRP-spot ETF. According to Polymarket, a crypto-betting platform, the likelihood of an XRP-spot ETF approval by December 2025 climbed to 86% on March 24, up from 57% in January.

Gox Transfers $1B in Bitcoin: 10,608 BTC Moved to New Wallet appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange before its collapse in 2014, has been slowly releasing its Bitcoin holdings as part of a long-awaited rehabilitation process. As per data from Spot on chain, the latest move involved transferring 11,501.4 BTC, valued at around $1 billion. This transfer included 10,608 BTC worth $929.7M which was sent to a new wallet. 893.4 BTC worth $78.3M was sent to a warm wallet, which is often used for transactions and could be moved out soon. This follows a previous transfer where 332 BTC ($25.5M) was deposited into the Bitstamp exchange. Given the size of these transfers, there is speculation that the BTC in the warm wallet will likely be moved or sold soon, which could impact the market. [ATTENTION] Mt. Gox just moved 11,501.4 $BTC ($1B) again! This includes 10,608 $BTC ($929.7M) sent to a new wallet and 893.4 $BTC ($78.3M) to a warm wallet. Notably, after Mt. Gox’s previous transfer, 332 $BTC ($25.5M) was deposited into #Bitstamp . It is likely the 893.4 $BTC … https://t.co/8HryhiHSoT pic.twitter.com/NBQtcWSREJ — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 25, 2025 Notably, this is the third significant transfer of funds by the exchange in the past four weeks, which follows Mt. Gox’s earlier moves, where it shuffled a total of 12,000 Bitcoin, worth over $1 billion, on March 6, and another 11,833 Bitcoin on March 11. So far, the latest coin transfers haven’t affected the spot price, unlike earlier this month. This is a big contrast to mid-last year when Mt. Gox’s coin transfers triggered fears of creditor sell-offs, causing major price swings. Many think that the large transfers from Mt. Gox could mean that creditor payouts are coming soon. Creditors have the option to receive their payouts in Bitcoin. A Reddit poll in July 2024, after the exchange made its first payout, showed that most creditors weren’t in a hurry to sell their Bitcoin. This suggests that many are holding onto their payouts rather than cashing out immediately. Mt. Gox began repaying its creditors in July 2024 using its holdings of 142,000 BTC ($11 billion), 143,000 Bitcoin Cash ($47 million), and 69 billion yen ($469 million). Some creditors received payments through Kraken and Bitstamp exchanges. The exchange still holds approximately 35,000 Bitcoin, valued at $3.1 billion, across wallets under its control. However, last October, the exchange pushed back its full creditor payout deadline to October 31, 2025, due to ongoing verification and processing for claimants.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BCH|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 03:24:01

Crypto.com @cryptocom · Follow We are excited to announce that Crypto.com will partner with Trump Media for ETFs, including a first of its kind ETF basket of cryptocurrencies, including #CRO and other crypto assets. crypto.com/en/company-new… 6:38 am · 25 Mar 2025 957 Reply Copy link Read 165 replies According to Monday’s press release , the new products will include digital currencies and securities and focus on diverse industries, including energy. The announcement triggered substantial recoveries for native token CRO. The altcoin broke out of a nearly four-month downtrend after a 25% increase in the past 24 hours, hinting at continued gains. Meanwhile, Crypto.com will ensure custody, support backend tech, and supply digital assets (including Bitcoin, Cronos, and others) for the upcoming ETFs. Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes commented on the development, stating: We aim to create inventive funds incorporating firms that concentrate on rapid growth, technological innovation, and strengthening the US economy, unencumbered by woke nonsense and political posturing. Investors will finally have options that adhere to their principles and that support superior US companies precisely focused on their core businesses. Is a CRO ETF imminent? Cronos coin issuer Crypto.com has witnessed multiple changes lately as it explores new markets. The latest collaboration with Trump Media magnified optimism in CRO due to exchange-traded funds hints. The announcement confirmed that the ETFs will incorporate BTC, CRO, and other digital assets. However, the team clarified that the ETFs will need regulatory approval before launching. Trump Media Group is behind Donald Trump’s social media site Truth Social. Meanwhile, the US president and his family have shown an increased appetite for blockchain technology. Besides their DeFi platform, World Liberty Financial, the team has issued several NFTs and meme tokens. CRO’s bullish breakout The partnership news catalyzed solid rebounds for Cronos. Analyst Cloudscape highlighted that the alt broke out of an almost 4-month low bearish trend, suggesting impressive short-term upswings. Source – Cloudscape on X The daily CRO/USD chart shows the altcoin maintained downtrends since late last year, printing lower lows and lower highs. Nevertheless, a decisive break beyond the descending trendline indicates a momentum shift, with buyers’ edge. CRO changes hands at $0.1014, targeting the resistance at $0.1598. Extended uptrends above this obstacle could trigger substantial gains for the altcoin. However, immediate weakness could mean a false breakout, with CRO failing to steady above the breakout region. Such scenarios might drag the digital asset to the support zone at $0.0705. That would translate to an approximately 30% dip from Cronos’ prevailing price. CRO’s price action Cronos led crypto gainers on Tuesday as it soared nearly 25% to trade at $0.1014. Chart by Coinmarketcap The over 650% increase in 24-hour trading volume highlights renewed investor and trader interest. A confirmed breakout will see the CRO climb towards the key level at $0.1598 – a 36% increase from the current CRO’s price. However, a false breakout might send the token back into the descending channel, leading to prolonged consolidation or significant price dips.

Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) argued that a final ruling is needed to prevent further attacks on the protocol. US Treasury Claims Tornado Cash Case Is Moot The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) removed Tornado Cash from its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list on March 21. It also delisted nearly 100 Smart Contract addresses affiliated with the Ethereum-based crypto mixer. The Friday delisting followed a November court ruling that determined the US Treasury had exceeded its authority by sanctioning the platform for allegedly “facilitating” money laundering. The same day, the Treasury Department argued in a court filing that a final court judgment in the Tornado Cash lawsuit is required because the crypto mixer was removed from the SDN list. Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, criticized the US treasury’s “late Friday pleading against Tornado Cash,” noting that “After grudgingly delisting TC, they now claim they’ve mooted any need for a final court judgment. But that’s not the law, and they know it.” Grewal argued that “under the voluntary cessation exception, a defendant’s decision to end a challenged practice moots a case only if the defendant can show that the practice cannot ‘reasonably be expected to recur.’” He cited a case Supreme Court ruling from last year, FBI v. Fikre (2024), that determined the FBI didn’t moot the case despite removing the plaintiff from the No Fly List because the ban could be reinstated again in the future. Based on this, the CLO considers a final court ruling on the Tornado Cash lawsuit necessary. He affirmed that the US Treasury has not assured that it won’t relist the crypto mixer in the future. “That’s not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,” Grewal concluded. Notably, the Treasury Department stated that it remained “deeply concerned about the significant state-sponsored hacking and money laundering campaign” of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), adding that it “will continue to monitor closely any transactions that may benefit malicious cyber actors or the DPRK.” The Fight For Crypto Privacy In August 2022, OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash for “failing to impose effective controls” to prevent malicious actors from laundering funds through the crypto mixer. The US Treasury alleged that the decentralized protocol had been used to launder over $7 billion worth of crypto since 2019, including $455 million linked to the North Korea-linked hacking group Lazarus. As Bitcoinist reported , the US District Court for the Western District of Texas reversed the OFAC sanctions against Tornado Cash in January. However, Peter Van Valkenburgh, attorney and Executive Director at CoinCenter, pointed out that the court ruling wasn’t “the end of the story.” As he explained in January, the “District Court will still need to decide whether the remedy is nationwide vacatur (anyone in US can use immutable contracts) or more limited relief (plaintiffs can use contracts and other parties may need to bring their own suits). Nationwide vacatur is what we should be rooting for.” On Sunday, Grewal also highlighted that “Money laundering hurts people. There. So does violating the law set by Congress. And so does impugning the integrity of large numbers of software developers with broad slanders and no individualized evidence that they did anything illegal.” It’s worth noting that despite Tornado Cash’s delist from OFAC’s sanctions list, one of its founders, Roman Storm, and its developer, Alexey Pertsev, continue their legal battle against Money Laundering charges. Pertsev was detained in the Netherlands in August 2022 and convicted in May 2024. He is working on his upcoming appeal after receiving a supervised release from prison. Meanwhile, Storm, also detained in 2022, awaits his April 14 trial. As Paradigm’s co-founder, Matt Huang, previously pointed out, “The prosecution’s case threatens to hold software developers criminally liable for the bad acts of third parties, which would have a chilling effect on crypto and beyond.”",Crypto News|Alexey Pertsev|coinbase|Coinbase CLO|Crypto Mixer|Crypto Privacy|ETH|Ethereum|ETHUSDT|mixing protocol|OFAC|Paul Grewal|Roman Storm|Tornado Cash|US Treasury Department,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-25 03:30:05

Mark Uyeda, the acting SEC chair, was reportedly the only commissioner who opposed suing Musk over his delayed disclosure of his stock purchase in Twitter, now rebranded as X. According to a report by Reuters, this decision comes at a time when the SEC is dealing with shifting priorities and challenges within the agency. The vote to determine whether Musk should face a lawsuit took place behind closed doors, with Uyeda breaking from the other commissioners who favored legal action. The SEC had formally filed a lawsuit against Musk in January 2025, alleging that he violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose his acquisition of more than 5% of Twitter’s stock in 2022. This failure to file the necessary report allowed Musk to purchase additional shares at artificially low prices, potentially saving him millions of dollars. SEC’s Changing Stance The SEC has been adjusting its approach to regulating cryptocurrency, easing enforcement actions against companies such as Ripple, OpenSea, and Coinbase. This more lenient stance has sparked discussions about the agency’s evolving priorities. Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration has also generated attention. He was appointed by former President Donald Trump to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency, a role designed to streamline regulatory practices. Musk’s relationship with Trump continues to raise speculation about potential influence on regulatory decisions. The SEC’s case against Musk brings to attention the ongoing debate about how securities laws apply to tech executives, particularly in the changing digital asset space.

The move signals growing confidence within the company as it eyes a public debut amid a shifting regulatory landscape in the US. Kraken has reportedly enlisted Wall Street heavyweights Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to lead the effort. The fundraising discussions are still in early stages. These two banks are reportedly in talks with additional lenders and financial institutions. Sources told Bloomberg the company may raise as little as $200m. The final amount will depend on market conditions and investor appetite. Kraken didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Crypto exchange Kraken is exploring raising as much as $1 billion in debt ahead of a potential initial public offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter. https://t.co/N3hlbFcu5G — Bloomberg (@business) March 24, 2025 Funds to Support Expansion, Not Operations This debt raise is not meant to cover operating costs, unlike typical emergency funding in crypto. Kraken plans to use the money for growth and expansion. This could include acquisitions, new products and scaling in key markets. Kraken is also said to be weighing an equity raise alongside the debt package. However, no final decisions have been made. Both the size and structure of the capital raise remain subject to change. With Legal Overhang Reduced, Kraken Resumes IPO Readiness Efforts An IPO has been on Kraken’s radar for years. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company is preparing for a possible public listing as soon as Q1 2025 . A more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under President Donald Trump could help clear the path, after prior ambitions were slowed by stricter enforcement under the Biden administration. The company has previously faced legal hurdles, including enforcement actions from the US SEC. Kraken settled one case and saw another dropped without penalties , allowing it to move forward with less regulatory overhang. In a sign of its broader ambitions, Kraken announced just last week it would acquire retail futures trading platform NinjaTrader for $1.5b . That deal, along with the ongoing fundraising discussions, indicates Kraken is preparing to expand its footprint ahead of a potential public listing.

The media platform has signed a non-binding agreement to offer a series of exchange-traded products (ETPs) and funds (ETFs). Trump media firm operates his frequently-used social media platform Truth Social. The “America-first” investment funds are slated to launch later this year subject to regulatory approvals, the statement noted. Further, the funds will be available on Truth.Fi , a platform designed to offer investment products. “The funds are expected to be widely available internationally including in the United States, Europe, and Asia, across existing platforms and brokerages,” the release read. We are excited to announce that https://t.co/vCNztATSCO will partner with Trump Media for ETFs, including a first of its kind ETF basket of cryptocurrencies, including #CRO and other crypto assets. https://t.co/EyxAH4Zhp6 pic.twitter.com/2mFvybjKOW — Crypto.com (@cryptocom) March 25, 2025 Crypto.com to Offer Backend Tech, Custody, Cryptos The funds would comprise both cryptos and securities from industries, including the energy sector. Besides, the funds will be available via Crypto.com’s broker-dealer, Foris Capital US, the media company said Monday. Additionally, Crypto.com, which was locked in a legal battle with US regulators last year, will supply the cryptocurrencies for the funds, including Bitcoin , Cronos and other digital assets. “These ETFs will give consumers more options from a brand with a loyal following,” said Kris Marszalek, co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com. “Once launched, these ETFs will be available on the Crypto.com App for our more than 140 million users around the world.” Crypto.com will also provide custody services and support the backend technology. Following the announcement, Crypto.com’s native CRO token is up nearly 30% over the last 24 hours to $0.10, per CoinGecko . Trump Media’s shares also surged over 9% in after hours trading. US Crypto ETFs Boom ETFs are popular investment vehicles that give investors exposure to an underlying asset. The SEC gave green light to Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds last year that opened doors to a flood of capital. The 11 Bitcoin ETFs currently trading, manage about $100 million in assets now. Meanwhile, Ehereum ETFs have generated about $2.5 billion net inflows. Further, the funds’ success have prompted asset managers to file for a range of altcoin ETFs , including Litecoin, Dogecoin, Solana and Cardano.

Steve Demetriou wants to turn Columbus into a major Bitcoin reserve hub. His plan could boost crypto adoption, attract businesses, and bring more investment to the Midwest. A strong crypto policy may drive innovation, create jobs, and increase tax revenue, making Columbus a key player in the digital economy.

His proposal allows the state to invest up to 10% of its unused funds in Bitcoin, aiming to strengthen Ohio’s financial future and bring innovation to public treasury management. Ohio needs to be on the cutting edge of cryptocurrency. My bill would establish basic rules and definitions around it so that we can be leaders in the future of finance. pic.twitter.com/pxB0nCvXkn — Steve Demetriou (@steve4ohiohouse) March 24, 2025 Ohio’s Vision for Bitcoin Adoption Demetriou believes that for Ohio to lead in digital finance, it must embrace cryptocurrencies. His bill grants the state treasurer the authority—but not the obligation—to invest in Bitcoin. These funds would come from the general revenue fund, the rainy-day fund, and the trust fund that covers lottery winnings. The move is not just about diversification; it’s about putting Ohio on the map as a crypto-friendly state ready to embrace financial innovation. A Growing Trend Among U.S. States Ohio isn’t alone in this push. Across the U.S., 28 states have proposed similar Bitcoin reserve plans, with 18 actively moving through legislative stages. Fifteen states have already reached discussions in the House of Representatives, while some have hit roadblocks. However, the increasing support for Bitcoin in public funds reflects the growing belief that digital assets have a role in government finance. The federal government is still debating whether to create a national crypto reserve, but individual states are moving ahead. Ohio’s initiative could set a precedent for others, encouraging broader adoption of Bitcoin in public treasury strategies. Bitcoin’s Stability in Question While Demetriou’s bill is structured with strict guidelines to ensure responsible Bitcoin investment. Only cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of at least $750 billion qualify, and currently, Bitcoin is the only one that meets this requirement. Security is a top priority—investments must be held securely in multiple locations, with no smartphone access allowed to prevent cyber threats. Bitcoin’s price fluctuations have raised concerns, but Demetriou sees it as a long-term investment rather than a speculative asset. By integrating Bitcoin into its financial strategy, Ohio is taking a forward-thinking approach, potentially reshaping how governments manage and grow public funds.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 05:10:37

Best New Meme Coins for Significant Returns,https://thecoinrise.com/cheems-and-sudeng-pump-as-btfds-100-bonus-bomb-settles-soon-best-new-meme-coins-for-significant-returns/,"The meme coin market is throwing wild punches again, and if you’re not riding this wave, you’re seriously missing out. BTFD Coin is still promoting its LAUNCH100 bonus, meaning every dollar you invest right now gets doubled in tokens (yes, 2X your coins!). Meanwhile, Cheems is making small but steady moves, and Sudeng is flexing some serious volume. If you’re after the best new meme coins for significant returns , this is your moment. Here’s why BTFD Coin’s 2900% ROI potential has the crypto world buzzing and why Cheems and Sudeng are also turning heads. BTFD Coin: The Only Meme Coin Giving You Double the Tokens! If you’ve been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the perfect time to ape into a meme coin presale, consider this your golden ticket. BTFD Coin is in Stage 15, priced at $0.0002, with only one stage left before the presale ends! It’s already raised over $6.41 million and has over 11,500 holders—and now it’s dropping absolute fire with its referral rewards program and the LAUNCH100 bonus. How BTFD Coin’s Referral System Can Stack Your Bags BTFD Coin is making it rain with its 10% referral rewards, meaning you don’t just get rich investing—you get richer when you bring your friends along. Here’s how it works: Connect Your Wallet on the BTFD presale page and get your unique referral code. Share Your Code with anyone looking to invest. Get 10% of their purchase in BTFD tokens if you rank in the top 20 referrers by month’s end. They get 10% more BTFD on their purchase! Track your earnings and watch your holdings multiply effortlessly. Imagine this—your buddy invests $5,000 in BTFD Coin using your referral. They get an extra $500 in BTFD, and you snag $500 worth of BTFD too. The more people you bring in, the more free tokens you rake in! That makes it one of the best new meme coins for significant returns. BTFD Coin’s Explosive Growth Potential Analysts predict BTFD Coin could hit $0.0006 when it lists, and if momentum kicks in, a $0.006 moonshot isn’t off the table. Here’s how to break this down in cold, hard numbers: Invest $3,000 today at $0.0002 per token = 15 million BTFD tokens. At a $0.0006 listing price, your bag is now worth $9,000 (3X your money!). If BTFD moons to $0.006, your $3,000 turns into $90,000. That’s a 2900% ROI! This presale window is closing fast, and with Stage 16 being the final round, this is your last chance to grab tokens before BTFD Coin lands on exchanges. Cheems: The Meme Coin OG Making Moves Cheems is holding steady at $0.000155, up 0.58% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $395,923. It’s not pulling a Dogecoin-level rally just yet, but the slow and steady growth shows confidence in its longevity. With a circulating supply of 2.55 billion CHEEMS, it’s still flying under the radar. If the community rallies behind it and it secures more exchange listings, it could see higher trading volume and price surges. Right now, it’s a low-market-cap gem that meme coin hunters should keep an eye on among the best new meme coins for significant returns. Sudeng: High Volume, High Potential Sudeng, aka HIPPO, is sitting at $0.004227 with a $42.2 million market cap, which makes it a more established player in the meme coin world. What’s catching attention, though, is its trading volume of $13.5 million in the last 24 hours. That kind of liquidity means investors are actively jumping in, and that momentum could push Sudeng’s price even higher. With a 10 billion HIPPO token supply, Sudeng has positioned itself as a serious meme coin contender, especially if it lands on more major exchanges. Watch this space, because this coin has the volume to make serious moves as one of the best new meme coins for significant returns. Final Thoughts: The Best New Meme Coins for Significant Returns Won’t Last Forever! The meme coin market is heating up, and while Cheems and Sudeng are showing strong potential, BTFD Coin is the ONLY one giving you 2X tokens AND a 2900% ROI opportunity. The LAUNCH100 bonus disappears after March 30, so if you want in, you need to act fast on this meme coin presale .

This is due to its prolonged consolidation between the $0.695 and $0.75 levels. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Price Prediction Looking at the ongoing price momentum, ADA is likely to see a major rally only if it breaks out of this consolidation; otherwise, the price may continue to experience minor fluctuations. Based on recent price action and historical trends, if ADA breaches the upper boundary of the consolidation and closes a daily candle above $0.756, there is a strong possibility of a price surge of over 12%, pushing it to the $0.85 level. Conversely, if ADA falls below the lower boundary and closes a daily candle below $0.69, it could drop to $0.65 in the coming days. Source: Trading View Additionally, the asset is facing resistance from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. At press time, ADA is trading near $2.42, registering a modest price decline of 0.50% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, the asset recorded a 40% jump in trading volume, indicating heightened participation from traders compared to the previous day. Major Liquidation Levels Despite the ongoing uncertainty and unclear price action, traders appear bullish and are strongly betting on the long side, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at $0.711 on the lower side and $0.742 on the upper side. Over the past 24 hours, they have built $17 million worth of long positions and $3 million worth of short positions, partially confirming that ADA’s price is poised for massive upside momentum. Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, whales and long-term holders seem to be continuously accumulating the asset despite ongoing market volatility, further signaling a potential price reversal. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The proposed legislation , if enacted, would enable the state to create strategic reserves of digital assets—leveraging both seized assets and public investments. The two bills in question are Senate Bill 1373, known as the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill, and Senate Bill 1025, titled the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. Arizona Crypto Reserve Bills Move to House Floor with GOP Majority Advantage Both bills are now headed to the House floor for a full vote, where the Republican-controlled chamber holds a 33-27 majority, potentially giving the proposals a favorable path forward. SB 1373 outlines the creation of a digital assets reserve composed of cryptocurrencies confiscated through criminal proceedings. Arizona’s state treasurer would manage the fund, with strict investment guidelines. Specifically, no more than 10% of the reserve’s total value could be invested annually. The bill also permits lending the assets to generate returns, as long as financial risks are not heightened. SB 1025 focuses specifically on Bitcoin, allowing the state treasury and retirement system to allocate up to 10% of their available funds into the cryptocurrency. It also includes provisions for securely storing the Bitcoin reserve in a segregated account within a potential federal Bitcoin reserve, should one be formed in the future. JUST IN: Arizona's House Rules Committee passed both Bitcoin Reserve Bills (SB1373 and SB1025), ruling them ""constitutional and in proper form."" The bills have now passed their assigned committees, meaning they should be headed for a full floor vote. pic.twitter.com/6KzJ0kHeI5 — Fiat Archive (@fiatarchive) March 24, 2025 Despite momentum in the legislature, the bills may face a significant challenge at the executive level. Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, has vetoed 22% of bills in 2024 so far—the highest rate among U.S. governors this year. Her stance on the digital asset legislation remains uncertain. Arizona’s efforts put it at the forefront of a broader state-level movement to incorporate cryptocurrencies into public finance strategies. More U.S. States Eye Bitcoin Reserve Other states are following suit. Texas, for example, recently passed its own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill (SB-21) in the Senate with a 25-5 vote. That bill now awaits a House vote and gubernatorial approval. In response, Texas Representative Ron Reynolds has introduced a bill to cap the reserve size at $250 million. Meanwhile, Oklahoma’s House approved Bitcoin Reserve Bill HB1203 with a 77-15 vote on March 25, sending it to the state Senate for consideration. Utah also introduced similar legislation, but the excerpt about establishing a strategic reserve was ultimately removed.

Analyst Predicts This New ‘Beyond Crypto’ Entity Could Replace Ethereum,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/analyst-predicts-new-beyond-crypto-entity-could-replace-eth/,"The post ETH Stable at $2000? Analyst Predicts This New ‘Beyond Crypto’ Entity Could Replace Ethereum appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency landscape in 2025 is witnessing significant changes as Ethereum (ETH) remains stable around $2000 and analysts predict new projects could soon surpass ETH in terms of utility and adoption. Coldware (COLD) is one such project gaining traction, with some experts suggesting it has the potential to replace Ethereum in key use cases due to its innovative features and scalability. Coldware (COLD): The ‘Beyond Crypto’ Entity Experts are beginning to refer to Coldware (COLD) as a ‘Beyond Crypto’ entity due to its real-world applications and broad use cases. While Ethereum remains a dominant force in DeFi and smart contracts, Coldware (COLD) is making its mark in sectors that go beyond traditional cryptocurrency applications. As Coldware continues to grow and gain adoption, it could become the preferred blockchain for industries like IoT, smart devices, and supply chain management. This shift could signal a fundamental change in the way blockchain is used, moving from speculative crypto trading to real-world utility. Coldware (COLD): The Future of Blockchain Beyond Crypto Coldware (COLD) is revolutionizing the way blockchain is used in the IoT space. By addressing the issues of scalability and transaction fees that have plagued other networks, Coldware is making blockchain technology more accessible and practical for real-world applications.

Dubbed “Mag 7B,” this fresh lineup has outperformed the original, delivering higher returns and lower volatility. The move sparks debate over whether Bitcoin deserves a spot alongside the biggest tech giants. A Better Fit Than Tesla? The experiment showed that Bitcoin, with its $1.7 trillion market cap—double that of Tesla—brings a stronger risk-reward balance to the mix. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s global head of digital assets research, noted that Bitcoin is more aligned with the Nasdaq than gold, suggesting it belongs in a tech-heavy portfolio. Since December 2017, Mag 7B has outpaced the original index by 5%, with stronger annual returns in five of the past seven years. On top of that, it was nearly 2% less volatile on average, making it a more stable choice than Tesla. A Growing Role in Institutional Portfolios Bitcoin’s market cap has soared past $1.7 trillion, more than double Tesla’s, making it a strong contender for institutional investments. Its increasing acceptance in global portfolios, especially as both a tech asset and a hedge, reinforces its potential to stand alongside giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Moreover, with the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, trading BTC has become just as seamless as trading major stocks. Kendrick believes Bitcoin now serves multiple roles—both as a hedge against traditional finance and as a key asset in tech portfolios. Market trends are looking good for Bitcoin. Since the Nasdaq is struggling, investors might shift money into Bitcoin. A key U.S. tariff decision on April 2 could also impact the market, and some experts believe Bitcoin could climb toward $90,000, showing its growing role in mainstream finance. Following the news, Bitcoin is up over 3.5% on Monday, pushing the total crypto market cap to $2.9 trillion. Other major cryptocurrencies are also gaining, with Ethereum up 4%, XRP rising 3.2%, Solana jumping 6.5%, and Dogecoin increasing by 3%.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 05:22:24

Gox has recently executed a big transaction by moving a massive 11,501.4 BTC, valued at approximately $1 billion, across two wallets. This is the second big transaction of this scale done by the exchange this month of March. Investors are closely watching the possibility of any major BTC price volatility going ahead. Mt. Gox Moves $1 Billion Worth of Bitcoin As part of the creditor repayment procedure, Mt. Gox, a defunct crypto exchange, is moving its Bitcoin holdings in huge numbers. Earlier on Tuesday, the exchange moved a total of 11,501.4 BTC, worth $1 billion, across two wallets. Details of the transaction reveal that 10,608 BTC (worth $929.7 million) was sent to a new wallet, while 893.4 BTC (valued at $78.3 million) was moved to a warm wallet, as reported by Spot On Chain . Source Spot On Chain This movement follows a previous Mt. Gox transfer, which saw 332 BTC ($25.5 million) deposited into the cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp. Market watchers speculate that the 893.4 BTC sent to the warm wallet may also be moved out shortly, potentially impacting market dynamics. Earlier this month in March, Mt. Gox moved 12,000 Bitcoin when the BTC price was trading around $92,000. Since then, Bitcoin has corrected nearly 7% and is currently flirting around $86,500 levels. The Bitcoin daily trading volumes have surged by a massive 97%, currently at $33.37 billion. BTC Price Volatility Coming Soon? Amid this massive Bitcoin movement by the crypto exchange, there’s a growing speculation of a major BTC price volatility coming ahead.

This level marks the convergence of the 50-day moving average and a descending trendline stemming from Bitcoin’s all-time high.

The current Bitcoin price prediction shows that bulls might try to restest this breakout again. However, failure to surpass it may result in continued consolidation or a potential pullback for BTC . Furthermore, the analyst pointed out that the Bitcoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently entered the overbought territory. The last six times the RSI has entered this territory, BTC has entered sharp corrections thereafter.

She made the projection during an interview and repeated it later at the HSBC Global Investment Summit, claiming the growth will come almost entirely from robo taxis, which she believes will drive 90% of Tesla’s future value. Cathie told Bloomberg that her firm, Ark Investment Management, hasn’t even added Tesla’s humanoid robot initiatives into the forecast yet. “We haven’t included that in the valuation,” she said, referring to the company’s work on robotics. She also said Tesla still performs better than China’s BYD in power and range per dollar, even though BYD topped $100 billion in revenue and overtook Tesla in sales. Cathie says robo taxis will drive Tesla’s future value Cathie said her $2,600 forecast was built around the idea that Tesla would dominate the autonomous ride-hailing market, with self-driving taxis making up the bulk of its valuation by the end of the decade. She didn’t name exact rollout dates but said the autonomous taxi platform is still the core trigger for the stock’s future climb. The forecast comes even as Tesla’s actual performance in 2025 tells a different story. The stock dropped sharply this year. Even though it rebounded in the last four trading days to around $278, that’s still far below her expectations. Sales and deliveries have fallen in Europe and China, with no signs of improvement. Meanwhile, political pressure has grown around Tesla CEO Elon Musk, especially after his Department of Government Efficiency cut thousands of jobs across federal and state agencies. Cathie defended her position despite the slump, saying Tesla remains Ark’s largest holding in its flagship ARK Innovation ETF, which held 10% of its $5.8 billion in assets in Tesla as of March 24. That’s lower than the 16% allocation at the end of 2024, but still a big chunk. This shift was documented in Ark’s fund disclosures and confirmed on their website. Back in 2023, Cathie and her analysts predicted Tesla shares would rise to $2,000 by 2027, fueled by market share gains from legacy automakers. Then in July, she said the launch of an autonomous taxi network would push the price closer to $2,600, about ten times where the stock trades now. Her prediction hasn’t changed, even as the company faces slower growth and regulatory battles in multiple countries. Cathie confirms Tesla and Bitcoin are still Ark’s top buys When Bloomberg asked Cathie if she still believed Bitcoin would reach $1.5 million by 2030, she said yes. “It is our view,” Cathie said in a March 18 interview , confirming the estimate is still the same. She said the crypto market is going through a “risk-off” phase right now but added that Bitcoin has been leading risk sentiment for months. Cathie used on-chain analytics to support her view, saying Bitcoin is now halfway through a typical four-year cycle and still moving inside a bull market. She said U.S. deregulation around crypto is key, and that institutions are watching. “They have to have a point of view on this new asset class,” she said. “And by putting it in portfolios, risk-adjusted returns for the whole portfolio go up.” When asked to choose between Tesla, Bitcoin, and Nvidia for buying the dip, Cathie didn’t hesitate. “We’ve been buying Tesla and names that mimic Bitcoin,” she said. She added that Ark has also been adding positions in Coinbase and Robinhood, using what she called a “risk-off grid” strategy to scoop up what she thinks are underpriced bets in the crypto and tech sectors. She said Ark publishes its trades every day and anyone can track where they’re putting money. Right now, that’s going into Tesla, Bitcoin-exposed stocks, and a few select innovation plays. Cathie expects negative quarters and multiple rate cuts Cathie also talked about the macroeconomic picture, saying she believes the U.S. has already entered what she called a rolling recession, even though Treasury Secretary Bessant said earlier this month that the economy isn’t headed for one. “We think we’re already in it,” she said. Cathie explained that the velocity of money is collapsing because people are scared. She pointed to public workers in education and healthcare who are now worried about job security. “The labor force is nervous,” she said, and that fear is causing savings rates to climb and spending to drop. That’s dragging the economy down further. She said this slow-motion decline could open the door for President Trump’s administration and the Federal Reserve to step in with tax cuts and rate cuts. “We think this gives the Fed more degrees of freedom,” she told Bloomberg. She expects quantitative tightening to end, or at least slow down, by the second half of the year. When asked how many rate cuts she sees coming in 2025, Cathie said, “We wouldn’t be surprised to see two or three.” But she added that it could go even further if inflation drops more than expected. She brought up the trueflation index, which she said shows inflation at just 1.65%, way below the CPI’s 2.8%. She listed off key signals: food prices are falling, egg prices are crashing, gas is cheaper, and rents are starting to dip. She said all of this means the Fed might have more flexibility than the market expects. “We could see more than the number I just suggested: two to three,” she said. Cathie also blamed this drop in inflation on deflation coming from innovation, especially from Ark’s five innovation sectors. She called it “good deflation” and said it’s driving down prices while keeping growth alive. She didn’t break down all five areas, but her firm has long invested in AI, robotics, blockchain, DNA tech, and energy storage. Cathie’s rise to fame started during Covid, when she made huge calls on stocks like Tesla, Zoom, and Roku, which exploded during lockdowns. At one point in early 2021, her funds hit $60 billion in assets, driven by retail investors who tracked her every move. That number has shrunk since then, but her bold forecasts certainly have not.

Gox has once again stirred the digital asset world after initiating a significant transfer of 11,501 Bitcoin, worth over $1 billion at current market prices. This marks the third large-scale transaction the defunct exchange has conducted in less than a month, further fueling speculation that long-awaited creditor repayments may soon begin. The latest activity was flagged by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, which reported the movement on X on March 25. According to Arkham, Mt. Gox sent 893 BTC (approximately $78 million) to a cold wallet identified as “1Jbez” and another 10,608 BTC (roughly $929 million) to a so-called change wallet labeled “1DcoA.” The timing and magnitude of this transaction follow closely on the heels of two earlier significant transfers: 12,000 BTC moved on March 6, and 11,833 BTC transferred on March 11. Combined, Mt. Gox has shuffled over 35,000 Bitcoin in March alone—currently valued at around $3.1 billion. This total still aligns with Arkham Intelligence’s data, which shows that the exchange holds about that amount across its known wallets. Blockchain intelligence firm Spot On Chain also weighed in on the activity, noting that some of the Bitcoin previously transferred this month made its way to the crypto exchange Bitstamp. The firm speculated that the recent 893 BTC sent to a warm wallet could also be moved out soon, possibly toward an exchange or third-party custodian as part of administrative or preparatory steps for redistribution. These transactions come as creditors and market participants continue to monitor Mt. Gox’s wallet movements for signs that repayments are about to commence. Many of the creditors who have waited over a decade since the exchange’s collapse may be inching closer to some form of resolution. The case of Mt. Gox remains one of the most storied and pivotal moments in crypto history. In early 2014, the Tokyo-based exchange filed for bankruptcy after disclosing that it had lost a staggering 850,000 Bitcoin in a now-infamous security breach. At its peak, Mt. Gox was the dominant trading platform for Bitcoin, handling between 70% to 80% of all BTC transactions globally. Since then, a court-appointed trustee has overseen efforts to recover assets and distribute them to affected users. In recent years, several tranches of Bitcoin have been recovered and held securely as preparations for eventual reimbursement gained momentum. However, the path has been slow and riddled with complications. In October 2024, the trustee pushed the repayment deadline by a full year to Oct. 31, 2025. The stated reason was that “many creditors still have not received their repayments because they have not completed the necessary procedures for receiving repayments.” Sell or Hold? Even as Mt. Gox inches closer to disbursing funds, there is growing consensus that many of its creditors may opt to hold their Bitcoin rather than sell. A Reddit poll conducted in July 2024, shortly after the exchange’s first minor distribution, found that a significant number of creditors were not in a hurry to liquidate their assets, citing both emotional and strategic reasons. While the influx of billions in Bitcoin has raised concerns about potential market pressure and volatility, the actual impact might be muted if most creditors choose to hold their tokens. Still, the possibility of a sudden wave of sell-offs cannot be entirely dismissed. In December 2024, Mt. Gox moved over 24,000 BTC—then worth nearly $2.5 billion—to an unknown address, triggering widespread debate about its intentions. That move coincided with Bitcoin surpassing the symbolic milestone of $100,000 for the first time, adding to market jitters. Bhutan Moves $63M in Bitcoin Amid Growing National Crypto Reserve Strategy In related news, the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has once again made headlines in the cryptocurrency world after moving $63 million worth of Bitcoin across three wallets on March 24, according to blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens, which cited data from Arkham Intelligence. One of the recipient wallets now holds approximately 600 BTC, worth around $53 million at current prices, underlining the country’s increasingly strategic approach to managing its digital assets. This is just the latest move in Bhutan’s quiet but steadily growing relationship with cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, which it has been mining using its vast hydroelectric power resources since 2019. The nation has positioned itself as a unique case study in sovereign-level crypto adoption, combining natural energy assets with long-term digital investment strategies. Following the March 24 transfers, Bhutan’s primary crypto wallet — identified in 2024 as belonging to the country’s state-owned investment arm, Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) — now holds nearly $889.9 million in Bitcoin. This staggering amount represents approximately 30.7% of Bhutan’s total gross domestic product (GDP), which the World Bank estimated at $2.9 billion in 2023. The implication is profound: Bhutan now has one of the highest ratios of sovereign Bitcoin holdings relative to GDP globally, rivaling early adopters like El Salvador. Although Bitcoin forms the core of Bhutan’s crypto strategy, it is not the only digital asset held. Arkham Intelligence data also shows that the DHI wallet includes smaller allocations of other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether (ETH) worth around $334,580, and trace amounts of LinqAI (LNQ), Phil (PHIL), and Apu Apustaja (APU), among others. This diversification, though marginal compared to its Bitcoin stake, indicates a broader awareness of the evolving digital asset landscape. The $63 million transaction follows a similar high-profile transfer in October 2024, when Bhutan moved $66 million worth of BTC to Binance — presumably for strategic reallocation or offloading during a bull market that saw Bitcoin reach historic highs. Over the past two months, Bhutan’s government has been incrementally transferring smaller amounts of Bitcoin and Ether from its main wallet to other addresses. While the purposes of these transactions remain undisclosed, they may be part of a broader liquidity strategy, ongoing investment reshuffling, or preparations for further infrastructure development in the crypto mining or fintech sectors. Such methodical activity suggests that Bhutan’s engagement with cryptocurrency is far from speculative — it is tactical, measured, and government-backed. Bhutan’s national embrace of crypto is mirrored at the city level. In January 2025, the Gelephu Special Administrative Region (SAR) confirmed that it would integrate digital assets into its official strategic reserves. Bitcoin in Global Reserve Trends Bhutan is far from alone in leveraging Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Other nations, notably El Salvador and the United States, have significantly expanded their crypto reserves during the ongoing 2024–2025 bull market. El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, saw the value of its Bitcoin holdings surge to over $100 million by late 2024. Meanwhile, the US government, primarily through law enforcement asset seizures, now holds more than $17 billion in Bitcoin. The movement has also trickled down to the state level, particularly in the United States. Texas has passed a Bitcoin reserve bill that awaits the governor’s signature, and other states like Arizona are making legislative progress on similar proposals. However, not all have embraced the trend — some states have rejected such bills due to concerns about volatility, regulation, and central banking conflicts. As countries and regions increasingly explore the utility of cryptocurrency as part of their strategic reserves, Bhutan’s model offers an intriguing template — especially for small nations rich in renewable energy and seeking alternative economic development paths. By tapping into its hydroelectric surplus and converting it into one of the world’s most valuable digital assets, Bhutan is quietly transforming its economic foundation and signaling to the global community that crypto can serve more than just speculative ends. It can be a pillar of a modern digital economy — sovereign, sustainable, and scalable.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ARKM|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-25 05:30:00

Dogecoin Price Only Up 2.6% This Past Week But Remittix Hits 400% For The Year,https://timestabloid.com/stop-wasting-your-time-and-money-dogecoin-price-only-up-2-6/,"Remittix (RTX) is a brand new 2025 cryptocurrency that has attracted fierce interest from investors with its innovative model for international payments. Using the assistance of an advanced PayFi protocol, the Ethereum token makes it possible for users to seamlessly exchange digital assets into local currencies and send them to any bank account. The project has already raised over $14 million in its presale stage, where the Remittix Token is available for sale at $0.0734 and 521 million tokens are available for purchase, an indicator of robust demand from early investors. Lightchain AI Vision for Growth Lightchain AI is creating a decentralized AI infrastructure to address the vulnerabilities of centralized computing. The platform utilizes blockchain technology to distribute AI workloads across a network of nodes to reduce the risk of single points of failure. With its Proof of Intelligence consensus algorithm, Lightchain AI incentivizes nodes to perform valuable computations in machine learning and data analytics. The approach represents an AI-driven marketplace where users and businesses can draw on a decentralized pool of resources for complex computing jobs. Apart from its indigenous protocols, Lightchain AI has a well-laid roadmap of expansions in health data analysis, logistics, and financial modeling. By solving real-world issues, it is a new project with real utility that it can provide. When the whole crypto space is in ruins, the fundamentals of Lightchain AI, including strong investor confidence, position it as a candidate for gigantic growth. According to analysts, its fully built ecosystem can make a 10x jump until mid-2025, the worth of AI-blockchain confluence. Market Uncertainty and Potential Outliers Recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market—dramatized by a 22% drop in global market capitalization in early March—has seen investors become more risk-averse. High-profile security breaches and macroeconomic concerns are likewise among the causes of dismal market sentiment. Projects like Lightchain AI, however, which combine real-world utility with nascent technology, have the ability to win over institutional investors in search of real assets . A clear roadmap and scheduled future developments into big data service can enable the platform to overcome less niche tokens, and thus be a source of growth in the context of market volatility. While Lightchain AI has been focused on AI-fueled solutions, Remittix has been focused on cross-border payment niches. Using on-chain liquidity pools alongside fiat rails, Remittix facilitates faster international remittances with lowered costs and end-user transaction time. Down-to-earth, utility-focused projects like this succeed when the aggregate market momentum weakens because they service actual use cases better than speculation and/or hype-driven trading. With such qualities combined with snug support during its infancy, Remittix has already recorded a 400% annual price increase and can simply continue outpacing meme-like cryptocurrencies. Remittix: Pioneering Cross-Border Transactions Remittix’s presale success indicates the trust of the market in its PayFi system. With its inbuilt support for fiat banking networks, the platform is successfully bridging crypto and mainstream finance. It allows users to pay any bank account globally by converting crypto to fiat, cutting out several intermediaries. PayFi protocol lowers remittance fees, with transactions that are nearly real-time. It is most beneficial to migrant workers remitting money to their families, and to businesses remitting money to overseas suppliers. Practical real-world usage also justifies Remittix. To illustrate, a Philippine on-contract programmer can be remunerated in stablecoins and can exchange it to local currency directly through Remittix’s system, remitting to a local bank. A Vietnamese manufacturing firm can also remunerate overseas suppliers in ETH or DOGE, converting it to USD or EUR with ease. That kind of blending of ease and affordability is what makes the token attractive to mass application. Projections suggest that the RTX token can expand exponentially as soon as it lists on large exchanges. If the PayFi network is scaled appropriately—more integration with other remittance channels. Remittix can compete with or even surpass traditional choices like Western Union or MoneyGram. Its union of real-world practicality and crypto innovation is a compelling argument for long-term appreciation well into 2025 and beyond. Conclusion: Embracing Innovative Solutions As the crypto space grapples with volatility, innovative projects like Lightchain AI and Remittix demonstrate that solid fundamentals and practical uses can thrive amidst uncertainty. Lightchain AI’s AI decentralized platform is targeting a potentially gigantic market in data-driven industries, and Remittix is solving urgent demand for simple-to-use cross-border payments. Both projects show how technological innovation and practical applications of use instill confidence among institutional and retail investors. Do not miss the chance to invest in these new technologies. If you are keen to be part of the intersection between blockchain and AI or want to benefit from next-generation payment technologies, review projects such as Remittix and Lightchain AI to diversify your cryptocurrency investment portfolio.

However, altcoins like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have outperformed Bitcoin’s surge in the 24-hour time frame, being the top gainers in the ten largest cryptocurrencies list. Bitcoin And Top Altcoins Experience Significant Gains Scheduled for announcement on April 2, President Donald Trump had previously indicated that he would impose both reciprocal and sector-specific tariffs on countries including Canada, China, and Mexico. However, anonymous sources within the White House, as reported by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have suggested that the president may opt for a narrower approach, focusing solely on reciprocal tariffs. According to the reports, this shift in strategy appears to signal a tempering of the administration’s approach to a “potential trade war”, which has historically led to increased volatility in both the cryptocurrency and equity markets. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Suffer April Flash Crash, Analyst Shows How Low It Could Go Dan Greer, CEO of Defi App, a decentralized finance platform, noted the correlation between Bitcoin’s recent price increase and the news of the tariff adjustments. “This surge in Bitcoin’s price coincides with reports that the Trump administration is considering narrowing the scope of tariffs set to take effect on April 2,” he stated. The positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin has extended to the broader cryptocurrency market, with nearly all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization experiencing gains on Monday. Ethereum rose by 4%, XRP by 2%, Solana, DOGE and Cardano led the pack with increases of 8%, 7.8% and 4.5% respectively. The stock market reflected this optimism, with both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices rising 2% over the past 24 hours. Expert Insights On BTC’s Recent Fluctuations Greer highlighted that this development has alleviated some market uncertainties, leading to increased investor confidence across both cryptocurrency and equity markets. The crypto sector, which has faced mixed reactions since Trump took office, has been grappling with the implications of his fluctuating tariff policies. These policies have introduced a considerable degree of economic uncertainty, prompting many investors to retreat from riskier assets. Related Reading: Analyst Sets Dogecoin Next Target As Ascending Triangle Forms The anticipated tariffs—expected to raise the prices of foreign goods—could lead to inflation, further complicating the economic landscape. Bitcoin, which reached an all-time high of $109,000 in January, has seen a decline, dropping to $78,000 earlier this month amid fears that aggressive economic policies could trigger a recession. Colin Closser, investor relations manager at crypto wallet company Exodus, expressed his understanding of the crypto market’s reaction to Trump’s policies. “I expect markets to show emotion and volatility during times of change and stress in the United States, and you can see that volatility in Bitcoin this morning,” he remarked. Since the spike, Bitcoin has seen a bit of a pullback towards the $86,930 level, with the most notable support floor between $83,000 and $84,000.

Pi continues to struggle, down more than 65% from its earlier peak of $3 this year. The growing supply pressure is one of the main causes of this decline. According to data from Pi Scan, nearly 99.3 million Pi ( PI ) tokens, worth approximately $91 million at Mar. 25 prices, are scheduled to be unlocked over the following 30 days. An average of 3 million tokens will be unlocked every day over this period. On Apr. 3, the biggest single-day unlock will take place, bringing 6.8 million tokens into circulation. With a total of 115.57 million in April, 182 million in May, and 222 million in June, even bigger unlocks are anticipated in the future. More selling pressure might result from this. Uncertainty surrounding exchange listings has also negatively impacted investor sentiment. Many people were hoping for a Binance listing , but they are becoming increasingly frustrated as there has been no confirmation. Concerns regarding centralization are also growing. In contrast to most blockchains where nodes are run independently, the Pi Core Team is in charge of Pi’s SuperNodes. Although there are now 42 of these nodes instead of just three at launch, Pi Network has not made it clear how these nodes were chosen. You might also like: 4 reasons Pi Network price crashed after mainnet launch Burning tokens, according to some, might aid in price stabilization . On a Mar. 24 post on X, cryptocurrency analyst Dr. Altcoin recommended reducing the supply by 60–100 million Pi coins to balance the market. Although Pi Network recently burned 10 million tokens, reducing the total number in circulation to 6.77 billion, the price has not benefited significantly from this burn. The CEXs have been flooded with unlocked Pi coins, and the PTC will need to burn another 60 to 100 million coins from the circulating supply in the coming days in order to bring Pi back to $1. I am now more confident that Pi is going to return to $1 soon. DYOR! pic.twitter.com/PooqZX8SsY — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) March 24, 2025 On the technical side, PI is trading at $0.9253 and showing a weak trend. Support is at $0.70, and the price is having trouble holding above $1.00, which is serving as the immediate resistance. Pi Network technical analysis. Credit: crypto.news With PI close to the lower band, the Bollinger Bands indicate that sellers are in control of the price swings. Though it hasn’t yet reached oversold levels, the relative strength index at 43.27 indicates a bearish trend. Important moving averages (10, 20, 30 periods) indicate selling pressure, and the moving average convergence divergence is likewise bearish. PI may drop to the $0.70 region if it fas below $0.85. With $1.34 as the next target, a break above $1.00 could shift the momentum. For now, PI remains weak unless buyers push it higher.

Bitcoin futures remain strong and signal confidence in its long-term trajectory. However, Ethereum futures have shown increased volatility, reflecting uncertainty ahead of the network’s upgrades. Meanwhile, Solana’s futures market has experienced a surge in open interest, driven by growing institutional and retail demand for the high-performance blockchain. As these futures markets diverge, a new player like BinoFi could introduce fresh liquidity dynamics and reshape this competitive landscape with its hybrid exchange model and institutional-grade trading infrastructure. Bitcoin Futures Hold Strong as Institutional Demand Grows Bitcoin futures have demonstrated remarkable resilience amid recent market fluctuations, signalling strong institutional confidence in the asset. Open interest in BTC futures has surged across significant exchanges, reflecting a steady influx of capital from professional traders and institutional investors. This rising demand highlights Bitcoin’s growing role in diversified investment portfolios, with many institutions hedging their positions against macroeconomic uncertainties. The increased participation also underscores Bitcoin’s maturity as an asset class, with sophisticated trading strategies now shaping market movements. A key factor driving this institutional interest is Bitcoin’s emerging status as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. With traditional financial markets experiencing volatility, many large investors see Bitcoin as a viable alternative to traditional assets. The recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs has further amplified institutional adoption, making it easier for hedge funds, asset managers, and pension funds to gain exposure to BTC. As institutional demand strengthens, Bitcoin futures are expected to remain a crucial pillar of the crypto market, influencing price action and liquidity across the ecosystem. BinoFi’s Institutional-Grade Trading Infrastructure: Bridging CeFi and DeFi BinoFi is setting a new standard for institutional trading by merging the best features of centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Its hybrid exchange model gives institutions the security, transparency, and efficiency they need to navigate the evolving crypto landscape. BinoFi ensures that professional traders and institutional investors can access a seamless, trustless trading environment through its non-custodial security framework, AI-enhanced trading capabilities, and regulatory compliance measures. At the core of BinoFi’s security infrastructure are Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets, which eliminate the need for traditional private keys. By splitting cryptographic key components across multiple parties, these wallets enable secure transaction signing without exposing sensitive credentials to potential hacks or insider threats. This non-custodial approach ensures that users retain complete control of their funds while benefiting from institutional-grade security, making BinoFi a compelling alternative to centralized exchanges that require custodial asset management. Beyond security, BinoFi leverages AI-enhanced trading and smart order routing to optimize trade execution. Its AI-powered algorithms analyze market trends, liquidity pools, and price movements in real-time, allowing for automated algorithmic trading and bot-driven strategies. This level of automation reduces slippage, improves price efficiency, and enhances liquidity aggregation across CeFi and DeFi platforms. Institutional investors can execute trades faster and more efficiently, capitalizing on price discrepancies across different liquidity sources. Another major differentiator for BinoFi is its commitment to on-chain transparency and regulatory compliance. Unlike many hybrid exchanges, BinoFi implements real-time proof-of-reserves, allowing users and auditors to verify its asset holdings on the blockchain at any moment. This ensures full solvency and financial integrity, addressing concerns about exchange mismanagement and liquidity crises. Additionally, BinoFi integrates Zero-Knowledge (ZK) KYC compliance, enabling institutions to meet regulatory requirements while preserving user privacy. With ZK-proof technology, traders can verify their identity without exposing sensitive personal data, reducing compliance friction without compromising security. By integrating these cutting-edge features, BinoFi is redefining what it means to be a hybrid exchange. Its institutional-grade trading infrastructure provides the security of MPC wallets, the intelligence of AI-driven trading, and the transparency of real-time proof-of-reserves. As institutions demand more robust solutions in the crypto space, BinoFi stands at the forefront, offering a CeFi-DeFi bridge that combines efficiency, security, and compliance in one seamless platform. BinoFi is currently holding its presale to attract early investors, to date more than 20 million BINO tokens have been sold at a price 0f $0.02 per token.

The exchange’s crypto wallet business, Binance Wallet, launched an investigation on March 23 after it “received a complaint alleging that one of our staff members engaged in front-running trades using insider information to gain improper profits,” it said in a March 25 X post. It claimed a preliminary investigation found a Binance Wallet staffer who joined the team last month was suspected of using information from a former position in a business development role at BNB Chain to “front-run” trades of a project token. “The employee was aware the project was planning a Token Generation Event (TGE) and anticipated it would generate significant community interest,” Binance Wallet wrote. It claimed the staffer “used multiple linked wallet addresses to purchase a large volume of the project’s tokens” before it publicly announced the token launch and then, after the announcement, “quickly sold part of his holdings to realize significant profits.” Binance Wallet accused the staff member of front-running trades based on non-public information gained from a previous role in breach of company policy. It added the staff member was “suspended immediately and pending further disciplinary action,” and the company would cooperate with authorities in the relevant jurisdiction to take legal action. The company did not name the staff member but noted the allegations circulating on X prompted the investigation. Earlier this week, multiple X users pointed to a former operations manager at BNB Chain — Freddie Ng — whose LinkedIn shows he joined Binance Wallet’s business development team last month. As noted by X user “py,” one of the wallets that DEX Screener shows has profited $82,400 from the token in question, U DEX Platform (UUU), is a wallet that received UUU tokens from another wallet initially funded by the address “freddieng.bnb” — which Ng had shared on his X account. A wallet allegedly linked to a Binance staffer sold holdings of a token just minutes after it debuted on March 23 and hit a peak value of $31.5 million. Source: DEX Screener Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ng was contacted for comment. Related: BNB Chain launches $100M liquidity program Binance Wallet said it appreciated the public efforts, but it would only reward those who submitted reports to a whistleblowing email “to protect whistleblowers’ interests.” It said it would hand out $100,000 equally distributed among four anonymous whistleblowers who emailed the exchange.

While ETH and XRP remain key assets in long-term portfolios, they’re less attractive to those prioritizing short-term growth. This has led to growing interest in early-stage projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which combines utility, accessibility, and a promising price entry point. Ethereum & Ripple Ethereum has recently seen renewed whale interest despite market uncertainty. Large-scale buyers continue accumulating ETH during price dips, indicating confidence in the asset’s long-term outlook. Meanwhile, XRP remains a major player in crypto, with analysts pointing toward a possible rebound following the end of its legal challenges. Both assets are stable and established—but that stability comes at the cost of limited percentage gains in the near term. This shift in strategy has pushed a portion of investors toward smaller, under-the-radar projects. Mutuum Finance is one such project now making noise across the space. Rather than focusing solely on speculative hype, the platform is positioning itself as a fully functional decentralized lending protocol, designed to give users more control over their capital while creating opportunities for sustainable income. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The platform allows users to supply assets to liquidity pools and earn interest, or borrow against collateral without needing to sell their holdings. It operates using both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. P2C enables users to earn automatically through shared pools, while P2P allows lenders and borrowers to agree on custom terms for less conventional tokens like PEPE or DOGE. A core part of Mutuum’s ecosystem is its mtToken model. When someone supplies an asset like ETH or USDC, they receive mtTokens in return, which represent their share in the pool. These tokens grow in value as borrowing activity increases. For example, depositing $2,500 worth of USDC will start generating yield, with rates adjusting dynamically based on borrower demand. Currently, the MUTM token is priced at $0.02 during its third presale phase. The token has already attracted over 6,600 holders and raised more than $4.69 million. With nearly 70% of this round completed, the next price increase to $0.025 is approaching quickly—prompting many early investors to secure their positions before the jump. Projections for the token’s launch have generated optimism, with analysts estimating a target of $1.20 in the months following release. That would mark a 5,900% increase from today’s price. For context, someone investing $1,200 now would receive 60,000 MUTM tokens. When the price reaches $1.20, their investment could grow to $72,000—highlighting the token’s potential for meaningful returns. The platform isn’t just relying on future expectations. A beta version of Mutuum’s app is set to launch alongside the token, ensuring utility from day one. Additionally, the protocol includes a buy-and-distribute system that uses a share of revenue to purchase MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to mtToken holders, creating constant buy pressure and incentivizing long-term participation. Another standout feature is the overcollateralized stablecoin currently in development. Users will be able to mint this stablecoin by locking excess collateral inside Mutuum’s protocol, accessing liquidity without having to sell their assets. This model mirrors some of the most successful DeFi tools while keeping user ownership intact. In a market where ETH and XRP continue to consolidate, MUTM presents a rare opportunity for growth-focused investors. Its combination of working products, passive income potential, and low barrier to entry makes it a serious contender for those looking to diversify into a new era of DeFi.

As blockchain adoption grows, Polkadot remains a key player, enabling cross-chain connectivity and scalability. With its robust technology and growing developer activity, Polkadot is well-positioned for long-term success in the crypto world.

This move follows other ventures like the TRUMP meme coin and the launch of the USD1 stablecoin by Trump-backed World Liberty Financial. However, these Trump ventures already attracted a lot of political scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest. Meanwhile, Kraken is preparing for a potential IPO by 2026, exploring a major fundraise and expanding its services through acquisitions and the relaunch of crypto staking. Trump Expands Crypto Presence with New ETF Agreement Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social and fintech platform Truth.Fi, signed a non-binding agreement with Crypto.com to launch a new line of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. According to a March 24 statement , the initiative is still subject to regulatory approval but is yet another major step in the growing overlap between cryptocurrency and Donald Trump's business ventures. The planned ETFs will be developed through Foris Capital US LLC, which is the broker-dealer arm of Crypto.com. They aim to feature digital assets and securities with a strong “Made in America” theme. The crypto components of the ETF could include a basket of tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Crypto.com’s native token Cronos (CRO). Crypto.com will provide both the infrastructure and custody services for the initiative. Once launched, the ETFs are expected to be accessible internationally, including across the US, Europe, and Asia via established brokerage platforms. They will also be integrated into the Crypto.com App, giving access to over 140 million users globally. In parallel, Truth.Fi plans to offer Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs), which TMTG will reportedly fund using its existing cash reserves. This ETF project is yet another crypto-related venture tied to Donald Trump. The US president’s growing crypto footprint already stirred some political controversy. Democratic lawmakers raised their concerns over potential conflicts of interest stemming from Trump’s dual roles in politics and business. In particular, scrutiny increased over his connection to World Liberty Financial, which is a crypto platform owned by the Trump Organization, and the launch of the TRUMP meme coin. TRUMP went live just three days before his inauguration. Representative Gerald Connolly labeled the meme coin a “money grab,” and alleged that Trump-affiliated entities benefited from more than $100 million in trading fees. Similarly, Representative Maxine Waters denounced the token as a “rug pull,” and criticized it for embodying the worst aspects of the crypto industry. Trump’s Crypto Firm Rolls Out Stablecoin Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial also recently launched a US dollar-pegged stablecoin called World Liberty Financial USD (USD1), with an initial supply of more than $3.5 million. The token was deployed on both the BNB Chain and Ethereum in early March, according to data from Etherscan and BscScan. Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao confirmed the deployment, though the project stated that the stablecoin is not currently available for trading. The timing of the launch aligns with ongoing discussions in Congress around stablecoin regulation. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act cleared the Senate Banking Committee on March 13 and is expected to reach the Senate floor for a full vote very soon. Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, projected that the bill could be signed by President Trump by June. Since its debut in September of 2024, World Liberty Financial operated with limited public transparency. Its website reveals that Trump and several family members collectively control 60% of the company’s equity. As of mid-March, the firm has conducted two public token sales that raised a combined total of $550 million. The launch of USD1 also coincides with reports that the Trump family held talks with Binance about potentially acquiring a stake in the exchange and issuing a presidential pardon for CZ, though Zhao denied that any deal or pardon arrangement exists. World Liberty also faced criticism over potential conflicts of interest. Even before its first public token sale in October of 2024, the company came under scrutiny from US lawmakers that were concerned about Trump’s dual role as a political figure and crypto entrepreneur. Shortly after Trump’s election victory, Tron founder Justin Sun announced a $30 million investment in World Liberty, which likely led to his appointment as an adviser to the firm. After Trump’s inauguration and the appointment of SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair, the SEC requested a pause in its enforcement case against Sun to explore a potential resolution. Sun and several of his companies were accused of selling unregistered securities. Meanwhile, other well known crypto executives who supported Trump and the Republican Party during the 2024 elections also had their legal challenges with the SEC dropped since Uyeda took charge. The stablecoin arrived during a broader expansion of the digital dollar market. Data from Artemis and Dune showed a more than 50% increase in active stablecoin wallets from February 2024 to February 2025. The market cap of all stablecoins surpassed $200 billion in January as well, with Tether and USDC still being the two leading assets in the space. Kraken Eyes IPO with Major Fundraise It is not only Trump-linked businesses that are currently making strides in the crypto space. Kraken, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, is reportedly exploring a big capital raise ahead of a potential initial public offering (IPO) targeted for early 2026. According to Bloomberg , Kraken is in early-stage discussions with major financial institutions including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to arrange a debt package worth between $200 million and $1 billion. The funds raised will support the company’s growth initiatives rather than operational costs. Bloomberg has been covering Kraken’s IPO ambitions for the past year, and reports suggest that plans to go public have gained more momentum since the election of US President Donald Trump, whose administration is seen as more crypto-friendly. Kraken's position in the crypto sector is growing, having processed more than $1.1 billion in trading volume over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap . The exchange also experienced some impressive growth in 2024 , with revenue reaching $1.5 billion. This was a 128% increase from 2023. Its adjusted earnings totaled $380 million for the year. (Source: Kraken ) Additionally, Kraken acquired NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion. NinjaTrader is a futures brokerage that was founded in 2003 and registered with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It will likely boost Kraken’s presence in the derivatives market. The acquisition also aligns with Kraken’s broader strategy to expand into multi-asset services, including equities and payment solutions. Kraken, like several other exchanges, was recently relieved from enforcement actions by the SEC. This more favorable environment likely influenced Kraken’s decision to relaunch its crypto staking services in the United States after nearly two years. The exchange now offers staking options for 17 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and Solana.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-25 05:49:46

According to an official tweet post by Binance, the employee used confidential information from their previous role at BNB Chain to purchase tokens before a public announcement. Shortly after the launch, they sold a portion of the tokens, securing significant profits. Binance Employee Tied Of Insider Trading The allegations surfaced when Binance received complaints on March 23, prompting an internal investigation. The findings revealed that the employee had used multiple wallet addresses to buy tokens before any official Token Generation Event (TGE) was announced.

Although Binance has not disclosed the employee’s name, it confirmed that they have been suspended immediately. The exchange also stated that it is working with legal authorities to ensure necessary actions are taken. As part of its efforts to maintain integrity, Binance rewarded four whistleblowers with $100,000 for reporting the misconduct through its official channel. Suspected Wallet Linked to $200k In Profit In a separate tweet post, Wu Blockchain reported that a suspected Binance employee, allegedly linked to a wallet under the name Freddie Ng, made a profit of $113,000 by trading UUU tokens on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The wallet, which initially spent $6,227 to buy 24.1 million UUU tokens, later sold 6.02 million tokens, generating substantial returns. The remaining 18.09 million tokens, valued at around $200,000, are still distributed across nine different wallet addresses. Binance’s Strict Action Against Misconduct Binance has ensured its commitment to maintaining transparency and fairness in crypto trading. The company noted that it will fully cooperate with authorities and take legal measures against those found guilty of insider trading. This isn’t the first time a major exchange has faced such an issue. Last year, a former Coinbase manager admitted to leaking confidential token-listing information for personal gain.

Gox transferred 11,501.4 Bitcoin (approximately $1 billion) on March 25. The analytic firm noted that the exchange had sent 893 BTC to its cold wallet (1Jbez) and another 10,608 BTC to another wallet (1DcoA). The bankrupt crypto exchange also transferred a total of 12,000 BTC worth over $1 billion on March 6 and another 11,833 Bitcoin on March 11. On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence showed that the exchange still holds around 35,000 BTC worth $3.1 billion across wallets it controls. Mt.

The analytic firm alerted the community that the Japanese exchange had sent 893 BTC worth around $78 million at current prices to the Mt. Gox cold wallet (1Jbez). The firm also noted that the exchange transferred another 10,608 Bitcoin, worth around $929 million, to the Mt. Gox change wallet (1DcoA). Source: Arkham Intelligence. Mt. Gox transfers 11,501.4 Bitcoin to its wallets. Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain revealed that one of the previous transfers this month ended up in the crypto exchange Bitstamp. The analytic firm also speculated that the 893.4 Bitcoin “sent to the warm wallet will be moved out shortly too.” The analytic firm showed that the Mt. Gox wallet (1PuQB) had moved a total of 12,000 Bitcoin worth over $1 billion on March 6. Arkham also noted that the exchange had sent $15 million of those funds to BitGo, which was one of the custodians facilitating Mt. Gox’s creditor repayments. The company had also sent 166.5 BTC worth around $15 million to Mt.Gox cold wallet, while the remainder of the assets were moved to an unidentified wallet (1Mo1n). The defunct exchange transferred another 11,833 BTC on March 11, worth over $930 million. The firm had also moved 11,501 BTC worth around $905.1 million into a new wallet, while the remaining 332 BTC ($26.1 million) were transferred to a warm wallet. Spot On Chain analytic firm revealed that the 332 digital assets may also be moved to assist with the repayments. Spot On Chain data also showed that the exchange started offloading around $9.2 billion worth of BTC in June 2024. The crypto company fell into bankruptcy in early 2024, and on-chain data indicated that some past movements of its BTC holdings were followed by creditor payouts, which began in 2024. Mt. Gox moves BTC for creditor compensation Mt. Gox was declared bankrupt in early 2014 after it suffered an 850,000 BTC loss in one of the biggest crypto hacks ever recorded. The firm was considered the largest Bitcoin exchange before the security breach, handling around 70-80% of trades. After the exchange collapsed in February 2014, a Tokyo court appointed a trustee to manage the bankruptcy proceedings and compensate creditors with the exchange’s assets. The exchange’s trustee in charge of its stash pushed the deadline for creditor repayments by a full year to October 31, 2025. The trustee also argued that many creditors “still have not received their repayments because they have not completed the necessary procedures for receiving repayments.” The firm also said that creditors had the option to receive their payouts in Bitcoin. A Reddit poll conducted on Mt. Gox Insolvency subreddit in July 2024 following the exchange’s first payout discovered that creditors were not rushing to sell their digital asset payouts. Mt. Gox Insolvency is the sub for the digital asset investors affected by the 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox. The firm also acknowledged that Mt. Gox Insolvency was participating in the official Mt. Gox insolvency process in Tokyo through the Japanese court system. The poll indicated that approximately 260 Mt. Gox creditors, representing 56% of the 467 poll participants, planned to hold onto their virtual assets after receiving their payouts. The defunct crypto exchange also moved over 24,000 BTC worth nearly $2.4 billion to an unknown address last December after the virtual asset hit a milestone of $100,000. Less than two weeks later, the firm also moved around 1,620 BTC through another series of unknown wallets. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

As Musk-ian technocracy takes hold of governments worldwide with financial surveillance, the real threat could stem from digital assets and stablecoin favorites like XRP, USDT, and USDC. Gold expert and former politician Tony Arterburn says that the “PayPal mafia and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk … are technocrats, and they certainly believe in a digitized currency system and more centralized systems in general.” In a recent interview on The Free Thought Project Podcast, the U.S. Army veteran and precious metals specialist said he doesn’t want to rain on people’s parade, but “you may not have something called CBDC, but it may be on the backs of stable coins or something else.” Musk’s ties to technocracy and social credit, Trump’s false promises Investopedia defines “ technocracy ” as a model of governance where “individuals selected to a leadership role are chosen through a process that emphasizes their relevant skills … as opposed to whether or not they fit the majority interests of a popular vote.” Of course, it’s clear that such a system would create problems and encourage elitist favoritism in governing the rest of the world by force, regardless of people’s actual skills or intentions. But that seems to be exactly where Musk and Trump are steering things. See the recent open promotion by the president of Tesla cars, for example. Elon Musk is the maternal grandson of former Canadian Social Credit Party and Technocratic politician Joshua N. Haldeman. This really should not be surprising given Trump’s love of bowing down to globalist agendas such as the violent clearing out of Gaza with bombs to create new real estate for his Israeli pals or Musk’s family lineage , which ties him directly to Joshua N. Haldeman (his maternal grandfather) who backed Canada’s Technocracy movement and was a leader of the Social Credit Party in the same country, before emigrating to South Africa. While Donald Trump’s executive order banning CBDCs in America was indeed well received by his supporters, the actual text of the document reveals some disturbing things for true believers in crypto and permissionless, peer-to-peer transactions. The document , titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” promises to bolster USD dominance “through actions to promote the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide.” Donald Trump posted about a “crypto reserve” on his social media platform Truth Social on March 3. As Arterburn states on the podcast: “I was there in Nashville at the Bitcoin conference when Trump spoke. So, this is something that’s been going on for a while. But they also mentioned other coins, and I thought, that’s it … They even mentioned Cardano, XRP, Ethereum, and other things, and I go, what’s interesting?” The gold expert noted that, unlike bitcoin, some of the aforementioned assets “have functions, but they’re with a company. They all track back to a board of directors or venture capital. You can see who they are.” In effect, Trump’s U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile features assets created by private companies, with the private financial giants thus possibly becoming state institutions by default, in a kind of modern, techno-fascism. The boards of directors, like Musk, would be unelected rulers. Self-appointed rulers creating mockeries like “D.O.G.E” and controlling people’s money without their consent, shaping political policy. Zooming out to a global view, this is already happening. Adoption of XRP, stablecoins soars, CBDC nightmare inches closer On the morning of March 25, Genki Oda, Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) representative director and SBI bigwig, posted a picture taken at Kanda Shrine in Tokyo to Musk’s social media platform, X. “I came to Kanda Shrine to pray with Jeremy and the Circle team for the success of our joint venture,” he noted (translated) in the caption. The Jeremy he is referring to is Jeremy Allaire of Circle. The new venture refers to the Japanese government’s approval of the USDC stablecoin and its official launch on the SBI VC Trade platform. Recent reports show that the adoption of stablecoins as a whole has been on a marked rise over the last year. When it comes to Tether, the leading U.S.-dollar-pegged stablecoin by market cap ($143.7B), many governments globally seem to champion its use, though it has faced some regulatory hurdles. In open service of government agencies, the company behind USDT actively censors, addresses, and freezes the assets of users in compliance with legal enforcers like the U.S. Department of Justice. For example, Cryptopolitan reported on March 6 that Tether froze $27 million in USDT on the Russian crypto exchange Garantex. This is right in line with how a CBDC would operate, becoming unusable once an account or address has been marked as “illegal” or non-compliant. As BIS (Bank of International Settlements) General Manager Augustín Carstens has said : “We don’t know who’s using a $100 bill today and we don’t know who’s using a 1,000 peso bill today. The key difference with the CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of central bank liability, and also we will have the technology to enforce that.” While some may see this as a good thing for law and order, those who see clearly know that the whole value proposition of Bitcoin and crypto was to take control of money out of the hands of sociopathic and violent state actors and to let peaceful, voluntary transactions and social order prevail. This is in direct opposition to Musk — who has received billions from the state for his ventures — and his overtures to a “ Novus Ordo Seclorum ,” or “new order of the ages” / “new world order.” Circling back to Japan, where WEF-friend Oda and Allaire are praying to Shintō gods for success, the technocratic surveillance is only increasing. In fact, one Nikkei Fintech journalist says Japan may have a CBDC by 2030 , following Europe’s lead. XRP supporters are hoping their favorite asset will be chosen for the role. Yoshitaka Kitao, massive Trump and Musk supporter and CEO of SBI Holdings in Japan, has previously noted that “We are the largest external shareholder of Ripple Labs, a US company that develops a next-generation remittance system using blockchain technology.” Arterburn warns lovers of freedom and sound money must be vigilant: “The establishment, the controllers, they want a CBDC. Davos wants a CBDC. World Economic Forum, the UN, they want Central Bank digital currency, the Bank of International Settlements. They all want CBDC. And that’s why none of that’s off the table. It just may come in a different form.”",OP-ED|CBDC|USDC|USDT|XRP,EN,0,0,FIAT|XRP|USDT|ASIA|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-25 06:12:15

Trump’s World Liberty Financial Sells 184K ENA Sparking Concerns,https://coingape.com/is-ethena-price-at-risk-trumps-world-liberty-financial-sells-184k-ena-sparking-concerns/,"Despite Ethena price extending weekly gains to over 7% this Tuesday, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial has rattled the crypto market with its ENA selloff spree. On-chain statistics indicated that Trump’s World Liberty sold a whopping 184,000 tokens intraday, reverberating a bearish sentiment among crypto traders and investors globally. In the wake of massive token unlocks and a dump by a market maker previously, the synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum already remains subject to volatility. Now, market watchers bearishly speculate over the asset’s future trajectory due to rising selling pressure. Is Ethena Price Bracing For Heat Amid Trump’s World Liberty’s Selloff? Usual market sentiments remain highly negative in light of heightened selling pressure on cryptocurrencies. The latest data from Arkham Intelligence indicated that World Liberty Financial sold 184,000 ENA for $69K over the past day. This selloff chronicle sparked concerns over Ethena price action’s long-term prospects, underlining a spike in selling pressure and WLFI’s loss of interest in the asset amid broader trends. Notably, the Trump family-backed firm purchased 11 tokens earlier, including the one mentioned above, via its WLFI sale funds. Intriguingly, since most of these assets were soon shifted to Coinbase Prime, the market had an unclear view of selloff transactions. However, a part of ENA holdings was transferred to the ‘0x76a’ custodial wallet address. This wallet address shifted 180,000 tokens to the address ‘0x77a.’ Subsequently, this address then sold the amount received for WBTC, per the data. Overall, this transactional process gained significant traction, whilst market watchers speculate whether further token selloffs are also incoming. The synthetic dollar protocol on Ethereum remains bearishly eyed by investors, attributed to this saga. Factors Fueling More Heat For Ethena Price Simultaneously, a couple of other aspects propel an unsure investor sentiment about future price movements. CoinGape reported that the market maker Amber Group recently offloaded $10 million ENA to Binance . The rising exchange supply solidified bearish market sentiments over the asset’s future potential. On the other hand, recent ENA token unlocks have also ushered in price volatility. While March saw over 2 billion coins unlocked and added to the crypto’s supply, April comes as another hurdle. Reportedly, over 200 million coins are set to unlock on April 2 and 5 collectively. In turn, traders and investors remain cautious over future Ethena price movements. It’s noteworthy that World Liberty Financial’s massive selloff potentially aligns with the past and looming unlocks in an effort to mitigate losses. What’s Next? As of press time, ENA price witnessed a nearly 1% jump in value, reaching $0.3989. The crypto hit a low and a peak of $0.3883 and $0.4098 intraday. Despite the selloffs and massive token unlocks, the weekly chart showed a 7% upswing, underling a resilient movement. However, the monthly chart showed a 10% slump, adding to speculations. Crypto market traders are currently uncertain about the asset’s performance ahead as broader trends indicate that volatility looms, whilst the price chart shows resilience. Besides, Ethena price prediction by CoinGape shows that bears remain dominant, as per the 3-month bias indicator. Nevertheless, renowned market trader Byzantine General took to X, projecting an optimistic outlook for the synthetic dollar protocol crypto. Source: Byzantine General, X The trader revealed that the crypto’s funding rate isn’t negative anymore, suggesting a bullish movement looms. Further, ENA got heavily shorted primarily due to its massive token unlocks, but the heat has now cooled down, per the analyst. Nevertheless, despite positive reaffirmation by renowned traders, it remains vital to gauge in broader aspects that underscore volatility is possible. The post Is Ethena Price At Risk?

According to a Mar. 25 press release statement , SBI VC Trade, a crypto exchange under SBI Holdings, will begin full-scale USD Coin ( USDC ) trading on Mar. 26. USDC is now the first international dollar stablecoin to be legally recognized under Japan’s stablecoin framework, following regulatory approval from the country’s Financial Services Agency. For the past two years, Circle has been working with banking partners and regulators to make this feasible. According to Circle’s chief executive officer Jeremy Allaire, Japan’s transparent stablecoin regulations offer significant prospects for cross-border transactions, digital payments, and financial innovation. “We are honored to bring USDC to businesses and consumers in the market, and with Circle Japan KK and the strong support of SBI Holdings and leading exchanges, USDC is positioned as a secure and transparent digital dollar that meets the needs of Japan’s evolving digital economy.” — Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle . SBI Holdings sees this as a critical step in enhancing the usability and accessibility of digital assets for both consumers and businesses. In addition to SBI VC Trade, USDC will soon be listed by Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer, further broadening its reach.

They are now available to companies operating in Dubai’s economic free zone, approved for use in financial services, treasury operations, and payments. With $2.6 billion minted in the last 30 days, USDC’s market capitalization as of Mar. 25 is $59.75 billion, according to data from DefiLlama. Even though Tether ( USDT ), Circle’s main competitor, still holds 61.93% of the stablecoin market share, regulatory scrutiny of the company is growing especially in Europe, where it has been delisted from several exchanges. On the other hand, Circle continues to improve its standing as a regulated and widely accepted stablecoin by adhering to the Markets in Crypto Authority regulations.

The centralized exchanges (CEX) of the Ethereum network hold the smallest amount of Ethereum in nearly nine years, with 8.97 million ETH remaining on the platforms. This sharp decline indicates a serious shift in Ethereum’s market dynamics, where the number of tokens available for immediate sale or trading on those same platforms is at an all-time low, not seen since November 2015. Ethereum Supply on CEX Hits 9-Year Low – Only 8.97M ETH Left As of March 24, data from CryptoRank and Santiment shows that Ethereum holdings on centralized exchanges (CEX) have dropped to their lowest level since November 2015, now standing at just 8.97 million ETH. Reduced… pic.twitter.com/TmU3A8UyX6 — Followin (@followin_io) March 24, 2025 The reduction in the supply of Ethereum on exchanges has sent a ripple of questions among observers about what it might mean for the market. It could be a sign of something more dire in the short term—reduced liquidity, for instance. Or it could be something much nicer: a precursor to a big jump in Ethereum’s price since there’s now less of the stuff on hand for traders to do whatever it is with Ethereum that they do. But sometimes it’s just nice to know in what direction the wind is blowing. So let’s take a look at this etherwind. One Ethereum observer—Evangelos Kandias—has suggested on Twitter that the current situation is hexing traders. Reduced Liquidity May Lead to Price Movements Ethereum’s drop in supply directly impacts centralized exchanges. The liquidity available on those exchanges has decreased significantly. There are now only 8.97 million ETH left on exchanges to trade. And that could create a situation where Ethereum’s price becomes far more reactive to changes in demand. A primary driver of this shift is that a good number of Ethereum holders are opting to transfer their assets from exchanges into cold wallets for what seems to be long-term storage. When these investors undertake this action, they are in effect taking ETH out of circulation and not making it available on exchanges. This strike appears to be a bullish one for Ethereum because it suggests the investors are in a less-sell, more-hold mode, with action that seems to imply confidence in Ethereum’s future. Additionally, a decrease in supply on exchanges usually causes an increase in demand, which in turn makes prices go up. In the case of Bitcoin, we saw its supply on exchanges drop earlier this year, followed by an intense spike in its price. Right now, Ethereum is very similar to Bitcoin in that its current supply on exchanges has dropped significantly. Ethereum Spot ETFs Experience Outflows Even with the nice signs pertaining to the diminished offering of Ethereum on exchanges, not all goings-on in the Ethereum marketplace are encouraging these days. From March 17 to March 21, Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) took a net outflow of $103 million for the week. The most sizable exit was from BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA), which saw a net outflow of $74 million. This could be taken as a somewhat bearish sign, suggesting that institutional investors might be easing back on Ethereum. From March 17 to March 21, Ethereum spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $103 million for the week. The largest outflow came from BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA), which recorded a net outflow of $74 million. In contrast, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a total weekly net inflow of… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 24, 2025 The notable part about the outflows from Ethereum ETFs is they represent a change in investor sentiment. Spot ETFs are products that institutional investors often use to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly purchase or manage it. The outflows suggest that some large investors are currently less confident than they were a month ago in Ethereum’s short-term prospects. That said, these flows are only a snapshot in time and can quickly change based on broader market conditions and investor sentiment. A Look Back: Bitcoin’s Similar Price Surge Grasping the possible fallout from Ethereum’s scant exchange supply requires us to consider a closely related event with Bitcoin that took place in January. On the heels of several price drops in late 2022, Bitcoin’s supply on centralized exchanges plummeted. Investors, it seemed, were taking their funds and moving them to the safety of cold storage. The only problem? With so few Bitcoin available to trade, the actual price of Bitcoin began to rise too. Even though Bitcoin and Ethereum are separate assets with their own market dynamics, we must not overlook the parallels between the two. If demand for Ethereum remains robust while its supply continues to dwindle, the cryptocurrency may be set for a price moonshot. This hinges, of course, on whether the reduced supply in the exchanges translates into an increase in buying pressure—something that seems less and less likely with each passing day. Conclusion: Reduced Exchange Supply Signals Potential for Price Growth A recent development for the cryptocurrency known as Ethereum is its stark drop in supply on centralized exchanges. There currently exists only 8.97 million ETH on such platforms, the lowest figure recorded in nearly nine years. This dearth seems to signal a move by not just retail, but also institutional investors, to cold wallets (hence the term “decreasing liquidity”) and is probably a bullish omen. After all, a cryptocurrency is less likely to be traded when there is almost none to be had. All of this is apparently part of a trend, with holders increasingly demonstrating faith in what seems to be Ethereum’s long-term viability. Despite a drop in exchange supply, Ethereum spot ETFs have seen notable outflows. This could suggest a potential short-term pullback from some of the institutions that had been investing in Ethereum via this vehicle. It might modestly affect the price if these trends continue. In the end, it is the interplay of supply and demand that will determine the direction of travel for Ethereum’s price. A situation has emerged that is similar to what happened with Bitcoin in January: the supply of Ethereum available on exchanges has fallen, and if demand picks up, the price could appreciate. Of course, this is a big “if,” one that many are watching closely as the weeks unfold. Even if it does play out, seeing Ethereum hit new highs could be a possibility.

With this green light, Circle is set to launch USDC in Japan on March 26 through a strategic partnership with SBI Holdings. Meanwhile, the move is expected to open major opportunities in trading, payments, cross-border finance, foreign exchange, and more. Circle Expands USDC Operations in Japan In a recent tweet post Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, revealed that the company spent over two years working with Japanese regulators and financial firms to secure approval. https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1904303244240896418 As part of its entry into the Japanese market, Circle has launched new operations and formed a strategic joint venture (JV) with SBI Holdings, one of Japan’s top financial firms. As part of this partnership, SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, will soon introduce USDC to Japanese users. This comes after SBI VC Trade made history on March 4 by becoming the first platform to receive regulatory approval to list USDC under Japan’s Financial Services Agency’s stablecoin framework. Circle also plans to expand further by listing USDC on Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer soon. This is a big move for Circle as it brings USDC to new markets beyond the traditional ones. Other major exchanges in Japan are expected to follow, strengthening USDC’s presence in the region. Japan Leads in Stablecoin Adoption Japan has been a leader in Web3 and blockchain adoption, setting clear regulations for stablecoins in its financial system. This strong regulatory framework is now paving the way for stablecoins like USDC to thrive in the country. SBI Holdings’ CEO, Yoshitaka Kitao, believes this move will improve financial access and boost digital asset growth in Japan. He stated that it aligns with their vision for the future of payments and blockchain finance. Japan has been cautious about digital assets due to past incidents like the Mt. Gox collapse. However, with better regulations in place, stablecoins like USDC are now seen as a safe option for both individuals and businesses. Unlocking New Financial Opportunities With USDC now approved in Japan, the stablecoin’s use is expected to go beyond just cryptocurrency trading. This approval makes Circle a top player in stablecoins, helping bring digital dollars to more people worldwide. As of now, USDC stablecoin has a market cap of almost $60 billion .",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|USDC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 07:08:34

While Shiba Inu holds its breath hoping Bitcoin clears $90K, and Pudgy Penguins rallies behind the first-ever NFT-crypto ETF in the U.S., a whole different beast is gaining speed— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Shiba is teetering around its support zone with weak investor backing, while Pudgy traders are riding the ETF headlines like a wave. Meanwhile, investors chasing serious ROI are hunting for the best cryptos to join for long term gains that can survive volatility, ignore market noise, and reward early believers. That’s where BTFD Coin steps in—an off-the-chain meme coin presale success story that’s rewriting the playbook on how meme coins should launch. By staying immune to external price fluctuations, BTFD’s final presale stretch is all about pure, unfiltered upside. With a fully live P2E game, monster staking returns, and bulls stampeding into the presale, this isn’t just another token; it’s a movement backed by stats, swagger, and serious community heat. Now’s your shot to discover how BTFD Coin is flipping the meme coin world on its head and why this presale could be the smartest long-term bet you make all year. Hold tight. The next few minutes could decide your next few years. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Meme Coin With a P2E Game and 90% APY Staking! Ask yourself this—if you had the chance to lock in a presale price that offers a direct path to 2900% ROI, would you take it or scroll past it? Because one stop before BTFD Coin’s final presale stage is right now—and there’s not much time left on the clock. At just $0.0002 per coin in Stage 15, the BTFD presale gives investors a golden shot to ride from ground-floor pricing all the way to its final listing price of $0.0006. That alone is a 200% return. But the real kicker? Analysts are calling for a moon price of $0.006. That’s a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI for those getting in today. A $1000 buy at this stage gets you 5,000,000 BTFD tokens. If it hits $0.0006, that’s $3,000. But if it hits its projected moon price of $0.006—boom, you’re sitting on $30,000. That’s why crypto insiders are labeling it one of the best cryptos to join for long term gains. The hype’s not just talk. BTFD’s raised over $6.41 million, sold more than 71 billion coins, and attracted 11,500+ holders—all before it even launched. And with Stage 16 being the final checkpoint, this $0.0002 price is on life support. Miss it now, and the ROI window shuts—fast. But it’s not just about early bird pricing. BTFD’s utility is where it goes beast mode. The full P2E game launched on January 1st is already paying out rewards. Play, earn, level up, and cash out or stake for gains. It’s crypto meets gaming with real bag potential. Let’s not sleep on staking either. BTFD’s staking system , live since December 2nd, offers a heavy 90% APY. That’s right—holders can earn while they wait. Staking $1,000 BTFD could grow to nearly twice in a year. And compounding? Yeah, that just levels it up further. The Bulls Squad characters and their digital world bring the coin to life, pulling the community into something more than just speculation. The meme coin presale is the heartbeat of this project, and it’s roaring in Stage 15. Want to make it even better? BTFD’s referral program offers real rewards. Share your code, and if someone buys $50 or more, they get 10% extra tokens. You, meanwhile, can score 10% of what they spend if you crack the top 20 on the leaderboard. The leaderboard resets monthly—so every new month is a clean shot. So here’s your four-step game plan to load up before this thing takes off. First, head to the BTFD presale site . Next, connect your wallet—Trust Wallet, MetaMask, whatever works. Pick your currency. Then click buy. That’s it. Claim those presale coins before this price disappears forever. This ain’t just another meme coin. BTFD Coin is charging into the next bull cycle with the herd behind it, a community-first mindset, and utilities that are already delivering.

Canary Capital filed for the first-ever U.S.-listed ETF that includes both NFTs and crypto, and it’s centered around the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. That includes the PENGU token and a curated set of rare NFTs from the collection. The ETF will also include Solana and Ethereum for liquidity moves. After the news broke, PENGU spiked—then pulled back over 8% during Friday’s U.S. trading hours. Still, retail sentiment is sky-high. StockTwits shows “extremely bullish” chatter with users seeing the dip as a golden buying opportunity. PENGU’s down 90% from its all-time high of $0.06845, but with the ETF move, investors are banking on a rebound. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Holding Its Breath as Bitcoin Eyes $90K SHIB’s fate is tied closely to Bitcoin’s momentum. With a correlation of 0.77, SHIB’s stuck in a waiting game. The MVRV Long/Short Difference just hit a six-month low—meaning short-term holders are sitting on profits and could dump anytime. That adds serious bearish pressure, especially with long-term whales staying quiet. Right now, SHIB’s hovering just above its $0.00001275 support level. A break above $0.00001462 could flip the narrative, but without a strong push from Bitcoin, it might stay stuck. Investors are watching BTC closely. If it breaks $90K, SHIB could ride that wave out of its current lull. Conclusion: Your $0.0002 Ticket to the Moon Is Right Here, Right Now If you’ve been searching for the best cryptos to join for long term gains, the data’s clear— BTFD Coin’s presale is where real gains live. While legacy tokens like SHIB wrestle with market mood swings and Pudgy Penguins aim for institutional validation, BTFD is giving everyday investors something real—an ROI opportunity of 2900%, a live P2E game, staking at 90% APY, and a die-hard bull community. Based on everything we’ve seen, from its explosive presale to analyst predictions of $0.006 and even higher, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be a breakout star in the next bull run. But you’ve got one stage left before the curtain drops. Don’t wait for listings and market hype—join during the final presale stage and lock in gains before the crowd shows up.

Yet macro analyst Tomas (@TomasOnMarkets) contends that the broader economic backdrop is not as dire as some headlines suggest, even though certain datasets have pointed to weaker growth in early 2025. “Doesn’t look very recessionary to me?” Tomas wrote in a recent post on X, echoing the skepticism he has maintained for months. He pointed to specific indicators that began sliding in February but have started to stabilize. According to his analysis, US growth nowcasts—which aggregate various real-time measures of economic growth—“fell throughout February but have been leveling off for three weeks.” He likewise referenced the Citi Economic Surprise Index (CESI), which tracks how actual economic data compares to consensus forecasts. Since January, the CESI had been in a downturn, implying that data releases were coming in below expectations, but it has also steadied in recent weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin To ‘Brutally Bleed Lower’ Or Break New ATH In Q2, Expert Warns “Falling CESI = data coming in below expectations, rising CESI = data coming in above expectations,” Tomas explained, highlighting the significance of the index for market sentiment. The upshot is that, while markets grew increasingly defensive during the early-year weakness, these indicators are no longer deteriorating at the pace observed at the start of 2025. Why Bitcoin Mirrors Summer 2024 Tomas then turned his attention to parallels between the current environment and two notable past episodes: the turbulence of Summer 2024 and the rout of late 2018. He underscored that, in each case, global markets encountered a sharp drawdown triggered by what he labeled “growth/recession scares,” combined with other exogenous pressures. “For me, the two recent instances that are the most similar to today in terms of both price action and macro backdrop are Summer 2024 and late 2018,” he wrote. During Summer 2024, concerns over growth plus a widespread yen carry trade unwind contributed to a 10% equity-market drawdown. In late 2018, an escalating trade battle during the first Trump-era tariff moves similarly prompted an initial correction in equities of about 10%, eventually deepening into a further 15% pullback. Now, with equity markets having also suffered approximately a 10% peak-to-trough decline recently, Tomas sees distinct echoes of those historical moments. He noted that such parallels extend to Bitcoin, which fell around 30% in Summer 2024 and 54% in late 2018—close to the 30% slide it has endured this time around. The question, he posed, is which path lies ahead: will the market follow the relatively contained Summer 2024 correction, or will it spiral into a more painful chain of losses similar to late 2018’s extended selloff? Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom In Sight As Trump Expected To Soften Stance On Reciprocal Tariffs: Report “So which way?” Tomas asked, underscoring the uncertain juncture facing both crypto assets and equities. His stance leans toward expecting a scenario more akin to Summer 2024 than to the tumult of 2018. In his words, “I’m still in the camp that tariffs won’t be as bad as many expect — I’ve been here for months,” a viewpoint he believes also helps explain the somewhat surprising resilience in risk assets lately. He suggested that “some of the noises over the past couple of days are potentially pointing towards this outcome, which is probably why risk assets have jumped today,” although he stopped short of claiming any definitive resolution. Several factors, in Tomas’s view, bolster the case that today’s landscape aligns more closely with Summer 2024 than with late 2018. One is the recent easing of financial conditions, which had tightened earlier in the year but have since moderated. Another is the US dollar’s notable weakening in recent weeks, a stark contrast to its ascent during 2018 that intensified selling pressure on global assets. Tomas added that most leading indicators still support a continued business cycle expansion, a stance he believes is less reflective of the contractionary signals that rattled investors nearly seven years ago. Another contributing element, he noted, is the generally favorable seasonal pattern for US equity indices, which often rebound after a weak February and find firmer footing by mid-March. Finally, tight credit spreads—still below their highs seen in August 2024—point to stable credit markets that do not appear to be pricing in severe economic distress. Beyond the question of macro signals, Tomas openly admitted fatigue with the swirl of discussions around economic policy catalysts. “I’m honestly really bored with all the tariff talk,” he wrote, while reminding followers that April 2 remains pivotal for clarity. “April 2nd ‘tariff liberation day’ will probably play a big role in deciding,” he concluded. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $86,557.

Max Avery highlighted the significance of this development in a recent post , emphasizing Ondo’s role in bridging traditional financial instruments with blockchain-based solutions. He pointed out that despite Ondo’s rapid growth and success, the broader market has not fully recognized its impact. Avery stated, “Ondo Finance is building a direct line between well-established financial instruments and on-chain access with XRP Ledger and Stellar and people still aren’t paying enough attention.” He further explained that Ondo is addressing key inefficiencies in traditional finance, such as slow settlement times and limited accessibility, by leveraging blockchain technology. The Growth of Ondo’s Tokenized Treasury Market One of Ondo Finance’s main offerings, OUSG, has already surpassed $1 billion in demand. This product provides exposure to U.S. Treasuries with on-chain accessibility, allowing for 24/7 minting and redemption. Avery contrasted this with traditional finance, where transactions are restricted by banking hours, often delaying settlements to the next business day. He described OUSG as providing the benefits of Treasuries while incorporating the flexibility of digital assets. With OUSG now available on the XRP Ledger , investors can gain access to tokenized treasuries in a more efficient manner. Avery noted that this development eliminates arbitrary time restrictions that have long constrained traditional financial markets. By utilizing the XRP Ledger, Ondo Finance is tapping into a blockchain network known for its institutional partnerships and compliance-focused infrastructure. USDY and Its Role in Expanding Financial Access Ondo’s second major offering, USDY, functions differently from traditional stablecoins. Unlike stablecoins that simply hold their value, USDY is backed by U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits, generating yield over time. Avery highlighted how USDY on Stellar connects to a global payment network spanning 180 countries. This feature allows users worldwide, particularly those without stable access to the U.S. dollar, to benefit from Treasury yields. Avery explained that the introduction of USDY provides financial opportunities that were previously unavailable. He asked how millions facing inflation and currency devaluation could gain access to stable dollar yields without requiring a U.S. bank account. By deploying USDY on Stellar, Ondo Finance enables broader participation in global financial markets. Experienced Leadership and Regulatory Focus Ondo Finance’s leadership includes individuals with extensive experience in traditional finance and digital assets. Avery noted that President Justin Schmidt previously led digital assets at Goldman Sachs , while Vice President Katie Wheeler has held roles at Circle and BlackRock. Additionally, Ondo has recently appointed Patrick McHenry, the former Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, as Vice Chairman of its Advisory Board. Avery pointed out that McHenry’s addition brings regulatory expertise at a critical time when cryptocurrency policies are still evolving. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 By combining blockchain technology with institutional-level financial expertise, Ondo Finance positions itself as a trusted entity in the tokenized asset space. Avery emphasized that this combination allows Ondo to move faster than traditional financial institutions while maintaining compliance standards that attract institutional investors. A Multi-Chain Approach to Tokenized Assets Avery underscored the significance of Ondo’s decision to integrate with the XRP Ledger and Stellar. He explained that each blockchain serves a distinct purpose: the XRP Ledger supports institutional adoption and compliance, while Stellar is well-suited for global payments and financial inclusion. Ondo’s strategic use of these networks ensures that its products align with the strengths of each ecosystem. Looking ahead, Avery suggested that tokenized U.S. Treasuries are only the beginning. He predicted that corporate bonds, real estate, commodities, and alternative assets could soon follow, making financial markets more accessible and efficient. He described the potential for fractional ownership, automated payouts, and smart contracts that directly interact with real-world assets. Avery concluded that these advancements represent a shift toward a more accessible financial system. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Gox collapse Once the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy in 2014 after losing about 850,000 BTC, which was then valued at almost $500 million. The exchange attributed the loss to a hacking incident, which turned out to be the result of years of security lapses. The case has been the subject of numerous legal battles over the years, causing the repayment of creditors to be delayed. As of Mar. 25, data from Arkham Intelligence shows that Mt. Gox still holds about 35,000 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $3.08 billion. Last year, the exchange extended its repayment deadline from Oct. 31, 2024, to Oct. 31, 2025, citing delays in verification and processing. Historically, large Bitcoin transfers from entities like Mt. Gox have triggered market fluctuations . However, data suggests that recent movements have had less impact on Bitcoin’s price.

Here’s MUTM Price Prediction for the Next Bull Run,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-mutuum-finance-mutm-the-golden-ticket-of-2025-heres-mutm-price-prediction-for-the-next-bull-run/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set the crypto market ablaze with speculation, with its presale already raking in over $4.7 million and over 6,500 holders in just a matter of weeks. Now in Phase 3 of an 11-phase presale, tokens are available for $0.02 each, over half of which have already been snapped up in advance of a 25% increase to $0.025 in Phase 4. Investors piling into MUTM today can lock in a 200% profit as soon as the token lists at $0.06, but projections after launch suggest a massive jump to $5 in 2025. Thanks to its decentralized lending framework and its buy pressure mechanism, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is on its way to becoming one of the most used tools in an area full of speculative assets. Rapid Presale Momentum Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 3 is racing toward a sell-out, driven by the anticipation of the next price spike. Anyone who purchases Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens in the early phases priced at $0.02 today will instantly see a 25% profit when Phase 4 launches at $0.025. This regimented climb provides technical gains for presale buyers as well, ending in a guaranteed 3x payout upon listing at $0.06. The project’s $100,000 giveaway — the chance for 10 early contributors to earn $10,000 each —has only added to the word, with investors pushing to stake a claim before the next stage of development launches. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing interest from both retail and institutional investors with the prospects of liquidity mining rewards and a peer-to-peer lending model, set to launch soon. Tokenomics Driving Demand for the Long Term Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with a self-funding ecosystem where platform revenue is utilized to automatically buyback Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This creates constant buy pressure and discourages sell-offs as these tokens are redistributed to stakers. Moreover, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol’s mtTokens — the interest-bearing assets that represent user deposits — add an extra layer of utility by enabling holders to earn passive yields on ETH, DAI or other supported cryptos. Analysts point to a scarcity model and overcollateralized lending of the token as events that should contribute further to stability, with post-launch estimates projected between $1.50 and $5. Investing $2,500 at the current presale price could swell to $125,000 if Mutuum Finance (MUTM) were to hit $5, representing 24,900% ROI. Strategic Roadmap for Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently getting a final smart contracts audit by Certik which once complete, should enhance investor confidence. Simultaneously, the team has hinted at plans for an overcollateralized stablecoin to deepen liquidity and expand borrowing options. In contrast with meme coins or trend-based coins, the value of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) depends on real use cases: making loans, deriving yields and connecting to off-chain DeFi systems. This real-world applicability has led to comparisons with early Ethereum adopters, with experts pointing to similarities in growth trajectories. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — is making the most of the volatility in the crypto market, rather than just getting by. The incentive structure aligns with utility of the platforms, and the project has created a green-print for ongoing demand. The small window to hop into Phase 3 is among the last to be able to stake Mutuum Finance (MUTM) below $0.025, a level inbound on your horizon — could soon become a lost memory. With Certik’s endorsement looming and exchange listings approaching, the real question is not if Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rise, but how high. For people looking for a 2025 golden ticket, time is sinking fast.

House of Doge is the Foundation’s corporate and commercialization unit, which was formed in February with a five-year deal in place.

Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Group will launch USDC, which will first be listed on the SBI VC Trade crypto exchange. SBI VC Trade recently received a regulatory nod to enable handling stablecoin listings in Japan. The approval made USDC the first and only global dollar stablecoin approved for use in the country. According to CoinGecko data , USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, following Tether in the lead. The stablecoin’s market cap currently stands at $59.7 billion. Besides, Circle is also planning to list the stablecoin on major crypto exchanges, including Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer.

Japan’s Stance on Stablecoins After Regulatory Reforms In 2023, Japan lifted the ban on foreign stablecoins, paving the way for firms like SBI to expand their offerings. In February, Japan’s regulator – Financial Services Agency (FSA) – approved policy recommendations to relax stablecoin regulations further. FSA Commissioner Hideki told local news outlet Nikkei that stablecoins could enhance financial services by improving remittance and settlement processes. “Stablecoins are used soundly for the sophistication of remittance and settlement. I hope it will be done,” he said. Apart from Circle, SBI VC Trade and its parent firm have established partnerships with major U.S. exchanges such as Ripple.

In the last seven days, the total meme coin market cap has gained nearly 10% from $48 billion to $52 billion at press time. Amid these bullish tailwinds, can SHIB price reach the highly anticipated psychological level of $0.001? Shiba Inu Price in Focus Amid Mysterious 1B SHIB Burn The Shiba Inu burn rate skyrocketed recently after an unknown user burned 1,000,000,000 SHIB tokens. Data from Shibburn shows that this user sent these tokens to the burn address in a single transaction. Yesterday, another address also sent 23M SHIB to the burn address. SHIB Burn One of the main factors contributing to the high burn rate is a spike in activity on the Shibarium network. DeFi tracking tool DeFiLlama shows that in just one week, Shibarium’s TVL has increased by over $1M and recently reached its highest level since late January. Shiba Inu DeFi TVL As Shibarium records an uptick in activity, the burn rate will continue to surge and bring down SHIB’s supply. This will bode well for Shiba Inu price. SHIB Supply Crunch Looms Besides the token burns, Shiba Inu supply on exchanges has also reached its lowest level in four years. According to Santiment, SHIB’s exchange experienced a sharp decline earlier this year, and only 100.42 trillion tokens, valued at around $1.3 billion are available on exchanges. Shiba Inu Supply on Exchanges The amount of SHIB held on exchanges is only 16% of the meme coin’s circulating supply of 589 trillion tokens. This decline indicates that many SHIB holders are not holding their tokens on exchanges, which highlights a lack of intent to sell. As this supply continues to fall, it might cause a supply crunch where demand outpaces the supply. This could spark a parabolic rally for Shiba Inu price. Can Shiba Inu Reach $0.001? The $0.001 price target is realistic for Shiba Inu as that would give it a $589B market cap. One of the factors that could aid such a rally is a gradual increase in the SHIB burn rate. Additionally, increased activity on Shibarium could sustain a long-term uptrend. Early Bitcoin advocate Davinci Jeremie previously stated that Shibarium will unlock SHIB’s potential . The possible launch of a spot SHIB ETF as highlighted by SHIB marketing executive LUCIE could also drive a price rally to $0.001. If Shiba Inu outperforms the rest of the crypto market and attains this price target, it will not only be the largest meme coin but also the largest altcoin. Shiba Inu Price Analysis Shiba Inu price today trades at $0.0000135 with a 2.5% gain in 24 hours, The meme coin is on the verge of a breakout after breaking above the upper trendline of a descending parallel channel, indicating that bears are losing control as buying pressure rises. The rising RSI line also supports this bullish Shiba Inu price prediction . This indicator stands at 51, which is a neutral level. However, the making of higher lows shows that selling pressure is easing. Shiba Inu faces two key resistance levels which, if breached, will confirm a bullish reversal. One of these levels is the 50-day SMA of $0.0000141. If the meme coin flips this resistance, it could trigger a 36% surge to the 200-day SMA of $0.000019. SHIB/USDT: 4-hour Chart In summary, Shiba Inu price is likely to break crucial resistance at the 50-day SMA, which will confirm a reversal from bearish to bullish trends. The increasing burn rate caused by an uptick in activity on Shibarium as well as the falling supply on exchange could trigger a supply crunch. This could precede a parabolic rally for SHIB.

However, it faced immediate resistance at that point and was pushed south to under $87,000 as of now. Here are some of the possible reasons behind the correction. Technical Perspective CryptoPotato warned yesterday that BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), measuring the speed and change of price movements, had gone into an overbought territory above 70. Such rapid increases typically mean that the asset has reached a local top and could be heading for a correction. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez outlined on X what happened to bitcoin the last six times it went into an overbought state. Hint, they were all painful. Check out what happened to #Bitcoin $BTC the last six times the RSI hit overbought territory in the 4-hour chart! pic.twitter.com/N3J5fLR5so — Ali (@ali_charts) March 24, 2025 The second technical indicator that could be behind BTC’s rejection is the TD Sequential. It sort of complements the RSI as it also shows whether the buyers or sellers have reached market exhaustion. In the case of bitcoin, it suggested a short-term top after the recent rally toward $89,000. After timing the recent bottom, the TD Sequential indicator now suggests #Bitcoin $BTC may be approaching a short-term top, hinting at potential profit-taking ahead. pic.twitter.com/3NZOsKfXr1 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 24, 2025 The last potential reason from a technical perspective came in the form of resistance, which had built up around the $89,000 mark. It was created when the 50-day moving average and the descending trending from the ATH converged and acted as a big roadblock in BTC’s potential move toward $90,000 and $100,000, said Martinez. Whales Offloading and Bonus Big bitcoin holders, typically referred to as whales, used the opportunity to secure some profits amid BTC’s rally. According to Martinez, who cited data from Santiment, they disposed of more than 20,000 BTC, valued at roughly $1.8 billion at prices from the local peak. Recall that whales had been accumulating hard in the past month as BTC’s price tumbled but might have changed their strategy, at least for the short term. The bonus reason comes from Mt Gox. Arkham noted that wallets related to the failed exchange have moved $1 billion worth of BTC. Such transfers typically scare off the market, and they lead to brief corrections.

Memecoins like FARTCOIN and SPX6900 are leading the charge as they feature in the top 10 memecoin by gains on CoinMarketCap today. SPX6900 had a terrible start to 2025. Its recent price action has got many investors asking if a comeback is underway. $SPX Journey: Will It Sustain Its Recent Rally? SPX6900 has come a long way from its all-time high of $1.72. It dropped by more than 80% since January to a low of $0.25 before recent efforts at recovery pushed it above $0.5 in March, and now it is trading above $0.6. Earlier today, $SPX skyrocketed to the #7 spot among top meme coins with a $592.03M market cap. For a moment, it was the biggest 24-hour gainer among the top 10 crypto coins. However, it is still 63% down from its ATH of 2 months ago. The $0.6 level has acted as support for several months, so the bulls will be expecting a close above this level to confirm a bullish outlook. The $SPX price faced a significant correction, after which it has now regained two resistance levels. Analysts predict another correction incoming but say it could rise to as high as $1.80 before experiencing a decline. SPX6900 may be doing well in the short term, but crypto investors are looking for a more stable return on investment over the long term. Memecoins like Chill Drone ($CHONE), fusing meme culture, gamification, and AI, are top searches on some crypto exchanges. $CHONE Could Outshine Recent Gains In the Meme Market While the market is feeling good about $SPX, there are newer, finer coins like $CHONE that are more than capable of taking over the media. $CHONE especially has a refreshing narrative that exceeds the potential of its rivals in the market. $CHONE is the kind of meme coin that is most attractive to experienced traders, with its market cap below $400k. It’s the best type of meme coin to ape into, as it is the kind that experiences massive blowouts. Daily trading volume is just under $68k, with a price increase of 8% in the last 24 hours. $CHONE has a chilled outlook, but it has been designed to grow efficiently. Its use of AI emphasizes its potential for growth. Right now, users can access an AI assistant on $CHONE’s website to ease user experience and answer any questions investors might have. $CHONE is bound to experience growth in the near future and will be able to surpass market players like $SPX. Meme Coins Still Have A Stake In Crypto’s Future The market is steadily recovering, and more meme coins are gaining liquidity from big players. $SPX might be proof that the market is getting back on its feet, but $CHONE would be the coin used to restore investors’ egos. As more market players emerge, experiencing exponential growth, $CHONE will become a stable figure, like $SPX, climbing the ranks to establish itself. $CHONE currently sits at a good entry point of $0.00037, encouraging traders to take advantage of a high-growth potential.

Meanwhile, with the entry of the institutions, the trade dynamics of the entire market have changed to a large extent. Hence, the external factors now seem to have a limited impact on the BTC price, as it seems to be confident of a continued upswing hereafter. The US President Donald Trump lit the ‘tariff war’ a few days ago, which dragged the traditional and the crypto markets lower. Now that he has eased the April 2 tariff plan for a while, the markets seem to have gained some strength. On the other hand, a fresh wave of volatility is expected to hit the markets with the fresh updates on Mt. Gox. The platform has now moved more than 11,000 BTC worth over $1 billion, which has become a matter of concern. The experts believe a fresh wave of volatility may strike the crypto markets, which may increase the selling pressure. It’s not the first time Mt. Gox made such moves. Previously, when it began its rehabilitation program, the creditors demonstrated a huge confidence in the upcoming price trend. As a result, the BTC price faced a minimal impact, which was short-lived. Moreover, the current market dynamics suggest the price may not be impacted by the current move too. Now the question arises: Will Bitcoin’s (BTC) price close the quarterly trade above $90,000? After rising above the 200-day MA, the BTC price has entered a secured range between the 50-day and 200-day MA, which is acting as strong resistance and support levels. Moreover, the baseline of Ichimoku is acting as a support, aiming for a bullish crossover in the next few days. This may happen only if the price continues to form constant higher highs and lows and eventually tests the 50-day MA close to $90,000. Meanwhile, the RSI remains elevated, even though the pace is extremely low. On the other hand, the MACD shows a rise in the buying pressure, but the levels remain within a negative range. Hence, no bullish confirmation can be validated unless the RSI breaks above 65 while the MACD is expected to rise to the positive range and to do so, a notable rise in the buying volume is a must. Therefore, the upcoming monthly close can be as important as the rise in volume may revive a strong ascending trend ahead.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 07:42:00

Some creditors received refunds through Kraken and Bitstamp, but the exchange postponed the refund deadline to October 31, 2025. With 35,583 BTC ($3.1 billion) still in Mt. Gox’s possession, concerns remain over potential selling pressure if these assets are distributed to creditors and subsequently liquidated.

Ethereum ( ETH ) has seemingly stuck in limbo as it’s giving away its value for free to layer-2 networks while struggling to keep investors interested. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has dropped 40% in the past three months, with Standard Chartered analysts now saying the network if facing “midlife crisis.” In an interview with the Financial Times, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research Geoff Kendrick said the network “gave away value for free” as with layer-2 networks Ethereum has “essentially commoditized itself.” Now, Ethereum is struggling with keeping its price from falling even further. As of press time, ETH is trading at around $2,054, after plunging to $1,813 earlier in March. Kaiko’s research analyst Adam McCarthy says the decline might be tied due to the fact that Ethereum “is just not interesting to most people.” “It’s hard to get too excited about amazing feats of engineering when there [are] so many competing things now in the attention economy.” Adam McCarthy You might also like: Ethereum leadership now eyes Solana-style growth, Dragonfly’s Qureshi says At the same time, Ethereum’s developers are struggling with internal disagreements, and user activity on the network hasn’t picked up, noted Carol Alexander, a finance professor at the University of Sussex. She added that the decentralized finance vision now feels “much further away now than a year ago” and that decision-making in the Ethereum community has become “a bit of a shambles.” Ethereum’s direction has been under scrutiny lately as even former Ethereum Foundation engineer Harikrishnan Mulackal criticized the network’s governance, saying it suffers from a “lack of a clear and cohesive vision.” Per Mulackal, without stronger leadership, Ethereum could stagnate, suggesting that the network should push for faster updates and ship “one hard fork each quarter.” Otherwise, he said, Ethereum risks reproducing “exactly the same result” as the past five years.

Several prediction models forecast YFI price to retest its all-time high of around $100k by 2030. The growth and adoption of Yearn Finance in 2025 and beyond will heavily pivot towards the protocol’s ability to adapt to the changing DeFi space. In the past, the Yearn Finance protocol has collaborated with other Web3 projects – led by Curve, AAVE, Optimism, and Arbitrum, among others – to ensure a sustainable future. With nearly $200 million in total value locked (TVL) the yearn finance protocol remains a top -tier platform in yield optimization.

On 24 March, two key bills—Senate Bill 1373 and Senate Bill 1025—cleared the House Rules Committee. If passed, the legislation would empower the state to create digital asset reserves using both seized cryptocurrencies and allocated public funds. Bitcoin Laws @Bitcoin_Laws · Follow 🇺🇸 State Reserve Race Update:Arizona’s House Rules Committee passed both Bitcoin Reserve Bills (SB1373 and SB1025), ruling them “constitutional and in proper form.”The bills have now passed their assigned committees, meaning they should be headed for a full floor vote. 3:27 am · 25 Mar 2025 390 Reply Copy link Read 10 replies With a Republican majority in the state House, the proposals now face a crucial floor vote that could place Arizona among the first US states to formally integrate crypto into treasury and retirement operations. Bitcoin, crypto bills move forward Senate Bill 1373, known as the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill, proposes the creation of a fund comprised of digital assets seized during criminal proceedings. The bill designates the Arizona State Treasurer as the fund’s manager, with oversight ensuring controlled exposure to market volatility. It includes a cap of 10% on the amount of the reserve that can be invested each year. It also allows the state to lend digital assets under the condition that such activity does not increase financial risk. This framework aims to turn previously confiscated assets into productive reserves without speculative exposure. Senate Bill 1025, named the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, focuses exclusively on Bitcoin. The bill would allow the state treasury and retirement system to allocate up to 10% of available funds into Bitcoin. It also includes a provision requiring the Bitcoin to be stored in a secure, segregated Federal Reserve account. Fiat Archive @fiatarchive · Follow JUST IN: 🇺🇲 Arizona’s House Rules Committee passed both Bitcoin Reserve Bills (SB1373 and SB1025), ruling them “constitutional and in proper form.” 👏The bills have now passed their assigned committees, meaning they should be headed for a full floor vote. 4:08 am · 25 Mar 2025 94 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies Political risks remain The two proposals will now head to the state House floor for a final vote. Arizona’s lower chamber has a 33-27 Republican majority, potentially easing the passage of the bills. However, even with legislative support, Governor Katie Hobbs’ stance remains uncertain. Governor Hobbs, a Democrat, has vetoed 22% of the bills passed in 2024 so far—the highest rate of any US governor this year. Her approach to cryptocurrency-related legislation has not been publicly clarified, adding uncertainty to the future of the proposed crypto reserve. The approval of either or both bills would mark a shift in Arizona’s approach to fiscal diversification. By incorporating crypto assets, the state aims to supplement its traditional financial reserves while also experimenting with blockchain-based monetary strategies. Other states expand Bitcoin reserve plans Arizona is not alone in this shift. A wave of similar proposals is emerging across the US, reflecting broader interest in digital assets among state governments. In Texas, the Senate passed its own version of a Bitcoin reserve bill (SB-21) with a 25-5 vote. That legislation awaits a House vote and gubernatorial decision. In a related move, Representative Ron Reynolds has proposed a cap of $250 million for the reserve. Meanwhile, Oklahoma’s House passed Bitcoin Reserve Bill HB1203 with a 77-15 vote on 25 March, sending it to the state Senate. Utah also introduced legislation along similar lines, although the section calling for a strategic reserve was eventually removed before advancing further. By allocating small portions of their treasuries or seized assets into cryptocurrencies, state governments are exploring new methods of value preservation, hedging, and returns. If the bills become law, Arizona will set a precedent for managing public digital assets through a conservative, regulated framework. The 10% allocation cap in both proposals reflects an attempt to balance innovation with fiscal responsibility.

The reserve began with an initial purchase of 10 million DOGE, a move designed to boost adoption of the meme coin as a serious payment solution. The goal behind the reserve is to solve one of crypto’s biggest problems: slow transaction times. Digital currencies often struggle with real-world usability because of delays in confirming payments. To fix this, the reserve will act as a buffer, helping to speed up Dogecoin transactions and make them smoother for businesses and users alike. Michael Galloro, a board member of the House of Doge, explained that the reserve will help make Dogecoin as reliable as traditional payment systems. Dogecoin already offers faster-than-average confirmation times, around one minute per transaction, which makes it a strong competitor for everyday purchases. Another key benefit is Dogecoin’s low transaction fees. Compared to the higher costs of using credit cards or traditional banks , Dogecoin stands out as a cost-effective payment method . The fees are a fraction of what users might pay through other systems, giving businesses a reason to consider DOGE as a payment option. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply, Dogecoin uses an inflationary model. Around 5.2 billion new coins enter circulation each year. This ongoing supply supports regular usage rather than encouraging people to simply hold the coin as a long-term asset. The House of Doge sees this steady liquidity as a strong point for building a reliable payment network. “With this reserve, we’re building the base for a system that prioritizes speed, stability, and daily use,” said Galloro. The organization wants to create an ecosystem where Dogecoin isn’t just a meme—it’s a functional digital currency that people and businesses use every day. Looking ahead, House of Doge is planning to roll out strategic partnerships aimed at demonstrating how scalable and useful Dogecoin can be in the real world. It also plans to launch reward programs such as merchant benefits and cashback incentives to further encourage adoption. Following the reserve announcement, Dogecoin saw a rise in both price and trading volume, reflecting a strong response from the market. These developments suggest growing momentum behind Dogecoin’s shift from joke coin to serious financial tool.",,EN,0,0,DOGE|FIAT|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-25 07:48:38

Aimed at reducing the country’s $1.2 trillion trade deficit, this policy shift could have a noticeable impact on financial markets, including crypto. Trump may hold back from imposing the most aggressive tariffs on key industries like automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. Instead, he might focus on a smaller group of countries—known informally as the “Dirty 15”—with large trade surpluses and high barriers to American exports. While this could signal a softer approach, nothing is set in stone. Trump has reversed course before, keeping both traditional and digital markets on edge. However, if the policy ends up being more selective or delayed, it could ease pressure on investors , especially after recent months of heightened macroeconomic tension. Historically, broad tariffs have led to market downturns, while lighter or delayed actions often provide relief. For crypto, which behaves like a risk-on asset, this means price movement could closely follow the tone of Trump’s final decision. If the administration pushes ahead with broad and aggressive tariffs , investor risk sentiment would likely weaken. Stock and bond markets might drop, and crypto could follow, with Bitcoin and Ethereum under pressure. Traders may move capital to the U.S. dollar or cash, reducing short-term interest in speculative digital assets. A similar pattern occurred in February, when tough tariff talk helped push Bitcoin below key price levels. On the other hand, if Trump announces a narrower, more targeted tariff strategy , the markets could see a short-term bounce. Crypto would benefit from reduced uncertainty and calmer investor sentiment. As seen earlier in March, even slight signals of policy flexibility helped Bitcoin climb back from recent lows. A measured approach could trigger another mini-rally. Trump’s unpredictability on trade continues to stir macroeconomic volatility , which heavily influences crypto prices. Even though digital currencies aren’t directly tied to trade, they react quickly to changes in global risk appetite and liquidity. In summary, how the April 2 tariffs unfold could shape the near-term direction of the crypto market. Aggressive tariffs could weigh on Bitcoin and Ethereum, while delayed or targeted actions might spark a rebound. Investors and traders are closely watching for clarity as crypto remains tightly linked to macro headlines.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-25 07:52:51

While there's no official statement from WLFI or Binance, the appearance of USD1—and its interaction with leading market maker Wintermute —has sparked rumors of a potential partnership involving Binance and possibly even the Trump family. The speculation began after reports suggested WLFI could be working with Binance to launch a USD-backed stablecoin, with the Trump family potentially investing in the venture. This week, the crypto community spotted USD1 on Binance Smart Chain, fueling chatter that the stablecoin may be tied to those earlier reports. A social media post claiming the ""Trump Family Foundation just issued a stablecoin on BSC"" went viral, further intensifying the conversation. The fact that Wintermute, a highly influential crypto market maker with billions in daily volume, interacted with USD1 only added to the intrigue. Wintermute has a known history of working with Binance and backing other crypto projects, which has increased interest in USD1's legitimacy. Former Binance CEO Changpeng “ CZ ” Zhao also commented on the situation. He confirmed that the USD1 smart contract had been deployed 20 days earlier and welcomed the token to BNB Chain. However, he later warned the community about scams using the USD1 name, clarifying that “the official USD1 is not tradable yet.” His wording left some readers confused, as it acknowledged an ""official"" version of the token without confirming any ties between Binance and WLFI. The lack of clarity has raised concerns. Some in the community noted that CZ’s spontaneous social media posts could easily be misinterpreted as endorsements or confirmations. Influencers reminded their followers not to take his comments out of context, especially in the absence of formal statements. So far, neither Binance nor WLFI has officially confirmed any partnership or acknowledged involvement with the USD1 stablecoin. Both have also denied earlier claims suggesting direct collaboration.

The move comes after SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings, received regulatory approval to list USDC under the Japan Financial Services Agency’s (FSA) stablecoin framework earlier this month. Announced on March 24, Circle confirmed that USDC trading will commence on SBI VC Trade starting March 26, making it the first platform in Japan to offer the US dollar-pegged stablecoin. The company also revealed plans to expand its reach by listing USDC on other major Japanese exchanges, including Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer, in the near future. The bitbank and bitFlyer platforms collectively processed over $50 million in daily trading volume last week and saw 1.85 million website visits over the past month, highlighting their significant influence in Japan’s crypto market. Strategic Expansion After Years of Negotiation Circle’s entry into Japan follows two years of discussions with regulators, financial institutions, and industry players, according to CEO Jeremy Allaire. In a March 24 X post , Allaire expressed optimism about the launch, stating that it will open up new opportunities for digital payments, cross-border finance, and foreign exchange (FX). The launch was welcomed by SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao, who stated that the stablecoin’s introduction would enhance financial accessibility and accelerate innovation in Japan’s blockchain-powered economy. USDC Maintains Its Position Circle’s regulatory win in Japan comes shortly after the company made strides in the Middle East. On Feb. 24, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) officially recognized USDC and Circle’s euro-backed EURC stablecoin under its new regulatory regime. USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, with $59.7 billion in circulation, trailing only Tether (USDT), which holds a dominant $143.8 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko.

If successful, the partnership could combine crypto-native features with Visa’s vast global customer base, creating a new way to process stablecoin payments at scale. The talks were initiated by Tools for Humanity, the company behind World Network. According to sources, the goal is to build a wallet that acts like a “mini bank account” , featuring fiat on-ramps, foreign exchange capabilities, and on-chain card services. This would allow stablecoin transactions across Visa’s massive infrastructure. Crypto influencer Mario Nawfal highlighted the effort, stating that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is reportedly leading the discussions with Visa. The wallet would be tied to the Worldcoin ecosystem and aim to simplify stablecoin payments in a way that mirrors traditional finance tools. In response to the news, Worldcoin’s price surged , gaining significant attention from the crypto community. This price jump reflects investor optimism, although it remains unclear how likely a final agreement is. Both companies have yet to confirm any official deal, and negotiations appear to be in the early stages. Visa has previously engaged with the crypto industry. In 2024, the company entered the real-world asset (RWA) space and partnered with platforms like Coinbase to enable faster fund transfers using Visa-branded debit cards. However, Visa’s earlier explorations into stablecoin integration had mixed outcomes. Some internal reports suggested that stablecoins could even disrupt Visa’s traditional revenue models. Despite those concerns, Visa is clearly continuing to explore crypto-related solutions, especially as stablecoins become more prominent in the global financial landscape. Industry voices, including former President Donald Trump , have recently emphasized the importance of stablecoins in maintaining U.S. dollar dominance . Likewise, pending regulations in the U.S. reflect growing interest among traditional institutions to enter the stablecoin space. For World Network, the potential partnership offers a chance to rebuild momentum. After facing regulatory pushback and a sharp price decline in 2024, this news has helped revive community confidence. The proposed stablecoin wallet could position World Network as a serious player in the broader digital finance ecosystem, especially if backed by a legacy payments brand like Visa. As of now, there is no confirmation or timeline for a possible deal. But the market’s response and the active discussions between the two parties suggest that stablecoins may soon play a much larger role in mainstream finance.",,EN,0,0,TRADING|WLD|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-25 07:58:37

Massive moves are happening across the board, and traders are on high alert. In a bold play, a whale just sold 356,665 Chainlink tokens, pocketing $4.59 million in USDC as LINK hit $12.88. But that’s not the only headline grabbing attention. Aave Labs has dropped its latest DeFi platform, aimed at bridging traditional finance with blockchain—and it’s already turning heads. While Chainlink and Aave make waves, BlockDAG (BDAG) is stealing the show. With a jaw-dropping $206 million raised in presale and 18.8 billion BDAG sold, BlockDAG is firing on all cylinders. The excitement is cranked up thanks to its Affiliate Program, giving traders back-to-back USDT rewards. It’s pure earning on repeat, and it’s happening right now. Chainlink Tokens: Whale Dumps 356k LINK for $4.59M—What’s Next? Chainlink tokens made headlines after a whale dumped 356,665 LINK, cashing out $4.59 million in USDC as prices hit $12.88. This quick sell-off came right after LINK jumped from $11.94, locking in profits. But here’s the catch—despite these short-term wins, Chainlink tokens have been on shaky ground. LINK has dropped 32.9% over the last month and is down 23.4% in just the past week. Even with its current price inching up to $13.14, there’s still a big question mark. Without serious buying pressure, Chainlink risks losing momentum. Many are wondering if LINK still deserves its spot among the highest ROI crypto plays—or if its best days are behind it. Aave Labs Targets Institutions with Horizon, but Will It Work? Aave Labs is pushing hard to lure institutional investors with its new Horizon initiative. The focus? Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), from stocks to real estate. Aave’s making a play for big money by blending traditional finance with DeFi. It’s offering lending options, investment vehicles—you name it. But there’s a catch. Strict KYC and AML rules make onboarding tough. Big investors are cautious, and regulations could throw even more roadblocks in the way. Add to that the usual blockchain security risks and technical hurdles, and it’s a bumpy road ahead. Some worry that Aave Labs’ shift toward institutions could alienate retail users altogether. Right now, many traders are eyeing higher ROI crypto alternatives with more immediate potential. BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program Pays 5% USDT Instantly—Earn Nonstop! BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program is shaking things up. Here’s how it works: share your link, and when someone buys BDAG, both of you score an instant 5% cashback in USDT. Simple, fast, and it doesn’t stop. Whether it’s one $10K buy (giving both of you 500 USDT) or dozens of smaller deals stacking rewards, the earning potential here is huge. The presale already tells the story. BlockDAG has raked in $206 million so far, with over 18.9 billion coins sold. Early buyers who got in at $0.001 have seen gains rocket by 2,380%—and the current batch price of $0.0248 is climbing fast. Thanks to the Affiliate Program, buying pressure is higher than ever. More referrals bring more buyers. More buyers create more scarcity. And as Batch 27 nears sellout, things are moving faster than ever. But here’s the kicker—this cashback cycle won’t last forever. When the Affiliate Program wraps up, so does the easiest way to stack BDAG and USDT at the same time. The clock’s ticking. For traders wanting in on the action before the next price spike, the moment to move is now. Summing Up! Chainlink tokens are still fighting market swings, and while whales are locking in profits, long-term growth looks shaky. Aave Labs is expanding into tokenized assets, but its success depends on getting institutions on board—and that’s a big ‘if.’ Meanwhile, BlockDAG is in hyperdrive. With $206 million already raised and 18.8 billion BDAG snapped up, it’s speeding toward its $600 million presale goal. Its Affiliate Program is flooding the market with new buyers, all chasing USDT rewards and price gains. With a 2,380% price increase from its starting point, BDAG is staking its claim as the highest ROI crypto on the table right now.

CEO Michael Saylor announced the company acquired 6,911 BTC for $584 million , pushing its total holdings past 500,000 Bitcoin. This move, made during a period of rising BTC prices, boosted investor confidence across the crypto market. Saylor stated the purchase was funded through the company’s STRK perpetual security , a debt-based financial tool recently launched to support ongoing Bitcoin acquisitions. The company increased its recent stock offering by over $200 million to make this buy possible. However, this aggressive accumulation strategy also raises long-term concerns. Strategy now holds more than 506,000 BTC, acquired at an average price near $66,000 per coin. This total represents over $33 billion in value, making the company one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. The latest purchase underlines Strategy's unwavering belief in Bitcoin's long-term value and its role in building digital financial infrastructure. But the firm's Bitcoin play isn't without risks. Strategy heavily depends on debt financing to continue acquiring BTC. Despite the bullish impact on market sentiment, this approach has resulted in ongoing negative cash flow. Many in the crypto space see Strategy’s buying activity as a key market signal—if that ever slows or reverses, confidence could quickly fade. Selling even a small portion of Strategy’s Bitcoin reserves could severely shake the market. Analysts warn that any forced liquidation, especially during a BTC downturn, would be interpreted as a very bearish signal. With the company so publicly committed to holding, any deviation from this stance could send shockwaves. Another concern lies in tax exposure and future obligations. While BTC’s price recovery has helped the firm stay afloat, the pressure to maintain investor trust remains high. The current strategy hinges on Bitcoin’s continued rise. If prices fall significantly, Strategy’s large debt position could become a major liability. Still, as of now, Bitcoin is gaining momentum , and Strategy’s consistent buying has become a stabilizing force in the crypto ecosystem. Since late 2024, the company’s purchases have accelerated—even as prices hit new highs—signaling Saylor’s dedication to supporting BTC. While Strategy’s bold stance continues to excite crypto advocates, it also ties the company’s future closely to Bitcoin’s success. The risk is high, but for now, Strategy remains one of the strongest institutional backers of the digital asset.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-25 08:02:04
