He believes this decision is a turning point that will help unlock opportunities in the US market, which has historically been challenging for crypto firms due to regulatory hurdles. Speaking in an interview, Garlinghouse said the SEC’s decision to end its regulatory investigation into Ripple was significant. He noted that Ripple was one of the first crypto companies to face the SEC’s lawsuit, and that the company had incurred over $150 million in legal fees to fight the case. Despite the long battle, he expressed relief at the outcome, noting that it allows Ripple and the wider crypto industry to move forward with greater clarity and confidence. “It took longer than we wanted to prove that the SEC was on the wrong side of the law and history, but we are excited about the outcome,” Garlinghouse said. “This allows us to really unlock a U.S. market that has been very hostile to the crypto industry.” Related News: Important Interest Rate Statements from US President Donald Trump and FED Official Bostic - Is a Rate Cut on the Way? While Ripple faces regulatory challenges in the U.S., the company has focused its efforts overseas, with around 95% of its customers now made up of financial institutions outside the U.S. The company has partnerships with major banks and payment providers, including HSBC and BBVA. Garlinghouse also pointed to Japan as a promising market where Ripple technology adoption is increasing. “Markets like Japan are still being unlocked,” he said. “The global cross-border payments market is huge and there is a significant opportunity to modernize this market beyond the outdated SWIFT network.” Garlinghouse noted that the regulatory change in the US has already started to increase local interest in Ripple. He explained that since President Donald Trump’s election, Ripple has signed more deals in the US in the six weeks it has done in the previous six months. “These are very innovative technologies in terms of how they will reorganize the financial infrastructure of the United States for 10 to 20 years,” he explained, adding: “From payments to real estate and securities transactions, crypto is poised to reshape these industries.” Despite the positive momentum, Garlinghouse also said regulatory clarity is needed. Lawmakers including Senator Cynthia Lummis and Representative French Hill are working to define clear distinctions between cryptocurrencies, which are classified as commodities and securities. “Providing clear guidelines will allow financial institutions to engage with crypto with greater confidence,” Garlinghouse said. “The US has lagged behind global leaders in this space, but the tide is turning and we need to invest in our domestic industry.” *This is not investment advice.

42288022,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142851,1742856609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Whale’s Colossal $213M Binance Withdrawal Sparks Market Speculation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-binance-withdrawal/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The ever-watchful eyes of the blockchain have spotted a significant movement. A Bitcoin whale, a term we use for individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, has just executed a massive withdrawal from one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, Binance. Let’s dive into what this colossal transaction entails and what it might mean for the volatile crypto market. Decoding the Whale’s $213M Binance Withdrawal: What Happened? According to the eagle-eyed blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, a crypto whale initiated a withdrawal of 2,425 BTC from Binance within a mere 10-hour window. At current valuations, this staggering amount of Bitcoin is worth approximately $213 million. That’s not pocket change, even in the crypto world! Here’s a quick breakdown: Transaction: Withdrawal of Bitcoin (BTC) Amount: 2,425 BTC Exchange: Binance Value: Approximately $213 million (USD) Reporting Source: Lookonchain (via X, formerly Twitter) Timeframe: Within 10 hours It’s important to understand that these large transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, making them visible to tracking services like Lookonchain. This transparency is a core feature of blockchain technology, allowing us to observe these significant financial maneuvers in near real-time. Why Does a Massive Bitcoin Whale Transaction Grab Headlines? You might be wondering, “So what? People move money around all the time.” And you’d be right. However, in the crypto sphere, particularly with Bitcoin, whale movements are closely scrutinized for several key reasons: Market Impact: Large Bitcoin holders possess the power to influence market prices. Selling off a substantial amount of BTC can potentially trigger price drops, while moving it to cold storage might be interpreted as a long-term bullish signal. Market Sentiment Indicator: Whale activity is often seen as a barometer of market sentiment. Are whales accumulating, suggesting they anticipate price increases? Or are they distributing their holdings, perhaps signaling a potential downturn? Early Warning Signals: Monitoring whale transactions can sometimes provide early hints of broader market trends or shifts in investor confidence. However, it’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions. A Binance withdrawal of this magnitude doesn’t automatically guarantee immediate market chaos or a sudden price surge. There are numerous reasons why a whale might move such a large sum. Decoding the Intent: What’s Behind This Binance Withdrawal ? Speculation is rife whenever a significant crypto transaction occurs. Let’s explore some potential reasons behind this Bitcoin whale ‘s $213 million move: Possible Reasons Potential Market Interpretation Cold Storage: Moving BTC to a secure, offline wallet for long-term holding. Potentially bullish; suggests long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. OTC Deals: Preparing for over-the-counter (OTC) trades, which are large, private transactions typically executed outside of exchanges. Neutral to slightly bullish; indicates significant private market activity. Diversification: Shifting funds to other cryptocurrencies or asset classes. Potentially bearish for Bitcoin if the whale is reducing BTC holdings in favor of alternatives. Regulatory Concerns: Moving funds due to evolving regulatory landscapes in certain jurisdictions. Mixed; could be bearish if perceived as a lack of confidence in exchange security or regulatory compliance, but could also be neutral if simply proactive risk management. Personal Reasons: Whales, like any investors, have diverse financial strategies and needs. The withdrawal could be for personal or business-related purposes unrelated to market speculation. Neutral; no direct market signal. As you can see, deciphering the exact motivation behind a whale’s move is often guesswork. Without direct insight into the whale’s intentions, we’re left to analyze the transaction within the broader context of the crypto market . Navigating Market Speculation: Market Impact of Whale Moves The immediate market impact of this Binance withdrawal remains to be seen. While large withdrawals can sometimes precede periods of price stability or even upward movement (if interpreted as a move to long-term storage), they don’t always dictate immediate market direction. Here’s what to keep in mind regarding potential market reactions: Broader Market Conditions: The overall health of the crypto market, macroeconomic factors, and global events play a much larger role in price fluctuations than individual whale transactions. Exchange Flows: It’s important to look at net exchange flows – are more Bitcoins flowing into or out of exchanges in general? This provides a broader picture of market sentiment. Order Books and Liquidity: The depth and liquidity of Bitcoin order books on exchanges will influence how easily large sell orders (if any were to follow this withdrawal) could be absorbed without causing significant price slippage. Media Narrative: How news outlets and social media interpret and amplify this event can also influence short-term market reactions, regardless of the underlying fundamentals. Key Takeaways: What Does This Mean for You and the Crypto Market ? So, what should you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, make of this $213 million Bitcoin whale withdrawal from Binance ? Stay Informed, Not Alarmed: Whale transactions are part of the crypto ecosystem. Stay informed about these movements, but avoid knee-jerk reactions based solely on single transactions. Look at the Bigger Picture: Analyze whale activity in conjunction with broader market trends, news, and technical indicators. Don’t isolate this single event. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never make investment decisions based solely on headlines or speculation. Conduct thorough research and understand your own risk tolerance. Volatility is Inherent: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Whale movements are just one factor contributing to this volatility. In conclusion, while the $213 million Bitcoin whale withdrawal from Binance is undoubtedly a noteworthy event, it’s essential to view it within a balanced perspective. It’s a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the constant interplay of various factors influencing price movements. Keep your eyes on the market, stay informed, and remember that responsible investing involves careful analysis and a long-term perspective.

42288413,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142854,1742857206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Grim Inflation Forecast: Federal Reserve Warns 2% Target Delayed Until 2027,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/grim-inflation-forecast-fed-2027/,"Are you bracing for continued economic uncertainty? Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic has delivered a sobering update on the battle against inflation, suggesting the fight will be longer and harder than previously anticipated. For those navigating the volatile cryptocurrency markets, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is crucial. Let’s dive into Bostic’s concerning inflation forecast and what it could mean for you. Dashed Hopes: 2% Inflation Target Pushed to 2027 In a recent statement that has financial markets buzzing, Raphael Bostic indicated that the Federal Reserve’s cherished 2% inflation target is unlikely to be achieved until early 2027. This is a significant revision, pushing back previous estimates and signaling a more persistent inflationary environment than many had hoped for. Previous Expectations vs. Reality: Earlier projections suggested a return to the 2% target sooner, but persistent inflationary pressures are proving more stubborn. Bostic’s Stance: Despite the extended timeline, Bostic reiterated the importance of reaching the 2% goal, underscoring the Fed’s commitment to price stability. Impact on Crypto: Prolonged high inflation can erode the purchasing power of fiat currencies, potentially making assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more attractive as hedges. Interest Rate Cuts: Fewer and Further Between? The prospect of interest rate cuts has been a closely watched indicator for investors across all markets, including crypto. Bostic’s latest remarks suggest a recalibration of expectations regarding monetary policy easing. Initially, the market anticipated two rate cuts this year. However, Bostic now suggests that only one rate cut is likely. This reduced pace of easing reflects the ongoing struggle to tame inflation. Here’s a breakdown of the evolving outlook: Timeline Previous Expectation Current Outlook (Bostic) 2024 Rate Cuts Two One Inflation Target 2% Earlier than 2027 Early 2027 Fed Response to Economic Weakness Aggressive easing Responsive easing This shift in expectations could influence cryptocurrency markets. Higher interest rates typically make riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, less appealing compared to safer, yield-bearing investments. Conversely, anticipation of rate cuts can fuel bullish sentiment in the crypto space. The Federal Reserve’s Balancing Act: Economic Outlook and Inflation Bostic’s comments reflect the delicate balancing act the Federal Reserve is currently undertaking. The central bank is tasked with managing inflation while also ensuring the health of the broader economy. The economic outlook remains uncertain, and the Fed must navigate these choppy waters carefully. According to Bostic, the Fed remains data-dependent and will respond as needed if the economy weakens. This suggests a flexible approach, but the primary focus appears to be firmly on controlling inflation, even if it means delaying rate cuts and potentially slowing economic growth. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors: Monitor Inflation Data: Keep a close watch on inflation reports (CPI, PCE) as these will heavily influence the Fed’s decisions and market reactions. Interest Rate Sensitivity: Understand how changes in interest rate expectations can impact crypto asset valuations. Higher rates can create headwinds, while lower rates can provide tailwinds. Economic Resilience: Assess the overall economic outlook. A weakening economy could prompt a more dovish Fed stance, potentially becoming positive for risk assets like crypto in the medium term, despite initial negative reactions to growth concerns. Long-Term Perspective: Bostic’s 2027 inflation timeline is a long-term forecast. Crypto investors should maintain a long-term perspective, considering that short-term volatility is inherent in these markets. Navigating the Economic Headwinds: What’s Next? President Bostic’s revised inflation forecast serves as a stark reminder that the fight against rising prices is far from over. The path to the 2% target is proving to be longer and more arduous than initially hoped. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, this economic backdrop requires careful consideration and strategic planning. The reduced likelihood of aggressive interest rate cuts in the near term means that the environment may remain challenging for risk assets. However, the inherent characteristics of cryptocurrencies, such as their decentralized nature and potential as inflation hedges, could still make them attractive in the long run. Staying informed, adapting to evolving economic data, and maintaining a balanced investment approach will be key to navigating these uncertain times.

42288670,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-eyes-1-milestone-as-eth-shib-face-tough-hurdles-ahead-of-2025-mainnet-launch/,1742857224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/42288670.jpeg,BlockDAG Eyes $1 Milestone as ETH & SHIB Face Tough Hurdles Ahead of 2025 Mainnet Launch,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-eyes-1-milestone-as-eth-shib-face-tough-hurdles-ahead-of-2025-mainnet-launch/,"Recent analysis of Shiba Inu (SHIB) prices reveals ongoing attempts to surpass the $0.00001240 mark. However, consistent selling pressure has managed to keep the price under control. Ethereum (ETH) is also struggling. Since December 2024, it has lost over half its value, leading to concerns about further price drops as traders speculate on the possibility of reaching a new low. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is preparing for its 2025 mainnet launch. The altcoin has seen a remarkable 2,380% increase since its first presale batch. As its network becomes operational, it’s expected to attract significant institutional attention, reduce available supply, and push prices upward. Market experts believe BDAG could reach $1 following the launch, positioning it as a prime crypto purchase today before it escalates further. SHIB Price: Can Bulls Break $0.00001240? Recent Shiba Inu price evaluations point to a crucial period as the price fluctuates within a specific range. SHIB has challenged the $0.00001240 resistance level several times but faced selling pressure, leading to price retractions toward the $0.00001180 support level. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have recently shown overbought conditions, coinciding with price resistance, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests a shift toward bearish momentum. Previous movements indicated a slight recovery when SHIB found support at lower levels. As traders keep an eye on these indicators, the future direction of SHIB prices remains a focal point for market analysts. ETH Price: Has It Hit Bottom? The current price trend for Ethereum indicates continuing uncertainty, with the cryptocurrency lingering near its recent lows. Having shed over 50% of its value since December 2024, ETH faces the possibility of further declines, sparking debates among analysts about whether it has bottomed out. A particular concern is Ethereum’s pricing relative to Bitcoin, which has dropped to its lowest ETH/BTC ratio since mid-2020. If Bitcoin’s value decreases further, it could drag down Ethereum’s dollar value even more. Although some predict a recovery later in 2025, Ethereum’s current market position remains precarious and demands careful analysis. BlockDAG’s Mainnet Launch Approaches—Will It Reach $1 Soon? BlockDAG’s upcoming 2025 mainnet launch signifies its evolution from a successful presale crypto to a fully functional ecosystem. A presale indicates market demand, but a live network demonstrates actual performance. Early adopters have secured over 18.8 billion BDAG coins, contributing to $205 million in total sales, making it one of the largest crypto presales ever. As the launch approaches, substantial BDAG holdings are expected to grow, boosting liquidity. This development moves the altcoin beyond mere speculation, establishing it as a network with tangible utility and a viable economy. Institutional stakeholders typically position themselves ahead of significant market changes, securing their stakes before retail buyers become involved. The transition of BlockDAG to a publicly traded entity is likely to attract considerable capital from venture capitalists and affluent buyers, securing supplies before demand surges. Once BDAG begins trading freely across various exchanges, supply restrictions could tighten further. Large stakeholders are less inclined to sell, decreasing availability and increasing price pressures. Retail buyers who wait for clear signals may encounter much higher entry prices as demand grows and trading volumes increase. The value of BDAG has already increased by 2,380%, rising from $0.001 in its initial batch to $0.0248 in the latest Batch 27. Analysts foresee a significant price adjustment ahead, with projections of reaching $1 by 2025 and potential peaks of over $20 by 2027. BDAG’s current valuation remains a small fraction of its anticipated worth, reinforcing its status as a top crypto to buy today before market dynamics and institutional involvement transform the landscape. Key Insights on SHIB, ETH, & BlockDAG Shiba Inu continues to struggle within a tight range, with analysis indicating repeated challenges at the $0.00001240 resistance. Conversely, Ethereum is still seeking stability. After a 50% fall, its price struggles to establish a definitive low, and while a rebound is possible, the market remains uncertain. BlockDAG, however, is not waiting for the market to stabilize. With a 2,380% increase since its first presale batch, it is outperforming most projects even before its mainnet launch. Once BDAG becomes operational, its value is expected to skyrocket. Market analysts are already targeting a $1 value for 2025, a significant rise from its current price in Batch 27, making BDAG the top crypto to consider purchasing today.

The ETFs are expected to launch later this year, pending regulatory approval and the signing of a definitive agreement. In addition to the ETFs, Trump Media plans to introduce Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) under the Truth.Fi brand. This will provide investors with more tailored investment options. Complementing the Trump Brand With WLFI Still, the ETFs and SMAs will be part of TMTG’s broader financial strategy, which includes an investment of up to $250 million. These funds will be custodied by Charles Schwab, a major financial institution, ensuring a structured and secure investment framework.

Imagine creating a rug that perfectly matches your vision, all through the power of AI! This isn’t just about adding another product line; it’s about democratizing design. Arcade is leveraging the power of models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, making sophisticated design tools accessible to everyone. This move signifies a broader trend of AI integration across various sectors, and for those in the crypto space, it mirrors the decentralized and accessible ethos many projects champion. ‘Match My Room’: AI-Powered Personalization One of the standout features accompanying this expansion is “Match My Room.” This clever tool lets you upload a photo of your room, and the AI platform analyzes the existing décor to generate rug designs that harmonize with your space’s color palette and style. Here’s a quick look at how ‘Match My Room’ enhances the design process: Color Harmony: Ensures your new rug complements your existing furniture and wall colors. Style Integration: AI understands the overall style of your room to suggest suitable rug designs. Visual Preview: Get a visual idea of how the rug will look in your space before making a purchase. While the AI is adept at color matching, it’s worth noting that replicating intricate patterns from existing décor is still a developing area. However, as a tool for ensuring color coordination, ‘Match My Room’ is incredibly useful. This feature embodies the user-centric approach that is becoming increasingly vital in the tech world, much like the focus on user experience in successful crypto platforms. Funding Fuels Future Growth: $42 Million Raised To propel this expansion and further platform development, Arcade has announced a successful $25 million Series A funding round . This brings their total funding to an impressive $42 million. This significant capital injection speaks volumes about investor confidence in Arcade’s vision and potential within the burgeoning AI-driven design market. Here’s a breakdown of what the funding will be used for: Area Purpose Hiring Expanding the team to support growth and innovation. Platform Development Enhancing existing features and developing new AI-powered tools. New Product Categories Expanding beyond rugs and jewelry to include ceramics, pillows, and potentially apparel and leather goods. This funding round was led by prominent investors like Laura Chau from Canaan Partners and Kirsten Green from Forerunner, further validating Arcade’s market position and future prospects. The involvement of such established names highlights the growing interest in AI-powered commerce solutions. Designing Your Dream Rug: How it Works Creating your custom rug on the Arcade AI platform is a straightforward and engaging process: Material Selection: Choose from a range of rug materials, starting with affordable options like hand-tufted wool and extending to luxury materials like cashmere and alpaca. Text Prompt Input: Describe your desired rug design using a text prompt. Think of it as instructing the AI artist. AI Generation: Arcade’s AI, powered by Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, generates rug designs based on your prompt. Sample Approval: Once you’ve chosen a design, Arcade connects you with a manufacturer who sends you a free sample for approval before you commit to a purchase. While prices for rugs start at around $400, Arcade emphasizes offering more accessible luxury compared to traditional high-end retailers. This approach of blending AI-driven customization with accessible pricing could be a winning formula in the evolving e-commerce landscape. More Than Just Design: Dream Boards and Seller Programs Arcade isn’t just about creating and buying; it’s fostering a community of design enthusiasts. The “Dream Boards” feature functions like Pinterest boards, allowing users to curate and share collections of products based on themes. This social aspect enhances user engagement and discovery within the platform. For those looking to monetize their creativity, Arcade offers a seller program. Users can earn a 5% commission on each sale of their designs, up from the previous 2.5%. An affiliate program and an entrepreneur program further incentivize content creators and influencers to participate and earn higher commission rates. This is akin to the creator economy principles seen in many blockchain-based platforms, rewarding users for their contributions. Early Success and Future Categories Despite being in beta for its jewelry offering since September 2024, Arcade boasts an impressive 650,000 jewelry designs generated. While purchase data and seller earnings remain undisclosed, the design generation numbers are a strong indicator of user engagement and the platform’s appeal. Looking ahead, Arcade plans to introduce ceramics and pillows as new product categories, with potential expansions into apparel and leather goods hinted at by founder Mariam Naficy. Chain belts are also mentioned as a near-future addition. This continuous expansion strategy suggests Arcade is aiming to become a comprehensive home goods and lifestyle design platform, powered by AI. Conclusion: The Future of Design is AI-Powered Arcade’s expansion into rug design and home goods is a compelling example of how generative AI is moving beyond niche applications and entering mainstream consumer markets. By combining user-friendly design tools with AI-driven personalization and a focus on accessible luxury, Arcade is positioning itself at the forefront of the future of design and e-commerce.

With Stellar pushing aggressive network upgrades, Tezos launching high-impact community initiatives, and Qubetics flipping the table with real-world asset tokenization, 2025’s crypto scene isn’t just buzzing—it’s blowing up. Community members who’ve been watching from the sidelines are now eyeing which project might actually become the next crypto to hit $1. And with prices shifting fast and narratives evolving daily, it’s time to unpack what’s real, what’s hype, and what could be the most slept-on opportunity this year. While Stellar and Tezos are rolling out new campaigns with bold moves, Qubetics is coming in hot with something totally different. It’s not just another token promising big things—it’s building a complete ecosystem where physical and digital assets can finally break free from the traditional finance bottleneck. The Qubetics marketplace is bridging the gap between blockchain tech and everyday utility in a way that past projects just couldn’t nail. And with its fast-moving presale and jaw-dropping ROI projections, there’s a reason people are saying Qubetics might be the next crypto to hit $1—and sooner than expected. Real Utility in Action: How Qubetics Bridges the Digital and Physical World Qubetics isn’t just another coin trying to ride the wave—it’s solving actual, long-standing headaches in the asset world. Its biggest power move? A tokenized asset marketplace that lets people and businesses fractionalize everything from real estate to rare collectibles into tradable digital tokens. That means more people can now afford to own a piece of previously out-of-reach assets—think: someone in their 20s buying into prime real estate or an independent creator tokenizing intellectual property without needing a middleman. All of this is happening in a secure, scalable environment designed to cater to every type of user. This isn’t theory—it’s infrastructure. Qubetics functions as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, meaning it’s bringing multiple leading blockchains into one unified system. That kind of backend magic translates to fewer silos and more seamless transactions. For example, a local business could tokenize part of its equity for community funding, while a farmer in another country could tokenize commodity yields to gain access to better liquidity. It’s a global fix for a very global problem—and exactly the type of utility play that makes Qubetics a serious contender for the next crypto to hit $1. Qubetics Presale ROI: Why This Might Be the Next Crypto to Hit $1 The Qubetics presale isn’t just active—it’s exploding. Sitting at Stage 27 with a current token price of $0.1300, this presale has already raised over $15.4 million with 503 million $TICS tokens sold and more than 23,700 holders jumping in. Here’s where it gets wild: each presale stage only lasts 7 days, and by every Sunday at 12 AM, the price jumps by 10%. And yeah, you read that right—every. single. week. The return projections are jaw-dropping. If you grabbed $TICS today and it reaches just $1, that’s a 669.13% ROI. At $5? You’re looking at a 3,745.67% ROI. Stretch that to $6 or $10 and you’re talking 4,514.80% and 7,591.33% respectively. And if $TICS hits $15 after the Q2 2025 mainnet launch, we’re talking a legendary 11,437% ROI. For example, if someone drops $100 right now, they’d get 769 tokens. If $TICS reaches $15, that’s a staggering $11,437 return. With the Qubetics presale moving this fast and returns this bold, it’s already being talked about as the best crypto presale of the year—and possibly the next crypto to hit $1 before some even realize what’s happening. Stellar Goes Full Speed with Network Upgrades and Ecosystem Boosts Stellar’s not holding back this year. According to CoinCentral, it’s been pushing hard to make its network faster and leaner. One of the biggest changes includes the implementation of Soroban, a native smart contracts platform designed to elevate decentralized finance and app-building on Stellar. This isn’t some far-off idea—it’s already live, making Stellar’s infrastructure way more attractive to developers who’ve been hesitant in the past. These moves are part of a broader effort to decentralize power and drive user adoption in real-world scenarios. But that’s not the only shift in gear. Stellar has also introduced fee reductions and throughput enhancements, which make transactions not just cheaper, but smoother and way more scalable. These network upgrades come at a critical time when Ethereum gas fees continue to be a roadblock for everyday users. With all of this happening, Stellar isn’t just tweaking things—it’s setting itself up to compete directly with more mainstream smart contract platforms. Tezos’ Trailblazers Program Sets the Stage for Long-Term Impact Tezos has officially rolled out its boldest move yet: the Trailblazers initiative. According to Blockchain.News, this program is designed to onboard creators, developers, and projects into the Tezos ecosystem with a focus on grassroots growth. Backed by a clear $15 million commitment, this campaign isn’t about flashy marketing—it’s about building real infrastructure and user bases from the ground up. The initiative focuses on three main tracks: creative arts, real-world asset tokenization, and DAO tooling—all huge in terms of blockchain’s future. The Trailblazers campaign comes with grants, hackathons, mentorship, and even long-term collaboration opportunities. The network is tapping into talent hubs in North America, Latin America, and emerging markets, helping bring diverse perspectives and regional adoption into the picture. The idea is to expand beyond traditional crypto communities and build meaningful use cases around the Tezos blockchain. With a strong emphasis on user empowerment and ecosystem decentralization, this move could reposition Tezos as not just another smart contract chain, but one of the most forward-thinking platforms heading into 2025. Why All Eyes Are on These Three: The Final Word In a year where every token is shouting for attention, only a few are actually putting in the work. Qubetics is rolling out a real-world marketplace with utility that goes beyond speculation, and its presale numbers and ROI projections alone make it a major contender for the next crypto to hit $1. Stellar, meanwhile, is delivering big-time with smart contract innovations and leaner, faster infrastructure. And Tezos? It’s making grassroots cool again with its Trailblazers initiative, setting the tone for real growth. Whether someone’s watching for long-term development, network upgrades, or explosive entry points, these three are commanding attention. Now might just be the best time to join this crypto presale, especially for those hunting down the best crypto presale, crypto pre sale, or top crypto presale before the wave hits. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics the next crypto to hit $1?

42289259,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142896,1742858459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Workflow Automation: Fair-Code Pioneer n8n Secures $60M Funding,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-workflow-automation-n8n-funding/,"The world of developer tools is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Companies that empower developers to seamlessly integrate AI into their workflows are not just gaining traction; they are experiencing explosive growth. n8n, a startup pronounced “enay-ten,” stands as a prime example. By strategically pivoting its workflow automation platform to embrace AI in 2022, n8n witnessed a staggering 5X surge in revenue, with growth doubling in just the last two months. This phenomenal success has culminated in a fresh injection of capital. Bitcoin World has confirmed that n8n has successfully raised €55 million ($60 million) in Series B funding, valuing the company at approximately €250 million ($270 million), according to sources close to the deal. This significant funding round underscores the immense potential and investor confidence in AI-driven workflow automation solutions. Explosive Growth in AI Workflow Automation Drives n8n’s $60M Funding Based in Berlin, n8n now boasts an impressive portfolio of over 3,000 enterprise clients and around 200,000 active users. This Series B funding round, led by Highland Europe, with participation from HV Capital and existing investors Sequoia, Felicis, and Harpoon, will be instrumental in fueling n8n’s continued technological advancements and strategic expansion into key markets like the U.S., which already accounts for more than half of its user base. While n8n keeps its revenue figures private, the substantial customer numbers, encompassing both free and paid subscriptions, speak volumes about its market penetration and the rising demand for efficient AI workflow automation tools. This funding is a testament to the transformative power of AI in reshaping how businesses approach automation. The Rise of Low-Code and No-Code Automation: n8n’s Fair-Code Foundation Founded in 2019, n8n initially gained momentum by catering to developer teams seeking low-code automation and no-code automation solutions. These solutions simplified the intricate process of connecting diverse applications without extensive coding. However, n8n’s unique appeal extended beyond mere technical utility. The company distinguished itself by championing “fair code,” an evolved concept stemming from open source principles. Fair code ensures that while developers can freely utilize open-source code, commercial applications built upon it adhere to principles that fairly compensate the original creators or the open-source community. Jan Oberhauser, n8n’s founder and CEO, is a prominent advocate for fair code, even managing a dedicated website to promote the concept. This commitment to ethical and community-driven development has resonated deeply within the developer community. AI as a Rocket Ship: How AI Integration Fueled n8n’s Success While n8n’s foundation in fair code and its strong open-source community presence, evidenced by over 70,000 GitHub stars, contributed to its initial growth, the integration of AI acted as a true catalyst, propelling the company into hypergrowth. Workflow automation and AI, particularly generative AI, are inherently synergistic. This synergy is also recognized by n8n’s competitors like Tines and Workato, and broader automation players like UiPath. Generative AI elevates automation by minimizing technical complexities, making it even more accessible than traditional low-code or no-code approaches. It streamlines the process of connecting applications and services, reducing the manual effort involved. Natural Language Workflow Automation: Simplifying Development with AI Recognizing the transformative potential of AI early on, Oberhauser and his team began integrating AI into n8n’s platform about a year and a half ago. Their vision was to drastically reduce the coding burden for developers by enabling them to express automation instructions in natural language. Instead of writing lengthy code to perform tasks like sending emails, users can now simply use natural language prompts. Oberhauser describes it as, “It’s a prompt to build workflow.” For instance, users can input instructions like, “get information from X and send it to Y,” and n8n’s AI-powered platform translates this into functional workflow automation . This intuitive, natural language interface significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developers and accelerates the automation process. Fair Code and Community: Pillars of n8n’s Innovative Approach N8n’s product architecture is designed to be compatible with various Large Language Models (LLMs), offering users flexibility and interoperability. This allows users already leveraging specific LLMs to seamlessly integrate them with n8n’s platform. Furthermore, n8n thrives on a vibrant and extensive contributor community. Active on platforms like GitHub and community forums, these contributors provide support, share knowledge, and develop and utilize workflow templates. N8n also offers a library of pre-built workflow templates, further accelerating the adoption and ease of use of its platform. This strong community engagement, coupled with the fair code ethos, creates a powerful ecosystem of collaboration and innovation. The Future is Now: Embracing AI for Workflow Automation Despite the initial hype surrounding AI and generative AI, the adoption of n8n’s AI-powered features was initially slow. However, a tipping point was reached last year, coinciding with a broader surge of interest and investment in AI coding tools, exemplified by companies like Poolside, Codeium, and Magic. End-users also began actively seeking practical applications of AI. Ultimately, n8n’s user-friendliness and tangible utility, combined with the AI revolution, solidified its value proposition for both users and investors. David Blyghton, the Highland Europe general partner who spearheaded the investment, emphasized this point, stating, “Everyone is trying to leverage AI but struggling to find practical use cases. The design, scale, and throughput of n8n is what allows people to adopt it.” Oberhauser confirms that market adoption has caught up, with approximately 75% of n8n’s customers now actively utilizing its AI-powered tools. This remarkable adoption rate underscores the transformative potential of fair code and no-code automation , now amplified by the power of AI.

Despite recent price appreciation, investor wariness remains fueled by skepticism towards long-term upside and saturation. Meanwhile, there's a new star in the altcoin world that's causing serious interest. Remittix (RTX)—a use-case-based cryptocurrency with real-world utility—is seeing increased volume and early investment, and now analysts are calling it one of the most promising projects of the year. Dogecoin Price Soars, but Investors are Cautious Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently priced at $0.1828, 7.41% higher. Its market cap is $27.17 billion, and its trading volume is a whopping 111.95% higher at $1.16 billion. Source: Tradingview Despite the volume spike, investors are staying away. Dogecoin's strong reliance on social media trends and meme culture has turned it into a casualty of brutal pullbacks. Although a continued favorite, DOGE's limited utilization and development keeps the majority of serious investors on the sidelines, requiring more than smoke before justifying new positions. Cardano Gains Strength, But Meets Resistance Cardano (ADA ) is currently at $0.7356, having posted a 4.41% price gain. The token's market capitalization is at $25.92 billion, while its volume is up 72.94% at $883.31 million. Source: Tradingview Cardano is picking up steam with volumes rising, but most investors do not want to buy at this stage. Past slow rollouts and failure to gain traction in DeFi have led some to question its potential for growth. Even with strong fundamentals of ADA, it might not be able to produce explosive growth without some enormous new catalyst—leading most traders to look at newer altcoins with greater potential for upside. Remittix (RTX): The Altcoin With Blazing Volume Growth and Real Utility Remittix (RTX) is also among the fastest-growing altcoins of 2024. Priced at $0.0734, only at the moment, the project has already earned $14 million+ and sold over 521 million tokens already in presale. While DOGE and ADA are already considered by some to be legacy coins, Remittix is just getting started—and that’s where the magic happens. It’s a PayFi solution that gives users and merchants across the globe instant, fee-free crypto-to-fiat transactions. Its application is obvious: freelancers, traders, and consumers globally can accept crypto and make fiat payments in seconds, free and instant. That’s why volume is accelerating so rapidly—and why most investors believe that RTX can return 100x in the next cycle. Why Smart Money Is Rotating Into Remittix Instead Of Meme Coins The meme-pump investors may look at DOGE or even new entrants such as POPCAT. But those looking at real adoption and survival are now looking at tokens such as Remittix. It exceeds hype—it provides function. To illustrate, if a freelancer who's working on a project for a U.S. client can receive payment in crypto and simultaneously exchange the funds for local currency via Remittix’s platform, there's no friction. This focus on actual problem-solving is the reason Remittix is gaining speed so rapidly, and why authorities are calling it the most underappreciated altcoin out there. Join the Remittix Presale Before Listings If you are attempting to identify the next altcoin that possesses what it takes to outperform DOGE and ADA, Remittix could be your best bet. Last Word Dogecoin and Cardano remain major parts of the crypto universe, but their potential may be capped by present valuations and a seasoned investor base. Meanwhile, Remittix is taking the lead, expanding rapidly, and addressing actual problems in the world with its PayFi approach. Investors waiting on DOGE and ADA are already piling into RTX—and based on the volume spike, they’re not the only ones. If you are looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2024, Remittix might be the most explosive one to look out for in the times to come. With demand soaring, the Remittix presale is quickly advancing to the next phase. Early access is a special opportunity to buy at low prices before exchange listings drive prices to lofty heights.

And the application process for companies wishing to obtain operating permits from the regulatory Financial Services Agency is famously complicated. As such, many larger companies have chosen to buy existing exchanges. They have found that M&A deals can be a faster way to launch than starting their own exchanges from scratch. Examples include the NASDAQ-listed Coincheck , which began life as a small startup. Following a crippling 2018 hack, the firm was later bailed out and then taken over by the securities giant Monex Group.

Just when you thought Dogecoin was all about memes and moon shots, the Dogecoin Foundation has dropped a bombshell that signals serious intentions. They’ve officially announced the creation of a substantial DOGE reserve , purchasing a cool 10 million DOGE – that’s about $1.8 million at current prices! This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a strategic move designed to solidify Dogecoin’s position in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Let’s dive into what this means for DOGE and the future of crypto payments. What’s the Buzz Around the Dogecoin Foundation’s DOGE Reserve? The Dogecoin Foundation , the non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the growth and development of Dogecoin, is stepping up its game. This 10 million DOGE reserve isn’t just sitting idly; it’s a deliberate investment aimed at fostering the utility of Dogecoin. Partnering with House of Doge, a project focused on Dogecoin-centric initiatives, the Foundation is sending a clear message: they’re serious about Dogecoin being more than just a meme coin. They envision it as a practical, fast, and reliable Dogecoin payment solution for everyday transactions. Here’s a breakdown of what we know so far: Significant Investment: A 10 million DOGE purchase demonstrates a tangible commitment from the Dogecoin Foundation. Strategic Partnership: Collaboration with House of Doge suggests a coordinated effort to build Dogecoin’s ecosystem. Payment Focus: The initiative is explicitly designed to promote Dogecoin as a viable payment option. Future Announcements: House of Doge hints at upcoming strategic partnerships, suggesting further expansion and integration plans are in the works. Why a Reserve for Dogecoin Payments? You might be wondering, why a reserve specifically? Well, it’s all about building confidence and infrastructure. A dedicated DOGE reserve can be utilized in various ways to support the Dogecoin ecosystem and encourage its use as a Dogecoin payment method. Think of it as a war chest ready to be deployed for initiatives that drive adoption. Here are some potential benefits of establishing this reserve: Funding Development: The reserve could be used to fund development projects aimed at improving Dogecoin’s technology, speed, and scalability. Incentivizing Adoption: It could support programs that incentivize merchants and businesses to accept DOGE as payment. Community Initiatives: The funds could be directed towards community-led projects that promote Dogecoin awareness and usage. Stability and Liquidity: While not its primary purpose, a reserve can contribute to market stability and liquidity in certain situations. DOGE Price Reaction and the ETF Hype: What’s Next? The market reacted positively to the news, with DOGE experiencing a 10% surge, reaching $0.19. However, it’s crucial to keep things in perspective. Despite this recent bump, DOGE is still down 40% over the past four months. The volatility of the cryptocurrency market is always a factor, and while this news is positive, sustained growth requires more than just announcements. Adding another layer of intrigue to the Dogecoin narrative are the three DOGE ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) filings currently under review by the SEC, as reported by The Block. The potential approval of a DOGE ETF could be a game-changer, opening the doors to institutional investment and broader market accessibility. DOGE ETF Filings Under SEC Review: Factor Potential Impact of DOGE ETF Approval Institutional Investment Increased capital inflow from institutional investors seeking crypto exposure. Market Accessibility Easier for traditional investors to invest in DOGE without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Price Volatility Potentially reduced volatility due to larger, more stable investment flows (though crypto volatility is inherent). Mainstream Legitimacy Further validation of Dogecoin as a legitimate digital asset within the financial system. Dogecoin’s Bold Move: A Sign of Maturing Cryptocurrency? The Dogecoin Foundation’s initiative is more than just a positive headline for DOGE; it reflects a broader trend within the cryptocurrency space. As the market matures, we’re seeing a shift from purely speculative investments towards projects with tangible utility and real-world applications. Dogecoin, often seen as the quintessential meme coin, is now actively seeking to solidify its position as a practical payment solution. This reserve is a concrete step in that direction. Key Takeaways: Utility is Key: The focus is shifting towards cryptocurrencies with real-world use cases beyond just trading. Foundation Support Matters: Active foundations are crucial for driving development and adoption within crypto ecosystems. ETFs are a Catalyst: Regulatory developments like ETF approvals can significantly impact market growth and accessibility. Community and Meme Power: Dogecoin’s unique community and meme-driven origins remain a powerful asset in its journey. Conclusion: Is Dogecoin Barking Up the Right Tree? The Dogecoin Foundation’s launch of a 10 million DOGE reserve is undoubtedly a significant development. It signals a serious commitment to making Dogecoin a viable Dogecoin payment option and moves beyond its meme coin origins. While challenges remain, and the volatile crypto market always presents uncertainties, this initiative, coupled with potential ETF approvals, paints a potentially bright future for Dogecoin. Whether this bold leap will truly propel DOGE to mainstream adoption remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Dogecoin is not just sitting back and memeing – it’s actively building and evolving.

The financial products will bear the Truth.fi brand and are expected to appear this year in the United States and abroad. The financial products will be known collectively as America-First Investment Funds and available through Crypto.com’s broker-dealer Foris Capital. They will include funds tracking cryptocurrency as well as “securities with a Made in America focus spanning diverse industries such as energy,” according to a statement . America-First financial products come in a few flavors The ETFs will be launched alongside Truth.Fi Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs). SMAs are managed portfolios created to meet an investor’s specifications. TMTG will invest up to $250 million in the ETFs and SMAs.

Once launched, these ETFs will be available on the Crypto.com App for our more than 140 million users around the world.” Cronos (CRO) is the Crypto.com governance token. CRO traded at $0.080 early on March 24, reached a peak of $0.099 at 11:30 p.m. GMT and settled down to $0.095 at the time of writing.

As its price increases and trading volumes soar, everyone is asking how much a $1,000 investment in Ripple (XRP) today will be worth in five years' time. Alongside XRP, analysts are closely watching Remittix (RTX) , an emerging payment-focused altcoin already making waves. With low entry pricing and strong fundamentals, could RTX outperform XRP over the long haul? XRP Price Prediction: Is $10 Realistic By 2029? Ripple (XRP) is currently trading at $2.46, up 3.02%, with a market cap of $143.61 billion. Its daily trading volume has climbed 65.44% to $3.25 billion, reflecting a resurgence in demand. XRP has been the default blockchain for cross-border financial transactions for a while. With clearer regulatory footing and restored institutional and banking attention, experts are optimistic about its next five years. Conservative forecasts have XRP at $5–$10 by 2029. A $10 XRP price means an investment of $1,000 today turns into roughly $4,000 good growth but not life-changing wealth. Remittix (RTX): The 100x Early-Stage Altcoin Remittix (RTX) is taking the world by storm as one of the most talked-about altcoins in the payment industry. Built on a PayFi model that enables instant, fee-less crypto-to-fiat settlements, RTX has a specific use case for freelancers, digital enterprises and consumers at large. Priced at just $0.0734, Remittix has already raised $14+ million in funding and sold more than 521 million tokens in its presale. Whereas XRP is pushing institutional corridors, Remittix is solving for the individual, allowing users to get paid in cryptocurrency and exchange it to fiat in real-time without intermediaries. Analysts believe RTX has the fundamentals and timing to potentially return up to 100x over the course of the next five years, making it one of the top early-stage altcoins of 2024. $1,000 in Remittix vs XRP: What Could It Be Worth In 2029? A $1,000 investment in XRP today could realistically be worth $3,000-$5,000 in five years if adoption continues to increase and it moves into double digits. Not bad but it pales in comparison to what's available with Remittix. If RTX moves from $0.0734 to even $7, a $1,000 investment today would be worth $95,000. At more ambitious projections of $10+, you're looking at six-figure returns. This enormous potential, combined with Remittix's working payment product, is why traders are calling it this cycle's XRP but with better timing for entry. Why Smart Investors Are Preferring Utility-Driven Altcoins Like Remittix Problem-solving tokens work better. XRP demonstrated as much by making payments center stage but Remittix is rewriting the script with a retail-facing, instant-use experience. With outrageous remittance fees still affecting millions of individuals globally, Remittix offers a low-fee, decentralized alternative. An African or South American freelancer can accept crypto with RTX and trade it for fiat instantly without bank fees or waiting times. That kind of usability is not hype; it's the reason Remittix is receiving serious investment from investors who weren't able to get in on the early XRP, SOL and MATIC runs. How to Buy Remittix (RTX) Before the Price Goes Up Further XRP still has potential, especially as regulatory clarity increases and financial partnerships expand. But its 100x growth days are likely behind it. Remittix, on the other hand, is just beginning. With a clear use case, low token price and expanding presale, RTX could be the best crypto for massive returns over the coming five years. If you're reading this and are wondering where to put your next $1,000 in crypto, consider the token that can turn it into $100,000. Remittix might just be the opportunity you've been waiting for. Remittix is available via its official presale, where early users can get the best rate before exchange listings are launched. With over 521 million tokens sold and increasing demand, the chance to get in early is rapidly diminishing.

A recent survey reveals a compelling trend: a significant majority of financial advisors in the United States are planning to ramp up their exposure to cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a clear signal that the financial establishment is increasingly embracing digital assets, but in a measured and familiar way. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto investment strategy and why financial advisors are turning to crypto ETFs . The Rising Tide of Crypto ETF Investment Among Financial Advisors According to a new report from TMX VettaFi, a noteworthy 57% of financial advisors in the US are set to increase their holdings in crypto ETFs . This data, reported by CoinDesk, stems from a comprehensive survey conducted by TMX VettaFi, a subsidiary of TMX Group. The survey paints a picture of growing confidence and strategic allocation towards digital assets within traditional finance. Interestingly, a substantial 42% of advisors intend to maintain their current positions, indicating a steady belief in their existing crypto allocations. Only a tiny fraction, a mere 1%, expressed plans to reduce their crypto ETF positions. This overwhelmingly positive sentiment underscores a significant shift in how financial professionals are viewing and incorporating cryptocurrencies into their clients’ portfolios. Why the Surge in Crypto ETF Interest from Financial Professionals? What’s driving this bullish outlook on crypto ETFs among financial advisors ? Cinthia Murphy, senior investment strategist at TMX VettaFi, sheds light on the reasons behind this trend. She highlights the appeal of “ crypto equity ETFs ,” which invest in publicly listed companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency industry. Think companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, both frequently cited examples in this space. Murphy points out that these products resonate with advisors because they are “easy to understand and control.” This ease of understanding is crucial for financial advisors who need to explain investment strategies to clients, many of whom may be newer to the world of crypto. Here are some key factors contributing to the increased interest: Familiarity and Regulation: ETFs are well-established investment vehicles with a clear regulatory framework, making them a comfortable entry point into crypto for advisors and clients alike. Diversification within Crypto: Crypto equity ETFs offer diversification by investing in multiple companies related to the crypto ecosystem, rather than directly holding volatile cryptocurrencies. Accessibility and Liquidity: ETFs are easily bought and sold on traditional stock exchanges, providing liquidity and accessibility that direct crypto ownership may lack. Client Demand: Increasing client interest in cryptocurrency exposure is likely prompting advisors to seek out suitable and regulated products like crypto ETFs . Crypto Equity ETFs: A Strategic Avenue for US Market Exposure The focus on crypto equity ETFs is particularly interesting. These ETFs don’t directly hold Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, they provide exposure to the crypto market by investing in companies that are involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This could include: Crypto Miners: Companies involved in the mining of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Crypto Exchanges: Platforms that facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies. Technology Companies with Crypto Holdings: Publicly listed companies that hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets, like Tesla or MicroStrategy. Blockchain Technology Companies: Businesses developing and utilizing blockchain technology across various industries. By investing in crypto equity ETFs , financial advisors can offer their clients exposure to the potential upside of the crypto market while mitigating some of the risks associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership. This approach aligns with a more traditional investment strategy , making it palatable to a broader range of investors and advisors within the US market . Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape: Considerations and Actionable Insights While the survey data is overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial to approach crypto ETFs with informed awareness. Here are some important considerations for both financial advisors and investors: Consideration Details Volatility: Even though crypto equity ETFs offer indirect exposure, they are still subject to the volatility of the underlying crypto market and the performance of the companies they hold. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and related ETFs is still evolving. Changes in regulations can impact the performance and viability of these investments. Company-Specific Risks: Investing in crypto equity ETFs means exposure to the risks associated with the individual companies within the ETF, in addition to broader market risks. Due Diligence: Thorough research and understanding of the specific crypto equity ETFs , their holdings, and their investment strategy are essential before investing. Actionable Insights: For Financial Advisors: Explore crypto equity ETFs as a potential tool to meet growing client demand for crypto exposure in a regulated and familiar format. Conduct thorough due diligence and educate clients about the risks and rewards. For Investors: If you are interested in gaining exposure to the crypto market but prefer a less direct approach, consider researching crypto equity ETFs . Understand the ETF’s holdings and risk profile before investing. Consult with a financial advisor to determine if crypto ETFs align with your overall investment strategy . Conclusion: A Strategic Shift Towards Crypto ETFs The survey data from TMX VettaFi sends a clear message: crypto ETFs are gaining significant traction among financial advisors in the US market . The preference for crypto equity ETFs highlights a strategic and measured approach to incorporating digital assets into portfolios. As the crypto landscape matures and regulatory clarity increases, we can expect this trend of institutional and advisor adoption of crypto ETFs to continue. This is not just about chasing hype; it’s about smart, strategic allocation in a rapidly evolving financial world. The increasing interest from financial advisors in crypto ETFs signals a significant step towards mainstream acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance.

According to House of Doge, the reserve serves as a proof of concept that highlights Dogecoin’s potential for seamless and efficient transactions. “The launch of Dogecoin Reserve is a significant step in House of Doge’s vision to make Dogecoin a fast and reliable payment option for businesses and shoppers everywhere,” the company said in a press release. The initiative includes innovative technology that allows merchants to accept Dogecoin payments instantly at the checkout, eliminating traditional blockchain transaction waiting times and providing the same level of trust as traditional payment methods.

While some predict a potential 300% rally in April, others aren’t convinced the momentum will last. With volatile price swings and limited real-world use, whales appear to be shifting their focus toward emerging utility-driven projects like Remittix (RTX) . As PEPE flirts with breakout territory, investors weigh hype against practical long-term potential. Whale Activity Sparks Speculation Around Pepe Coin’s Next Move Pepe continues to ride the unpredictable waves of meme coin mania. It is currently priced at $0.000007926 and has a hefty 24-hour trading volume topping $611.2 million as of March 21, 2025. After delivering an eye-catching 106.4% rally earlier this month, PEPE gave back some of those gains amid broader market corrections, leaving traders to wonder if the next move is a bounce or a break. Despite the volatility, PEPE remains a favorite among meme coin loyalists, with Pepe price prediction as intense as ever. Its rapid rise and equally swift retracement show just how reactive the token is to internet sentiment and whale activity. Analysts remain split; some, like CoinCodex , predict a strong upswing to $0.000025 by June, representing a potential 200%+ climb. Others, including Changelly , expect PEPE to oscillate between $0.0000094 and $0.0000155, with an average price projection around $0.0000151. This wide range reflects the nature of PEPE itself: a coin fueled less by technical strength and more by cultural momentum. Its value hinges not only on market structure but on the virality it can spark. As April approaches, investors are watching closely to see whether whales double down or begin shifting to tokens with more grounded utility. Either way, PEPE’s meme-powered presence ensures it stays in the spotlight, whether as a 300% gainer or just another missed rocket. Whales Shift Focus From PEPE to High-Utility Tokens Like Remittix While Pepe Coin continues to grab attention with its unpredictable swings, a growing number of crypto traders are quietly shifting focus to a project that offers more than speculation. Remittix (RTX) , a rising PayFi contender, is proving that blockchain can do more than entertain it can solve real-world problems. Designed to streamline cross-border transactions, Remittix enables instant crypto-to-fiat transfers straight into bank accounts, eliminating delays, conversion headaches and unwanted scrutiny from financial gatekeepers. With institutions tightening their grip on how money moves, demand is rising for tools that allow users to stay in control. Remittix stands out for letting individuals send crypto while the receiver gets a standard bank deposit, with no traceable link back to a blockchain transaction. That’s a big deal in regions where banking restrictions are heavy or where financial autonomy is at risk. The market seems to agree. With over $14 million already raised and RTX tokens still priced at $0.0734, the presale has quickly become one of the most watched in 2025. Analysts are forecasting an 800% surge before launch, with post-listing projections climbing even higher. Pepe price prediction remains a heated subject and while PEPE fans debate whether another 300% run is possible in April, early Remittix backers are already positioning themselves for what could be a 10x breakout.

The official also sees asset-backed stablecoins as a means to potentially resurrect the gold standard. Alexander Shokhin, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs ( RSPP ), is convinced that no government would like to see its sovereign rights as a money issuer challenged but recognizes the general consensus in Russia that crypto can be employed in cross-border payments. Business lobby group urges Russian government to consider using cryptocurrencies The authorities in Moscow should analyze the prospects for using cryptocurrencies in light of President Donald Trump’s decision to establish a strategic reserve of Bitcoin and other digital coins in the U.S. The head of the RSPP expressed this opinion in an interview released on Sunday. The organization, over which Shokhin presides, promotes the interests of businesses in the Russian Federation and is one of the oldest lobby groups in the country. It was founded in 1991 when it succeeded the USSR’s Scientific and Industrial Union. Speaking to the Tass news agency, he described cryptocurrencies as an “encroachment on the sovereign rights” of governments to issue money, adding that no central bank would want to face competition from other money issuers without the ability to control the issuing. “But it seems that it has long been agreed that crypto can be used in cross-border settlements,” Shokhin remarked at the same time. He pointed out that in the context of the financial restrictions imposed on Russian business entities, cryptocurrency has found its place among payment instruments. “Well, after Trump said that the United States will now become the crypto capital of the world and is already accumulating crypto reserves, so to speak, at least in Ethereum and Bitcoin, we also need to look at it somehow,” the lobbyist elaborated. Shokhin backs idea of launching settlement system with stablecoins and gold Alexander Shokhin emphasized that Russia should approach the matter carefully, avoiding the establishment of other money issuing centers while at the same time exploiting the benefits of using digital financial assets, including to conduct international settlements. The RSPP executive further highlighted that this possibility has been addressed within proposals to create a new payment and settlement system, alternative to the U.S. dollar-based system and using stablecoins tied to different assets. He suggested that Russia could think about creating a payment and settlement system similar to the International Monetary Fund’s special drawing rights but one introducing additional assets and reserves in the form of gold. “That is, in a sense, returning to the gold standard and to exchange-traded commodities with prices that have been stable for 10 or more years. Such calculations are being made,” the official revealed in the interview. Some officials in Russia still hoping for a crypto reserve President Trump’s initiative to set up a cryptocurrency reserve with bitcoin and other coins seized by the authorities in the United States was met with little enthusiasm by policy makers across Europe, including the Russian Federation. Governor of the Central Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina made it clear she didn’t see any circumstances under which cryptocurrency could enter the monetary authority’s reserves. The Ministry of Finance “has not heard about the creation of a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies in Russia,” Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev was recently quoted as stating. Nevertheless, the idea has had its backers in Russia. In December, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev urged the finance ministry to assess the feasibility of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. And last week, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, Evgeny Masharov, proposed forming a government crypto fund to keep digital assets confiscated in criminal proceedings.

Solana (SOL) prompts speculation for its potential massive growth but Remittix continues to gain momentum through its successful funding campaign that sold over 521 million tokens for $0.0734 each and raised more than $14 million. The big question is: which of these two will truly deliver a massive rally in 2025? Solana’s Recent Recovery and Key Levels SOL/USD Hourly Chart (Binance). Source: TradingView. Image shows SOL breaking the $140 key resistance The Solana price experienced a 7% increase during one day leading to its position at $141.69 after a difficult March period. Technical signals indicate a potential market correction after the token succeeded in breaking above two benchmarks starting from $137 before reaching $140. The Relative Strength Index in the hourly timeframe recently crossed 80 levels indicating overbought territory where price drops may soon occur. Technical analysts believe $137 will function as an entry point for additional buying if the price returns to that level. The price falling beneath $137 marks a potential trend change yet many investors plan to monitor Solana because the token might return to previous levels after dropping. A sense of precaution remains necessary because the Fear & Greed Index demonstrates a wariness level positioned at 31 or 45 according to different information sources. A limited price increase is expected due to bear market conditions since investors remain hesitant about market trends. Some Solana price forecasters predict it will reach between $112 and $179 in the next month but other analysts expect the token to rise beyond these levels in a long-term perspective. A hypothetical 60x growth requires Solana to expand into an intense bull market that may be catalyzed by increasing user engagement and major institutional backing and strategic partnerships. Introducing Remittix: The 60x Contender The past performance levels of Solana remain unattainable as RTX altcoin maintains increased investor interest through its payment solution. Through this new project users can exchange digital assets directly to local currency while the system focuses on building user-friendly transaction features for daily use. To provide market-accessibility Remittix integrates cryptocurrency with traditional finance through an efficient payment system which avoids time-demanding processes while eliminating high fees. User numbers on the platform would expand quickly through payment provider connections with remittance businesses. The pre-sale phase of Remittix succeeded in collecting more than $14 million through sales exceeding 521 million tokens at each token costing $0.0734. Analysis indicates that broad acceptance of Remittix will lead to a 60x rise in token value like what has occurred during successful market adoption. New market demand will generate significant value increases for Remittix because its market capitalization remains lower than Solana. How Remittix Could Outshine Solana The extensive features of Solana including its chain reliability and numerous dApps and institutional attraction sometimes act as both advantages and disadvantages in the crypto space. Large systems need extended periods to reach new dimensions while facing overwhelming competition because their advancement depends mainly on developer participation. The Remittix platform exists to let users change crypto into fiat currency in short periods while skipping complex learning or multiple exchange steps. The solution's basic operation potentially attracts many more users swiftly while excluding those users who dislike complex multi-exchange activity. Due to its low price below $1, Remittix appeals to investors who want to benefit from projects with small market capitalization. The projection for Remittix usage growth by some analysts makes a 60-times price increase plausible since straightforward altcoins with consumer-focused value propositions historically experience strong adoption. The supporters of Remittix suggest its single-step solution provides better marketing potential alongside simpler explanation when compared to more complex chain technologies. Conclusion Solana blockchain maintains its position as a promising platform thanks to its strong fundamentals yet uncertainty exists regarding its ability to reach the 60x extensive price target of. The coin’s success likely hinges on consistent development, developer loyalty, and a broader crypto bull run. The digital token to real payment feature operated by Remittix functions smoothly with minimal formalities. New network participants could join under the proposed cryptocurrency-to-cash exchange method thus creating achievable conditions for achieving a 60x increase.

42290762,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=717484,1742860805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42290762.jpeg,The Cyclicality Of Bitcoin: What The Cyclical Crests Say About A BTC Top,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/the-cyclicality-of-bitcoin/,"Tony “The Bull” Severino, a well-followed crypto analyst, recently took to the social media platform X to share a detailed breakdown of Bitcoin’s historical price behavior. The analysis uses a cyclical lens that many in the crypto community (both bulls and bears) agree holds significant relevance. Notably, Tony Severino focuses on the concept of Bitcoin’s four-year cycles and how troughs and crests have consistently marked the periods of greatest opportunity and greatest risks for investing in Bitcoin. This analysis comes in light of Bitcoin’s recent price correction below $90,000 in March. Cycles Define Sentiment: From Troughs Of Opportunity To Crests Of Risk Severino’s analysis starts from a foundational belief shared across the crypto industry. The widely-held belief is that Bitcoin operates in clearly defined cycles, usually lasting around four years, mostly in relation to its halving cycles. His technical outlook is based on Bitcoin’s cycle indicator on the monthly candlestick timeframe chart that goes as far back as 2013. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? Why A Fall To $63,000 Is Possible If This Resistance Holds As shown in the chart below, Bitcoin has gone through four definitive cycles in its history. These cycles, he explains, should be viewed from “trough to trough.” The troughs are the darkest moments in the market, but they also represent the point of maximum financial opportunity. As these cycles progress, Bitcoin transitions through periods of increasing optimism, eventually arriving at what the analyst calls the “cyclical crest.” These crests, highlighted in red in his chart, are the periods where Bitcoin has reached its point of maximum financial risk. This is relayed in the ensuing price actions, with the Bitcoin price topping out right after passing each cyclical crest. Bitcoin passed through its crest in the current market cycle just before reaching its all-time high of $108,786 in January 2025. If past cycles are any indication, the coming months could reveal whether a top is already in. Right-Translated Peaks: Is BTC Running Out Of Time In This Cycle? Bitcoin has been on a correction path since February and is currently down by 20% from this $108,786 price high. The Bitcoin price has even gone ahead to correct as low as $78,780 in the second week of March, triggering reactions as to whether the crypto has already reached its peak price this cycle. Related Reading: Inverse Head And Shoulders Breakout Suggests Bitcoin Price Is Headed To $300,000 However, Bitcoin might not be in the woods yet, as not all crests are followed immediately by market tops. Severino pointed out that past cycles have featured “right-translated” peaks where Bitcoin continued to rise slightly even after crossing the crest. The 2017 bull run was the most right-translated, with price action staying strong for some time after the red-zone crest. In contrast, other cycles began reversing not long after reaching this point of maximum risk. Bitcoin appears to have already passed the red crest based on Severino’s model, but this does not confirm a top is in just yet. Instead, it means that the margin for error is rapidly narrowing. The longer BTC continues to correct after this point, the more elevated the risk of a bearish phase becomes. BTC is attempting to regain bullish momentum at the time of writing, trading at $87,300 after rising 3.6% in the past 24 hours. Many other analysts argue that the Bitcoin price could still chart higher territory this year before a definitive top is confirmed.

A transfer involving 167M XRP has polarized the community, while Solana’s significant decrease prompts doubts on its ability to maintain critical support levels. Amid these fluctuations, BlockDAG (BDAG) has excelled, amassing over $205.5M in its presale and establishing itself as a significant contender in the cryptocurrency sphere. With an advanced blockchain architecture that resolves longstanding inefficiencies and anticipated listings on 10 major CEXs, could BDAG lead the upcoming surge in crypto advancements? Continue reading to explore. XRP Whale Action Sparks Speculation A recent XRP whale action has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency world. An anonymous entity moved 167M XRP, valued at roughly $367 million, between unidentified wallets. This transaction occurred during a market slump, with XRP’s price falling nearly 5% in the past day. Such large-scale transfers frequently ignite speculation regarding their potential impact on the market. While some view this XRP whale action as a tactical accumulation in anticipation of a market upswing, others see it as a prelude to a major sell-off, possibly leading to further declines in XRP’s price. Keeping an eye on these XRP whale actions is essential for understanding market dynamics and predicting future price trends. Explore the Latest Solana (SOL) Price Prediction Solana (SOL) has recently seen a sharp decline, dropping over 7% in a single day to $118.76, sparking concerns about a possible retest of the $100 support level. This pessimistic view is driven by a decrease in meme coin interest, the release of 11.16 million SOL by FTX’s bankruptcy estate, and general market weakness. Technical analysis indicates SOL breaking below the crucial $136 support, suggesting a bearish trajectory. Analysts believe that if these support levels give way, Solana might approach the $100 mark again, making this Solana (SOL) price prediction vital for market participants. BlockDAG Solves Key Blockchain Challenges—Secures $205.5M! The domain of cryptocurrency has often shifted with the introduction of groundbreaking solutions. Bitcoin pioneered decentralized finance, while Ethereum brought smart contracts into the blockchain ecosystem. Despite their innovations, both platforms face ongoing issues with balancing security, speed, and decentralization—the core blockchain trilemma. BlockDAG has made significant strides in overcoming these hurdles by implementing Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, which allows for the simultaneous confirmation of multiple transactions. This method contrasts with the linear processing of traditional blockchains, enabling BlockDAG to eliminate bottlenecks without sacrificing security or efficiency. Central to this innovation is the Phantom GhostDAG protocol, which offers a level of decentralization that avoids the congestion typical of Ethereum’s network. Moreover, BlockDAG’s design promotes an environmentally friendly Proof-of-Work model, demonstrating that scalability does not need to undermine security or environmental sustainability. This advanced technology has set BlockDAG on a path toward broad adoption in both its infrastructure and community involvement. Having raised $205.5 million, attracted 170,000 unique holders, and witnessed a 2,380% increase in price since its first presale batch, BlockDAG’s progress is evident. With the price now at $0.0248 in Batch 27 and predictions of a rise to $1 post-listing, the upcoming Keynote 3 announcements and 10 CEX listings are expected to boost liquidity and further demand. For those considering the best long-term crypto, BlockDAG represents a formidable option. It addresses fundamental blockchain constraints, and delaying involvement could mean missing significant opportunities. Market Movements in Focus Recent XRP whale action has reignited discussions, with a substantial transfer of 167M tokens causing uncertainty about future market trends. Concurrently, Solana’s significant fall below crucial support levels has prompted discussions on the likelihood of a drop to $100. The instability in these assets keeps the market on alert. Contrasting with this, BlockDAG is advancing steadily, having raised over $205.5 million from crypto presale funding and supported by 170,000 unique holders. Its adoption of Phantom GhostDAG protocol and DAG technology addresses some of the most persistent inefficiencies in blockchain technology. With its price up 2,380% since the initial batch and Batch 27’s rate of $0.0248 quickly increasing, hesitating could mean losing out on what could be an exponential growth phase.

When Bitcoin dominance slows, liquidity flows into high-risk, high-reward assets, and meme coins tend to be the first to benefit. In 2021, Shiba Inu (SHIB) made early buyers rich when millions of retail traders flooded into the market. In 2023, PEPE skyrocketed from obscurity to a multi-billion-dollar market cap in weeks. Now, in 2025, the cycle is starting again. And this time, in a downturn for the wider market at large, early investors are looking at the high-flying presale FloppyPepe (FPPE) instead of Shiba Inu. Why Meme Coin Buying Season Has Arrived Market sentiment plays a huge role in meme coin performance. Historically, meme coins explode when three conditions align: Bitcoin stabilizes, dips, or trends sideways → Investors look for more volatile opportunities. Retail traders re-enter the market during or after a dip → Meme coins thrive on engagement, memes, and community activity. Early-stage projects gain traction before major breakouts → Low market caps and immunity from the market’s rollercoaster allow for exponential upside. Following the dip at the beginning of this week, on-chain data has shown a rise in meme coin wallet activity, with a growing number of new holders accumulating presale tokens. This suggests both Whales and presale adopters are preparing for signs of the next breakout. SHIB vs. FPPE – Which One Has More Upside? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a legend in the meme coin space, no doubt. However, its growth potential in 2025 is limited. In fact, since the turn of the year, SHIB is down more than 35% . SHIB already has a $8 billion market cap. While it can and should still rise again, its potential for 1000x gains is long gone. Burn mechanisms help price action, but they don’t create the kind of viral momentum of newer projects. Its biggest rally happened in 2021. Since then, SHIB has trended downwards to the tune of 85% away from its peak. Clearly, meme coins need new narratives to recapture investor attention. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , on the other hand, is at the earliest presale stage, meaning it has a fraction of SHIB’s market cap and significantly more room to grow. Why FPPE Could Be the Best Pick in This Buying Season Despite appearances, FPPE isn’t a typical meme coin hoping to ride a trend and disappear as fast as it appeared. It’s an AI-powered ecosystem designed to generate engagement indefinitely. Meme-o-Matic AI Generator → Unlike SHIB, FloppyPepe creates viral content automatically. This ensures that it remains relevant in times such as these when the markets cool off. FloppyX AI Agent → Analyzes trends, generates memes, and turns market sentiment into shareable content. A first-of-its-kind tool in the meme coin space. Deflationary Tokenomics → 1% of every transaction is burned, reducing supply over time—something SHIB still struggles to implement effectively. Presale Price Advantage → While SHIB is already trading at a $8 billion market cap, FPPE is still in its first presale phase, offering the lowest possible entry price. What History Tells Us About Buying Early The biggest meme coin gains come from early-stage investments. SHIB’s early buyers saw 70,000,000%+ gains. PEPE’s early adopters turned $100 into six figures in weeks. Dogecoin’s long-term holders became millionaires after years of accumulation. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is in its accumulation phase. This means investors have a rare chance to get in before mass adoption. Meme Coins Reward Those Who Back Themselves Meme coins aren’t usually about utility. They’re about community, momentum, and timing. Right now, early investors are shifting their focus from established names like SHIB to high-upside opportunities like FPPE, whose use of AI could revolutionize how meme coins are perceived in the space. History shows that buying in early meme coin presales delivers the highest returns. And with FloppyPepe integrating AI-driven engagement tools and deflationary mechanics, it could be positioned as the next big meme coin breakout of 2025.

According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, whales in the Bounce ( AUCTION ) market have been greatly influencing the altcoin’s price action for the past week, causing massive swings in both directions. Bounce Finance is a decentralized auction platform enabling auctions for various assets, such as physical assets tokenized on the blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). AUCTION tokens are used for governance, staking, and fees for participating in auctions or creating NFTs on the platform. Lookonchain says that in the last several days, whales sent over 14% of the circulating supply of AUCTION to Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by volume, and OKX. Those deposits presumably led to coins being sold on the open market, which ultimately caused prices to plummet. Says Lookonchain, “AUCTION Whales deposited 1.08 million AUCTION ($48.6 million, 14.26% of the total supply) into Binance and OKX again, causing the price to plummet by 50%. Pay attention to price changes.” Source: Lookonchain/X At time of writing, AUCTION has not recovered, currently trading at $20.93 with a market cap of $137 million. AUCTION is ranked as the 363rd-largest crypto asset by market cap.

This development comes as USDC becomes the first dollar-backed stablecoin approved for circulation under Japan’s stablecoin regulatory framework. Circle’s entry into the Japanese market is facilitated through its local entity, Circle Japan KK, and strategic partnerships, including a joint venture with SBI Holdings. Circle Launches USDC in Japan With SBI According to a recent blog post , Circle has received formal approval to launch the USDC stablecoin in Japan. The approval was granted by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) under the country’s updated stablecoin regulations. USDC is the first and only global dollar stablecoin approved for use in Japan. This sets a precedent for other stablecoins seeking entry into Japan’s regulated financial system. SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, will lead the initial launch of USDC on March 26. The launch will mark the start of the integration of the stablecoin across the country’s digital asset exchanges. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, remarked “We are honored to bring USDC to businesses and consumers in the market, and with Circle Japan KK and the strong support of SBI Holdings and leading exchanges, USDC is positioned as a secure and transparent digital dollar that meets the needs of Japan’s evolving digital economy.” Major Japanese Exchanges Set to List USDC Alongside SBI VC Trade, other major exchanges in Japan are preparing to offer the USDC stablecoin. Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer are among the top exchanges that plan to support USDC trading soon. Consequently, the move will improve the liquidity and availability of the stablecoin within Japan’s digital asset market. These platforms will enable both retail and institutional users to access USDC through regulated channels. The partnerships represent an effort to integrate Circle’s financial infrastructure into Japan’s digital economy. The listings are part of a broader strategy to support the compliant use of stablecoins in payments and settlements. President & CEO of SBI Holdings, Yoshitaka Kitao added, “We believe this initiative will enhance financial accessibility and drive digital asset innovation, aligning with our broader vision for the future of payments and blockchain-based finance in Japan.” Circle’s local presence through Circle Japan KK allows it to work directly with exchange operators. This structure supports regulatory compliance and operational alignment with Japanese financial standards. USDC Utility in Digital Finance Circle’s entry into Japan includes plans to support a wider range of use cases for USDC. These include payments, settlements, cross-border finance, and treasury operations. Additionally, stablecoin issuer will work with financial institutions and technology providers to develop new applications for digital dollars. This effort aims to strengthen the local digital finance ecosystem. Circle is positioning USDC as a fully-reserved, transparent, and compliant stablecoin. The reserves are held in cash and cash-equivalent assets at regulated institutions, with monthly third-party attestations. Meanwhile, the stablecoin issuer recently established a local entity in Dubai to meet regulatory standards and support its operations within the Dubai International Financial Centre.

Rising nearly 2% within the last day, BTC maintains its dominant market position, boasting a total market capitalization close to $1.74 trillion. With nearly 19.84 million BTC circulating from its limited supply of 21 million, investor enthusiasm is evident. On the technical front, the recent symmetrical triangle breakout on Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart signals strong bullish sentiment. Breaking decisively above the critical pivot point of $86,462, BTC surged toward a significant resistance level at $89,024. This rally marks a critical turning point, although BTC has now entered a mild corrective phase, illustrating natural short-term profit-taking. The key level to watch closely is $86,400, as holding this support could catalyze another bullish upswing toward resistances of $90,750 and $92,800. Bullish breakout triggered at pivot $86,462. Current correction at resistance $89,024. Crucial support at $86,400 for bullish continuity.

Ongoing debate has focused on how the coins could be vulnerable to the kind of bank runs that paralyzed the financial system during past financial crises. Bloomberg noted that the Trump administration and Congress were both pushing to cement the growing importance of stablecoins, with two bills designed to give stablecoins a bigger role in the global payments infrastructure already running through the House and Senate. Washington’s interest, including vocal support from President Donald Trump, helped encourage the steady flow of new money into the stablecoins sector—even as other sectors of the crypto industry struggled—bringing the total value to over $230B. However, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that the bill lacked the basic safeguards necessary to ensure that stablecoins did not blow up the entire financial system. She added that the bill allowed stablecoin issuers to invest in risky assets, including assets that were bailed out in 2008. The Reserve Primary Fund broke its intended peg to the dollar as investors lost confidence in the $785M in Lehman Brothers’ debt backing it, which triggered the broader run on money-market funds that spread chaos through the financial system. Stablecoin bill faces systemic bank run risk President Trump’s latest push for stablecoin regulation at the Digital Asset Summit signalled major catalysts ahead for crypto markets. The Senate Banking Committee voted 18-6 on March 13th to advance the bill regulating stablecoin. GC Cooke, the founder and CEO of Brava, claimed that banks were desperately launching stablecoins to save themselves, adding that JP Morgan, Citi, and Charles Schwab knew what was coming. However, Senator Warren expressed less faith in the bill, saying that anyone who thought the U.S. taxpayer would not be called on–whether directly or indirectly–to bail out these guys was kidding themselves. Reportedly, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Financial Stability Oversight Council called attention to these run risks in multiple papers published last year, and various central bankers have spoken about the risks in recent speeches. “If a run on a large stablecoin were to occur, liquidation of the assets backing the stablecoin could be disruptive, especially if those assets were linked to other funding markets.” -Lisa D. Cook, a governor on the Federal Reserve’s board Matthew Bisanz, a financial regulatory partner at Mayer Brown, doubted whether a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin that is denominated in U.S. dollars could be vulnerable to a run because the coin can always pay the redeemer in U.S. dollars. He, however, acknowledged that if those dollars were deposited at a bank and the bank needed to liquidate assets to fund withdrawals by the stablecoin holders, then there could be a run. But that would be the same type of run that could happen to any fractional reserve depository. Lutnick and Bessent say legitimizing stablecoins helps strengthen the U.S. dollar 📣 Congress is hashing out the stablecoin scene while kicking CBDCs to the curb!

If the bill is passed, stablecoin issuers would need to be licensed and back their tokens one-to-one with approved assets like cash, short-term US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and money-market funds. However, a professor emeritus at George Washington University Law School, Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., published a policy report last month calling attention to some of the vulnerabilities that the proposed legislation did not address. Wilmarth pointed out that even safe, short-term US Treasury bills, which would be allowed into reserves in the proposed legislation, were vulnerable to bank runs and had been frozen up during previous crises. He also noted that Circle’s USDC only managed to recover its peg in 2023 after federal regulators stepped in to cover all of Silicon Valley Bank’s uninsured depositors. Former Federal Reserve board member Nellie Liang held a different opinion, saying that the recent amendments to the GENIUS Act would force stablecoin issuers to hold cash-like assets, which should be safe even in the run. She added that reserve assets had to be ‘very safe and very liquid’ for stablecoins to function without causing or posing risk to financial stability, Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Users of the prediction markets platform can now deposit funds into their Polymarket wallet with SOL. Polymarket Unveils Solana Deposits After Integration After weeks of speculation, Polymarket rolled out Solana (SOL) deposits for users of the platform. According to a post on X , users can now fund their Polymarket wallets with SOL, a key upgrade in the quest toward expansion. “Starting today, you can now make deposits into your Polymarket wallet using Solana,” read the announcement. Prior to the integration with Solana, Polymarket users could only fund their accounts with Circle’s USDC stablecoin. The push to embrace SOL deposits aligns with Polymarket’s desire to increase platform activity using a fast-rising blockchain. SOL, the sixth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $71.6 billion, has an active ecosystem that sizzles with activity. Onchain data indicates active wallets reaching 11 million amid rising daily trading volumes for SOL. While Polymarket reached 450,000 monthly active users in early 2025, activity on the prediction market platform has waned. The platform’s integration with Solana will open it to a new demographic beyond stablecoin users. Solana Rallies By 6% Following The Announcement In the minutes following Polymarket’s integration, Solana’s price spiked by nearly 7% to trade at $140. On the seven-day charts, Solana is coasting on a 10% upswing as it puts claims for a steep correction behind it. SOL daily trading volumes have soared by an incredible 143% over the last day to settle at $4.18 billion. Experts are terming the spike as the catalyst for SOL to reach $1,000 after weeks of consolidation. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has backed Layer 1 blockchains over Layer 2 solutions, noting heightened security and speed. Polymarket’s integration follows Yakovenko’s expression of regret over a controversial Solana ad , apologizing to the community for dabbling in “culture wars.” “The ad was bad, and it’s still gnawing at my soul,” said Yakovenko. “I am ashamed I downplayed it instead of just calling it what it is – mean and punching down on a marginal group.” The post Polymarket Integrates Solana, Enables Deposits With SOL appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|Polymarket|Solana (SOL)|Solana Price,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|USDC,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-25 00:57:39

Back in 2021, Solana skyrocketed from around $1.50 to $258, delivering over 16,000% gains. Now, AI-driven analysis is pointing toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a high-upside performer. The project is in Phase 3 presale. Investors acquired are more than 6400 presale tokens to produce a dynamic level of investor support worth $4.5 million. Mutuum Finance Phase 3 has already sold out over 60% of it. Those entering now can expect 200% returns worth $0.06 during the exchange launch period. Investors have a limited period remaining before the phase closes. Analysts predict parabolic gains to $4, positioning MUTM as the next altcoin to experience a Solana-like breakout. Solana’s 2021 Meteoric Rise: A Blueprint for Altcoin Potential In 2021, Solana (SOL) delivered one of the most legendary bull runs in crypto history, skyrocketing from around $1.50 to an all-time high of $258, an astonishing 16,000% gain. This explosive rally was fueled by its high-speed, low-cost blockchain technology, rapid DeFi and NFT adoption, and strong institutional backing. The network’s ability to handle thousands of transactions per second positioned it as a major Ethereum competitor, drawing massive investor interest. Solana’s surge serves as a benchmark for emerging altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which analysts speculate could replicate a similar trajectory if adoption, innovation, and market sentiment align. Mutuum Finance Presale Investors show growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because they continue to support its project development regardless of Cardano’s market performance. During the pre-sale phase investors achieved an outstanding milestone by providing more than $4.5 million in funding for reaching 6400 participants. The token value of Mutuum Finance tokens showed growth during Phase 3 initial stages and continues increasing toward its launch price expectation of $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Lending System Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework which combines Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish straight loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P exchanges because this system represents a superior way of managing worldwide assets. Users benefit from automated security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. Strategic Growth & Community Rewards The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing (staking rewards) mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings of new exchanges will improve inter-user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its first users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to gain traction as analysts highlight its potential for massive growth, mirroring Solana’s historic 2021 rally. More than 6,400 investors have already contributed $4.5 million, and Phase 3 presale has surpassed 60% completion. A limited opportunity remains for investors to secure MUTM tokens at early-stage prices before its expected surge to $4. Act now to be part of the next potential altcoin breakout and participate today.

USDC ( USDC ) will first be listed on the “SBI VC Trade” crypto exchange under a joint venture between its parent firm — Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings — and Circle’s Japanese entity Circle Japan KK, Circle said in a March 24 statement. The news comes three weeks after SBI VC Trade secured an industry-first regulatory approval on March 4 to list USDC under the Japan Financial Services Agency’s stablecoin regulatory framework. Circle is also looking to list USDC on Binance Japan, bitbank and bitFlyer in the near future. Japan’s bitbank and bitFlyer are two of the country’s largest crypto exchanges, having processed more than $25 million each over the last day with over 1.85 million visits to their websites in the last month. The regulatory approval comes after two years of back-and-forth negotiations with regulators, banking partners and industry players, Circle’s Jeremy Allaire said in a March 24 X post. “[This] unlocks tremendous opportunities not just in trading digital assets, but more broadly in payments, cross border finance and commerce, FX,” he added.

Meme coins dominate headlines, and Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) leads a new kind of movement. While classic players like Celestia and Terra Classic continue building solid ecosystems, Pablo is blazing a trail through icy myth-filled realms with deflationary tokenomics and insane ROI. As of now, Pablo’s journey has reached the 16th location—Crystal Cove—and it’s turning heads across the web3 world. The buzz around meme coins is real. The recent surge in tokens like Bonk and TURBO proves there’s serious money behind the madness. Arctic Pablo Coin is tapping into that exact wave—but with something no one else is offering: a mystical, cinematic narrative wrapped in a community-driven ecosystem. It’s not just about buying crypto—it’s about joining a mythic expedition where every token unlocks a story, a location, and a chance to build wealth while exploring Earth’s hidden mysteries. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Meme Coin Adventure Arctic Pablo Coin throws the rulebook out the frosty window in a world flooded with rinse-and-repeat meme coins. Picture this: a lone explorer on a snowmobile slicing through the Arctic tundra, hunting down treasure-filled realms like Crystal Cove, Icebound Bastion, and Forgotten Fjord. Each location unlocks a chapter in a mythical journey—and a new chance for wealth. At the time of writing, Arctic Pablo Coin is priced at just $0.000083, and over $2 million has already been raised. With a launch price of $0.008, early believers are staring at a 9552.41% ROI. Put it this way: a simple $100 investment at this location could transform into $9,638.55 at launch. This isn’t just hype—it’s math. Pablo’s journey is heating up, and this location could close anytime. Don’t get left behind. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin one of the best crypto coins to buy right now isn’t just the narrative (although, let’s be real—it’s legendary). It’s the numbers. With a total supply of 221.2 billion APC tokens, a tightly designed burn mechanism, and a presale divided into exclusive locations instead of stages, Pablo isn’t playing around. Each week, unsold tokens are permanently burned on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), locking in scarcity and potential price pumps. But here’s the real kicker: 66% APY staking. Stake your APC tokens and watch them multiply like penguins in mating season. Staked coins are vested for two months from the launch date—just enough time for your bag to bulk up without lifting a finger. It’s a low-effort, high-reward strategy that turns passive holding into an active growth engine. It’s one of the Best Crypto Coins to Buy. Celestia (TIA): The Scalable Rollup Layer That’s Playing the Long Game While meme coins steal the spotlight, Celestia (TIA) is over here laying the groundwork for an entirely new kind of blockchain future. It’s modular, sleek, and built to solve one of crypto’s biggest headaches: scalability. Currently, TIA is trading around $10.74, and the coin saw massive hype during its airdrop, with many early holders seeing solid returns. Even after the hype cooled, Celestia’s utility-driven architecture continues to make it one of the best crypto coins to buy for serious builders and long-term believers. But here’s the rub—it’s not exactly a playground for degen traders chasing quick flips. Celestia is for those who believe in the evolution of blockchain infrastructure. It’s steady, thoughtful, and designed to scale the web3 world without crumbling under pressure. And while the staking yields and burn mechanics aren’t as splashy as Arctic Pablo Coin’s, Celestia offers an opportunity to get in early on the backbone of a modular future. Think of it like investing in Amazon Web Services before anyone knew what cloud computing was. Terra Classic (LUNC): The Phoenix That Just Might Rise Again No crypto list is complete without a comeback story—and Terra Classic (LUNC) fits that bill like a glove. After the infamous collapse of Terra in 2022, most people wrote off LUNC as dead weight. But a funny thing happened on the way to crypto’s graveyard—Terra Classic refused to die. Fast forward to today, and LUNC is making some real moves. This coin is clawing its way back into relevance with a passionate community, regular token burns, and updated governance structures. It might not have the headline-grabbing presale of Arctic Pablo or the modular tech of Celestia, but it has an army of diamond hands still fighting for a second chance. Currently priced at around $0.00012, LUNC has plenty of room to run. The circulating supply is massive, but consistent burns and revived developer interest are helping trim the fat. The LUNC burn rate has topped 100 billion tokens, showing a serious push from the community to restore its former glory. Still, suppose nostalgia, community strength, and comeback vibes are your thing. In that case, Terra Classic might just belong on a shortlist of the best crypto coins to buy—especially at its current dirt-cheap valuation. Final Thoughts: What are the best crypto coins to buy right now? Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Celestia, and Terra Classic each offer unique value propositions—but one stands out for immediate ROI potential. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just building hype; it’s creating a movement. With a narrative-rich presale model, 66% APY staking, deflationary tokenomics, and the potential for a 9552% return, this coin is rewriting the meme coin rulebook. But only one of these is nearing the end of its current low-price location—and that’s Arctic Pablo Coin. With prices set to rise and this presale location ending any moment, it’s now or never. Join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now and secure your spot in crypto’s next big adventure. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs: What makes Arctic Pablo Coin one of the best crypto coins to buy right now? Arctic Pablo Coin offers a 9552% ROI potential, 66% APY staking, and a narrative-rich presale model that separates it from standard meme coins. How is Celestia different from other crypto projects? Celestia uses modular blockchain architecture to separate data availability from execution, allowing developers to scale without compromise. Is Terra Classic still a good investment in 2025? Terra Classic has revived community engagement and token burns despite its past, offering long-shot potential for high-risk investors. The post Momentum Is Wild, Don’t Blink!

He clarified in another post that the USD1 stablecoin it is not yet tradable, cautioning the community against scams using the same name. The official X page for WLFI has since quoted his tweet with an official warning, which stated that USD1 is not yet tradable and that users need to beware of scams. pic.twitter.com/zXXG3LCESB — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) March 24, 2025 CZ’s warning to his followers Hours before CZ warned users about potential scams linked to USD1, he revealed in a post that the smart contract of the self-proclaimed “World Liberty Financial USD” stablecoin has been deployed on BSC. “Welcome to @BNBChain!” His tweet read . “According to BSCScan, the smart contract was deployed 20 days ago. Build!” He concluded with an applause emoji. World Liberty Financial USD (USD1) on BSCScan. Source: BSCScan The post triggered excitement from users, with many claiming these are just signs that BNB season is about to begin in full swing. CZ’s clarification post came hours later. “I was told since this post, a lot of scammers created coins with the same name. The official USD1 is not tradable yet. Please do not fall for the scams,” it read . It was an attempt to keep his followers, many of whom are greatly influenced by his tweets, safe because even though he referred to it as “the official USD1,” CZ’s comment isn’t an actual indicator that there is an official partnership between Binance and World Liberty Financial. Some users responded to his warning by criticizing his “spontaneous” posting style, pointing out that the community may take his posts completely out of context, which could create misunderstandings. Talks of a WLFI-stablecoin began last year, triggering ethical concerns and complications WLFI, the Trump family-linked crypto project, revealed plans to create and issue its own stablecoin last year October according to sources quoted by Decrypt. The stablecoin is designed to hold a steady value that is pegged to the US dollar, but back in October, when the news first broke, it was revealed the World Liberty team was in the process of determining how to make the financial product safe before bringing it to market. The moves that followed seemed to confirm a potential stablecoin venture, even including the appointment of Rich Teo, co-founder of stablecoin issuer Paxos, as World Liberty’s stablecoin and payment lead. It has been months since then, and it is now about to become a reality despite the concerns. World Liberty is already a very controversial business entity because of its links to the former—and now present—president of the US. However, the thought of Trump and his business partners issuing their own stablecoin is even more controversial as it poses regulatory hurdles spanning securities classification, financial licensing, AML/KYC compliance, reserve transparency, and political sensitivities. For stablecoins to retain their stability, they need to be heavily collateralized. Take popular stablecoin issuer Circle for example; it reportedly holds billions worth of dollar-denominated assets at regulated American financial institutions to back its billions worth of stablecoin, USDC, currently in circulation. Some projects, like Terra, have tried to circumvent this method of fiat collateralization, sometimes by using crypto as a backing, but they have failed. Terra’s method was successful for over a year until UST’s price collapsed to zero in May 2022, wiping out about $60 billion in value and triggering a bloody response from the broader crypto market. More questions about how the USD1 will be promoted to market How WLFI will address the problem of reserve transparency remains to be seen. However, the onboarding of experienced figures in the stablecoin industry like Rich Teo suggests WLFI is aware of the potential challenges. Despite the potential legal and regulatory strife, having its own USD1 stablecoin could offer the World Liberty team huge profits. Like banks, stablecoin issuers rake in cash by reinvesting customer deposits in yield-bearing products like US Treasury bills. Tether, the company behind USDT, reported a record $5.2 billion profit in the first half of 2024 alone. Revenue generated from having its own USD1 stablecoin could boost World Liberty’s future plans, but issuing a new stablecoin in an already saturated field is no easy task. It would require deals with top crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase and Binance, to make the asset available to a large swath of users. However Binance currently has a “strategic commercial partnership” with First Digital Labs, issuer of the fifth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, FDUSD while Coinbase co-issues USDC, the second largest, along with Circle. Notably, another Trump venture, the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) reached a nonbinding agreement with Crypto.com on launching a series of exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded products (ETFs) on Monday. However, there was no mention of any potential collaboration between the projects on any impending stablecoin projects. The importance of stablecoins to the ecosystem has become apparent in the past couple of years. They have become the go-to assets for traders who want to preserve their funds even while the market fluctuates. They can also be used as dollar equivalents in markets where dollars are restricted or inaccessible, making them important bridges between crypto and traditional financial markets.

The projection is based on the breakout of a multi-year “bull flag” formation, traditionally seen in technical analysis as a continuation pattern that may precede upward momentum. This development comes as market participants reassess XRP price role in the broader digital asset landscape. XRP Price Could Hit $1,452 as Analyst Spots Bull Flag Breakout Analyst “Steph is Crypto” took to the X platform to present a long-term bullish chart for XRP price. According to the shared analysis , the Ripple token is breaking out of a multi-year bull flag pattern dating back to 2018. This formation is a continuation signal in technical analysis, pointing to upward momentum after consolidation. The breakout above the downward-sloping channel marks a shift in price structure. Steph suggests that the XRP price could reach as high as $1,452.81 over the coming years. This forecast is based on the length of the initial flagpole projected from the breakout point. More so, “Steph is Crypto” chart indicates that XRP price may now be entering a new phase of movement after years of consolidation. Source: X Expressing his optimistic Ripple price prediction, the analyst added, “I don’t even want to give you this #XRP price target! You’re definitely not bullish enough.” Similarly, a recent report speculate that Michael Saylor could diversify MicroStrategy’s portfolio by allocating $21 billion from Bitcoin into XRP. Analysts suggest such a move could trigger a parabolic rally in XRP price, potentially pushing it toward the $1,000 mark. Additional Technical Breakout Around $2.48 In a recent video update , Steph is Crypto highlighted a second technical breakout. This time, a descending wedge pattern was identified, a structure associated with trend reversals. The XRP price was shown crossing above the wedge’s resistance level, trading around the $2.48 mark. The analyst chart suggested this move could act as an entry point for traders. The projected target from the wedge breakout is $3.36, representing a potential 37.98% gain from current levels. Source: X More so, analyst Dark Defender also shared bullish crypto market sentiments, projecting the top altcoin could reach $77.7 in the current bull cycle. His forecast relies on Exponential Fibonacci levels and Elliott Wave theory, pointing to a multi-phase rally.

The asset has moved past the $87,000 level, gaining approximately 5.2% over the past week and 3.4% in the last 24 hours. This uptick in performance marks a notable contrast to the steady downtrend observed in recent weeks, offering traders renewed momentum and sparking discussions around broader market sentiment. One of the key developments supporting this shift appears to be rising liquidity on major exchanges. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlighted that the amount of ERC-20 stablecoins held on Binance has reached a new all-time high, now surpassing $31 billion. Binance continues to lead in trading volume among centralized exchanges, making this metric particularly important for analyzing near-term price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Shows Stronger Recovery Signs—Upside Move in Focus Stablecoin Accumulation and Investor Sentiment According to Darkfost’s analysis on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, the increasing stablecoin reserves suggest growing confidence among Binance users. These funds may represent capital being positioned for reentry into crypto markets, potentially signaling a wave of buying pressure. Additionally, Binance may be accumulating stablecoins to manage liquidity for ongoing investor demand or hedging strategies. Notably, stablecoin balances on exchanges are often used as an indicator of future market participation. When reserves increase, it typically reflects investor readiness to deploy capital into assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While this trend does not guarantee immediate upward price movement, it generally aligns with improving sentiment and rising demand. 📈Stablecoin on Binance ATH ! The amount of stablecoins (erc-20) available on Binance has just reached a new all-time high, surpassing $31 billion.

These “cost basis” levels represent the average entry price for groups of investors segmented by how long they’ve held their Bitcoin. Monitoring these ranges helps assess which price levels may act as support or resistance in the market. Kesmeci identified four key price bands: $85,000 for holders between 1 to 4 weeks, $89,000 for 3 to 6-month holders, $98,000 for 1 to 3-month holders, and $63,000 for those holding between 6 to 12 months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stuck In A Loop? Here’s Why $87,000 Could Be Crucial These zones are important because short-term investors often react to these levels—either taking profit or exiting when the price approaches their average entry cost.

Don’t Miss Its Soon-Ending Bonus",https://thecoinrise.com/after-pepes-surge-btfd-coin-is-one-of-the-top-new-meme-coins-to-join-in-march-2025-dont-miss-its-soon-ending-bonus/,"In the Wild West of crypto, timing is everything. If you were around during Pepe Coin’s ICO and didn’t hop on board, you probably watched in horror as early buyers laughed their way to the bank. Pepe Coin launched at a tiny fraction of a cent, only to explode into meme coin royalty. The regret? Real. But don’t worry, the universe is handing you a second chance—BTFD Coin. With only one stage left in its presale, BTFD Coin is offering early believers an opportunity that might just rival Pepe’s historic rise. Over $6.41 million raised, 11,500 investors locked in, and the Bulls Squad leading the charge—this might be the meme coin presale you were waiting for. Not to mention, everyone’s hopping in to grab that LAUNCH100 bonus before it expires on March 30th! Is it one of the top new meme coins to join in March 2025 ? Most likely. Pepe Coin: From Underdog to Meme Coin Titan Pepe Coin didn’t just enter the market—it dominated it. Launched at a mere fraction of a penny, this frog-themed sensation skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high that made early buyers ridiculously rich. The secret to its success? Hype, community strength, and a wave of FOMO had everyone scrambling to get in. Listings on major exchanges, viral memes, and a rapidly expanding user base turned this joke coin into serious money. At its peak, Pepe Coin’s market cap soared into the billions, proving that meme coins can be more than just internet jokes—they can be wealth generators. Now, here’s the kicker: Every single person who missed out on Pepe has one thing in common—they wish they had acted sooner. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Meme Coin Movement? Fast forward to today, and another contender is stepping into the meme coin arena: BTFD Coin. Not just another face in the crowd, this token is built with a vision, a community, and a strategy to make waves. At the heart of BTFD Coin is the Bulls Squad, a team of four unique characters symbolizing different investor mindsets. Whether you’re a cautious planner like Nerdy Bull or a full-send investor like Raging Bull, this coin is designed to unite all types of crypto enthusiasts under one banner. Here’s where things get interesting. Right now, BTFD Coin is in Stage 15 of its meme coin presale , priced at $0.0002 per token. Once Stage 16 rolls in, that price will climb, and analysts predict an initial exchange listing at $0.0006. What does that mean for you? A 200% return on investment before the party even gets started. But dream a little bigger. If BTFD Coin follows the same trajectory as Pepe, reaching a potential high of $0.006, that’s a mind-blowing 2900% ROI: A $4,000 investment today at $0.0002 per token would get you 20 million BTFD Coins. At the projected listing price of $0.0006, that stash would be worth $12,000. If BTFD Coin surges to $0.006, that same $4,000 could transform into a staggering $120,000. Why BTFD Coin Stands Out Unlike meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD Coin brings real utility and a strong community. It features high-APY staking rewards, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and a roadmap designed for long-term growth. Plus, with over 71 billion tokens already sold, the demand is undeniable. Final Call: Your Last Chance at One of the Top New Meme Coins to Join in March 2025 BTFD Coin is nearing its final presale stage. With Stage 16 being the last stop before listing, this is the ultimate “buy the dip” moment before the price climbs. If you missed Pepe Coin’s explosive rise, consider this your shot at redemption. The window is closing fast. Don’t be the one wishing you had bought in sooner. Secure your BTFD Coins now and strap in for what could be the next big meme coin breakout.

Reuters reported on March 24 that Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin said his office subpoenaed Robinhood last week to get information on its marketing materials and the number of Massachusetts-based users that traded sports events contracts on college basketball tournaments. Galvin said he was concerned the trading platform was “linking a gambling event on a popular sports event that’s especially popular to young people to a brokerage account.” “This is just another gimmick from a company that’s very good at gimmicks to lure investors away from sound investing,” he added. Robinhood launched a prediction markets hub on March 17 that would be initially available through the Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated prediction platform Kalshi and would feature event contracts on college basketball tournaments and the May federal funds rate. A Robinhood spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the event contracts “are regulated by the CFTC and offered through CFTC-registered entities.” “Prediction markets have become increasingly relevant for retail and institutional investors alike, and we’re proud to be one of the first platforms to offer these products to retail customers in a safe and regulated manner,” the spokesperson said. Robinhood Markets (HOOD) share price remained relatively flat after the close of trading on March 24 after an over 9% jump over the day to close at $48.36, according to Google Finance. Robinhood is up nearly 30% so far this year but has fallen from its Feb. 14 all-time peak of $65.28. Source: Google Finance The CFTC and Galvin’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Event contracts are agreements that allow users to bet on the outcome of essentially anything, from sports games to election outcomes and the price of cryptocurrencies.

Last month, Robinhood scrapped event contracts allowing for bets on the Super Bowl a day after launching the products after the CFTC asked it to. The Massachusetts probe also requested Robinhood hand over internal communications about the decision to roll out the recent college basketball events contracts after the CFTC’s request to stop the Super Bowl contracts. The CFTC also reportedly asked Kalshi and Crypto.com early last month to explain how both of their Super Bowl event contracts complied with derivatives regulations.

The bills together, if passed into law, would clear the way for Arizona to establish strategic digital assets reserves composed of existing assets confiscated through criminal proceedings in addition to newly invested public funds. The Republicans hold a 33-27 majority in Arizona’s House of Representatives, giving both bills a decent chance of passing. Source: Bitcoin Laws However, according to Bitcoin Laws, the final hurdle could be the state’s Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs. Hobbs has a history of vetoing bills before the House, having blocked 22% of bills in 2024 — the highest rate of any state governor. Arizona’s two crypto bills explained The two bills recently approved by Arizona’s House Rules Committee are the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill (SB 1373) and the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025). The Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill (SB 1373) focuses on establishing a strategic digital assets reserve made up of digital assets seized through criminal proceedings to be managed by the state’s treasurer. The treasurer would be limited to investing no more than 10% of the fund’s total value each fiscal year. However, they would also be able to loan the fund’s assets in order to increase returns, provided that doing so doesn’t increase financial risks. The Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025) specifically deals with Bitcoin ( BTC ). The bill proposes allowing Arizona’s Treasury and state retirement system to invest up to 10% of its available funds into Bitcoin. Additionally, SB 1025 would also allow for the state’s Bitcoin reserve to be stored in a secure, segregated account inside a federal Bitcoin reserve, should one be established. Related: US states lead in strategic Bitcoin reserve creation — Will Trump deliver on his BTC promise? While Arizona is now considered to be leading the race to establish a state-based digital asset reserve, several other states are hot on its heels. On March 6, the Texas Senate passed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill (SB-21) by a vote of 25-5. The Texan bill still needs to pass the House and get the governor’s signature to pass into law. Following this vote, a new bill was introduced by Democrat Representative Ron Reynolds to cap the size of the previously uncapped reserve to $250 million. Utah also recently passed Bitcoin legislation , but all references to the establishment of a strategic reserve were removed at the last moment. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma House passed its Bitcoin Reserve Bill HB1203, 77-15 on March 25. That bill will now head to the state’s senate.

The accusation came is the latest episode in a lengthy legal battle and persistent advocacy led by key figures in the crypto community, like Coinbase’s Chief Legal Office, Paul Grewal. Grewal shared a post on X accusing the Treasury Department of attempting to sidestep the legal ruling of the court. He revealed that the announcement of the lifting of the sanctions contain an illegal moot clause, which does not align with legal precedence and fails to prevent a future sanction. The @USTreasury 's response to the unambiguous mandate of the Fifth Circuit on Tornado Cash has been a study in chaos. It's time for the district court to do what was ordered months ago.

Fikre, where the FBI’s removal of a plaintiff from the No Fly List did not prevent legal proceedings, as the court recognized that the agency could reinstate its prior decision at any time. Coinbase CLO accuses U.S. Treasury of attempting legal maneuver Grewal described the Treasury’s legal maneuvering as a “study in chaos”, arguing that the agency is yet to comply with the court’s order. He said: “It’s time for the district court to do what was ordered months ago. Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment on Count 1 must be granted, and TC’s designation must be held unlawful and set aside” The legal battle over Tornado Cash has become a defining case for the cryptocurrency industry testing the limits of the government and regulatory authority over decentralized and open-source technology. While the Treasury’s decision to remove Tornado Cash from the SDN list was a milestone moment, Grewal and other advocates remain concerned that the agency’s actions leave the door open for future restrictions. Alex Pertsev, co-founder of Tornado cash, who was previously arrested in the Netherlands on money laundering charges, was released on house arrest February 2025 after serving 64 months in prison. Co-founder Roman Semenov remains at large, while Roman Storm was arrested in August 2023 in Washington state and has been in a legal battle with the Department of Justice (DOJ) since then. He’s out on a $2-million bail and has seen overwhelming support from personalties and organizations with crypto interests. While this reversal is welcome, it does not go far enough. @alex_pertsev remains under house arrest in Europe for his alleged role in building Tornado Cash. It is time for all charges against him to be dropped. Developers should not be held criminally liable for writing code that… — Perianne (@PerianneDC) March 21, 2025 Tornado Cash’s legal battle with OFAC In August 2022, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash, alleging that it laundered over $7 billion including about $455 million for North Korea’s Lazarus Group. This led to its founders also being charged with money laundering and sanctions violations. Coinbase and other prominent voices in the crypto community launched a lawsuit challenging the Treasury’s actions. In November 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Treasury does not have the legal authority to sanction Tornado Cash, adding that the smart contracts used by the protocol to mask crypto transactions do not constitute property under federal law. The judge, Don Willett stated that “We readily recognize the real-world downsides of certain uncontrollable technology falling outside of OFAC’s sanctioning authority.” However, the sanctions remained until March 21, 2025, when the Treasury announced that it was lifting the sanctions on Tornado Cash and removing it from the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged the evolving technological and legal landscape, stating “Digital assets present enormous opportunities for innovation and value creation for the American people.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

PEPE is at a decisive point, testing its $0.00000650 support level—a zone that could determine its short-term future. A successful hold may invite renewed buying, but a drop could lead to further losses. At the same time, Official Trump (TRUMP) has tumbled by 80%, falling from its high of $74.59 to $13.41. Investors are questioning whether a recovery is even possible. While these projects battle volatility, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention with a key partnership. Its recent collaboration with SpaceDev, a respected blockchain development company, has supercharged its growth. With its presale surging beyond $205.5 million and BDAG priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, many see this as one of the most promising cryptos to buy before it hits the broader market. PEPE Tests a Key Support Zone as Traders Await Its Next Move PEPE finds itself at a crucial support zone near $0.00000650. According to crypto analyst Chandler, this level is make-or-break. If PEPE manages to hold above it, there’s potential for a recovery that could reignite interest among traders. A bounce from this point could trigger fresh buying activity, restoring bullish sentiment. However, if PEPE loses its grip and falls below this support, sellers may take over, driving the price lower. For now, investors are watching and waiting, looking for clear signals before deciding whether to re-enter or stay on the sidelines. TRUMP Coin Plunges 80%—Does It Have a Chance to Bounce Back? Official Trump (TRUMP) has taken a major hit, dropping 80% from $74.59 to just $13.41. This sharp decline has raised concerns about the coin’s future prospects. While some traders still hope for a rebound, the market appears cautious. For TRUMP to recover, it would need a significant injection of buying interest—something that isn’t guaranteed in today’s climate. Some speculate a price rally could push TRUMP to $100 by April 2025, but this remains highly uncertain. Analysts warn that without a major catalyst to renew confidence, TRUMP’s prospects remain unclear, and further declines are not off the table. BlockDAG’s Partnership with SpaceDev Fuels a Surge in Buyer Interest As PEPE and TRUMP navigate uncertainty, BlockDAG is charting an entirely different course. Its strategic partnership with SpaceDev is laying the groundwork for rapid ecosystem expansion. SpaceDev brings extensive blockchain expertise that is set to boost BlockDAG’s efficiency, scalability, and overall adoption. BlockDAG CEO Antony Turner has called this collaboration a major leap forward, while SpaceDev CTO Juan Manuel Sobral sees BDAG as a future leader in blockchain. SpaceDev will play a key role in enhancing BlockDAG’s developer ecosystem, overseeing grants, and optimizing network infrastructure—further expanding BDAG’s potential. These developments are already translating into tangible results. BlockDAG’s presale has exceeded $205.5 million, with batch 27 priced at $0.0248 and selling out fast. Unlike many speculative tokens, BDAG is focused on building a robust blockchain ecosystem, prioritizing real-world use cases and sustainable growth. Analysts suggest BDAG’s upcoming exchange listings could push its price significantly higher, making the current presale one of the last opportunities to buy before the market takes over. What Lies Ahead for PEPE, TRUMP, & BlockDAG? PEPE faces a defining moment. Whether it holds its key support level will shape its near-term direction—either sparking a bounce or inviting deeper losses. TRUMP remains in a steep decline, with little evidence of an imminent turnaround unless market sentiment shifts dramatically. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is in full momentum mode. Its partnership with SpaceDev is paving the way for broader adoption and innovation, and with its presale topping $205.5 million, BDAG stands out as one of the most promising crypto projects heading into 2025. Buyers are flocking to secure BDAG before it lists on major exchanges, positioning BlockDAG as a serious contender for the best new crypto to buy right now .

Dogecoin (DOGE), meanwhile, approaches a decisive support level, sparking discussions about whether a trend reversal is ahead. Amid this shifting landscape, BlockDAG (BDAG) continues its remarkable rise. With its value already up 2,380%, BDAG’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. The BDAG800 bonus, offering an incredible 400% extra coins, is now in its final phase. As the presale nears completion, buyers are seizing this limited-time opportunity before the bonus window closes. Cardano (ADA) Trading Volume Jumps 58% Despite Price Dip Cardano’s trading volume has surged by 58.36% to reach $1.77 billion, even though its price dropped by 9.3% over the last 24 hours. This increase in volume suggests renewed interest from traders, many of whom are either capitalizing on short-term price swings or preparing for a possible price recovery. ADA is now testing a key support zone between $0.73 and $0.80. Market analysts believe that holding this range could be vital for ADA to stabilize and regain momentum. Should buyers maintain their presence at these levels, there’s potential for ADA to push toward resistance at $1.14. If support holds firm, the increased trading volume may indicate strengthening market confidence. Dogecoin (DOGE) Nears Critical Support as Traders Await a Turnaround Dogecoin appears to be nearing an important turning point. After peaking at $0.4846, it has moved through a correction phase. Now, DOGE is approaching the $0.1822 support zone, which could be pivotal for its next move. Technical indicators point to the completion of a wave C pattern—often a sign that a reversal might be close. If DOGE rebounds from this level and the RSI begins to recover, a shift to bullish momentum could soon follow. However, if it drops below $0.0816, the potential for further downside remains. Investors are watching carefully to see whether a trend change is confirmed before anticipating stronger upward movement. BlockDAG’s Presale Momentum Builds as 400% Bonus Nears Expiry BlockDAG’s BDAG800 bonus has attracted major attention, offering buyers an extra 400% in BDAG coins. With the token’s price already up 2,380% since the presale began, excitement continues to grow. So far, over 18.8 billion BDAG tokens have been sold, and the presale has raised more than $205.5 million. Early adopters have seen impressive gains, and with BlockDAG moving toward its $600 million target, the chance to enter at the current price is quickly disappearing. There’s heightened anticipation as BlockDAG prepares to launch on more than ten major exchanges. Analysts are forecasting a $1 valuation by 2025, backed by BlockDAG’s strong presale success and expanding user base. As the BDAG800 bonus window narrows, this could be a final opportunity for buyers to secure additional BDAG before regular rates return. What’s Next for ADA, DOGE, & BlockDAG? Cardano’s recent surge in trading volume suggests active interest, even as it tests critical support. If that level holds, ADA could be poised for a rebound. Similarly, Dogecoin’s proximity to key support offers the potential for a price reversal, though confirmation is still pending. In contrast, BlockDAG’s upward momentum remains strong. With its 400% bonus still in play and exchange listings coming soon, BDAG offers an exciting chance for those looking for future growth. As its presale approaches the finish line, many are viewing BlockDAG as one of the most promising opportunities in the current market.

Gox shuffled a total of 12,000 Bitcoin worth over $1 billion on March 6 and another 11,833 Bitcoin on March 11. Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain said in a March 25 post to X that one of the previous transfers this month ended up in the crypto exchange Bitstamp. Spot On Chain speculates the 893 Bitcoin “sent to the warm wallet will be moved out shortly too.” Source: Spot On Chain Arkham data shows the exchange still holds about 35,000 Bitcoin worth $3.1 billion across wallets it controls. Many speculate significant movements from Mt. Gox could mean creditor payouts are around the corner. Creditors have the option to receive their payouts in Bitcoin. A July 2024 Reddit poll following the exchange’s first payout found creditors were not rushing to sell their Bitcoin payouts. Mt. Gox fell into bankruptcy in early 2014 after suffering an 850,000 Bitcoin loss in one of the biggest crypto hacks ever recorded. Before the security breach, it was the largest Bitcoin exchange, handling around 70-80% of trades. After its bankruptcy in February 2014, a Tokyo court appointed a trustee to manage the bankruptcy proceedings and compensate creditors with the exchange’s assets. Related: Mt. Gox moves $2.2B of Bitcoin, adding to BTC selling pressure However, last October, the trustee in charge of the exchange’s Bitcoin stash extended the deadline , pushing it by a full year to Oct. 31, 2025, claiming many creditors “still have not received their repayments because they have not completed the necessary procedures for receiving repayments.” Last December, Mt. Gox also moved over 24,000 Bitcoin , worth nearly $2.5 billion, to an unknown address after the cryptocurrency hit a milestone of $100,000.

The answer lies in Qubetics ($TICS), an emerging force in the industry that has already secured millions in presale funds. While many tokens promise innovation, few truly deliver— Qubetics is rewriting that narrative as one of the top crypto presale. Meanwhile, Story Protocol is shaping the future of decentralized intellectual property, integrating Claude’s Modular Content Platform (MCP) to streamline content creation. And Helium Network Token (HNT) is rapidly expanding in Mexico, connecting over 2.3 million people through its decentralized wireless network. Qubetics: The Future of Global Transactions Qubetics is a cutting-edge blockchain project designed to redefine financial connectivity. It eliminates the inefficiencies of traditional remittance systems by offering seamless, near-instant cross-border transactions. This means businesses, freelancers, and enterprises can move capital globally without the usual headaches of high fees, slow processing times, and currency conversion limitations. For example, imagine a logistics company needing to pay suppliers across multiple countries. Traditional banking channels would involve delays, high transaction costs, and unnecessary intermediaries. With Qubetics, those transactions are near-instant, with ultra-low fees, eliminating friction and enhancing cash flow efficiency one of the top crypto presale. Qubetics Presale Gains Momentum—Early Participants Secure Massive ROI Potential The Qubetics crypto presale is already making waves in its 27 stage, with over 503 million $TICS tokens sold and more than 23,700 token holders securing their share of this rapidly growing ecosystem. At its current price of $0.1300, those who recognized the potential early have positioned themselves for life-changing returns. The momentum is undeniable—Qubetics has already raised over $15.4 million, and the demand is only increasing as more people realize what’s unfolding. For those who got in early, the potential upside is staggering. Imagine securing $TICS when the presale first began—those early participants are already seeing exponential growth in their holdings. But even at this stage, the potential returns are still massive. A $500 investment at $0.1300 would acquire 3,846 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, that $500 turns into $3,846. If it surges to $10, that same $500 transforms into an incredible $38,460—a staggering 7,591% ROI. With supply steadily decreasing and presale stages advancing, the window of opportunity is closing fast. Once the presale ends, there’s no going back to these prices. Those who secure their position now could be looking at one of the top crypto presale. Story Protocol (IP): Pioneering Decentralized Content Creation Story Protocol is transforming how intellectual property is managed on-chain. By integrating Claude’s Modular Content Platform (MCP), the protocol allows creators to structure and commercialize their work more efficiently. This modular approach ensures that content can be reused, licensed, and monetized across multiple platforms without legal bottlenecks. At ETHDenver 2025, Story Protocol showcased these advancements to a receptive audience, highlighting its commitment to revolutionizing decentralized content ownership. Additionally, the recently updated technical roadmap promises new scalability enhancements, further improving the user experience for content creators looking to leverage blockchain’s potential. Helium Network Token (HNT): Expanding Connectivity in Mexico Helium Network Token (HNT) continues to push the boundaries of decentralized wireless networks. In February 2025, the project secured a partnership with Movistar, one of Mexico’s largest telecom providers, to expand Helium’s coverage to approximately 2.3 million new users. This move positions Helium as a serious contender in the telecommunications industry, challenging traditional centralized providers. Alongside network expansion, the Helium Wallet App received a significant update (v2.11.7), addressing critical bugs and improving the overall user experience. However, price forecasts suggest a potential downtrend, with some analyses projecting HNT could decline from $4.10 to $0.96 by the end of 2025. Why Qubetics Stands Out While Story Protocol innovates in the intellectual property sector and Helium strengthens decentralized connectivity, Qubetics is directly solving one of blockchain’s most persistent challenges—frictionless financial transactions. One of the top crypto presale numbers speak volumes, signaling strong community confidence. With blockchain adoption accelerating, Qubetics is positioned as a crucial infrastructure layer for the digital economy. For those looking to be part of a project that combines real-world utility with groundbreaking financial potential, the Qubetics presale is one event that cannot be overlooked. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other crypto projects? Qubetics is focused on real-world financial solutions, particularly cross-border transactions, offering ultra-low fees and near-instant transfers. How does Story Protocol benefit content creators? By integrating Claude’s MCP, Story Protocol enhances content modularity, allowing creators to monetize their work more effectively on a decentralized network. What is the latest update on Helium Network Token (HNT)? Helium expanded its network in Mexico through a partnership with Movistar, bringing connectivity to over 2.3 million users.

These products will include digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Crypto.com Coin (CRO), along with other securities focused on American industries, such as energy. The launch is expected later this year, pending regulatory approval. Crypto.com will provide the backend technology, custody solutions, and crypto supply. Notably, this is just the latest in a series of crypto projects backed by Trump and his family. They’ve released several NFT collections, memecoins, and even their own DeFi protocol, World Liberty Financial (WLFI). The funds are expected to launch later this year, pending approval, and are expected to be available worldwide, including in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, through existing platforms and brokerages. Despite challenges, Cronos climbed over 18% due to market excitement and momentum. In December, Cronos hit a yearly high after reports of a meeting between the Crypto.com CEO and the U.S. President, along with a legal resolution with the SEC. However, CRO has since dropped 30%. Today’s news has brought new liquidity to the altcoin. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes expressed excitement about partnering with Crypto.com and Yorkville America to launch investment products that focus on supporting American businesses, innovative technologies, and crypto ventures. These funds aim to strengthen the U.S. economy without being influenced by political agendas. Kris Marszalek, co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com, shared that he is proud of the partnership and excited to support the launch of these new ETFs, including the first-of-its-kind basket of tokens, featuring CRO. The ETFs will launch alongside Truth.Fi Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs). Both the ETFs and SMAs are part of TMTG’s financial services strategy, with TMTG planning to invest up to $250 million, managed by Charles Schwab. However, A Cronos ETF could be the biggest political crypto scandal since the TRUMP token. U.S. Presidents are not supposed to be involved in private business, especially with foreigners.

The filing revealed that the Israel-based crypto and stock trading platform brought in $12.6 billion in total revenue and $192 million in net income for 2024. In 2023, it reported $3.89 billion in revenue and just $15.3 million in profit. The numbers show a massive increase year over year. The company hasn’t yet said how much it plans to raise or what the share price will be. That information will come in a later filing when eToro is ready to launch the actual sale. The IPO is being led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS, and Citigroup. Both the company and some of its shareholders are planning to sell shares as part of the offering. eToro shows profit growth as crypto makes a comeback under Trump About 96% of eToro’s revenue in 2024 came from crypto, according to the filing. Crypto prices shot up last year after Donald Trump returned to the White House and took a pro-crypto stance. That policy change helped platforms like eToro, which lets users buy and sell crypto along with stocks, see a surge in demand. Founded in 2007, eToro runs a trading app that allows users to follow and copy popular traders. It has more than 38 million users across 75 countries, based on a recent company statement. The company first tried to go public in 2021 through a $10.4 billion merger with a special purpose acquisition company backed by Betsy Cohen, but the deal was canceled in 2022. Last year, eToro raised $250 million in a funding round that gave it a new valuation of $3.5 billion. That round included investors like ION Group, SoftBank Vision Fund II, and Velvet Sea Ventures. In the U.S., eToro ran into problems with regulators. In September 2024, the company’s American division, eToro USA LLC, agreed to pay a $1.5 million fine and restrict which crypto assets it offered to U.S. customers. The penalty was part of a settlement with the SEC, which accused the platform of operating as an unregistered broker and clearing agency. The company signed a cease-and-desist order but didn’t admit or deny the charges. The filing didn’t include any predictions for 2025 or forward-looking statements. It focused only on past performance. That leaves investors to decide whether the 2024 surge can last, especially since the company is so heavily tied to crypto markets, which are still volatile even under favorable policies. eToro didn’t say how many shares it would issue or what valuation it’s targeting now. But the last known private valuation was $3.5 billion, which is a steep drop from the canceled SPAC deal’s $10.4 billion figure. Whether the IPO beats or matches that number will depend on how crypto performs in early 2025 and how much investors believe in the company’s long-term growth. In a related development, Kraken, another crypto exchange, is also planning to go public, though a bit later than eToro. According to its own SEC filing, Kraken is working with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to raise up to $1 billion in debt ahead of an expected IPO in early 2026. The debt won’t be used to run daily operations. Instead, it will help Kraken expand before it enters public markets. One of the unnamed participants in the talks told the SEC that the final amount could be as low as $200 million, depending on how the talks go. The company is also thinking about raising equity along with the debt, but nothing has been finalized yet. Terms like the structure and total amount may change in the coming months. In a public statement, Kraken said, “We are always exploring strategic paths toward Kraken’s Mission: accelerating the global adoption of crypto. We remain fully focused on investing in this goal.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

As of today, BTC trades at approximately $88,025, representing a 6.2% increase over the past week. This recovery follows a volatile period where the asset experienced significant resistance below the $85,000 price level. While this upward price action has brought renewed optimism to the market, analysts are also highlighting underlying factors that could influence Bitcoin’s near-term direction. One of the most notable trends is a spike in leverage, signaling that derivative traders may be playing a larger role in driving price movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Futures Data Shows Bullish Long/Short Ratio – Details Bitcoin Open Interest Surges, Signaling High-Leverage Activity According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant analyst IT Tech, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) has reached a record high above $32 billion. Open Interest refers to the total value of outstanding derivative contracts—such as futures and options—that have not yet been settled. A rising OI alongside a rising price can indicate growing bullish sentiment, but it can also be a signal of increased risk if the market becomes overly leveraged. IT Tech noted that while the rally has sparked enthusiasm, it comes with a caveat. “High OI combined with rapid price increase often leads to liquidation cascades if the trend reverses,” the analyst wrote. If bulls fail to maintain momentum, over-leveraged positions may be liquidated, triggering a sharp correction. Monitoring sudden shifts in OI and price will be critical in the coming days.

Javon Marks, a technical analyst active on X, suggested that Bitcoin may be in the early stages of another major breakout. “Bitcoin looks to be working on another massive bullish breakout,” Marks said, adding that altcoins could soon follow suit. On the other hand, analyst Ali offered a more cautious outlook, citing the TD Sequential indicator as a potential sign of an upcoming short-term top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Under Threat?

Moo Deng just might. It climbed 3.65% in the last 24 hours, with trading volume popping by nearly 26%. Meanwhile, SPX6900 made a major statement, soaring 23.56% in one day and 67.60% on the week. That kind of surge doesn’t go unnoticed in meme coin land, where sentiment moves like lightning and FOMO drives fast action. But as impressive as these daily swings are, they still pale next to what BTFD Coin is pulling off during its ongoing meme coin presale. With over $6.41 million already raised and more than 71 billion tokens sold, BTFD isn’t just another player—it’s the one commanding the spotlight. Backed by a full Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY staking, and a projected moon price of $0.006, this project is rapidly becoming the hottest name among the best new meme coins to invest in now . BTFD Coin’s $6.41M Presale Has the Bulls Charging What happens when a coin offers 2X tokens, 90% APY staking, a live P2E game, and a projected 2900% ROI? It becomes the most talked-about meme coin presale of 2025. BTFD Coin, now in Stage 15 and priced at just $0.0002, has already raised over $6.41 million. And it’s not slowing down. With only one stage left before listing, early buyers are rushing in to Own the Dip and run with the Bulls. Analysts are already eyeing the $0.006 moon price post-listing. That’s a 2900% climb from today’s presale price. To put that into perspective, if someone threw $5,000 into BTFD at $0.0002, they’d get 25 million tokens. When BTFD hits $0.0006 listing price, that’s $15,000. But if it hits the projected $0.006? That turns into $150,000. That’s life-changing money—off a meme coin that hasn’t even listed yet. And here’s the cherry on top—the limited-time LAUNCH100 code that doubles your tokens. Yes, 2X. Every BTFD purchase before March 30 gets you twice as many tokens. That’s not just a deal—it’s a rocket launcher for returns. Bulls, this is the last chance to stake your claim before the price goes beast mode. Getting in is easy. Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with ETH or BNB, head to the presale page , connect your wallet, enter how much BTFD you want, and hit buy. Be sure to apply the LAUNCH100 code in all caps before finalizing the transaction to activate the bonus. Claim your tokens when the presale ends—and start earning through staking and gaming right away.

The Bitcoin ( BTC ) whale added 2,400 Bitcoin — worth over $200 million — to their stash on March 24, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence said in an X post. Data shared by the firm shows that despite some sales in February, after the latest purchase, the whale holds over 15,000 Bitcoin in its wallet , worth over $1.3 billion, at current prices. “A $1 billion Bitcoin Whale just withdrew $200 million of Bitcoin this morning from Binance,” Arkham said. The whale started acquiring Bitcoin five days ago after selling off its stash when Bitcoin’s price was between $100,000 and $86,000 in February. CoinGeck data shows on Feb. 1, Bitcoin was worth over $104,000, but it steadily declined to hit a low of $78,940 on Feb. 28. Source: Arkham Intelligence The whale movement comes amid a recent Bitcoin price rebound. Bitcoin has been trading $81,000 and $88,000 in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko, with a price surge of 3% on March 24, distancing itself from its $76,900 low on March 11. Bitcoin whale wakes from slumber At the same time, another Bitcoin whale has woken up after eight years of dormancy, moving over 3,000 Bitcoin, worth $250 million, in one transaction on March 22. “His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today — and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years,” Arkham said in a March 22 X post. Another huge Bitcoin holder, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with approximately $11.6 trillion in assets under management, has been steadily accumulating more Bitcoin over the last week as well, according to Arkham. Across 15 transactions, the asset manager bought an extra 4,054 Bitcoin, giving it a total stash of 573,878, worth over $50 billion, data on Bitbo’s Bitcoin treasury tracker shows . BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also led a rally of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, snapping a five-week net outflow streak by clocking a net inflow of $744.4 million. The bulk of net inflows came from BlackRock’s iShares, which recorded $537.5 million, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $136.5 million. Bitcoin whales weren’t the only ones accumulating more crypto. Lookonchain used Arkham data to track a lone Ether whale who added 7,074 Ether ( ETH ) to its stash on March 21, worth $13.8 million. Source: Lookonchain Ether has been moving between $1,876 and $2,097 in the last seven days, CoinGecko data shows . It’s still down over 57% from its all-time high of $4,878, which it hit in November 2021. However, its open interest surged to a new all-time high on March 21, and the number of addresses with at least $100,000 worth of Ether started rising at the beginning of March , from just over 70,000 addresses on March 10 to over 75,000 on March 22.

42298927,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=699164,1742872787,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42298927.jpeg,Bitcoin is just another trade to Wall Street—and it’ll dump it in the end like always,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-is-just-another-trade-to-wall-street/,"According to Standard Chartered, Bitcoin is still just another trade to Wall Street. It’s being grouped with tech stocks and traded like one. It gets picked up when it’s useful and tossed when it’s not. The bank said on Monday that Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq is now around 0.5, and earlier this year, it went up to 0.8. At the same time, its link with gold has collapsed. Since January, that correlation dropped to zero at one point. Now it’s just above 0.2. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote in the report, “Bitcoin trading is highly correlated to the Nasdaq over short time horizons.” He said this trend is why Bitcoin should be looked at as another big tech trade. Kendrick added, “If it were included [in a tech basket], the implication would be more institutional buying as BTC would serve multiple purposes in investor portfolios.” This isn’t new. Wall Street keeps switching how it sees crypto. One month, it’s a tech play. The next month it’s a “hedge against the traditional system.” But Kendrick didn’t deny that hedge idea. He said , “In reality… the need for such hedges is very infrequent.” Standard Chartered adds Bitcoin to tech stock experiment Mag 7B Meanwhile, Standard Chartered has also made up a new index called the Mag 7B. That one takes the Magnificent 7 tech stocks — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — but kicks Tesla out and adds Bitcoin in its place. Kendrick said that since December 2017, Mag 7B outperformed the regular Mag 7 by about 5%. That happened in five out of seven calendar years, even though the lead in 2022 was tiny. On average, Mag 7B returned about 1% more per year than Mag 7. He said the gains weren’t massive but were consistent. He also compared Bitcoin’s volatility to Nvidia’s over a longer period. Since January 20, when Donald Trump took office again, Bitcoin has dropped about 16%, and Nvidia is down 12%. Meanwhile, Tesla has crashed 36%. That’s more like ether, which has fallen 38% in the same time. Kendrick said, “Investors can view Bitcoin as both a hedge against [traditional finance] and as part of their tech allocation.” He added that Bitcoin’s role in portfolios is getting more solid and that this dual purpose might attract more money, especially now that it’s being adopted more by institutions. Volatility from Trump’s tariffs puts Bitcoin under pressure Since Trump started pushing tariffs again, Bitcoin dropped around 5% for the year. Standard Chartered said that’s not surprising, since Bitcoin tends to react to macroeconomic triggers. The bank pointed to two specific patterns: Bitcoin usually moves up when money supply (M2) grows, and down when the U.S. dollar index (DXY) rises. Those two relationships are still active. Traders are now waiting for relief in Q2, hoping that Bitcoin will bounce as the market gets more clarity on tariffs. But the White House has kept markets guessing. U.S. stock futures were flat Monday night, March 24. That came after a day when major indexes had surged on hopes that Trump would scale back his plans. The S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both down 0.1%, while the Dow Jones futures dropped 43 points. The hesitation came after gains earlier that day, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. According to their report, the White House may reduce the scope of the upcoming tariffs, which are supposed to go live on April 2. Morgan Stanley says market bounce won’t last long On the same Monday, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson spoke to CNBC’s Fast Money . He called the current rebound a “low-quality rally.” He said that it started off with a short squeeze, and now it’s being driven by small technicals, like earnings revisions stabilizing in some of the Mag 7 names. Wilson said, “The last couple of days, though, stocks have acted better, and that can take the index higher. How high? 5,900. So, we’re almost there.” The market had a strong start to the week. On Monday, the S&P 500 rose 1.8% and closed at 5,767.57. That’s still about 6% below its record high. The Dow added nearly 600 points, and the Nasdaq Composite went up by more than 2%. The Magnificent Seven were a big part of that rally. Those include Apple, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla. Tesla saw its best daily gain since November. But Wilson doesn’t think that momentum will last long. He wrote in his Monday note that the rally has limits. “Stronger seasonals, lower rates and oversold momentum indicators support our call for a tradeable rally from ~5500,” he said. He also mentioned that a weaker dollar and stabilized earnings estimates from the big tech stocks could bring capital back to U.S. equities. But after that short-term move, he warned, the volatility isn’t going anywhere. Wilson added, “Whatever rally we’re getting now, we think probably end up fading into earnings, into May and June. Then, we’ll probably make a more durable low later in the year.” He blamed the weakness in markets not on tariffs but on fundamentals and technicals. “The reason the markets are lower over the course of the last three or four months has nothing to do with tariffs,” Wilson said. “It’s mostly to do with the fact that earnings revisions have rolled over. The Fed stopped cutting rates. You had stricter enforcement on immigration. You have [Department of Government Efficiency]. All of those things are growth negative.” At press time, Bitcoin was worth exactly $87,722. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Bitcoin hovered near $87,000, leading a broader rally in altcoins. Solana and ETH were also showing strong recovery on Tuesday. Investor sentiments have improved following reports that the White House is considering a more moderate stance on tariffs, easing concerns over potential economic disruptions. The White House is reportedly shifting toward a more “targeted” approach in implementing Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, rather than a broad application. The global cryptocurrency market cap rose to $2.85 trillion, marking a 2.05% increase over the past 24 hours. Trading activity surged, with total market volume reaching $87.37 billion, up 60.12% from the previous day. Bitcoin (BTC) price today Bitcoin traded at $86,866.24 up around 1% in the past 24 hours. The coin’s 24-hour trading range was between $85,890.56 and $88,758.73. Bitcoin’s market dominance slipped by 0.31% over the day to 60.54%. Bitcoin climbed back above $88,000 on Monday, extending its weekend gains as the broader cryptocurrency market moved higher. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted in an X post on Monday that Bitcoin could climb to $110,000 before pulling back to $76,500. Hayes pointed to the US Federal Reserve’s dovish stance on inflation and President Trump’s flexible approach to tariffs as potential catalysts that could ease market concerns and bolster investor confidence. Ethereum (ETH) price today Ethereum (ETH) price was showing a strong recovery on Tuesday. The token was up around 3.5% to trade at $2,063.37. The intraday low and high were $1,990.96 and $2,101.98, respectively. Trading volume for the coin shot up over 72% to $14.5 billion. XRP and SOL price today XRP price was down 0.26%, trading at $2.42 after hitting an intraday high of $2.50. On March 24, CoinShares released its latest Weekly Crypto Asset Flow report, highlighting net inflows into the crypto market for the week ending March 21—the first in six weeks. XRP ranked second, attracting $6.7 million in inflows. The recent inflows may indicate growing speculation on the approval of a US XRP-spot ETF. According to Polymarket, a crypto-betting platform, the likelihood of an XRP-spot ETF approval by December 2025 climbed to 86% on March 24, up from 57% in January.

Gox Transfers $1B in Bitcoin: 10,608 BTC Moved to New Wallet appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange before its collapse in 2014, has been slowly releasing its Bitcoin holdings as part of a long-awaited rehabilitation process. As per data from Spot on chain, the latest move involved transferring 11,501.4 BTC, valued at around $1 billion. This transfer included 10,608 BTC worth $929.7M which was sent to a new wallet. 893.4 BTC worth $78.3M was sent to a warm wallet, which is often used for transactions and could be moved out soon. This follows a previous transfer where 332 BTC ($25.5M) was deposited into the Bitstamp exchange. Given the size of these transfers, there is speculation that the BTC in the warm wallet will likely be moved or sold soon, which could impact the market. [ATTENTION] Mt. Gox just moved 11,501.4 $BTC ($1B) again! This includes 10,608 $BTC ($929.7M) sent to a new wallet and 893.4 $BTC ($78.3M) to a warm wallet. Notably, after Mt. Gox’s previous transfer, 332 $BTC ($25.5M) was deposited into #Bitstamp . It is likely the 893.4 $BTC … https://t.co/8HryhiHSoT pic.twitter.com/NBQtcWSREJ — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 25, 2025 Notably, this is the third significant transfer of funds by the exchange in the past four weeks, which follows Mt. Gox’s earlier moves, where it shuffled a total of 12,000 Bitcoin, worth over $1 billion, on March 6, and another 11,833 Bitcoin on March 11. So far, the latest coin transfers haven’t affected the spot price, unlike earlier this month. This is a big contrast to mid-last year when Mt. Gox’s coin transfers triggered fears of creditor sell-offs, causing major price swings. Many think that the large transfers from Mt. Gox could mean that creditor payouts are coming soon. Creditors have the option to receive their payouts in Bitcoin. A Reddit poll in July 2024, after the exchange made its first payout, showed that most creditors weren’t in a hurry to sell their Bitcoin. This suggests that many are holding onto their payouts rather than cashing out immediately. Mt. Gox began repaying its creditors in July 2024 using its holdings of 142,000 BTC ($11 billion), 143,000 Bitcoin Cash ($47 million), and 69 billion yen ($469 million). Some creditors received payments through Kraken and Bitstamp exchanges. The exchange still holds approximately 35,000 Bitcoin, valued at $3.1 billion, across wallets under its control. However, last October, the exchange pushed back its full creditor payout deadline to October 31, 2025, due to ongoing verification and processing for claimants.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BCH|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 03:24:01

Crypto.com @cryptocom · Follow We are excited to announce that Crypto.com will partner with Trump Media for ETFs, including a first of its kind ETF basket of cryptocurrencies, including #CRO and other crypto assets. crypto.com/en/company-new… 6:38 am · 25 Mar 2025 957 Reply Copy link Read 165 replies According to Monday’s press release , the new products will include digital currencies and securities and focus on diverse industries, including energy. The announcement triggered substantial recoveries for native token CRO. The altcoin broke out of a nearly four-month downtrend after a 25% increase in the past 24 hours, hinting at continued gains. Meanwhile, Crypto.com will ensure custody, support backend tech, and supply digital assets (including Bitcoin, Cronos, and others) for the upcoming ETFs. Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes commented on the development, stating: We aim to create inventive funds incorporating firms that concentrate on rapid growth, technological innovation, and strengthening the US economy, unencumbered by woke nonsense and political posturing. Investors will finally have options that adhere to their principles and that support superior US companies precisely focused on their core businesses. Is a CRO ETF imminent? Cronos coin issuer Crypto.com has witnessed multiple changes lately as it explores new markets. The latest collaboration with Trump Media magnified optimism in CRO due to exchange-traded funds hints. The announcement confirmed that the ETFs will incorporate BTC, CRO, and other digital assets. However, the team clarified that the ETFs will need regulatory approval before launching. Trump Media Group is behind Donald Trump’s social media site Truth Social. Meanwhile, the US president and his family have shown an increased appetite for blockchain technology. Besides their DeFi platform, World Liberty Financial, the team has issued several NFTs and meme tokens. CRO’s bullish breakout The partnership news catalyzed solid rebounds for Cronos. Analyst Cloudscape highlighted that the alt broke out of an almost 4-month low bearish trend, suggesting impressive short-term upswings. Source – Cloudscape on X The daily CRO/USD chart shows the altcoin maintained downtrends since late last year, printing lower lows and lower highs. Nevertheless, a decisive break beyond the descending trendline indicates a momentum shift, with buyers’ edge. CRO changes hands at $0.1014, targeting the resistance at $0.1598. Extended uptrends above this obstacle could trigger substantial gains for the altcoin. However, immediate weakness could mean a false breakout, with CRO failing to steady above the breakout region. Such scenarios might drag the digital asset to the support zone at $0.0705. That would translate to an approximately 30% dip from Cronos’ prevailing price. CRO’s price action Cronos led crypto gainers on Tuesday as it soared nearly 25% to trade at $0.1014. Chart by Coinmarketcap The over 650% increase in 24-hour trading volume highlights renewed investor and trader interest. A confirmed breakout will see the CRO climb towards the key level at $0.1598 – a 36% increase from the current CRO’s price. However, a false breakout might send the token back into the descending channel, leading to prolonged consolidation or significant price dips.

Mark Uyeda, the acting SEC chair, was reportedly the only commissioner who opposed suing Musk over his delayed disclosure of his stock purchase in Twitter, now rebranded as X. According to a report by Reuters, this decision comes at a time when the SEC is dealing with shifting priorities and challenges within the agency. The vote to determine whether Musk should face a lawsuit took place behind closed doors, with Uyeda breaking from the other commissioners who favored legal action. The SEC had formally filed a lawsuit against Musk in January 2025, alleging that he violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose his acquisition of more than 5% of Twitter’s stock in 2022. This failure to file the necessary report allowed Musk to purchase additional shares at artificially low prices, potentially saving him millions of dollars. SEC’s Changing Stance The SEC has been adjusting its approach to regulating cryptocurrency, easing enforcement actions against companies such as Ripple, OpenSea, and Coinbase. This more lenient stance has sparked discussions about the agency’s evolving priorities. Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration has also generated attention. He was appointed by former President Donald Trump to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency, a role designed to streamline regulatory practices. Musk’s relationship with Trump continues to raise speculation about potential influence on regulatory decisions. The SEC’s case against Musk brings to attention the ongoing debate about how securities laws apply to tech executives, particularly in the changing digital asset space. The outcome of this lawsuit could have significant implications for future regulatory actions in the U.S.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 04:03:01

The move signals growing confidence within the company as it eyes a public debut amid a shifting regulatory landscape in the US. Kraken has reportedly enlisted Wall Street heavyweights Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to lead the effort. The fundraising discussions are still in early stages. These two banks are reportedly in talks with additional lenders and financial institutions. Sources told Bloomberg the company may raise as little as $200m. The final amount will depend on market conditions and investor appetite. Kraken didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Crypto exchange Kraken is exploring raising as much as $1 billion in debt ahead of a potential initial public offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter. https://t.co/N3hlbFcu5G — Bloomberg (@business) March 24, 2025 Funds to Support Expansion, Not Operations This debt raise is not meant to cover operating costs, unlike typical emergency funding in crypto. Kraken plans to use the money for growth and expansion. This could include acquisitions, new products and scaling in key markets. Kraken is also said to be weighing an equity raise alongside the debt package. However, no final decisions have been made. Both the size and structure of the capital raise remain subject to change. With Legal Overhang Reduced, Kraken Resumes IPO Readiness Efforts An IPO has been on Kraken’s radar for years. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company is preparing for a possible public listing as soon as Q1 2025 . A more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under President Donald Trump could help clear the path, after prior ambitions were slowed by stricter enforcement under the Biden administration. The company has previously faced legal hurdles, including enforcement actions from the US SEC. Kraken settled one case and saw another dropped without penalties , allowing it to move forward with less regulatory overhang. In a sign of its broader ambitions, Kraken announced just last week it would acquire retail futures trading platform NinjaTrader for $1.5b . That deal, along with the ongoing fundraising discussions, indicates Kraken is preparing to expand its footprint ahead of a potential public listing.

Steve Demetriou wants to turn Columbus into a major Bitcoin reserve hub. His plan could boost crypto adoption, attract businesses, and bring more investment to the Midwest. A strong crypto policy may drive innovation, create jobs, and increase tax revenue, making Columbus a key player in the digital economy.

His proposal allows the state to invest up to 10% of its unused funds in Bitcoin, aiming to strengthen Ohio’s financial future and bring innovation to public treasury management. Ohio needs to be on the cutting edge of cryptocurrency. My bill would establish basic rules and definitions around it so that we can be leaders in the future of finance. pic.twitter.com/pxB0nCvXkn — Steve Demetriou (@steve4ohiohouse) March 24, 2025 Ohio’s Vision for Bitcoin Adoption Demetriou believes that for Ohio to lead in digital finance, it must embrace cryptocurrencies. His bill grants the state treasurer the authority—but not the obligation—to invest in Bitcoin. These funds would come from the general revenue fund, the rainy-day fund, and the trust fund that covers lottery winnings. The move is not just about diversification; it’s about putting Ohio on the map as a crypto-friendly state ready to embrace financial innovation. A Growing Trend Among U.S. States Ohio isn’t alone in this push. Across the U.S., 28 states have proposed similar Bitcoin reserve plans, with 18 actively moving through legislative stages. Fifteen states have already reached discussions in the House of Representatives, while some have hit roadblocks. However, the increasing support for Bitcoin in public funds reflects the growing belief that digital assets have a role in government finance. The federal government is still debating whether to create a national crypto reserve, but individual states are moving ahead. Ohio’s initiative could set a precedent for others, encouraging broader adoption of Bitcoin in public treasury strategies. Bitcoin’s Stability in Question While Demetriou’s bill is structured with strict guidelines to ensure responsible Bitcoin investment. Only cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of at least $750 billion qualify, and currently, Bitcoin is the only one that meets this requirement. Security is a top priority—investments must be held securely in multiple locations, with no smartphone access allowed to prevent cyber threats. Bitcoin’s price fluctuations have raised concerns, but Demetriou sees it as a long-term investment rather than a speculative asset. By integrating Bitcoin into its financial strategy, Ohio is taking a forward-thinking approach, potentially reshaping how governments manage and grow public funds.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 05:10:37

Best New Meme Coins for Significant Returns,https://thecoinrise.com/cheems-and-sudeng-pump-as-btfds-100-bonus-bomb-settles-soon-best-new-meme-coins-for-significant-returns/,"The meme coin market is throwing wild punches again, and if you’re not riding this wave, you’re seriously missing out. BTFD Coin is still promoting its LAUNCH100 bonus, meaning every dollar you invest right now gets doubled in tokens (yes, 2X your coins!). Meanwhile, Cheems is making small but steady moves, and Sudeng is flexing some serious volume. If you’re after the best new meme coins for significant returns , this is your moment. Here’s why BTFD Coin’s 2900% ROI potential has the crypto world buzzing and why Cheems and Sudeng are also turning heads. BTFD Coin: The Only Meme Coin Giving You Double the Tokens! If you’ve been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the perfect time to ape into a meme coin presale, consider this your golden ticket. BTFD Coin is in Stage 15, priced at $0.0002, with only one stage left before the presale ends! It’s already raised over $6.41 million and has over 11,500 holders—and now it’s dropping absolute fire with its referral rewards program and the LAUNCH100 bonus. How BTFD Coin’s Referral System Can Stack Your Bags BTFD Coin is making it rain with its 10% referral rewards, meaning you don’t just get rich investing—you get richer when you bring your friends along. Here’s how it works: Connect Your Wallet on the BTFD presale page and get your unique referral code. Share Your Code with anyone looking to invest. Get 10% of their purchase in BTFD tokens if you rank in the top 20 referrers by month’s end. They get 10% more BTFD on their purchase! Track your earnings and watch your holdings multiply effortlessly. Imagine this—your buddy invests $5,000 in BTFD Coin using your referral. They get an extra $500 in BTFD, and you snag $500 worth of BTFD too. The more people you bring in, the more free tokens you rake in! That makes it one of the best new meme coins for significant returns. BTFD Coin’s Explosive Growth Potential Analysts predict BTFD Coin could hit $0.0006 when it lists, and if momentum kicks in, a $0.006 moonshot isn’t off the table. Here’s how to break this down in cold, hard numbers: Invest $3,000 today at $0.0002 per token = 15 million BTFD tokens. At a $0.0006 listing price, your bag is now worth $9,000 (3X your money!). If BTFD moons to $0.006, your $3,000 turns into $90,000. That’s a 2900% ROI! This presale window is closing fast, and with Stage 16 being the final round, this is your last chance to grab tokens before BTFD Coin lands on exchanges. Cheems: The Meme Coin OG Making Moves Cheems is holding steady at $0.000155, up 0.58% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $395,923. It’s not pulling a Dogecoin-level rally just yet, but the slow and steady growth shows confidence in its longevity. With a circulating supply of 2.55 billion CHEEMS, it’s still flying under the radar. If the community rallies behind it and it secures more exchange listings, it could see higher trading volume and price surges. Right now, it’s a low-market-cap gem that meme coin hunters should keep an eye on among the best new meme coins for significant returns. Sudeng: High Volume, High Potential Sudeng, aka HIPPO, is sitting at $0.004227 with a $42.2 million market cap, which makes it a more established player in the meme coin world. What’s catching attention, though, is its trading volume of $13.5 million in the last 24 hours. That kind of liquidity means investors are actively jumping in, and that momentum could push Sudeng’s price even higher. With a 10 billion HIPPO token supply, Sudeng has positioned itself as a serious meme coin contender, especially if it lands on more major exchanges. Watch this space, because this coin has the volume to make serious moves as one of the best new meme coins for significant returns. Final Thoughts: The Best New Meme Coins for Significant Returns Won’t Last Forever! The meme coin market is heating up, and while Cheems and Sudeng are showing strong potential, BTFD Coin is the ONLY one giving you 2X tokens AND a 2900% ROI opportunity.

This is due to its prolonged consolidation between the $0.695 and $0.75 levels. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Price Prediction Looking at the ongoing price momentum, ADA is likely to see a major rally only if it breaks out of this consolidation; otherwise, the price may continue to experience minor fluctuations. Based on recent price action and historical trends, if ADA breaches the upper boundary of the consolidation and closes a daily candle above $0.756, there is a strong possibility of a price surge of over 12%, pushing it to the $0.85 level. Conversely, if ADA falls below the lower boundary and closes a daily candle below $0.69, it could drop to $0.65 in the coming days. Source: Trading View Additionally, the asset is facing resistance from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. At press time, ADA is trading near $2.42, registering a modest price decline of 0.50% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, the asset recorded a 40% jump in trading volume, indicating heightened participation from traders compared to the previous day. Major Liquidation Levels Despite the ongoing uncertainty and unclear price action, traders appear bullish and are strongly betting on the long side, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at $0.711 on the lower side and $0.742 on the upper side. Over the past 24 hours, they have built $17 million worth of long positions and $3 million worth of short positions, partially confirming that ADA’s price is poised for massive upside momentum. Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, whales and long-term holders seem to be continuously accumulating the asset despite ongoing market volatility, further signaling a potential price reversal. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Teaming with House of Doge, the foundation aims to fund development, encourage merchant adoption, and strengthen the coin’s overall utility. This announcement sparked a 10% price jump for DOGE, though it’s still down 40% in four months.

March 25, 2025 05:28:09 UTC US Stock Market: S &P Concentration Near Historic Highs Despite the recent underperformance of mega-cap names, market concentration remains at extreme levels. The top 10 stocks represent about 36% of the S&P 500’s market cap, surpassing Dot-Com Bubble peaks. Moreover, the largest U.S. stock is roughly 700 times bigger than the 75th percentile stock—a figure not seen since the 1930s.

March 25, 2025 05:25:39 UTC Standard Chartered’s “Mag 7B” Index Outshines Original, Replaces Tesla with Bitcoin Standard Chartered has devised a “Mag 7B” index that swaps out Tesla in favor of bitcoin—delivering higher returns and lower volatility than the original “Magnificent 7” tech index. The bank’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, found that Mag 7B outperformed Mag 7 by about 5% since December 2017 and was less volatile every single year analyzed. By treating bitcoin like a major tech stock, Kendrick says investors could gain both a hedge against traditional finance and a powerful portfolio booster.

The proposed legislation , if enacted, would enable the state to create strategic reserves of digital assets—leveraging both seized assets and public investments. The two bills in question are Senate Bill 1373, known as the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill, and Senate Bill 1025, titled the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. Arizona Crypto Reserve Bills Move to House Floor with GOP Majority Advantage Both bills are now headed to the House floor for a full vote, where the Republican-controlled chamber holds a 33-27 majority, potentially giving the proposals a favorable path forward. SB 1373 outlines the creation of a digital assets reserve composed of cryptocurrencies confiscated through criminal proceedings. Arizona’s state treasurer would manage the fund, with strict investment guidelines. Specifically, no more than 10% of the reserve’s total value could be invested annually. The bill also permits lending the assets to generate returns, as long as financial risks are not heightened. SB 1025 focuses specifically on Bitcoin, allowing the state treasury and retirement system to allocate up to 10% of their available funds into the cryptocurrency. It also includes provisions for securely storing the Bitcoin reserve in a segregated account within a potential federal Bitcoin reserve, should one be formed in the future. JUST IN: Arizona's House Rules Committee passed both Bitcoin Reserve Bills (SB1373 and SB1025), ruling them ""constitutional and in proper form."" The bills have now passed their assigned committees, meaning they should be headed for a full floor vote. pic.twitter.com/6KzJ0kHeI5 — Fiat Archive (@fiatarchive) March 24, 2025 Despite momentum in the legislature, the bills may face a significant challenge at the executive level. Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, has vetoed 22% of bills in 2024 so far—the highest rate among U.S. governors this year. Her stance on the digital asset legislation remains uncertain. Arizona’s efforts put it at the forefront of a broader state-level movement to incorporate cryptocurrencies into public finance strategies. More U.S. States Eye Bitcoin Reserve Other states are following suit. Texas, for example, recently passed its own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill (SB-21) in the Senate with a 25-5 vote. That bill now awaits a House vote and gubernatorial approval. In response, Texas Representative Ron Reynolds has introduced a bill to cap the reserve size at $250 million. Meanwhile, Oklahoma’s House approved Bitcoin Reserve Bill HB1203 with a 77-15 vote on March 25, sending it to the state Senate for consideration. Utah also introduced similar legislation, but the excerpt about establishing a strategic reserve was ultimately removed.

Dubbed “Mag 7B,” this fresh lineup has outperformed the original, delivering higher returns and lower volatility. The move sparks debate over whether Bitcoin deserves a spot alongside the biggest tech giants. A Better Fit Than Tesla? The experiment showed that Bitcoin, with its $1.7 trillion market cap—double that of Tesla—brings a stronger risk-reward balance to the mix. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s global head of digital assets research, noted that Bitcoin is more aligned with the Nasdaq than gold, suggesting it belongs in a tech-heavy portfolio. Since December 2017, Mag 7B has outpaced the original index by 5%, with stronger annual returns in five of the past seven years. On top of that, it was nearly 2% less volatile on average, making it a more stable choice than Tesla. A Growing Role in Institutional Portfolios Bitcoin’s market cap has soared past $1.7 trillion, more than double Tesla’s, making it a strong contender for institutional investments. Its increasing acceptance in global portfolios, especially as both a tech asset and a hedge, reinforces its potential to stand alongside giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Moreover, with the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, trading BTC has become just as seamless as trading major stocks. Kendrick believes Bitcoin now serves multiple roles—both as a hedge against traditional finance and as a key asset in tech portfolios. Market trends are looking good for Bitcoin. Since the Nasdaq is struggling, investors might shift money into Bitcoin. A key U.S. tariff decision on April 2 could also impact the market, and some experts believe Bitcoin could climb toward $90,000, showing its growing role in mainstream finance. Following the news, Bitcoin is up over 3.5% on Monday, pushing the total crypto market cap to $2.9 trillion. Other major cryptocurrencies are also gaining, with Ethereum up 4%, XRP rising 3.2%, Solana jumping 6.5%, and Dogecoin increasing by 3%.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 05:22:24

Gox has recently executed a big transaction by moving a massive 11,501.4 BTC, valued at approximately $1 billion, across two wallets. This is the second big transaction of this scale done by the exchange this month of March. Investors are closely watching the possibility of any major BTC price volatility going ahead. Mt. Gox Moves $1 Billion Worth of Bitcoin As part of the creditor repayment procedure, Mt. Gox, a defunct crypto exchange, is moving its Bitcoin holdings in huge numbers. Earlier on Tuesday, the exchange moved a total of 11,501.4 BTC, worth $1 billion, across two wallets. Details of the transaction reveal that 10,608 BTC (worth $929.7 million) was sent to a new wallet, while 893.4 BTC (valued at $78.3 million) was moved to a warm wallet, as reported by Spot On Chain . Source Spot On Chain This movement follows a previous Mt. Gox transfer, which saw 332 BTC ($25.5 million) deposited into the cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp. Market watchers speculate that the 893.4 BTC sent to the warm wallet may also be moved out shortly, potentially impacting market dynamics. Earlier this month in March, Mt. Gox moved 12,000 Bitcoin when the BTC price was trading around $92,000. Since then, Bitcoin has corrected nearly 7% and is currently flirting around $86,500 levels. The Bitcoin daily trading volumes have surged by a massive 97%, currently at $33.37 billion. BTC Price Volatility Coming Soon? Amid this massive Bitcoin movement by the crypto exchange, there’s a growing speculation of a major BTC price volatility coming ahead. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a critical resistance level for Bitcoin (BTC) at $89,000. This level marks the convergence of the 50-day moving average and a descending trendline stemming from Bitcoin’s all-time high.

The current Bitcoin price prediction shows that bulls might try to restest this breakout again. However, failure to surpass it may result in continued consolidation or a potential pullback for BTC . Furthermore, the analyst pointed out that the Bitcoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently entered the overbought territory.

She made the projection during an interview and repeated it later at the HSBC Global Investment Summit, claiming the growth will come almost entirely from robo taxis, which she believes will drive 90% of Tesla’s future value. Cathie told Bloomberg that her firm, Ark Investment Management, hasn’t even added Tesla’s humanoid robot initiatives into the forecast yet. “We haven’t included that in the valuation,” she said, referring to the company’s work on robotics. She also said Tesla still performs better than China’s BYD in power and range per dollar, even though BYD topped $100 billion in revenue and overtook Tesla in sales. Cathie says robo taxis will drive Tesla’s future value Cathie said her $2,600 forecast was built around the idea that Tesla would dominate the autonomous ride-hailing market, with self-driving taxis making up the bulk of its valuation by the end of the decade. She didn’t name exact rollout dates but said the autonomous taxi platform is still the core trigger for the stock’s future climb. The forecast comes even as Tesla’s actual performance in 2025 tells a different story. The stock dropped sharply this year. Even though it rebounded in the last four trading days to around $278, that’s still far below her expectations. Sales and deliveries have fallen in Europe and China, with no signs of improvement. Meanwhile, political pressure has grown around Tesla CEO Elon Musk, especially after his Department of Government Efficiency cut thousands of jobs across federal and state agencies. Cathie defended her position despite the slump, saying Tesla remains Ark’s largest holding in its flagship ARK Innovation ETF, which held 10% of its $5.8 billion in assets in Tesla as of March 24. That’s lower than the 16% allocation at the end of 2024, but still a big chunk. This shift was documented in Ark’s fund disclosures and confirmed on their website. Back in 2023, Cathie and her analysts predicted Tesla shares would rise to $2,000 by 2027, fueled by market share gains from legacy automakers. Then in July, she said the launch of an autonomous taxi network would push the price closer to $2,600, about ten times where the stock trades now. Her prediction hasn’t changed, even as the company faces slower growth and regulatory battles in multiple countries. Cathie confirms Tesla and Bitcoin are still Ark’s top buys When Bloomberg asked Cathie if she still believed Bitcoin would reach $1.5 million by 2030, she said yes. “It is our view,” Cathie said in a March 18 interview , confirming the estimate is still the same. She said the crypto market is going through a “risk-off” phase right now but added that Bitcoin has been leading risk sentiment for months. Cathie used on-chain analytics to support her view, saying Bitcoin is now halfway through a typical four-year cycle and still moving inside a bull market. She said U.S. deregulation around crypto is key, and that institutions are watching. “They have to have a point of view on this new asset class,” she said. “And by putting it in portfolios, risk-adjusted returns for the whole portfolio go up.” When asked to choose between Tesla, Bitcoin, and Nvidia for buying the dip, Cathie didn’t hesitate. “We’ve been buying Tesla and names that mimic Bitcoin,” she said. She added that Ark has also been adding positions in Coinbase and Robinhood, using what she called a “risk-off grid” strategy to scoop up what she thinks are underpriced bets in the crypto and tech sectors. She said Ark publishes its trades every day and anyone can track where they’re putting money. Right now, that’s going into Tesla, Bitcoin-exposed stocks, and a few select innovation plays. Cathie expects negative quarters and multiple rate cuts Cathie also talked about the macroeconomic picture, saying she believes the U.S. has already entered what she called a rolling recession, even though Treasury Secretary Bessant said earlier this month that the economy isn’t headed for one. “We think we’re already in it,” she said. Cathie explained that the velocity of money is collapsing because people are scared. She pointed to public workers in education and healthcare who are now worried about job security. “The labor force is nervous,” she said, and that fear is causing savings rates to climb and spending to drop. That’s dragging the economy down further. She said this slow-motion decline could open the door for President Trump’s administration and the Federal Reserve to step in with tax cuts and rate cuts. “We think this gives the Fed more degrees of freedom,” she told Bloomberg. She expects quantitative tightening to end, or at least slow down, by the second half of the year. When asked how many rate cuts she sees coming in 2025, Cathie said, “We wouldn’t be surprised to see two or three.” But she added that it could go even further if inflation drops more than expected. She brought up the trueflation index, which she said shows inflation at just 1.65%, way below the CPI’s 2.8%. She listed off key signals: food prices are falling, egg prices are crashing, gas is cheaper, and rents are starting to dip. She said all of this means the Fed might have more flexibility than the market expects. “We could see more than the number I just suggested: two to three,” she said. Cathie also blamed this drop in inflation on deflation coming from innovation, especially from Ark’s five innovation sectors. She called it “good deflation” and said it’s driving down prices while keeping growth alive. She didn’t break down all five areas, but her firm has long invested in AI, robotics, blockchain, DNA tech, and energy storage. Cathie’s rise to fame started during Covid, when she made huge calls on stocks like Tesla, Zoom, and Roku, which exploded during lockdowns. At one point in early 2021, her funds hit $60 billion in assets, driven by retail investors who tracked her every move. That number has shrunk since then, but her bold forecasts certainly have not.

Gox Moves 11,501 Bitcoin in Third Major Transfer This Month",https://coinpaper.com/8175/mt-gox-moves-11-501-bitcoin-in-third-major-transfer-this-month,"Two significant developments in government-held Bitcoin reserves have recently caught the attention of the crypto community. On March 24, the government of Bhutan moved $63 million worth of Bitcoin across three wallets, continuing its strategic approach to cryptocurrency investment. Just a day later, the long-defunct Mt. Gox exchange transferred 11,501 Bitcoin, its third major transaction this month, sparking renewed speculation around creditor repayments. Mt. Gox Transfers 11,501 Bitcoin, Stirring Speculation Around Creditor Payouts Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has once again stirred the digital asset world after initiating a significant transfer of 11,501 Bitcoin, worth over $1 billion at current market prices. This marks the third large-scale transaction the defunct exchange has conducted in less than a month, further fueling speculation that long-awaited creditor repayments may soon begin. The latest activity was flagged by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, which reported the movement on X on March 25. According to Arkham, Mt. Gox sent 893 BTC (approximately $78 million) to a cold wallet identified as “1Jbez” and another 10,608 BTC (roughly $929 million) to a so-called change wallet labeled “1DcoA.” The timing and magnitude of this transaction follow closely on the heels of two earlier significant transfers: 12,000 BTC moved on March 6, and 11,833 BTC transferred on March 11. Combined, Mt. Gox has shuffled over 35,000 Bitcoin in March alone—currently valued at around $3.1 billion. This total still aligns with Arkham Intelligence’s data, which shows that the exchange holds about that amount across its known wallets. Blockchain intelligence firm Spot On Chain also weighed in on the activity, noting that some of the Bitcoin previously transferred this month made its way to the crypto exchange Bitstamp. The firm speculated that the recent 893 BTC sent to a warm wallet could also be moved out soon, possibly toward an exchange or third-party custodian as part of administrative or preparatory steps for redistribution. These transactions come as creditors and market participants continue to monitor Mt. Gox’s wallet movements for signs that repayments are about to commence. Many of the creditors who have waited over a decade since the exchange’s collapse may be inching closer to some form of resolution. The case of Mt. Gox remains one of the most storied and pivotal moments in crypto history. In early 2014, the Tokyo-based exchange filed for bankruptcy after disclosing that it had lost a staggering 850,000 Bitcoin in a now-infamous security breach. At its peak, Mt. Gox was the dominant trading platform for Bitcoin, handling between 70% to 80% of all BTC transactions globally. Since then, a court-appointed trustee has overseen efforts to recover assets and distribute them to affected users. In recent years, several tranches of Bitcoin have been recovered and held securely as preparations for eventual reimbursement gained momentum. However, the path has been slow and riddled with complications. In October 2024, the trustee pushed the repayment deadline by a full year to Oct. 31, 2025. The stated reason was that “many creditors still have not received their repayments because they have not completed the necessary procedures for receiving repayments.” Sell or Hold? Even as Mt. Gox inches closer to disbursing funds, there is growing consensus that many of its creditors may opt to hold their Bitcoin rather than sell. A Reddit poll conducted in July 2024, shortly after the exchange’s first minor distribution, found that a significant number of creditors were not in a hurry to liquidate their assets, citing both emotional and strategic reasons. While the influx of billions in Bitcoin has raised concerns about potential market pressure and volatility, the actual impact might be muted if most creditors choose to hold their tokens. Still, the possibility of a sudden wave of sell-offs cannot be entirely dismissed. In December 2024, Mt. Gox moved over 24,000 BTC—then worth nearly $2.5 billion—to an unknown address, triggering widespread debate about its intentions. That move coincided with Bitcoin surpassing the symbolic milestone of $100,000 for the first time, adding to market jitters. Bhutan Moves $63M in Bitcoin Amid Growing National Crypto Reserve Strategy In related news, the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has once again made headlines in the cryptocurrency world after moving $63 million worth of Bitcoin across three wallets on March 24, according to blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens, which cited data from Arkham Intelligence. One of the recipient wallets now holds approximately 600 BTC, worth around $53 million at current prices, underlining the country’s increasingly strategic approach to managing its digital assets. This is just the latest move in Bhutan’s quiet but steadily growing relationship with cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, which it has been mining using its vast hydroelectric power resources since 2019. The nation has positioned itself as a unique case study in sovereign-level crypto adoption, combining natural energy assets with long-term digital investment strategies. Following the March 24 transfers, Bhutan’s primary crypto wallet — identified in 2024 as belonging to the country’s state-owned investment arm, Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) — now holds nearly $889.9 million in Bitcoin. This staggering amount represents approximately 30.7% of Bhutan’s total gross domestic product (GDP), which the World Bank estimated at $2.9 billion in 2023. The implication is profound: Bhutan now has one of the highest ratios of sovereign Bitcoin holdings relative to GDP globally, rivaling early adopters like El Salvador. Although Bitcoin forms the core of Bhutan’s crypto strategy, it is not the only digital asset held. Arkham Intelligence data also shows that the DHI wallet includes smaller allocations of other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether (ETH) worth around $334,580, and trace amounts of LinqAI (LNQ), Phil (PHIL), and Apu Apustaja (APU), among others. This diversification, though marginal compared to its Bitcoin stake, indicates a broader awareness of the evolving digital asset landscape. The $63 million transaction follows a similar high-profile transfer in October 2024, when Bhutan moved $66 million worth of BTC to Binance — presumably for strategic reallocation or offloading during a bull market that saw Bitcoin reach historic highs. Over the past two months, Bhutan’s government has been incrementally transferring smaller amounts of Bitcoin and Ether from its main wallet to other addresses. While the purposes of these transactions remain undisclosed, they may be part of a broader liquidity strategy, ongoing investment reshuffling, or preparations for further infrastructure development in the crypto mining or fintech sectors. Such methodical activity suggests that Bhutan’s engagement with cryptocurrency is far from speculative — it is tactical, measured, and government-backed. Bhutan’s national embrace of crypto is mirrored at the city level. In January 2025, the Gelephu Special Administrative Region (SAR) confirmed that it would integrate digital assets into its official strategic reserves. Bitcoin in Global Reserve Trends Bhutan is far from alone in leveraging Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Other nations, notably El Salvador and the United States, have significantly expanded their crypto reserves during the ongoing 2024–2025 bull market. El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, saw the value of its Bitcoin holdings surge to over $100 million by late 2024. Meanwhile, the US government, primarily through law enforcement asset seizures, now holds more than $17 billion in Bitcoin. The movement has also trickled down to the state level, particularly in the United States. Texas has passed a Bitcoin reserve bill that awaits the governor’s signature, and other states like Arizona are making legislative progress on similar proposals. However, not all have embraced the trend — some states have rejected such bills due to concerns about volatility, regulation, and central banking conflicts. As countries and regions increasingly explore the utility of cryptocurrency as part of their strategic reserves, Bhutan’s model offers an intriguing template — especially for small nations rich in renewable energy and seeking alternative economic development paths. By tapping into its hydroelectric surplus and converting it into one of the world’s most valuable digital assets, Bhutan is quietly transforming its economic foundation and signaling to the global community that crypto can serve more than just speculative ends. It can be a pillar of a modern digital economy — sovereign, sustainable, and scalable.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ARKM|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-25 05:30:00

When the whole crypto space is in ruins, the fundamentals of Lightchain AI, including strong investor confidence, position it as a candidate for gigantic growth. According to analysts, its fully built ecosystem can make a 10x jump until mid-2025, the worth of AI-blockchain confluence. Market Uncertainty and Potential Outliers Recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market—dramatized by a 22% drop in global market capitalization in early March—has seen investors become more risk-averse. High-profile security breaches and macroeconomic concerns are likewise among the causes of dismal market sentiment. Projects like Lightchain AI, however, which combine real-world utility with nascent technology, have the ability to win over institutional investors in search of real assets . A clear roadmap and scheduled future developments into big data service can enable the platform to overcome less niche tokens, and thus be a source of growth in the context of market volatility. While Lightchain AI has been focused on AI-fueled solutions, Remittix has been focused on cross-border payment niches. Using on-chain liquidity pools alongside fiat rails, Remittix facilitates faster international remittances with lowered costs and end-user transaction time. Down-to-earth, utility-focused projects like this succeed when the aggregate market momentum weakens because they service actual use cases better than speculation and/or hype-driven trading. With such qualities combined with snug support during its infancy, Remittix has already recorded a 400% annual price increase and can simply continue outpacing meme-like cryptocurrencies. Remittix: Pioneering Cross-Border Transactions Remittix’s presale success indicates the trust of the market in its PayFi system. With its inbuilt support for fiat banking networks, the platform is successfully bridging crypto and mainstream finance. It allows users to pay any bank account globally by converting crypto to fiat, cutting out several intermediaries. PayFi protocol lowers remittance fees, with transactions that are nearly real-time. It is most beneficial to migrant workers remitting money to their families, and to businesses remitting money to overseas suppliers. Practical real-world usage also justifies Remittix. To illustrate, a Philippine on-contract programmer can be remunerated in stablecoins and can exchange it to local currency directly through Remittix’s system, remitting to a local bank. A Vietnamese manufacturing firm can also remunerate overseas suppliers in ETH or DOGE, converting it to USD or EUR with ease. That kind of blending of ease and affordability is what makes the token attractive to mass application. Projections suggest that the RTX token can expand exponentially as soon as it lists on large exchanges. If the PayFi network is scaled appropriately—more integration with other remittance channels. Remittix can compete with or even surpass traditional choices like Western Union or MoneyGram. Its union of real-world practicality and crypto innovation is a compelling argument for long-term appreciation well into 2025 and beyond. Conclusion: Embracing Innovative Solutions As the crypto space grapples with volatility, innovative projects like Lightchain AI and Remittix demonstrate that solid fundamentals and practical uses can thrive amidst uncertainty. Lightchain AI’s AI decentralized platform is targeting a potentially gigantic market in data-driven industries, and Remittix is solving urgent demand for simple-to-use cross-border payments. Both projects show how technological innovation and practical applications of use instill confidence among institutional and retail investors. Do not miss the chance to invest in these new technologies. If you are keen to be part of the intersection between blockchain and AI or want to benefit from next-generation payment technologies, review projects such as Remittix and Lightchain AI to diversify your cryptocurrency investment portfolio.

However, altcoins like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have outperformed Bitcoin’s surge in the 24-hour time frame, being the top gainers in the ten largest cryptocurrencies list. Bitcoin And Top Altcoins Experience Significant Gains Scheduled for announcement on April 2, President Donald Trump had previously indicated that he would impose both reciprocal and sector-specific tariffs on countries including Canada, China, and Mexico. However, anonymous sources within the White House, as reported by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have suggested that the president may opt for a narrower approach, focusing solely on reciprocal tariffs. According to the reports, this shift in strategy appears to signal a tempering of the administration’s approach to a “potential trade war”, which has historically led to increased volatility in both the cryptocurrency and equity markets. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Suffer April Flash Crash, Analyst Shows How Low It Could Go Dan Greer, CEO of Defi App, a decentralized finance platform, noted the correlation between Bitcoin’s recent price increase and the news of the tariff adjustments. “This surge in Bitcoin’s price coincides with reports that the Trump administration is considering narrowing the scope of tariffs set to take effect on April 2,” he stated. The positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin has extended to the broader cryptocurrency market, with nearly all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization experiencing gains on Monday. Ethereum rose by 4%, XRP by 2%, Solana, DOGE and Cardano led the pack with increases of 8%, 7.8% and 4.5% respectively. The stock market reflected this optimism, with both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices rising 2% over the past 24 hours. Expert Insights On BTC’s Recent Fluctuations Greer highlighted that this development has alleviated some market uncertainties, leading to increased investor confidence across both cryptocurrency and equity markets. The crypto sector, which has faced mixed reactions since Trump took office, has been grappling with the implications of his fluctuating tariff policies. These policies have introduced a considerable degree of economic uncertainty, prompting many investors to retreat from riskier assets. Related Reading: Analyst Sets Dogecoin Next Target As Ascending Triangle Forms The anticipated tariffs—expected to raise the prices of foreign goods—could lead to inflation, further complicating the economic landscape. Bitcoin, which reached an all-time high of $109,000 in January, has seen a decline, dropping to $78,000 earlier this month amid fears that aggressive economic policies could trigger a recession. Colin Closser, investor relations manager at crypto wallet company Exodus, expressed his understanding of the crypto market’s reaction to Trump’s policies. “I expect markets to show emotion and volatility during times of change and stress in the United States, and you can see that volatility in Bitcoin this morning,” he remarked. Since the spike, Bitcoin has seen a bit of a pullback towards the $86,930 level, with the most notable support floor between $83,000 and $84,000.

Pi continues to struggle, down more than 65% from its earlier peak of $3 this year. The growing supply pressure is one of the main causes of this decline. According to data from Pi Scan, nearly 99.3 million Pi ( PI ) tokens, worth approximately $91 million at Mar. 25 prices, are scheduled to be unlocked over the following 30 days. An average of 3 million tokens will be unlocked every day over this period. On Apr. 3, the biggest single-day unlock will take place, bringing 6.8 million tokens into circulation. With a total of 115.57 million in April, 182 million in May, and 222 million in June, even bigger unlocks are anticipated in the future. More selling pressure might result from this. Uncertainty surrounding exchange listings has also negatively impacted investor sentiment. Many people were hoping for a Binance listing , but they are becoming increasingly frustrated as there has been no confirmation. Concerns regarding centralization are also growing. In contrast to most blockchains where nodes are run independently, the Pi Core Team is in charge of Pi’s SuperNodes. Although there are now 42 of these nodes instead of just three at launch, Pi Network has not made it clear how these nodes were chosen. You might also like: 4 reasons Pi Network price crashed after mainnet launch Burning tokens, according to some, might aid in price stabilization . On a Mar. 24 post on X, cryptocurrency analyst Dr. Altcoin recommended reducing the supply by 60–100 million Pi coins to balance the market. Although Pi Network recently burned 10 million tokens, reducing the total number in circulation to 6.77 billion, the price has not benefited significantly from this burn. The CEXs have been flooded with unlocked Pi coins, and the PTC will need to burn another 60 to 100 million coins from the circulating supply in the coming days in order to bring Pi back to $1. I am now more confident that Pi is going to return to $1 soon. DYOR! pic.twitter.com/PooqZX8SsY — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) March 24, 2025 On the technical side, PI is trading at $0.9253 and showing a weak trend. Support is at $0.70, and the price is having trouble holding above $1.00, which is serving as the immediate resistance. Pi Network technical analysis. Credit: crypto.news With PI close to the lower band, the Bollinger Bands indicate that sellers are in control of the price swings. Though it hasn’t yet reached oversold levels, the relative strength index at 43.27 indicates a bearish trend. Important moving averages (10, 20, 30 periods) indicate selling pressure, and the moving average convergence divergence is likewise bearish. PI may drop to the $0.70 region if it fas below $0.85. With $1.34 as the next target, a break above $1.00 could shift the momentum. For now, PI remains weak unless buyers push it higher.

Bitcoin futures remain strong and signal confidence in its long-term trajectory. However, Ethereum futures have shown increased volatility, reflecting uncertainty ahead of the network’s upgrades. Meanwhile, Solana’s futures market has experienced a surge in open interest, driven by growing institutional and retail demand for the high-performance blockchain. As these futures markets diverge, a new player like BinoFi could introduce fresh liquidity dynamics and reshape this competitive landscape with its hybrid exchange model and institutional-grade trading infrastructure. Bitcoin Futures Hold Strong as Institutional Demand Grows Bitcoin futures have demonstrated remarkable resilience amid recent market fluctuations, signalling strong institutional confidence in the asset. Open interest in BTC futures has surged across significant exchanges, reflecting a steady influx of capital from professional traders and institutional investors. This rising demand highlights Bitcoin’s growing role in diversified investment portfolios, with many institutions hedging their positions against macroeconomic uncertainties. The increased participation also underscores Bitcoin’s maturity as an asset class, with sophisticated trading strategies now shaping market movements. A key factor driving this institutional interest is Bitcoin’s emerging status as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. With traditional financial markets experiencing volatility, many large investors see Bitcoin as a viable alternative to traditional assets. The recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs has further amplified institutional adoption, making it easier for hedge funds, asset managers, and pension funds to gain exposure to BTC. As institutional demand strengthens, Bitcoin futures are expected to remain a crucial pillar of the crypto market, influencing price action and liquidity across the ecosystem. BinoFi’s Institutional-Grade Trading Infrastructure: Bridging CeFi and DeFi BinoFi is setting a new standard for institutional trading by merging the best features of centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Its hybrid exchange model gives institutions the security, transparency, and efficiency they need to navigate the evolving crypto landscape. BinoFi ensures that professional traders and institutional investors can access a seamless, trustless trading environment through its non-custodial security framework, AI-enhanced trading capabilities, and regulatory compliance measures. At the core of BinoFi’s security infrastructure are Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets, which eliminate the need for traditional private keys. By splitting cryptographic key components across multiple parties, these wallets enable secure transaction signing without exposing sensitive credentials to potential hacks or insider threats. This non-custodial approach ensures that users retain complete control of their funds while benefiting from institutional-grade security, making BinoFi a compelling alternative to centralized exchanges that require custodial asset management. Beyond security, BinoFi leverages AI-enhanced trading and smart order routing to optimize trade execution. Its AI-powered algorithms analyze market trends, liquidity pools, and price movements in real-time, allowing for automated algorithmic trading and bot-driven strategies. This level of automation reduces slippage, improves price efficiency, and enhances liquidity aggregation across CeFi and DeFi platforms. Institutional investors can execute trades faster and more efficiently, capitalizing on price discrepancies across different liquidity sources. Another major differentiator for BinoFi is its commitment to on-chain transparency and regulatory compliance. Unlike many hybrid exchanges, BinoFi implements real-time proof-of-reserves, allowing users and auditors to verify its asset holdings on the blockchain at any moment. This ensures full solvency and financial integrity, addressing concerns about exchange mismanagement and liquidity crises. Additionally, BinoFi integrates Zero-Knowledge (ZK) KYC compliance, enabling institutions to meet regulatory requirements while preserving user privacy. With ZK-proof technology, traders can verify their identity without exposing sensitive personal data, reducing compliance friction without compromising security. By integrating these cutting-edge features, BinoFi is redefining what it means to be a hybrid exchange. Its institutional-grade trading infrastructure provides the security of MPC wallets, the intelligence of AI-driven trading, and the transparency of real-time proof-of-reserves. As institutions demand more robust solutions in the crypto space, BinoFi stands at the forefront, offering a CeFi-DeFi bridge that combines efficiency, security, and compliance in one seamless platform. BinoFi is currently holding its presale to attract early investors, to date more than 20 million BINO tokens have been sold at a price 0f $0.02 per token.

The exchange’s crypto wallet business, Binance Wallet, launched an investigation on March 23 after it “received a complaint alleging that one of our staff members engaged in front-running trades using insider information to gain improper profits,” it said in a March 25 X post. It claimed a preliminary investigation found a Binance Wallet staffer who joined the team last month was suspected of using information from a former position in a business development role at BNB Chain to “front-run” trades of a project token. “The employee was aware the project was planning a Token Generation Event (TGE) and anticipated it would generate significant community interest,” Binance Wallet wrote. It claimed the staffer “used multiple linked wallet addresses to purchase a large volume of the project’s tokens” before it publicly announced the token launch and then, after the announcement, “quickly sold part of his holdings to realize significant profits.” Binance Wallet accused the staff member of front-running trades based on non-public information gained from a previous role in breach of company policy. It added the staff member was “suspended immediately and pending further disciplinary action,” and the company would cooperate with authorities in the relevant jurisdiction to take legal action. The company did not name the staff member but noted the allegations circulating on X prompted the investigation. Earlier this week, multiple X users pointed to a former operations manager at BNB Chain — Freddie Ng — whose LinkedIn shows he joined Binance Wallet’s business development team last month. As noted by X user “py,” one of the wallets that DEX Screener shows has profited $82,400 from the token in question, U DEX Platform (UUU), is a wallet that received UUU tokens from another wallet initially funded by the address “freddieng.bnb” — which Ng had shared on his X account. A wallet allegedly linked to a Binance staffer sold holdings of a token just minutes after it debuted on March 23 and hit a peak value of $31.5 million. Source: DEX Screener Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ng was contacted for comment. Related: BNB Chain launches $100M liquidity program Binance Wallet said it appreciated the public efforts, but it would only reward those who submitted reports to a whistleblowing email “to protect whistleblowers’ interests.” It said it would hand out $100,000 equally distributed among four anonymous whistleblowers who emailed the exchange.

While ETH and XRP remain key assets in long-term portfolios, they’re less attractive to those prioritizing short-term growth. This has led to growing interest in early-stage projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which combines utility, accessibility, and a promising price entry point. Ethereum & Ripple Ethereum has recently seen renewed whale interest despite market uncertainty. Large-scale buyers continue accumulating ETH during price dips, indicating confidence in the asset’s long-term outlook. Meanwhile, XRP remains a major player in crypto, with analysts pointing toward a possible rebound following the end of its legal challenges. Both assets are stable and established—but that stability comes at the cost of limited percentage gains in the near term. This shift in strategy has pushed a portion of investors toward smaller, under-the-radar projects. Mutuum Finance is one such project now making noise across the space. Rather than focusing solely on speculative hype, the platform is positioning itself as a fully functional decentralized lending protocol, designed to give users more control over their capital while creating opportunities for sustainable income. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The platform allows users to supply assets to liquidity pools and earn interest, or borrow against collateral without needing to sell their holdings. It operates using both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. P2C enables users to earn automatically through shared pools, while P2P allows lenders and borrowers to agree on custom terms for less conventional tokens like PEPE or DOGE. A core part of Mutuum’s ecosystem is its mtToken model. When someone supplies an asset like ETH or USDC, they receive mtTokens in return, which represent their share in the pool. These tokens grow in value as borrowing activity increases. For example, depositing $2,500 worth of USDC will start generating yield, with rates adjusting dynamically based on borrower demand. Currently, the MUTM token is priced at $0.02 during its third presale phase. The token has already attracted over 6,600 holders and raised more than $4.69 million. With nearly 70% of this round completed, the next price increase to $0.025 is approaching quickly—prompting many early investors to secure their positions before the jump. Projections for the token’s launch have generated optimism, with analysts estimating a target of $1.20 in the months following release. That would mark a 5,900% increase from today’s price. For context, someone investing $1,200 now would receive 60,000 MUTM tokens. When the price reaches $1.20, their investment could grow to $72,000—highlighting the token’s potential for meaningful returns. The platform isn’t just relying on future expectations. A beta version of Mutuum’s app is set to launch alongside the token, ensuring utility from day one. Additionally, the protocol includes a buy-and-distribute system that uses a share of revenue to purchase MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to mtToken holders, creating constant buy pressure and incentivizing long-term participation. Another standout feature is the overcollateralized stablecoin currently in development. Users will be able to mint this stablecoin by locking excess collateral inside Mutuum’s protocol, accessing liquidity without having to sell their assets. This model mirrors some of the most successful DeFi tools while keeping user ownership intact. In a market where ETH and XRP continue to consolidate, MUTM presents a rare opportunity for growth-focused investors. Its combination of working products, passive income potential, and low barrier to entry makes it a serious contender for those looking to diversify into a new era of DeFi.

This move follows other ventures like the TRUMP meme coin and the launch of the USD1 stablecoin by Trump-backed World Liberty Financial. However, these Trump ventures already attracted a lot of political scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest. Meanwhile, Kraken is preparing for a potential IPO by 2026, exploring a major fundraise and expanding its services through acquisitions and the relaunch of crypto staking. Trump Expands Crypto Presence with New ETF Agreement Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social and fintech platform Truth.Fi, signed a non-binding agreement with Crypto.com to launch a new line of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. According to a March 24 statement , the initiative is still subject to regulatory approval but is yet another major step in the growing overlap between cryptocurrency and Donald Trump's business ventures. The planned ETFs will be developed through Foris Capital US LLC, which is the broker-dealer arm of Crypto.com. They aim to feature digital assets and securities with a strong “Made in America” theme. The crypto components of the ETF could include a basket of tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Crypto.com’s native token Cronos (CRO). Crypto.com will provide both the infrastructure and custody services for the initiative. Once launched, the ETFs are expected to be accessible internationally, including across the US, Europe, and Asia via established brokerage platforms. They will also be integrated into the Crypto.com App, giving access to over 140 million users globally. In parallel, Truth.Fi plans to offer Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs), which TMTG will reportedly fund using its existing cash reserves. This ETF project is yet another crypto-related venture tied to Donald Trump. The US president’s growing crypto footprint already stirred some political controversy. Democratic lawmakers raised their concerns over potential conflicts of interest stemming from Trump’s dual roles in politics and business. In particular, scrutiny increased over his connection to World Liberty Financial, which is a crypto platform owned by the Trump Organization, and the launch of the TRUMP meme coin. TRUMP went live just three days before his inauguration. Representative Gerald Connolly labeled the meme coin a “money grab,” and alleged that Trump-affiliated entities benefited from more than $100 million in trading fees. Similarly, Representative Maxine Waters denounced the token as a “rug pull,” and criticized it for embodying the worst aspects of the crypto industry. Trump’s Crypto Firm Rolls Out Stablecoin Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial also recently launched a US dollar-pegged stablecoin called World Liberty Financial USD (USD1), with an initial supply of more than $3.5 million. The token was deployed on both the BNB Chain and Ethereum in early March, according to data from Etherscan and BscScan. Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao confirmed the deployment, though the project stated that the stablecoin is not currently available for trading. The timing of the launch aligns with ongoing discussions in Congress around stablecoin regulation. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act cleared the Senate Banking Committee on March 13 and is expected to reach the Senate floor for a full vote very soon. Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, projected that the bill could be signed by President Trump by June. Since its debut in September of 2024, World Liberty Financial operated with limited public transparency. Its website reveals that Trump and several family members collectively control 60% of the company’s equity. As of mid-March, the firm has conducted two public token sales that raised a combined total of $550 million. The launch of USD1 also coincides with reports that the Trump family held talks with Binance about potentially acquiring a stake in the exchange and issuing a presidential pardon for CZ, though Zhao denied that any deal or pardon arrangement exists. World Liberty also faced criticism over potential conflicts of interest. Even before its first public token sale in October of 2024, the company came under scrutiny from US lawmakers that were concerned about Trump’s dual role as a political figure and crypto entrepreneur. Shortly after Trump’s election victory, Tron founder Justin Sun announced a $30 million investment in World Liberty, which likely led to his appointment as an adviser to the firm. After Trump’s inauguration and the appointment of SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair, the SEC requested a pause in its enforcement case against Sun to explore a potential resolution. Sun and several of his companies were accused of selling unregistered securities. Meanwhile, other well known crypto executives who supported Trump and the Republican Party during the 2024 elections also had their legal challenges with the SEC dropped since Uyeda took charge. The stablecoin arrived during a broader expansion of the digital dollar market. Data from Artemis and Dune showed a more than 50% increase in active stablecoin wallets from February 2024 to February 2025. The market cap of all stablecoins surpassed $200 billion in January as well, with Tether and USDC still being the two leading assets in the space. Kraken Eyes IPO with Major Fundraise It is not only Trump-linked businesses that are currently making strides in the crypto space. Kraken, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, is reportedly exploring a big capital raise ahead of a potential initial public offering (IPO) targeted for early 2026. According to Bloomberg , Kraken is in early-stage discussions with major financial institutions including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to arrange a debt package worth between $200 million and $1 billion. The funds raised will support the company’s growth initiatives rather than operational costs. Bloomberg has been covering Kraken’s IPO ambitions for the past year, and reports suggest that plans to go public have gained more momentum since the election of US President Donald Trump, whose administration is seen as more crypto-friendly. Kraken's position in the crypto sector is growing, having processed more than $1.1 billion in trading volume over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap . The exchange also experienced some impressive growth in 2024 , with revenue reaching $1.5 billion. This was a 128% increase from 2023. Its adjusted earnings totaled $380 million for the year. (Source: Kraken ) Additionally, Kraken acquired NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion. NinjaTrader is a futures brokerage that was founded in 2003 and registered with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It will likely boost Kraken’s presence in the derivatives market. The acquisition also aligns with Kraken’s broader strategy to expand into multi-asset services, including equities and payment solutions. Kraken, like several other exchanges, was recently relieved from enforcement actions by the SEC. This more favorable environment likely influenced Kraken’s decision to relaunch its crypto staking services in the United States after nearly two years. The exchange now offers staking options for 17 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and Solana.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-25 05:49:46

According to an official tweet post by Binance, the employee used confidential information from their previous role at BNB Chain to purchase tokens before a public announcement. Shortly after the launch, they sold a portion of the tokens, securing significant profits. Binance Employee Tied Of Insider Trading The allegations surfaced when Binance received complaints on March 23, prompting an internal investigation. The findings revealed that the employee had used multiple wallet addresses to buy tokens before any official Token Generation Event (TGE) was announced.

Although Binance has not disclosed the employee’s name, it confirmed that they have been suspended immediately. The exchange also stated that it is working with legal authorities to ensure necessary actions are taken. As part of its efforts to maintain integrity, Binance rewarded four whistleblowers with $100,000 for reporting the misconduct through its official channel. Suspected Wallet Linked to $200k In Profit In a separate tweet post, Wu Blockchain reported that a suspected Binance employee, allegedly linked to a wallet under the name Freddie Ng, made a profit of $113,000 by trading UUU tokens on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The wallet, which initially spent $6,227 to buy 24.1 million UUU tokens, later sold 6.02 million tokens, generating substantial returns. The remaining 18.09 million tokens, valued at around $200,000, are still distributed across nine different wallet addresses. Binance’s Strict Action Against Misconduct Binance has ensured its commitment to maintaining transparency and fairness in crypto trading. The company noted that it will fully cooperate with authorities and take legal measures against those found guilty of insider trading. This isn’t the first time a major exchange has faced such an issue. Last year, a former Coinbase manager admitted to leaking confidential token-listing information for personal gain.

Gox transfers 11,501.4 Bitcoin to its wallets. Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain revealed that one of the previous transfers this month ended up in the crypto exchange Bitstamp. The analytic firm also speculated that the 893.4 Bitcoin “sent to the warm wallet will be moved out shortly too.” The analytic firm showed that the Mt. Gox wallet (1PuQB) had moved a total of 12,000 Bitcoin worth over $1 billion on March 6. Arkham also noted that the exchange had sent $15 million of those funds to BitGo, which was one of the custodians facilitating Mt. Gox’s creditor repayments. The company had also sent 166.5 BTC worth around $15 million to Mt.Gox cold wallet, while the remainder of the assets were moved to an unidentified wallet (1Mo1n). The defunct exchange transferred another 11,833 BTC on March 11, worth over $930 million. The firm had also moved 11,501 BTC worth around $905.1 million into a new wallet, while the remaining 332 BTC ($26.1 million) were transferred to a warm wallet. Spot On Chain analytic firm revealed that the 332 digital assets may also be moved to assist with the repayments. Spot On Chain data also showed that the exchange started offloading around $9.2 billion worth of BTC in June 2024. The crypto company fell into bankruptcy in early 2024, and on-chain data indicated that some past movements of its BTC holdings were followed by creditor payouts, which began in 2024. Mt. Gox moves BTC for creditor compensation Mt. Gox was declared bankrupt in early 2014 after it suffered an 850,000 BTC loss in one of the biggest crypto hacks ever recorded. The firm was considered the largest Bitcoin exchange before the security breach, handling around 70-80% of trades. After the exchange collapsed in February 2014, a Tokyo court appointed a trustee to manage the bankruptcy proceedings and compensate creditors with the exchange’s assets. The exchange’s trustee in charge of its stash pushed the deadline for creditor repayments by a full year to October 31, 2025. The trustee also argued that many creditors “still have not received their repayments because they have not completed the necessary procedures for receiving repayments.” The firm also said that creditors had the option to receive their payouts in Bitcoin. A Reddit poll conducted on Mt. Gox Insolvency subreddit in July 2024 following the exchange’s first payout discovered that creditors were not rushing to sell their digital asset payouts. Mt. Gox Insolvency is the sub for the digital asset investors affected by the 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox. The firm also acknowledged that Mt. Gox Insolvency was participating in the official Mt. Gox insolvency process in Tokyo through the Japanese court system. The poll indicated that approximately 260 Mt. Gox creditors, representing 56% of the 467 poll participants, planned to hold onto their virtual assets after receiving their payouts. The defunct crypto exchange also moved over 24,000 BTC worth nearly $2.4 billion to an unknown address last December after the virtual asset hit a milestone of $100,000. Less than two weeks later, the firm also moved around 1,620 BTC through another series of unknown wallets. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

As Musk-ian technocracy takes hold of governments worldwide with financial surveillance, the real threat could stem from digital assets and stablecoin favorites like XRP, USDT, and USDC. Gold expert and former politician Tony Arterburn says that the “PayPal mafia and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk … are technocrats, and they certainly believe in a digitized currency system and more centralized systems in general.” In a recent interview on The Free Thought Project Podcast, the U.S. Army veteran and precious metals specialist said he doesn’t want to rain on people’s parade, but “you may not have something called CBDC, but it may be on the backs of stable coins or something else.” Musk’s ties to technocracy and social credit, Trump’s false promises Investopedia defines “ technocracy ” as a model of governance where “individuals selected to a leadership role are chosen through a process that emphasizes their relevant skills … as opposed to whether or not they fit the majority interests of a popular vote.” Of course, it’s clear that such a system would create problems and encourage elitist favoritism in governing the rest of the world by force, regardless of people’s actual skills or intentions. But that seems to be exactly where Musk and Trump are steering things. See the recent open promotion by the president of Tesla cars, for example. Elon Musk is the maternal grandson of former Canadian Social Credit Party and Technocratic politician Joshua N. Haldeman. This really should not be surprising given Trump’s love of bowing down to globalist agendas such as the violent clearing out of Gaza with bombs to create new real estate for his Israeli pals or Musk’s family lineage , which ties him directly to Joshua N. Haldeman (his maternal grandfather) who backed Canada’s Technocracy movement and was a leader of the Social Credit Party in the same country, before emigrating to South Africa. While Donald Trump’s executive order banning CBDCs in America was indeed well received by his supporters, the actual text of the document reveals some disturbing things for true believers in crypto and permissionless, peer-to-peer transactions. The document , titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” promises to bolster USD dominance “through actions to promote the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide.” Donald Trump posted about a “crypto reserve” on his social media platform Truth Social on March 3. As Arterburn states on the podcast: “I was there in Nashville at the Bitcoin conference when Trump spoke. So, this is something that’s been going on for a while. But they also mentioned other coins, and I thought, that’s it … They even mentioned Cardano, XRP, Ethereum, and other things, and I go, what’s interesting?” The gold expert noted that, unlike bitcoin, some of the aforementioned assets “have functions, but they’re with a company. They all track back to a board of directors or venture capital. You can see who they are.” In effect, Trump’s U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile features assets created by private companies, with the private financial giants thus possibly becoming state institutions by default, in a kind of modern, techno-fascism. The boards of directors, like Musk, would be unelected rulers. Self-appointed rulers creating mockeries like “D.O.G.E” and controlling people’s money without their consent, shaping political policy. Zooming out to a global view, this is already happening. Adoption of XRP, stablecoins soars, CBDC nightmare inches closer On the morning of March 25, Genki Oda, Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) representative director and SBI bigwig, posted a picture taken at Kanda Shrine in Tokyo to Musk’s social media platform, X. “I came to Kanda Shrine to pray with Jeremy and the Circle team for the success of our joint venture,” he noted (translated) in the caption. The Jeremy he is referring to is Jeremy Allaire of Circle. The new venture refers to the Japanese government’s approval of the USDC stablecoin and its official launch on the SBI VC Trade platform. Recent reports show that the adoption of stablecoins as a whole has been on a marked rise over the last year. When it comes to Tether, the leading U.S.-dollar-pegged stablecoin by market cap ($143.7B), many governments globally seem to champion its use, though it has faced some regulatory hurdles. In open service of government agencies, the company behind USDT actively censors, addresses, and freezes the assets of users in compliance with legal enforcers like the U.S. Department of Justice. For example, Cryptopolitan reported on March 6 that Tether froze $27 million in USDT on the Russian crypto exchange Garantex. This is right in line with how a CBDC would operate, becoming unusable once an account or address has been marked as “illegal” or non-compliant. As BIS (Bank of International Settlements) General Manager Augustín Carstens has said : “We don’t know who’s using a $100 bill today and we don’t know who’s using a 1,000 peso bill today. The key difference with the CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of central bank liability, and also we will have the technology to enforce that.” While some may see this as a good thing for law and order, those who see clearly know that the whole value proposition of Bitcoin and crypto was to take control of money out of the hands of sociopathic and violent state actors and to let peaceful, voluntary transactions and social order prevail. This is in direct opposition to Musk — who has received billions from the state for his ventures — and his overtures to a “ Novus Ordo Seclorum ,” or “new order of the ages” / “new world order.” Circling back to Japan, where WEF-friend Oda and Allaire are praying to Shintō gods for success, the technocratic surveillance is only increasing. In fact, one Nikkei Fintech journalist says Japan may have a CBDC by 2030 , following Europe’s lead. XRP supporters are hoping their favorite asset will be chosen for the role. Yoshitaka Kitao, massive Trump and Musk supporter and CEO of SBI Holdings in Japan, has previously noted that “We are the largest external shareholder of Ripple Labs, a US company that develops a next-generation remittance system using blockchain technology.” Arterburn warns lovers of freedom and sound money must be vigilant: “The establishment, the controllers, they want a CBDC. Davos wants a CBDC. World Economic Forum, the UN, they want Central Bank digital currency, the Bank of International Settlements. They all want CBDC. And that’s why none of that’s off the table. It just may come in a different form.”",OP-ED|CBDC|USDC|USDT|XRP,EN,0,0,FIAT|XRP|USDT|ASIA|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-25 06:12:15

Trump’s World Liberty Financial Sells 184K ENA Sparking Concerns,https://coingape.com/is-ethena-price-at-risk-trumps-world-liberty-financial-sells-184k-ena-sparking-concerns/,"Despite Ethena price extending weekly gains to over 7% this Tuesday, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial has rattled the crypto market with its ENA selloff spree. On-chain statistics indicated that Trump’s World Liberty sold a whopping 184,000 tokens intraday, reverberating a bearish sentiment among crypto traders and investors globally. In the wake of massive token unlocks and a dump by a market maker previously, the synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum already remains subject to volatility. Now, market watchers bearishly speculate over the asset’s future trajectory due to rising selling pressure. Is Ethena Price Bracing For Heat Amid Trump’s World Liberty’s Selloff? Usual market sentiments remain highly negative in light of heightened selling pressure on cryptocurrencies. The latest data from Arkham Intelligence indicated that World Liberty Financial sold 184,000 ENA for $69K over the past day. This selloff chronicle sparked concerns over Ethena price action’s long-term prospects, underlining a spike in selling pressure and WLFI’s loss of interest in the asset amid broader trends. Notably, the Trump family-backed firm purchased 11 tokens earlier, including the one mentioned above, via its WLFI sale funds. Intriguingly, since most of these assets were soon shifted to Coinbase Prime, the market had an unclear view of selloff transactions. However, a part of ENA holdings was transferred to the ‘0x76a’ custodial wallet address. This wallet address shifted 180,000 tokens to the address ‘0x77a.’ Subsequently, this address then sold the amount received for WBTC, per the data. Overall, this transactional process gained significant traction, whilst market watchers speculate whether further token selloffs are also incoming. The synthetic dollar protocol on Ethereum remains bearishly eyed by investors, attributed to this saga. Factors Fueling More Heat For Ethena Price Simultaneously, a couple of other aspects propel an unsure investor sentiment about future price movements. CoinGape reported that the market maker Amber Group recently offloaded $10 million ENA to Binance . The rising exchange supply solidified bearish market sentiments over the asset’s future potential. On the other hand, recent ENA token unlocks have also ushered in price volatility. While March saw over 2 billion coins unlocked and added to the crypto’s supply, April comes as another hurdle. Reportedly, over 200 million coins are set to unlock on April 2 and 5 collectively. In turn, traders and investors remain cautious over future Ethena price movements. It’s noteworthy that World Liberty Financial’s massive selloff potentially aligns with the past and looming unlocks in an effort to mitigate losses. What’s Next? As of press time, ENA price witnessed a nearly 1% jump in value, reaching $0.3989. The crypto hit a low and a peak of $0.3883 and $0.4098 intraday. Despite the selloffs and massive token unlocks, the weekly chart showed a 7% upswing, underling a resilient movement. However, the monthly chart showed a 10% slump, adding to speculations. Crypto market traders are currently uncertain about the asset’s performance ahead as broader trends indicate that volatility looms, whilst the price chart shows resilience. Besides, Ethena price prediction by CoinGape shows that bears remain dominant, as per the 3-month bias indicator. Nevertheless, renowned market trader Byzantine General took to X, projecting an optimistic outlook for the synthetic dollar protocol crypto. Source: Byzantine General, X The trader revealed that the crypto’s funding rate isn’t negative anymore, suggesting a bullish movement looms. Further, ENA got heavily shorted primarily due to its massive token unlocks, but the heat has now cooled down, per the analyst. Nevertheless, despite positive reaffirmation by renowned traders, it remains vital to gauge in broader aspects that underscore volatility is possible. The post Is Ethena Price At Risk?

According to a Mar. 25 press release statement , SBI VC Trade, a crypto exchange under SBI Holdings, will begin full-scale USD Coin ( USDC ) trading on Mar. 26. USDC is now the first international dollar stablecoin to be legally recognized under Japan’s stablecoin framework, following regulatory approval from the country’s Financial Services Agency. For the past two years, Circle has been working with banking partners and regulators to make this feasible. According to Circle’s chief executive officer Jeremy Allaire, Japan’s transparent stablecoin regulations offer significant prospects for cross-border transactions, digital payments, and financial innovation. “We are honored to bring USDC to businesses and consumers in the market, and with Circle Japan KK and the strong support of SBI Holdings and leading exchanges, USDC is positioned as a secure and transparent digital dollar that meets the needs of Japan’s evolving digital economy.” — Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle . SBI Holdings sees this as a critical step in enhancing the usability and accessibility of digital assets for both consumers and businesses. In addition to SBI VC Trade, USDC will soon be listed by Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer, further broadening its reach.

The centralized exchanges (CEX) of the Ethereum network hold the smallest amount of Ethereum in nearly nine years, with 8.97 million ETH remaining on the platforms. This sharp decline indicates a serious shift in Ethereum’s market dynamics, where the number of tokens available for immediate sale or trading on those same platforms is at an all-time low, not seen since November 2015. Ethereum Supply on CEX Hits 9-Year Low – Only 8.97M ETH Left As of March 24, data from CryptoRank and Santiment shows that Ethereum holdings on centralized exchanges (CEX) have dropped to their lowest level since November 2015, now standing at just 8.97 million ETH. Reduced… pic.twitter.com/TmU3A8UyX6 — Followin (@followin_io) March 24, 2025 The reduction in the supply of Ethereum on exchanges has sent a ripple of questions among observers about what it might mean for the market. It could be a sign of something more dire in the short term—reduced liquidity, for instance. Or it could be something much nicer: a precursor to a big jump in Ethereum’s price since there’s now less of the stuff on hand for traders to do whatever it is with Ethereum that they do. But sometimes it’s just nice to know in what direction the wind is blowing. So let’s take a look at this etherwind. One Ethereum observer—Evangelos Kandias—has suggested on Twitter that the current situation is hexing traders. Reduced Liquidity May Lead to Price Movements Ethereum’s drop in supply directly impacts centralized exchanges. The liquidity available on those exchanges has decreased significantly. There are now only 8.97 million ETH left on exchanges to trade. And that could create a situation where Ethereum’s price becomes far more reactive to changes in demand. A primary driver of this shift is that a good number of Ethereum holders are opting to transfer their assets from exchanges into cold wallets for what seems to be long-term storage. When these investors undertake this action, they are in effect taking ETH out of circulation and not making it available on exchanges. This strike appears to be a bullish one for Ethereum because it suggests the investors are in a less-sell, more-hold mode, with action that seems to imply confidence in Ethereum’s future. Additionally, a decrease in supply on exchanges usually causes an increase in demand, which in turn makes prices go up. In the case of Bitcoin, we saw its supply on exchanges drop earlier this year, followed by an intense spike in its price. Right now, Ethereum is very similar to Bitcoin in that its current supply on exchanges has dropped significantly. Ethereum Spot ETFs Experience Outflows Even with the nice signs pertaining to the diminished offering of Ethereum on exchanges, not all goings-on in the Ethereum marketplace are encouraging these days. From March 17 to March 21, Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) took a net outflow of $103 million for the week. The most sizable exit was from BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA), which saw a net outflow of $74 million. This could be taken as a somewhat bearish sign, suggesting that institutional investors might be easing back on Ethereum. From March 17 to March 21, Ethereum spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $103 million for the week. The largest outflow came from BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA), which recorded a net outflow of $74 million. In contrast, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a total weekly net inflow of… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 24, 2025 The notable part about the outflows from Ethereum ETFs is they represent a change in investor sentiment. Spot ETFs are products that institutional investors often use to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly purchase or manage it. The outflows suggest that some large investors are currently less confident than they were a month ago in Ethereum’s short-term prospects. That said, these flows are only a snapshot in time and can quickly change based on broader market conditions and investor sentiment. A Look Back: Bitcoin’s Similar Price Surge Grasping the possible fallout from Ethereum’s scant exchange supply requires us to consider a closely related event with Bitcoin that took place in January. On the heels of several price drops in late 2022, Bitcoin’s supply on centralized exchanges plummeted. Investors, it seemed, were taking their funds and moving them to the safety of cold storage. The only problem? With so few Bitcoin available to trade, the actual price of Bitcoin began to rise too. Even though Bitcoin and Ethereum are separate assets with their own market dynamics, we must not overlook the parallels between the two. If demand for Ethereum remains robust while its supply continues to dwindle, the cryptocurrency may be set for a price moonshot. This hinges, of course, on whether the reduced supply in the exchanges translates into an increase in buying pressure—something that seems less and less likely with each passing day. Conclusion: Reduced Exchange Supply Signals Potential for Price Growth A recent development for the cryptocurrency known as Ethereum is its stark drop in supply on centralized exchanges. There currently exists only 8.97 million ETH on such platforms, the lowest figure recorded in nearly nine years. This dearth seems to signal a move by not just retail, but also institutional investors, to cold wallets (hence the term “decreasing liquidity”) and is probably a bullish omen. After all, a cryptocurrency is less likely to be traded when there is almost none to be had. All of this is apparently part of a trend, with holders increasingly demonstrating faith in what seems to be Ethereum’s long-term viability. Despite a drop in exchange supply, Ethereum spot ETFs have seen notable outflows. This could suggest a potential short-term pullback from some of the institutions that had been investing in Ethereum via this vehicle. It might modestly affect the price if these trends continue. In the end, it is the interplay of supply and demand that will determine the direction of travel for Ethereum’s price. A situation has emerged that is similar to what happened with Bitcoin in January: the supply of Ethereum available on exchanges has fallen, and if demand picks up, the price could appreciate. Of course, this is a big “if,” one that many are watching closely as the weeks unfold. Even if it does play out, seeing Ethereum hit new highs could be a possibility.

Circle also plans to expand further by listing USDC on Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer soon. This is a big move for Circle as it brings USDC to new markets beyond the traditional ones. Other major exchanges in Japan are expected to follow, strengthening USDC’s presence in the region. Japan Leads in Stablecoin Adoption Japan has been a leader in Web3 and blockchain adoption, setting clear regulations for stablecoins in its financial system. This strong regulatory framework is now paving the way for stablecoins like USDC to thrive in the country. SBI Holdings’ CEO, Yoshitaka Kitao, believes this move will improve financial access and boost digital asset growth in Japan. He stated that it aligns with their vision for the future of payments and blockchain finance. Japan has been cautious about digital assets due to past incidents like the Mt. Gox collapse. However, with better regulations in place, stablecoins like USDC are now seen as a safe option for both individuals and businesses. Unlocking New Financial Opportunities With USDC now approved in Japan, the stablecoin’s use is expected to go beyond just cryptocurrency trading. This approval makes Circle a top player in stablecoins, helping bring digital dollars to more people worldwide. As of now, USDC stablecoin has a market cap of almost $60 billion .",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|USDC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 07:08:34

While Shiba Inu holds its breath hoping Bitcoin clears $90K, and Pudgy Penguins rallies behind the first-ever NFT-crypto ETF in the U.S., a whole different beast is gaining speed— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Shiba is teetering around its support zone with weak investor backing, while Pudgy traders are riding the ETF headlines like a wave. Meanwhile, investors chasing serious ROI are hunting for the best cryptos to join for long term gains that can survive volatility, ignore market noise, and reward early believers. That’s where BTFD Coin steps in—an off-the-chain meme coin presale success story that’s rewriting the playbook on how meme coins should launch. By staying immune to external price fluctuations, BTFD’s final presale stretch is all about pure, unfiltered upside. With a fully live P2E game, monster staking returns, and bulls stampeding into the presale, this isn’t just another token; it’s a movement backed by stats, swagger, and serious community heat. Now’s your shot to discover how BTFD Coin is flipping the meme coin world on its head and why this presale could be the smartest long-term bet you make all year. Hold tight. The next few minutes could decide your next few years. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Meme Coin With a P2E Game and 90% APY Staking! Ask yourself this—if you had the chance to lock in a presale price that offers a direct path to 2900% ROI, would you take it or scroll past it? Because one stop before BTFD Coin’s final presale stage is right now—and there’s not much time left on the clock. At just $0.0002 per coin in Stage 15, the BTFD presale gives investors a golden shot to ride from ground-floor pricing all the way to its final listing price of $0.0006. That alone is a 200% return. But the real kicker? Analysts are calling for a moon price of $0.006. That’s a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI for those getting in today. A $1000 buy at this stage gets you 5,000,000 BTFD tokens. If it hits $0.0006, that’s $3,000. But if it hits its projected moon price of $0.006—boom, you’re sitting on $30,000. That’s why crypto insiders are labeling it one of the best cryptos to join for long term gains. The hype’s not just talk. BTFD’s raised over $6.41 million, sold more than 71 billion coins, and attracted 11,500+ holders—all before it even launched. And with Stage 16 being the final checkpoint, this $0.0002 price is on life support. Miss it now, and the ROI window shuts—fast. But it’s not just about early bird pricing. BTFD’s utility is where it goes beast mode. The full P2E game launched on January 1st is already paying out rewards. Play, earn, level up, and cash out or stake for gains. It’s crypto meets gaming with real bag potential. Let’s not sleep on staking either. BTFD’s staking system , live since December 2nd, offers a heavy 90% APY. That’s right—holders can earn while they wait. Staking $1,000 BTFD could grow to nearly twice in a year. And compounding? Yeah, that just levels it up further. The Bulls Squad characters and their digital world bring the coin to life, pulling the community into something more than just speculation. The meme coin presale is the heartbeat of this project, and it’s roaring in Stage 15. Want to make it even better? BTFD’s referral program offers real rewards. Share your code, and if someone buys $50 or more, they get 10% extra tokens. You, meanwhile, can score 10% of what they spend if you crack the top 20 on the leaderboard. The leaderboard resets monthly—so every new month is a clean shot. So here’s your four-step game plan to load up before this thing takes off. First, head to the BTFD presale site . Next, connect your wallet—Trust Wallet, MetaMask, whatever works. Pick your currency. Then click buy. That’s it. Claim those presale coins before this price disappears forever. This ain’t just another meme coin. BTFD Coin is charging into the next bull cycle with the herd behind it, a community-first mindset, and utilities that are already delivering. Join now or watch from the sidelines when early believers make bank. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): ETF News Sends Ripples Through NFT Markets Pudgy Penguins just made crypto history. Canary Capital filed for the first-ever U.S.-listed ETF that includes both NFTs and crypto, and it’s centered around the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. That includes the PENGU token and a curated set of rare NFTs from the collection. The ETF will also include Solana and Ethereum for liquidity moves. After the news broke, PENGU spiked—then pulled back over 8% during Friday’s U.S. trading hours. Still, retail sentiment is sky-high. StockTwits shows “extremely bullish” chatter with users seeing the dip as a golden buying opportunity. PENGU’s down 90% from its all-time high of $0.06845, but with the ETF move, investors are banking on a rebound. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Holding Its Breath as Bitcoin Eyes $90K SHIB’s fate is tied closely to Bitcoin’s momentum. With a correlation of 0.77, SHIB’s stuck in a waiting game. The MVRV Long/Short Difference just hit a six-month low—meaning short-term holders are sitting on profits and could dump anytime. That adds serious bearish pressure, especially with long-term whales staying quiet. Right now, SHIB’s hovering just above its $0.00001275 support level. A break above $0.00001462 could flip the narrative, but without a strong push from Bitcoin, it might stay stuck. Investors are watching BTC closely. If it breaks $90K, SHIB could ride that wave out of its current lull. Conclusion: Your $0.0002 Ticket to the Moon Is Right Here, Right Now If you’ve been searching for the best cryptos to join for long term gains, the data’s clear— BTFD Coin’s presale is where real gains live. While legacy tokens like SHIB wrestle with market mood swings and Pudgy Penguins aim for institutional validation, BTFD is giving everyday investors something real—an ROI opportunity of 2900%, a live P2E game, staking at 90% APY, and a die-hard bull community. Based on everything we’ve seen, from its explosive presale to analyst predictions of $0.006 and even higher, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be a breakout star in the next bull run. But you’ve got one stage left before the curtain drops. Don’t wait for listings and market hype—join during the final presale stage and lock in gains before the crowd shows up. Get to the official BTFD site and snag your tokens while they’re still priced at just $0.0002. BTFD or get left behind.

Yet macro analyst Tomas (@TomasOnMarkets) contends that the broader economic backdrop is not as dire as some headlines suggest, even though certain datasets have pointed to weaker growth in early 2025. “Doesn’t look very recessionary to me?” Tomas wrote in a recent post on X, echoing the skepticism he has maintained for months. He pointed to specific indicators that began sliding in February but have started to stabilize. According to his analysis, US growth nowcasts—which aggregate various real-time measures of economic growth—“fell throughout February but have been leveling off for three weeks.” He likewise referenced the Citi Economic Surprise Index (CESI), which tracks how actual economic data compares to consensus forecasts. Since January, the CESI had been in a downturn, implying that data releases were coming in below expectations, but it has also steadied in recent weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin To ‘Brutally Bleed Lower’ Or Break New ATH In Q2, Expert Warns “Falling CESI = data coming in below expectations, rising CESI = data coming in above expectations,” Tomas explained, highlighting the significance of the index for market sentiment. The upshot is that, while markets grew increasingly defensive during the early-year weakness, these indicators are no longer deteriorating at the pace observed at the start of 2025. Why Bitcoin Mirrors Summer 2024 Tomas then turned his attention to parallels between the current environment and two notable past episodes: the turbulence of Summer 2024 and the rout of late 2018. He underscored that, in each case, global markets encountered a sharp drawdown triggered by what he labeled “growth/recession scares,” combined with other exogenous pressures. “For me, the two recent instances that are the most similar to today in terms of both price action and macro backdrop are Summer 2024 and late 2018,” he wrote. During Summer 2024, concerns over growth plus a widespread yen carry trade unwind contributed to a 10% equity-market drawdown. In late 2018, an escalating trade battle during the first Trump-era tariff moves similarly prompted an initial correction in equities of about 10%, eventually deepening into a further 15% pullback. Now, with equity markets having also suffered approximately a 10% peak-to-trough decline recently, Tomas sees distinct echoes of those historical moments. He noted that such parallels extend to Bitcoin, which fell around 30% in Summer 2024 and 54% in late 2018—close to the 30% slide it has endured this time around. The question, he posed, is which path lies ahead: will the market follow the relatively contained Summer 2024 correction, or will it spiral into a more painful chain of losses similar to late 2018’s extended selloff? Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom In Sight As Trump Expected To Soften Stance On Reciprocal Tariffs: Report “So which way?” Tomas asked, underscoring the uncertain juncture facing both crypto assets and equities. His stance leans toward expecting a scenario more akin to Summer 2024 than to the tumult of 2018. In his words, “I’m still in the camp that tariffs won’t be as bad as many expect — I’ve been here for months,” a viewpoint he believes also helps explain the somewhat surprising resilience in risk assets lately. He suggested that “some of the noises over the past couple of days are potentially pointing towards this outcome, which is probably why risk assets have jumped today,” although he stopped short of claiming any definitive resolution. Several factors, in Tomas’s view, bolster the case that today’s landscape aligns more closely with Summer 2024 than with late 2018. One is the recent easing of financial conditions, which had tightened earlier in the year but have since moderated. Another is the US dollar’s notable weakening in recent weeks, a stark contrast to its ascent during 2018 that intensified selling pressure on global assets. Tomas added that most leading indicators still support a continued business cycle expansion, a stance he believes is less reflective of the contractionary signals that rattled investors nearly seven years ago. Another contributing element, he noted, is the generally favorable seasonal pattern for US equity indices, which often rebound after a weak February and find firmer footing by mid-March. Finally, tight credit spreads—still below their highs seen in August 2024—point to stable credit markets that do not appear to be pricing in severe economic distress. Beyond the question of macro signals, Tomas openly admitted fatigue with the swirl of discussions around economic policy catalysts. “I’m honestly really bored with all the tariff talk,” he wrote, while reminding followers that April 2 remains pivotal for clarity. “April 2nd ‘tariff liberation day’ will probably play a big role in deciding,” he concluded.

Max Avery highlighted the significance of this development in a recent post , emphasizing Ondo’s role in bridging traditional financial instruments with blockchain-based solutions. He pointed out that despite Ondo’s rapid growth and success, the broader market has not fully recognized its impact. Avery stated, “Ondo Finance is building a direct line between well-established financial instruments and on-chain access with XRP Ledger and Stellar and people still aren’t paying enough attention.” He further explained that Ondo is addressing key inefficiencies in traditional finance, such as slow settlement times and limited accessibility, by leveraging blockchain technology. The Growth of Ondo’s Tokenized Treasury Market One of Ondo Finance’s main offerings, OUSG, has already surpassed $1 billion in demand. This product provides exposure to U.S. Treasuries with on-chain accessibility, allowing for 24/7 minting and redemption. Avery contrasted this with traditional finance, where transactions are restricted by banking hours, often delaying settlements to the next business day. He described OUSG as providing the benefits of Treasuries while incorporating the flexibility of digital assets. With OUSG now available on the XRP Ledger , investors can gain access to tokenized treasuries in a more efficient manner. Avery noted that this development eliminates arbitrary time restrictions that have long constrained traditional financial markets. By utilizing the XRP Ledger, Ondo Finance is tapping into a blockchain network known for its institutional partnerships and compliance-focused infrastructure. USDY and Its Role in Expanding Financial Access Ondo’s second major offering, USDY, functions differently from traditional stablecoins. Unlike stablecoins that simply hold their value, USDY is backed by U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits, generating yield over time. Avery highlighted how USDY on Stellar connects to a global payment network spanning 180 countries. This feature allows users worldwide, particularly those without stable access to the U.S. dollar, to benefit from Treasury yields. Avery explained that the introduction of USDY provides financial opportunities that were previously unavailable. He asked how millions facing inflation and currency devaluation could gain access to stable dollar yields without requiring a U.S. bank account. By deploying USDY on Stellar, Ondo Finance enables broader participation in global financial markets. Experienced Leadership and Regulatory Focus Ondo Finance’s leadership includes individuals with extensive experience in traditional finance and digital assets. Avery noted that President Justin Schmidt previously led digital assets at Goldman Sachs , while Vice President Katie Wheeler has held roles at Circle and BlackRock. Additionally, Ondo has recently appointed Patrick McHenry, the former Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, as Vice Chairman of its Advisory Board. Avery pointed out that McHenry’s addition brings regulatory expertise at a critical time when cryptocurrency policies are still evolving.

Avery emphasized that this combination allows Ondo to move faster than traditional financial institutions while maintaining compliance standards that attract institutional investors. A Multi-Chain Approach to Tokenized Assets Avery underscored the significance of Ondo’s decision to integrate with the XRP Ledger and Stellar. He explained that each blockchain serves a distinct purpose: the XRP Ledger supports institutional adoption and compliance, while Stellar is well-suited for global payments and financial inclusion. Ondo’s strategic use of these networks ensures that its products align with the strengths of each ecosystem. Looking ahead, Avery suggested that tokenized U.S. Treasuries are only the beginning. He predicted that corporate bonds, real estate, commodities, and alternative assets could soon follow, making financial markets more accessible and efficient. He described the potential for fractional ownership, automated payouts, and smart contracts that directly interact with real-world assets. Avery concluded that these advancements represent a shift toward a more accessible financial system. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Gox collapse Once the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy in 2014 after losing about 850,000 BTC, which was then valued at almost $500 million. The exchange attributed the loss to a hacking incident, which turned out to be the result of years of security lapses. The case has been the subject of numerous legal battles over the years, causing the repayment of creditors to be delayed. As of Mar. 25, data from Arkham Intelligence shows that Mt. Gox still holds about 35,000 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $3.08 billion. Last year, the exchange extended its repayment deadline from Oct. 31, 2024, to Oct. 31, 2025, citing delays in verification and processing. Historically, large Bitcoin transfers from entities like Mt. Gox have triggered market fluctuations . However, data suggests that recent movements have had less impact on Bitcoin’s price. The cryptocurrency is trading at around $86,500 at press time, showing a strong recovery from its recent 7-day low of $81,259.

Here’s MUTM Price Prediction for the Next Bull Run,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-mutuum-finance-mutm-the-golden-ticket-of-2025-heres-mutm-price-prediction-for-the-next-bull-run/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set the crypto market ablaze with speculation, with its presale already raking in over $4.7 million and over 6,500 holders in just a matter of weeks. Now in Phase 3 of an 11-phase presale, tokens are available for $0.02 each, over half of which have already been snapped up in advance of a 25% increase to $0.025 in Phase 4. Investors piling into MUTM today can lock in a 200% profit as soon as the token lists at $0.06, but projections after launch suggest a massive jump to $5 in 2025. Thanks to its decentralized lending framework and its buy pressure mechanism, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is on its way to becoming one of the most used tools in an area full of speculative assets. Rapid Presale Momentum Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 3 is racing toward a sell-out, driven by the anticipation of the next price spike. Anyone who purchases Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens in the early phases priced at $0.02 today will instantly see a 25% profit when Phase 4 launches at $0.025. This regimented climb provides technical gains for presale buyers as well, ending in a guaranteed 3x payout upon listing at $0.06. The project’s $100,000 giveaway — the chance for 10 early contributors to earn $10,000 each —has only added to the word, with investors pushing to stake a claim before the next stage of development launches. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing interest from both retail and institutional investors with the prospects of liquidity mining rewards and a peer-to-peer lending model, set to launch soon. Tokenomics Driving Demand for the Long Term Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with a self-funding ecosystem where platform revenue is utilized to automatically buyback Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This creates constant buy pressure and discourages sell-offs as these tokens are redistributed to stakers. Moreover, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol’s mtTokens — the interest-bearing assets that represent user deposits — add an extra layer of utility by enabling holders to earn passive yields on ETH, DAI or other supported cryptos. Analysts point to a scarcity model and overcollateralized lending of the token as events that should contribute further to stability, with post-launch estimates projected between $1.50 and $5. Investing $2,500 at the current presale price could swell to $125,000 if Mutuum Finance (MUTM) were to hit $5, representing 24,900% ROI. Strategic Roadmap for Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently getting a final smart contracts audit by Certik which once complete, should enhance investor confidence. Simultaneously, the team has hinted at plans for an overcollateralized stablecoin to deepen liquidity and expand borrowing options. In contrast with meme coins or trend-based coins, the value of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) depends on real use cases: making loans, deriving yields and connecting to off-chain DeFi systems. This real-world applicability has led to comparisons with early Ethereum adopters, with experts pointing to similarities in growth trajectories. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — is making the most of the volatility in the crypto market, rather than just getting by. The incentive structure aligns with utility of the platforms, and the project has created a green-print for ongoing demand. The small window to hop into Phase 3 is among the last to be able to stake Mutuum Finance (MUTM) below $0.025, a level inbound on your horizon — could soon become a lost memory. With Certik’s endorsement looming and exchange listings approaching, the real question is not if Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rise, but how high. For people looking for a 2025 golden ticket, time is sinking fast.

House of Doge is the Foundation’s corporate and commercialization unit, which was formed in February with a five-year deal in place. It hopes to position DOGE as a payment currency, away from its predominant existence as a memecoin, as part of a framework to show it can be used for everyday payments at very low fees. House of Doge added it will unveil partnerships with various payment processors in the coming months. “With a strategic reserve, the House of Doge is laying the foundation for a payments ecosystem that ensures liquidity, stability, and reliability,” said Michael Galloro, a Member of the Board-Elect of the House of Doge, in a release. “By maintaining a reserve, we can bridge the gap between transaction processing times and real-world usability, making Dogecoin extremely practical for everyday purchases.” DOGE was among the highest gains in the run-up to President Donald Trump’s election due to the possibility of its abbreviation becoming part of the administration: the “Department of Government Efficiency,” abbreviated as D.O.G.E.

Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Group will launch USDC, which will first be listed on the SBI VC Trade crypto exchange. SBI VC Trade recently received a regulatory nod to enable handling stablecoin listings in Japan. The approval made USDC the first and only global dollar stablecoin approved for use in the country. According to CoinGecko data , USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, following Tether in the lead. The stablecoin’s market cap currently stands at $59.7 billion. Besides, Circle is also planning to list the stablecoin on major crypto exchanges, including Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer. As previously reported, SBI VC Trade began a trial phase for USDC rollout to select users, starting March 12. Circle’s USDC Launch Aims to Drive Web3 Adoption in Japan Circle and SBI Holdings partnership will help foster “Web3 proliferation for the Japan market,” the company statement read. “We have spent 2+ years engaging with Japan’s regulators, major industry players, strategic parnters, banking partners and others to enable USDC for the Japanese market,” wrote Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, on X.

Japan’s Stance on Stablecoins After Regulatory Reforms In 2023, Japan lifted the ban on foreign stablecoins, paving the way for firms like SBI to expand their offerings. In February, Japan’s regulator – Financial Services Agency (FSA) – approved policy recommendations to relax stablecoin regulations further. FSA Commissioner Hideki told local news outlet Nikkei that stablecoins could enhance financial services by improving remittance and settlement processes. “Stablecoins are used soundly for the sophistication of remittance and settlement. I hope it will be done,” he said. Apart from Circle, SBI VC Trade and its parent firm have established partnerships with major U.S. exchanges such as Ripple.

In the last seven days, the total meme coin market cap has gained nearly 10% from $48 billion to $52 billion at press time. Amid these bullish tailwinds, can SHIB price reach the highly anticipated psychological level of $0.001? Shiba Inu Price in Focus Amid Mysterious 1B SHIB Burn The Shiba Inu burn rate skyrocketed recently after an unknown user burned 1,000,000,000 SHIB tokens. Data from Shibburn shows that this user sent these tokens to the burn address in a single transaction. Yesterday, another address also sent 23M SHIB to the burn address. SHIB Burn One of the main factors contributing to the high burn rate is a spike in activity on the Shibarium network. DeFi tracking tool DeFiLlama shows that in just one week, Shibarium’s TVL has increased by over $1M and recently reached its highest level since late January. Shiba Inu DeFi TVL As Shibarium records an uptick in activity, the burn rate will continue to surge and bring down SHIB’s supply. This will bode well for Shiba Inu price. SHIB Supply Crunch Looms Besides the token burns, Shiba Inu supply on exchanges has also reached its lowest level in four years. According to Santiment, SHIB’s exchange experienced a sharp decline earlier this year, and only 100.42 trillion tokens, valued at around $1.3 billion are available on exchanges. Shiba Inu Supply on Exchanges The amount of SHIB held on exchanges is only 16% of the meme coin’s circulating supply of 589 trillion tokens. This decline indicates that many SHIB holders are not holding their tokens on exchanges, which highlights a lack of intent to sell. As this supply continues to fall, it might cause a supply crunch where demand outpaces the supply. This could spark a parabolic rally for Shiba Inu price. Can Shiba Inu Reach $0.001? The $0.001 price target is realistic for Shiba Inu as that would give it a $589B market cap. One of the factors that could aid such a rally is a gradual increase in the SHIB burn rate. Additionally, increased activity on Shibarium could sustain a long-term uptrend. Early Bitcoin advocate Davinci Jeremie previously stated that Shibarium will unlock SHIB’s potential . The possible launch of a spot SHIB ETF as highlighted by SHIB marketing executive LUCIE could also drive a price rally to $0.001. If Shiba Inu outperforms the rest of the crypto market and attains this price target, it will not only be the largest meme coin but also the largest altcoin. Shiba Inu Price Analysis Shiba Inu price today trades at $0.0000135 with a 2.5% gain in 24 hours, The meme coin is on the verge of a breakout after breaking above the upper trendline of a descending parallel channel, indicating that bears are losing control as buying pressure rises. The rising RSI line also supports this bullish Shiba Inu price prediction . This indicator stands at 51, which is a neutral level. However, the making of higher lows shows that selling pressure is easing. Shiba Inu faces two key resistance levels which, if breached, will confirm a bullish reversal. One of these levels is the 50-day SMA of $0.0000141. If the meme coin flips this resistance, it could trigger a 36% surge to the 200-day SMA of $0.000019. SHIB/USDT: 4-hour Chart In summary, Shiba Inu price is likely to break crucial resistance at the 50-day SMA, which will confirm a reversal from bearish to bullish trends. The increasing burn rate caused by an uptick in activity on Shibarium as well as the falling supply on exchange could trigger a supply crunch. This could precede a parabolic rally for SHIB.

However, it faced immediate resistance at that point and was pushed south to under $87,000 as of now. Here are some of the possible reasons behind the correction. Technical Perspective CryptoPotato warned yesterday that BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), measuring the speed and change of price movements, had gone into an overbought territory above 70. Such rapid increases typically mean that the asset has reached a local top and could be heading for a correction. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez outlined on X what happened to bitcoin the last six times it went into an overbought state. Hint, they were all painful. Check out what happened to #Bitcoin $BTC the last six times the RSI hit overbought territory in the 4-hour chart! pic.twitter.com/N3J5fLR5so — Ali (@ali_charts) March 24, 2025 The second technical indicator that could be behind BTC’s rejection is the TD Sequential. It sort of complements the RSI as it also shows whether the buyers or sellers have reached market exhaustion. In the case of bitcoin, it suggested a short-term top after the recent rally toward $89,000. After timing the recent bottom, the TD Sequential indicator now suggests #Bitcoin $BTC may be approaching a short-term top, hinting at potential profit-taking ahead. pic.twitter.com/3NZOsKfXr1 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 24, 2025 The last potential reason from a technical perspective came in the form of resistance, which had built up around the $89,000 mark. It was created when the 50-day moving average and the descending trending from the ATH converged and acted as a big roadblock in BTC’s potential move toward $90,000 and $100,000, said Martinez. Whales Offloading and Bonus Big bitcoin holders, typically referred to as whales, used the opportunity to secure some profits amid BTC’s rally. According to Martinez, who cited data from Santiment, they disposed of more than 20,000 BTC, valued at roughly $1.8 billion at prices from the local peak. Recall that whales had been accumulating hard in the past month as BTC’s price tumbled but might have changed their strategy, at least for the short term. The bonus reason comes from Mt Gox. Arkham noted that wallets related to the failed exchange have moved $1 billion worth of BTC. Such transfers typically scare off the market, and they lead to brief corrections.

Memecoins like FARTCOIN and SPX6900 are leading the charge as they feature in the top 10 memecoin by gains on CoinMarketCap today. SPX6900 had a terrible start to 2025. Its recent price action has got many investors asking if a comeback is underway. $SPX Journey: Will It Sustain Its Recent Rally? SPX6900 has come a long way from its all-time high of $1.72. It dropped by more than 80% since January to a low of $0.25 before recent efforts at recovery pushed it above $0.5 in March, and now it is trading above $0.6. Earlier today, $SPX skyrocketed to the #7 spot among top meme coins with a $592.03M market cap. For a moment, it was the biggest 24-hour gainer among the top 10 crypto coins. However, it is still 63% down from its ATH of 2 months ago. The $0.6 level has acted as support for several months, so the bulls will be expecting a close above this level to confirm a bullish outlook. The $SPX price faced a significant correction, after which it has now regained two resistance levels. Analysts predict another correction incoming but say it could rise to as high as $1.80 before experiencing a decline. SPX6900 may be doing well in the short term, but crypto investors are looking for a more stable return on investment over the long term. Memecoins like Chill Drone ($CHONE), fusing meme culture, gamification, and AI, are top searches on some crypto exchanges. $CHONE Could Outshine Recent Gains In the Meme Market While the market is feeling good about $SPX, there are newer, finer coins like $CHONE that are more than capable of taking over the media. $CHONE especially has a refreshing narrative that exceeds the potential of its rivals in the market. $CHONE is the kind of meme coin that is most attractive to experienced traders, with its market cap below $400k. It’s the best type of meme coin to ape into, as it is the kind that experiences massive blowouts. Daily trading volume is just under $68k, with a price increase of 8% in the last 24 hours. $CHONE has a chilled outlook, but it has been designed to grow efficiently. Its use of AI emphasizes its potential for growth. Right now, users can access an AI assistant on $CHONE’s website to ease user experience and answer any questions investors might have. $CHONE is bound to experience growth in the near future and will be able to surpass market players like $SPX. Meme Coins Still Have A Stake In Crypto’s Future The market is steadily recovering, and more meme coins are gaining liquidity from big players. $SPX might be proof that the market is getting back on its feet, but $CHONE would be the coin used to restore investors’ egos. As more market players emerge, experiencing exponential growth, $CHONE will become a stable figure, like $SPX, climbing the ranks to establish itself. $CHONE currently sits at a good entry point of $0.00037, encouraging traders to take advantage of a high-growth potential.

Meanwhile, with the entry of the institutions, the trade dynamics of the entire market have changed to a large extent. Hence, the external factors now seem to have a limited impact on the BTC price, as it seems to be confident of a continued upswing hereafter. The US President Donald Trump lit the ‘tariff war’ a few days ago, which dragged the traditional and the crypto markets lower. Now that he has eased the April 2 tariff plan for a while, the markets seem to have gained some strength. On the other hand, a fresh wave of volatility is expected to hit the markets with the fresh updates on Mt. Gox. The platform has now moved more than 11,000 BTC worth over $1 billion, which has become a matter of concern. The experts believe a fresh wave of volatility may strike the crypto markets, which may increase the selling pressure. It’s not the first time Mt. Gox made such moves. Previously, when it began its rehabilitation program, the creditors demonstrated a huge confidence in the upcoming price trend. As a result, the BTC price faced a minimal impact, which was short-lived. Moreover, the current market dynamics suggest the price may not be impacted by the current move too. Now the question arises: Will Bitcoin’s (BTC) price close the quarterly trade above $90,000? After rising above the 200-day MA, the BTC price has entered a secured range between the 50-day and 200-day MA, which is acting as strong resistance and support levels. Moreover, the baseline of Ichimoku is acting as a support, aiming for a bullish crossover in the next few days. This may happen only if the price continues to form constant higher highs and lows and eventually tests the 50-day MA close to $90,000. Meanwhile, the RSI remains elevated, even though the pace is extremely low. On the other hand, the MACD shows a rise in the buying pressure, but the levels remain within a negative range. Hence, no bullish confirmation can be validated unless the RSI breaks above 65 while the MACD is expected to rise to the positive range and to do so, a notable rise in the buying volume is a must. Therefore, the upcoming monthly close can be as important as the rise in volume may revive a strong ascending trend ahead.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 07:42:00

While such transactions have sometimes occurred before refunds to creditors, it is currently unclear whether this move is part of an upcoming distribution. Potential Market Impact Mt.Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange, is gradually repaying 142,000 BTC ($11 billion) and 143,000 Bitcoin Cash to its creditors. Some creditors received refunds through Kraken and Bitstamp, but the exchange postponed the refund deadline to October 31, 2025. With 35,583 BTC ($3.1 billion) still in Mt. Gox’s possession, concerns remain over potential selling pressure if these assets are distributed to creditors and subsequently liquidated.

Ethereum ( ETH ) has seemingly stuck in limbo as it’s giving away its value for free to layer-2 networks while struggling to keep investors interested. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has dropped 40% in the past three months, with Standard Chartered analysts now saying the network if facing “midlife crisis.” In an interview with the Financial Times, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research Geoff Kendrick said the network “gave away value for free” as with layer-2 networks Ethereum has “essentially commoditized itself.” Now, Ethereum is struggling with keeping its price from falling even further. As of press time, ETH is trading at around $2,054, after plunging to $1,813 earlier in March. Kaiko’s research analyst Adam McCarthy says the decline might be tied due to the fact that Ethereum “is just not interesting to most people.” “It’s hard to get too excited about amazing feats of engineering when there [are] so many competing things now in the attention economy.” Adam McCarthy You might also like: Ethereum leadership now eyes Solana-style growth, Dragonfly’s Qureshi says At the same time, Ethereum’s developers are struggling with internal disagreements, and user activity on the network hasn’t picked up, noted Carol Alexander, a finance professor at the University of Sussex. She added that the decentralized finance vision now feels “much further away now than a year ago” and that decision-making in the Ethereum community has become “a bit of a shambles.” Ethereum’s direction has been under scrutiny lately as even former Ethereum Foundation engineer Harikrishnan Mulackal criticized the network’s governance, saying it suffers from a “lack of a clear and cohesive vision.” Per Mulackal, without stronger leadership, Ethereum could stagnate, suggesting that the network should push for faster updates and ship “one hard fork each quarter.” Otherwise, he said, Ethereum risks reproducing “exactly the same result” as the past five years.

Several prediction models forecast YFI price to retest its all-time high of around $100k by 2030. The growth and adoption of Yearn Finance in 2025 and beyond will heavily pivot towards the protocol’s ability to adapt to the changing DeFi space. In the past, the Yearn Finance protocol has collaborated with other Web3 projects – led by Curve, AAVE, Optimism, and Arbitrum, among others – to ensure a sustainable future. With nearly $200 million in total value locked (TVL) the yearn finance protocol remains a top -tier platform in yield optimization. However, the Yearn Finance platform faces immense competition from other DeFi aggregators led by Convex Finance.

In the remaining three quarters of 2025, YFI price will likely rebound from the multi-year support level of about $4,600 and establish a new bullish trend.

The Yearn.Finance protocol faces an uphill task of competing with dozens of other DeFi projects competing for the same market. The YFI investors should consider regulatory compliance and the environment in major jurisdictions led by the United States. Is YFI’s price tied to Bitcoin or Ethereum? In the past 30 days, YFI has depicted a 0.79 out of 1 price correlation with Bitcoin according to Intotheblock. The high correlation could continue in the coming years amid the mainstream adoption of DeFi protocols by institutional investors. Will YFI price reach $100k by 2030?

On 24 March, two key bills—Senate Bill 1373 and Senate Bill 1025—cleared the House Rules Committee. If passed, the legislation would empower the state to create digital asset reserves using both seized cryptocurrencies and allocated public funds. Bitcoin Laws @Bitcoin_Laws · Follow 🇺🇸 State Reserve Race Update:Arizona’s House Rules Committee passed both Bitcoin Reserve Bills (SB1373 and SB1025), ruling them “constitutional and in proper form.”The bills have now passed their assigned committees, meaning they should be headed for a full floor vote. 3:27 am · 25 Mar 2025 390 Reply Copy link Read 10 replies With a Republican majority in the state House, the proposals now face a crucial floor vote that could place Arizona among the first US states to formally integrate crypto into treasury and retirement operations. Bitcoin, crypto bills move forward Senate Bill 1373, known as the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill, proposes the creation of a fund comprised of digital assets seized during criminal proceedings. The bill designates the Arizona State Treasurer as the fund’s manager, with oversight ensuring controlled exposure to market volatility. It includes a cap of 10% on the amount of the reserve that can be invested each year. It also allows the state to lend digital assets under the condition that such activity does not increase financial risk. This framework aims to turn previously confiscated assets into productive reserves without speculative exposure. Senate Bill 1025, named the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, focuses exclusively on Bitcoin. The bill would allow the state treasury and retirement system to allocate up to 10% of available funds into Bitcoin. It also includes a provision requiring the Bitcoin to be stored in a secure, segregated Federal Reserve account. Fiat Archive @fiatarchive · Follow JUST IN: 🇺🇲 Arizona’s House Rules Committee passed both Bitcoin Reserve Bills (SB1373 and SB1025), ruling them “constitutional and in proper form.” 👏The bills have now passed their assigned committees, meaning they should be headed for a full floor vote. 4:08 am · 25 Mar 2025 94 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies Political risks remain The two proposals will now head to the state House floor for a final vote. Arizona’s lower chamber has a 33-27 Republican majority, potentially easing the passage of the bills. However, even with legislative support, Governor Katie Hobbs’ stance remains uncertain. Governor Hobbs, a Democrat, has vetoed 22% of the bills passed in 2024 so far—the highest rate of any US governor this year. Her approach to cryptocurrency-related legislation has not been publicly clarified, adding uncertainty to the future of the proposed crypto reserve. The approval of either or both bills would mark a shift in Arizona’s approach to fiscal diversification. By incorporating crypto assets, the state aims to supplement its traditional financial reserves while also experimenting with blockchain-based monetary strategies. Other states expand Bitcoin reserve plans Arizona is not alone in this shift. A wave of similar proposals is emerging across the US, reflecting broader interest in digital assets among state governments. In Texas, the Senate passed its own version of a Bitcoin reserve bill (SB-21) with a 25-5 vote. That legislation awaits a House vote and gubernatorial decision. In a related move, Representative Ron Reynolds has proposed a cap of $250 million for the reserve. Meanwhile, Oklahoma’s House passed Bitcoin Reserve Bill HB1203 with a 77-15 vote on 25 March, sending it to the state Senate. Utah also introduced legislation along similar lines, although the section calling for a strategic reserve was eventually removed before advancing further. By allocating small portions of their treasuries or seized assets into cryptocurrencies, state governments are exploring new methods of value preservation, hedging, and returns. If the bills become law, Arizona will set a precedent for managing public digital assets through a conservative, regulated framework. The 10% allocation cap in both proposals reflects an attempt to balance innovation with fiscal responsibility.

The reserve began with an initial purchase of 10 million DOGE, a move designed to boost adoption of the meme coin as a serious payment solution. The goal behind the reserve is to solve one of crypto’s biggest problems: slow transaction times. Digital currencies often struggle with real-world usability because of delays in confirming payments. To fix this, the reserve will act as a buffer, helping to speed up Dogecoin transactions and make them smoother for businesses and users alike. Michael Galloro, a board member of the House of Doge, explained that the reserve will help make Dogecoin as reliable as traditional payment systems. Dogecoin already offers faster-than-average confirmation times, around one minute per transaction, which makes it a strong competitor for everyday purchases. Another key benefit is Dogecoin’s low transaction fees. Compared to the higher costs of using credit cards or traditional banks , Dogecoin stands out as a cost-effective payment method . The fees are a fraction of what users might pay through other systems, giving businesses a reason to consider DOGE as a payment option. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply, Dogecoin uses an inflationary model. Around 5.2 billion new coins enter circulation each year. This ongoing supply supports regular usage rather than encouraging people to simply hold the coin as a long-term asset. The House of Doge sees this steady liquidity as a strong point for building a reliable payment network. “With this reserve, we’re building the base for a system that prioritizes speed, stability, and daily use,” said Galloro. The organization wants to create an ecosystem where Dogecoin isn’t just a meme—it’s a functional digital currency that people and businesses use every day. Looking ahead, House of Doge is planning to roll out strategic partnerships aimed at demonstrating how scalable and useful Dogecoin can be in the real world. It also plans to launch reward programs such as merchant benefits and cashback incentives to further encourage adoption. Following the reserve announcement, Dogecoin saw a rise in both price and trading volume, reflecting a strong response from the market. These developments suggest growing momentum behind Dogecoin’s shift from joke coin to serious financial tool.",,EN,0,0,DOGE|FIAT|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-25 07:48:38

Aimed at reducing the country’s $1.2 trillion trade deficit, this policy shift could have a noticeable impact on financial markets, including crypto. Trump may hold back from imposing the most aggressive tariffs on key industries like automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. Instead, he might focus on a smaller group of countries—known informally as the “Dirty 15”—with large trade surpluses and high barriers to American exports. While this could signal a softer approach, nothing is set in stone. Trump has reversed course before, keeping both traditional and digital markets on edge. However, if the policy ends up being more selective or delayed, it could ease pressure on investors , especially after recent months of heightened macroeconomic tension. Historically, broad tariffs have led to market downturns, while lighter or delayed actions often provide relief. For crypto, which behaves like a risk-on asset, this means price movement could closely follow the tone of Trump’s final decision. If the administration pushes ahead with broad and aggressive tariffs , investor risk sentiment would likely weaken. Stock and bond markets might drop, and crypto could follow, with Bitcoin and Ethereum under pressure. Traders may move capital to the U.S. dollar or cash, reducing short-term interest in speculative digital assets. A similar pattern occurred in February, when tough tariff talk helped push Bitcoin below key price levels. On the other hand, if Trump announces a narrower, more targeted tariff strategy , the markets could see a short-term bounce. Crypto would benefit from reduced uncertainty and calmer investor sentiment. As seen earlier in March, even slight signals of policy flexibility helped Bitcoin climb back from recent lows. A measured approach could trigger another mini-rally. Trump’s unpredictability on trade continues to stir macroeconomic volatility , which heavily influences crypto prices. Even though digital currencies aren’t directly tied to trade, they react quickly to changes in global risk appetite and liquidity. In summary, how the April 2 tariffs unfold could shape the near-term direction of the crypto market. Aggressive tariffs could weigh on Bitcoin and Ethereum, while delayed or targeted actions might spark a rebound. Investors and traders are closely watching for clarity as crypto remains tightly linked to macro headlines.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-25 07:52:51

While there's no official statement from WLFI or Binance, the appearance of USD1—and its interaction with leading market maker Wintermute —has sparked rumors of a potential partnership involving Binance and possibly even the Trump family. The speculation began after reports suggested WLFI could be working with Binance to launch a USD-backed stablecoin, with the Trump family potentially investing in the venture. This week, the crypto community spotted USD1 on Binance Smart Chain, fueling chatter that the stablecoin may be tied to those earlier reports. A social media post claiming the ""Trump Family Foundation just issued a stablecoin on BSC"" went viral, further intensifying the conversation. The fact that Wintermute, a highly influential crypto market maker with billions in daily volume, interacted with USD1 only added to the intrigue. Wintermute has a known history of working with Binance and backing other crypto projects, which has increased interest in USD1's legitimacy. Former Binance CEO Changpeng “ CZ ” Zhao also commented on the situation. He confirmed that the USD1 smart contract had been deployed 20 days earlier and welcomed the token to BNB Chain. However, he later warned the community about scams using the USD1 name, clarifying that “the official USD1 is not tradable yet.” His wording left some readers confused, as it acknowledged an ""official"" version of the token without confirming any ties between Binance and WLFI. The lack of clarity has raised concerns. Some in the community noted that CZ’s spontaneous social media posts could easily be misinterpreted as endorsements or confirmations. Influencers reminded their followers not to take his comments out of context, especially in the absence of formal statements. So far, neither Binance nor WLFI has officially confirmed any partnership or acknowledged involvement with the USD1 stablecoin. Both have also denied earlier claims suggesting direct collaboration. Until more information is released, the status of USD1 remains uncertain , and the crypto world will be watching closely for any updates.",,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-25 07:55:45

The move comes after SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings, received regulatory approval to list USDC under the Japan Financial Services Agency’s (FSA) stablecoin framework earlier this month. Announced on March 24, Circle confirmed that USDC trading will commence on SBI VC Trade starting March 26, making it the first platform in Japan to offer the US dollar-pegged stablecoin. The company also revealed plans to expand its reach by listing USDC on other major Japanese exchanges, including Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer, in the near future. The bitbank and bitFlyer platforms collectively processed over $50 million in daily trading volume last week and saw 1.85 million website visits over the past month, highlighting their significant influence in Japan’s crypto market. Strategic Expansion After Years of Negotiation Circle’s entry into Japan follows two years of discussions with regulators, financial institutions, and industry players, according to CEO Jeremy Allaire. In a March 24 X post , Allaire expressed optimism about the launch, stating that it will open up new opportunities for digital payments, cross-border finance, and foreign exchange (FX). The launch was welcomed by SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao, who stated that the stablecoin’s introduction would enhance financial accessibility and accelerate innovation in Japan’s blockchain-powered economy. USDC Maintains Its Position Circle’s regulatory win in Japan comes shortly after the company made strides in the Middle East. On Feb. 24, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) officially recognized USDC and Circle’s euro-backed EURC stablecoin under its new regulatory regime. USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, with $59.7 billion in circulation, trailing only Tether (USDT), which holds a dominant $143.8 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko.

If successful, the partnership could combine crypto-native features with Visa’s vast global customer base, creating a new way to process stablecoin payments at scale. The talks were initiated by Tools for Humanity, the company behind World Network. According to sources, the goal is to build a wallet that acts like a “mini bank account” , featuring fiat on-ramps, foreign exchange capabilities, and on-chain card services. This would allow stablecoin transactions across Visa’s massive infrastructure. Crypto influencer Mario Nawfal highlighted the effort, stating that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is reportedly leading the discussions with Visa. The wallet would be tied to the Worldcoin ecosystem and aim to simplify stablecoin payments in a way that mirrors traditional finance tools. In response to the news, Worldcoin’s price surged , gaining significant attention from the crypto community. This price jump reflects investor optimism, although it remains unclear how likely a final agreement is. Both companies have yet to confirm any official deal, and negotiations appear to be in the early stages. Visa has previously engaged with the crypto industry. In 2024, the company entered the real-world asset (RWA) space and partnered with platforms like Coinbase to enable faster fund transfers using Visa-branded debit cards. However, Visa’s earlier explorations into stablecoin integration had mixed outcomes. Some internal reports suggested that stablecoins could even disrupt Visa’s traditional revenue models. Despite those concerns, Visa is clearly continuing to explore crypto-related solutions, especially as stablecoins become more prominent in the global financial landscape. Industry voices, including former President Donald Trump , have recently emphasized the importance of stablecoins in maintaining U.S. dollar dominance . Likewise, pending regulations in the U.S. reflect growing interest among traditional institutions to enter the stablecoin space. For World Network, the potential partnership offers a chance to rebuild momentum. After facing regulatory pushback and a sharp price decline in 2024, this news has helped revive community confidence. The proposed stablecoin wallet could position World Network as a serious player in the broader digital finance ecosystem, especially if backed by a legacy payments brand like Visa. As of now, there is no confirmation or timeline for a possible deal. But the market’s response and the active discussions between the two parties suggest that stablecoins may soon play a much larger role in mainstream finance.",,EN,0,0,TRADING|WLD|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-25 07:58:37

Massive moves are happening across the board, and traders are on high alert. In a bold play, a whale just sold 356,665 Chainlink tokens, pocketing $4.59 million in USDC as LINK hit $12.88. But that’s not the only headline grabbing attention. Aave Labs has dropped its latest DeFi platform, aimed at bridging traditional finance with blockchain—and it’s already turning heads. While Chainlink and Aave make waves, BlockDAG (BDAG) is stealing the show. With a jaw-dropping $206 million raised in presale and 18.8 billion BDAG sold, BlockDAG is firing on all cylinders. The excitement is cranked up thanks to its Affiliate Program, giving traders back-to-back USDT rewards. It’s pure earning on repeat, and it’s happening right now. Chainlink Tokens: Whale Dumps 356k LINK for $4.59M—What’s Next? Chainlink tokens made headlines after a whale dumped 356,665 LINK, cashing out $4.59 million in USDC as prices hit $12.88. This quick sell-off came right after LINK jumped from $11.94, locking in profits. But here’s the catch—despite these short-term wins, Chainlink tokens have been on shaky ground. LINK has dropped 32.9% over the last month and is down 23.4% in just the past week. Even with its current price inching up to $13.14, there’s still a big question mark. Without serious buying pressure, Chainlink risks losing momentum. Many are wondering if LINK still deserves its spot among the highest ROI crypto plays—or if its best days are behind it. Aave Labs Targets Institutions with Horizon, but Will It Work? Aave Labs is pushing hard to lure institutional investors with its new Horizon initiative. The focus? Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), from stocks to real estate. Aave’s making a play for big money by blending traditional finance with DeFi. It’s offering lending options, investment vehicles—you name it. But there’s a catch. Strict KYC and AML rules make onboarding tough. Big investors are cautious, and regulations could throw even more roadblocks in the way. Add to that the usual blockchain security risks and technical hurdles, and it’s a bumpy road ahead. Some worry that Aave Labs’ shift toward institutions could alienate retail users altogether. Right now, many traders are eyeing higher ROI crypto alternatives with more immediate potential. BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program Pays 5% USDT Instantly—Earn Nonstop! BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program is shaking things up. Here’s how it works: share your link, and when someone buys BDAG, both of you score an instant 5% cashback in USDT. Simple, fast, and it doesn’t stop. Whether it’s one $10K buy (giving both of you 500 USDT) or dozens of smaller deals stacking rewards, the earning potential here is huge. The presale already tells the story. BlockDAG has raked in $206 million so far, with over 18.9 billion coins sold. Early buyers who got in at $0.001 have seen gains rocket by 2,380%—and the current batch price of $0.0248 is climbing fast. Thanks to the Affiliate Program, buying pressure is higher than ever. More referrals bring more buyers. More buyers create more scarcity. And as Batch 27 nears sellout, things are moving faster than ever. But here’s the kicker—this cashback cycle won’t last forever. When the Affiliate Program wraps up, so does the easiest way to stack BDAG and USDT at the same time. The clock’s ticking. For traders wanting in on the action before the next price spike, the moment to move is now. Summing Up! Chainlink tokens are still fighting market swings, and while whales are locking in profits, long-term growth looks shaky. Aave Labs is expanding into tokenized assets, but its success depends on getting institutions on board—and that’s a big ‘if.’ Meanwhile, BlockDAG is in hyperdrive. With $206 million already raised and 18.8 billion BDAG snapped up, it’s speeding toward its $600 million presale goal. Its Affiliate Program is flooding the market with new buyers, all chasing USDT rewards and price gains. With a 2,380% price increase from its starting point, BDAG is staking its claim as the highest ROI crypto on the table right now.

CEO Michael Saylor announced the company acquired 6,911 BTC for $584 million , pushing its total holdings past 500,000 Bitcoin. This move, made during a period of rising BTC prices, boosted investor confidence across the crypto market. Saylor stated the purchase was funded through the company’s STRK perpetual security , a debt-based financial tool recently launched to support ongoing Bitcoin acquisitions. The company increased its recent stock offering by over $200 million to make this buy possible. However, this aggressive accumulation strategy also raises long-term concerns. Strategy now holds more than 506,000 BTC, acquired at an average price near $66,000 per coin. This total represents over $33 billion in value, making the company one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. The latest purchase underlines Strategy's unwavering belief in Bitcoin's long-term value and its role in building digital financial infrastructure. But the firm's Bitcoin play isn't without risks. Strategy heavily depends on debt financing to continue acquiring BTC. Despite the bullish impact on market sentiment, this approach has resulted in ongoing negative cash flow. Many in the crypto space see Strategy’s buying activity as a key market signal—if that ever slows or reverses, confidence could quickly fade. Selling even a small portion of Strategy’s Bitcoin reserves could severely shake the market. Analysts warn that any forced liquidation, especially during a BTC downturn, would be interpreted as a very bearish signal. With the company so publicly committed to holding, any deviation from this stance could send shockwaves. Another concern lies in tax exposure and future obligations. While BTC’s price recovery has helped the firm stay afloat, the pressure to maintain investor trust remains high. The current strategy hinges on Bitcoin’s continued rise. If prices fall significantly, Strategy’s large debt position could become a major liability. Still, as of now, Bitcoin is gaining momentum , and Strategy’s consistent buying has become a stabilizing force in the crypto ecosystem. Since late 2024, the company’s purchases have accelerated—even as prices hit new highs—signaling Saylor’s dedication to supporting BTC. While Strategy’s bold stance continues to excite crypto advocates, it also ties the company’s future closely to Bitcoin’s success. The risk is high, but for now, Strategy remains one of the strongest institutional backers of the digital asset.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-25 08:02:04

Trump says next Wednesday, April 2nd, will be “ Liberation Day in America ,” when he’ll slap tariffs on countries around the world. However, the Trump Administration has sent mixed signals about the severity of those upcoming tariffs. Krüger tells his 208,500 followers on the social media platform X that April 2nd “will be similar to election night” in its impact on the markets, potentially including crypto markets. “It is the biggest event of the year by an order of magnitude. 10x more important than any FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee), which is a lot. And anything can happen. Trump could go soft, in which case markets would rally fast and furiously. Or could go half-way, adding uncertainty on timelines, in which case markets would take out the stops of all longs and shorts. Or go all out, in which case markets could easily crash another 10% to 15%, fast. In the worst-case scenario, sh*t would hit the fan then tariffs would start coming off as Trump negotiates hard in the following month, in which case peak negativity would hit around week two of April, which would coincide with US Tax Day. The US economy is still strong, but will highly likely slow down due to tariffs regardless of the path Trump chooses. But every economist already expects a very sharp economic slow-down into year-end. Which means, it is already largely priced in.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Binance announced that a market maker in MOVE made a net profit of $38 million by selling 66 million MOVE tokens. “We have confirmed that a Movement (MOVE) market maker is associated with another market maker that was recently removed from the exchange for illegal activities. As a result, we removed the market maker from the exchange and banned all market making activities on Binance.” Binance also explained the inappropriate behavior of the banned MOVE market maker, and listed it as follows: “A day after MOVE was listed, on 2024-12-10 (UTC), approximately 66 million MOVE tokens were sold by the Market Maker and very few buy orders were placed. The Market Maker made a net profit of 38 million USDT before being delisted on March 18, 2025.” To be Paid as Compensation! Binance also added that in order to protect users, they have frozen the profits made by the market maker and these will be paid out to users as compensation. “Furthermore, to compensate Binance users, we have frozen the profits made by the market maker. Specific compensation plans will be announced later.” Statement from Movement: We Did Not Know! The Movement team did not remain silent in this situation and announced a $38 million buyback plan in its statement. The team stated that the market maker's illegal activities were carried out without permission, and said, “As a result of Binance's investigation, we learned that the market maker sold a large amount of MOVE after listing. The market maker's illegal activities occurred without our permission. We have immediately terminated all contracts with the market maker and will be implementing a MOVE buyback plan on Binance over the next three months.” MOVE continues to trade at $0.46, up 6% in the last 24 hours. *This is not investment advice.

The breakneck speed at which technology is evolving today is contributing to consistent breakthroughs, especially in the areas of health and finance. As innovators in the tech and healthcare space deftly navigate the complexities of transforming industries, the investment landscape also begins to shift. The obvious similarities between cryptocurrency and AI are opening the door for wild potential in the future and enhancing opportunities for investors. Advancements and challenges in the AI revolution While artificial intelligence (AI) is not a new discovery, its role in the healthcare space is novel. AI is revolutionizing spaces such as drug discovery and drug development, data collection and interpretation, and efficiency improvement in all areas of the pharma industry. AI-driven solutions are still in their relative infancy for healthcare applications, but their potential is already crystal clear concerning improving efficiency, reducing failure rates, and accelerating the time-to-market for new drugs. Integrating AI technology into the pharma sector can be a complex undertaking, presenting several challenges for those on the front lines of AI innovation. Regulatory and compliance guidelines have not always kept pace with discovery, leading to unnecessary hurdles in the rollout of new drugs and processes. Data availability, quality, and security may be lacking. Pharmaceutical data is often fragmented across different institutions, creating accessibility barriers. Data privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR also limit the availability of real-world patient data for AI training. This is where blockchain technology can assist the emergence of effective AI in healthcare. By leveraging federated learning, AI models can be trained across decentralized data sources without compromising privacy. Investment in AI models can also be met with skepticism. Many AI models function as black boxes, making it difficult for regulators and pharma executives to trust their recommendations. Lack of interpretability in AI-driven drug discovery models can create distrust in clinical and regulatory environments. Cost is a significant barrier to AI implementation in healthcare. AI integration requires substantial investment in infrastructure, talent acquisition, and computational power. Training AI models on biomedical data is expensive and requires access to cloud computing resources, GPUs, and specialized algorithms. Pharma companies may hesitate to invest in AI without immediate financial returns. To combat this issue, many are turning to cost-effective AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) models, allowing pharma companies to use AI solutions without massive upfront investment, exploring public-private partnerships, and grant funding to support AI-driven research in pharma, or leveraging pre-trained AI models and transfer learning techniques to reduce training costs. Crypto investment and AI With AI poised to redefine the healthcare landscape, it is no wonder cryptocurrency investors have a keen interest in the technology. The interwoven nature of blockchain technology and healthcare AI applications for security and efficiency appeals to the burgeoning crypto market. While overcoming the mentioned challenges in AI integration will be critical for market application success, catering to the investment interests of crypto investors will also be significant in the overall adoption of AI in the pharma space. Advancements in AI in the pharma sector have led to an uptick in venture capital investment, strengthening the trust muscle of other interested parties, such as crypto investors. According to a recent study, 38% of new investment dollars allocated for healthcare are directed towards AI-enabled technologies. The validity of AI partnerships and the necessity of AI assistance in pharma development and discovery efficiency have driven investment. The convergence of AI and cryptocurrency is already emerging through crypto, such as AxonDAO ($AXGT) and Welshare Health ($WEL) , creating opportunities for crypto investors to enter the space. The currently available advancements of AI in the pharma sector are just the tip of the iceberg. Investors should be aware of the exponential growth potential in healthcare AI. As innovators navigate the myriad of hurdles on the pathway to full adoption — such as regulatory matters and investor skepticism — they continue to make welcomed advancements in the space. Crypto investors are likely to play a crucial role in the future adoption of AI in healthcare.

After years of battling a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company is now poised for a major Ripple expansion within the United States. This pivotal moment, as revealed by CEO Brad Garlinghouse in a recent FOX Business interview, marks a turning point for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. What Sparked Ripple’s US Expansion Plans? For those closely following the crypto saga, the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple has been a major industry talking point. Garlinghouse explained that the legal battle had effectively pushed a staggering 95% of Ripple’s business operations overseas. This was a strategic move to navigate the regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. However, with the SEC deciding to drop the case, the doors are now wide open for Ripple to re-establish and amplify its presence in its home country. This development is not just about reclaiming lost ground; it’s about capitalizing on a renewed interest in crypto within the U.S. market. Garlinghouse highlighted a notable surge in domestic interest, particularly since President Donald Trump’s administration. According to CoinGape, this resurgence has translated into tangible business growth, with Ripple securing more deals post-Trump’s inauguration than in the six months preceding it. This indicates a favorable shift in the regulatory and business environment, encouraging XRP US operations. Decoding the Impact of the SEC Lawsuit on Ripple The now-resolved SEC lawsuit has undeniably cast a long shadow over Ripple’s operations. Let’s break down the key impacts: Business Relocation: As mentioned, the lawsuit prompted Ripple to move the vast majority of its business overseas to regions with clearer crypto regulations. Market Uncertainty: The legal ambiguity created by the lawsuit likely deterred some potential US partnerships and investments, as businesses hesitated to engage with a company embroiled in regulatory disputes. Focus Shift: Ripple had to dedicate significant resources – both financial and human – to defend itself against the SEC, diverting attention and resources from potential growth initiatives within the US. Reputational Impact: While Ripple ultimately prevailed in key aspects of the case, the lawsuit inevitably had some impact on its public image, particularly in the US market. Brad Garlinghouse’s Vision for Ripple’s Future Brad Garlinghouse ‘s statements offer a glimpse into Ripple’s strategic direction moving forward. His optimism about expanding in the U.S. is palpable, and it’s rooted in both the legal victory and the evolving crypto landscape. Here’s what we can infer about his vision: Renewed Focus on the US Market: The most immediate impact will be a strategic pivot back towards the U.S. market, aiming to capture the growing domestic interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Strategic Partnerships: We can anticipate Ripple actively seeking new partnerships and collaborations with US-based financial institutions and businesses, leveraging its technology for cross-border payments and other applications. Regulatory Engagement: Having navigated a major regulatory challenge, Ripple is likely to engage proactively with US regulators to foster a clearer and more supportive regulatory framework for the crypto industry. Technological Innovation: With the legal hurdle removed, Ripple can refocus more intensely on developing and deploying innovative blockchain solutions, potentially expanding beyond its core payment focus. Crypto Regulation in the US: A Shifting Landscape? Ripple’s situation is inextricably linked to the broader discussion of crypto regulation in the United States. The SEC lawsuit, while specific to Ripple, highlighted the regulatory uncertainties that have plagued the crypto industry in the US. Is the tide turning? Here are some points to consider: Aspect Previous Scenario (Pre-Lawsuit Resolution) Potential Future (Post-Lawsuit Resolution) Regulatory Clarity Significant uncertainty regarding crypto classifications and enforcement actions. Potential for increased clarity and more defined regulatory boundaries, possibly through legislative or further judicial guidance. Industry Confidence Hesitation and caution among businesses due to regulatory risks. Boosted confidence and increased investment in the crypto sector as regulatory fears subside. Innovation Potential stifling of innovation due to regulatory hurdles and legal costs. Greater freedom to innovate and develop new crypto products and services within a more predictable regulatory environment. Market Access Limited access to the US market for some crypto businesses due to regulatory complexities. Improved market access and opportunities for crypto companies to operate and grow in the US. What Does This Mean for XRP Holders and the Crypto Market? Ripple’s positive developments often have ripple effects (pun intended!) across the crypto market. For XRP holders, the news of US expansion is undoubtedly encouraging. It signals a potential increase in XRP’s utility and adoption, particularly within the US market. A stronger Ripple presence in the US could translate to: Increased XRP Demand: As Ripple expands its US operations and forges new partnerships, the demand for XRP, used in Ripple’s payment solutions, could see a boost. Positive Price Sentiment: Positive news surrounding Ripple often positively impacts XRP’s price. US expansion could further fuel positive market sentiment. Broader Market Confidence: Ripple’s victory and expansion can be seen as a positive signal for the entire crypto market, indicating that regulatory challenges can be overcome and that growth opportunities persist. Final Thoughts: A New Chapter for Ripple and XRP? The SEC lawsuit resolution and Ripple’s renewed focus on Ripple expansion in the US mark a significant turning point. While challenges and regulatory nuances will undoubtedly remain, the path forward appears brighter for Ripple and XRP. Brad Garlinghouse’s optimistic outlook reflects a broader sentiment within the crypto industry – a sense of resilience, growth, and increasing acceptance. As Ripple steps into this new chapter, the crypto world will be watching closely to see how this expansion unfolds and what impact it will have on the future of digital finance.

If you're exploring XRP price predictions, you've likely noticed the current bullish sentiment around Ripple as its SEC case nears resolution. Many market analysts believe XRP could see significant growth thanks to increased institutional adoption for cross border payments. However, if you're looking for a cheap crypto with massive potential, consider Dawgz AI. With a low entry price compared to XRP’s higher market cap and substantial circulating supply, Dawgz AI offers early investors excellent opportunities for bigger returns in the crowded crypto market.

He explains that its AI-powered trading algorithms, audited security, and growth potential make it stand out from other meme coins. Conclusion XRP price prediction remains highly dependent on the SEC case resolution, with 2025 projections showing potential ROI up to 74.66% and prices potentially reaching $2-$7. While these numbers suggest reason for optimism, XRP faces structural challenges in reaching higher price targets like $20-$100.

The cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, with both established coins like XRP and newcomers like DAWGZ AI presenting different risk-reward profiles for digital asset investors. Frequently Asked Questions Will XRP reach $100 dollars? While some enthusiasts remain optimistic, XRP reaching $100 is extremely unlikely soon, as it requires a multi-trillion-dollar market cap, surpassing the entire crypto market, including rapidly growing coins like Dawgz AI. What is the price prediction of XRP in 2025? Technical analysis suggests XRP may trade between $2-$7 by 2025, influenced by regulation, adoption rates, market conditions, and competition from trending cryptocurrencies such as Dawgz AI. Will XRP reach $50 dollars? XRP hitting $50 faces significant challenges, needing a $2.5 trillion market cap- higher than today's total crypto market, including promising new tokens like Dawgz AI. Will XRP reach $20? XRP reaching $20 is somewhat plausible but difficult, requiring major institutional backing, positive regulatory news, significant global network growth, and overcoming competition from popular coins like Dawgz AI.

As institutional enthusiasm is building in tandem with BTC’s technical momentum (the latter noted by the likes of Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood) — so too is demand for increasingly sought-after supply with tokens such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which, with estimates predicting a post-launch 53x rise, is now racing through its third presale phase. The Technical Momentum of Bitcoin Is Building Van Lagen’s most recent evaluation shows that Bitcoin is currently in Wave 5 of the Elliott wave theory, a stage of the cycle that has a history of seeing explosive price growth. The megaphone pattern’s structure — identified by ascending peaks and descending troughs — had created the groundwork for a multi-year accumulation cycle. Each “base” phase since then has methodically shaken out speculative holders while gradually accruing institutional capital — notable accumulations that will set the groundwork for this one to develop into sustainable upward momentum. Bitcoin price actions are similar to past bull cycles, but this one has multiple times upside potential with this current wave expected to extend gains 1.618x to 2x. This technical fabric aligns nicely with growing adoption metrics; to name a few, spot ETF inflows and corporate treasury allocations reinforce BTC’s macroeconomic hedge narrative. Excitement for the Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is crushing presale charts as Bitcoin’s megaphone pattern makes headlines. Already the project has dropped $4,700,000 into 6,500 holders, Phase 3 is now over 65% sold at $0.02 a token. At Phase 4, when mutant price reaches $0.025 investors are set to secure 25% profit on purchases today, but the bigger price opportunity is actually the $0.06 listing price – a 200% jump from today’s price. Targets beyond launch are even farther out, with analysts pointing to the token’s buy-and-utillise-and-hold model and lending utilities as transferrable synergies towards a move towards $3.50. With this, participants would gain 17,400% during Phase 3 alone, and this will far surpass the gains noticed in recent DeFi launches. Built-In Demand Mechanisms Mutuum Finance talons into the potential of DeFi without the speculative hype that comes to other projects by tying its value-generation model directly to DeFi utilities. Users can deposit assets, such as ETH or stablecoins, to the platform’s lending protocol, which issues mtTokens that earn interest over time. Reflecting this demand, these tokens are transferrable across DeFi ecosystems and create recurrent demand for MUTM, where a percentage of platform fees is permanently used to buy back and distribute with stakers. This ongoing cycle of self-sustainability minimizes sell pressure and encourages long-term holding, a departure from meme coins that depend solely on fickle sentiment. For institutions seeking regulated-yield opportunities in through decentralized markets, Mutuum Finance’s overcollateralized loans ensure minimal default risks. Security and Strategic Growth On the development front, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing for a Certik audit of its smart contracts — a move that, once complete, will boost investor confidence. The findings of the audit, when concluded, will be communicated through official means, thus emphasizing transparency. The team is also working on an overcollateralized stablecoin that is intended to increase liquidity and insulate the ecosystem from market downturns. These developments, along with a $100,000 continuous giveaway for presale buyers adds to the urgency for retail investors racing to acquire tokens before they land on exchanges. As Bitcoin technicals strengthen bullish sentiment in crypto markets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a parallel arrow in the quiver of exponential gains. Phase 3 is nearly full and a 25% price increase approaching! Historic examples support the notion that tokens with structured buy pressure and real-world utilizes outperform speculative counterparts, in bull markets—are lining up MUTM for favorable revaluation cycle post launch.

Comparing Strategy’s Preferred Stock Offerings,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/25/strf-or-strk-comparing-strategy-s-preferred-stock-offerings,"Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of Strategy (MSTR).Strategy (MSTR), the U.S. company that's made buying bitcoin ( BTC ) a key corporate policy, recently expanded its financial toolkit with the introduction of a second Series A perpetual preferred stock, adding to its growing line of capital market instruments. The company is selling 8.5 million shares of the new offering, called Strife (STRF), at $85 each, giving it a net $711.2 million for bitcoin purchases. That's up from an initial target of $500 million. The sale ends later Tuesday. Strategy's earlier preferred issuance, Strike (STRK) , initially raised $563 million. A perpetual preferred stock sits between debt and common equity in the capital structure, typically offering dividends and greater price stability. That makes it appealing to investors seeking lower volatility and more predictable returns. Unlike owners of common stock, holders do not get voting rights. STRF pays a 10% annual dividend on a $100 stated amount, with payments made quarterly in cash. If Strategy misses a dividend, the amount compounds at an additional 1% a year each up to a maximum 18% dividend rate, creating an incentive for timely payments. Strategy may redeem all STRF shares if fewer than 25% of the original issuance remains or under certain tax events, in which case shareholders would receive the liquidation preference plus any unpaid dividends. Additionally, in the event of a “fundamental change,” holders can force the company to repurchase their shares at the stated amount plus any accrued dividends. Lower dividends from STRK In contrast, STRK offers an 8% annual dividend based on its $100 liquidation preference, though the effective yield declines as STRK’s price rises. Unlike STRF, STRK includes a conversion feature, allowing holders to swap their preferred shares into common stock at a 10:1 ratio if the common share price reaches $1,000, offering equity upside. That means the new issue functions even more as a fixed-income security, making it the less volatile of the two. While STRK may appeal to investors looking for a blend of yield and potential capital appreciation, STRF is clearly aimed at those prioritizing income and capital stability. To support these dividend payments, Strategy will rely on a combination of operational cash flow, proceeds from convertible debt offerings and at-the-market (ATM) share sales on the common stock. Strategy also has an open ATM program in place for STRK , recently purchasing 130 BTC, and has about $3.57 billion remaining on its ATM capacity through the common stock , giving it significant flexibility to fund dividend commitments while continuing to pursue its bitcoin accumulation strategy. The company's shares rose more than 10% on Monday, by which point it held 506,137 BTC.",Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|Stocks,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|STRK|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-25 09:30:35

On March 24, DAO member Nathan van der Heyden submitted a proposal calling for the recovery of unused funds allocated to the Arbitrum Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP). The program, launched in 2024, aimed to position Arbitrum as a leading platform for onchain gaming development. Van der Hayden said that the GCP was approved when projections were “exceptionally optimistic.” He added that this had “proved unsustainable.” “We must wind down GCP activities and secure all possible funds in order to safeguard the DAO’s funds and restore investor confidence in the ability of this DAO to allocate capital,” van der Heyden wrote in the governance forum post. The community member also said the GCP had been reluctant to document its activities and that the program was not delivering on its promises. Source: Nathan van der Heyden Arbitrum proposal splits DAO sentiment Another DAO member seconded the proposal, saying the community must secure what is left of the funds: “The DAO should step in now and secure what is there and then think about a good and meaningful way of going forward.” While many others agreed to an immediate clawback of the funds, some said it may be counterproductive. One DAO member said that while the motivation may be valid, they favored a more constructive approach. “The desire to protect DAO funds and ensure transparency is valid, but immediately resorting to a complete clawback seems overly harsh and potentially counterproductive,” they wrote . The DAO member suggested phased clawbacks instead of immediately taking the program’s funding back and proposed flexible reporting standards to allow a more streamlined approach for the GCP. Arbitrum token declined 81% since the GCP launch The GCP was introduced on March 12, 2024, as a way to fuel the growth of Web3 gaming within the Arbitrum ecosystem. It allocated about 225 Arbitrum ( ARB ) tokens worth roughly $468 million. The funds went to investing in promising studios and games for network development and establishing Arbitrum as a leader for onchain gaming. However, the program coincided with a $2.2 billion token unlock , which may have caused the token’s price to drop. By June 2024, the tokens allocated to the program were only worth about $215 million , more than 50% less than their original value. At the time of writing, ARB tokens are trading at $0.38, 81% down from its price during the GCP launch. Arbitrum token’s decline since the GCP launch.

On March 14, ZKsync sunset its liquidity rewards program ZKsync Ignite, saying that current market conditions had influenced the decision to end the program. Related: Axie Infinity teases new Web3 game as NFT outlook turns positive Broader decline Web3 gaming funding The Arbitrum DAO proposal also comes amid a decline in Web3 gaming investments. Toshiyuki Otsuka, the founder of GameFi platform Snpit, told Cointelegraph that factors like market volatility and oversaturation of low-quality projects are slowing investment in Web3 gaming. “Many investors are taking a more cautious approach, waiting to see which projects can demonstrate long-term viability before committing capital,” Otsuka said. Otsuka added that the speculative rush of the past few years has given way to a more sustainable investment landscape for Web3 gaming, where only the most promising players are able to secure funding.

42313423,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143003,1742895331,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Crypto.com CRO Scam Claim: Analyst Exposes Token Reissuance Amid Trump ETF Buzz,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-com-cro-scam-claim/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing, and not all for positive reasons. Recent news of Trump Media partnering with Crypto.com to launch ETFs was quickly overshadowed by a wave of controversy. On-chain analyst ZachXBT, a respected voice in the crypto space, ignited a firestorm by publicly criticizing Crypto.com’s native token, CRO. But are these accusations valid? Let’s delve into the heart of this explosive situation and understand why CRO is being labeled as potentially a ‘scam’ and what this means for the broader crypto landscape. Is Crypto.com’s CRO Token Really a ‘Scam’? ZachXBT didn’t mince words when he took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his concerns. His statement, “CRO is no different from a scam,” is a powerful indictment. This accusation centers around a significant event: Crypto.com’s reissuance of 70 billion CRO tokens. These weren’t just any tokens; they were supposedly burned – permanently removed from circulation – back in 2021. The analyst’s claim directly challenges the transparency and trustworthiness of Crypto.com, a major player in the crypto exchange arena. Decoding the Token Reissuance: What Happened? To understand the gravity of ZachXBT’s accusation, we need to break down the token reissuance issue: The Burn Event of 2021: Crypto.com announced a massive CRO token burn in 2021, removing a significant portion of the token supply to theoretically increase scarcity and value for holders. This is a common practice in crypto to boost tokenomics. The Reissuance Revelation: Fast forward to last week, and ZachXBT highlighted that Crypto.com had reissued 70 billion CRO tokens. This revelation shocked many in the crypto community, as it directly contradicted the idea of a permanent burn. Transparency Concerns: The core of the issue isn’t just the reissuance itself, but the lack of clear communication and transparency surrounding it. If tokens were supposedly burned and then reappear, questions arise about the initial burn’s legitimacy and the exchange’s operational practices. This situation raises critical questions about trust and accountability in the crypto space. When exchanges make commitments about token burns, the community expects these commitments to be honored. Reversing such actions without clear explanation can severely damage user confidence. Trump Media ETF Deal and the CRO Controversy The timing of this controversy is particularly noteworthy because it coincides with Trump Media’s partnership with Crypto.com to launch Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). ETFs are investment vehicles that track an index, commodity, or basket of assets, but trade like stocks on an exchange. In the crypto context, a crypto ETF could offer traditional investors exposure to digital assets without directly holding them. ZachXBT specifically questioned Trump Media’s choice of Crypto.com for this ETF venture, especially when established and arguably more reputable exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini are available. His point highlights a potential reputational risk for Trump Media. Partnering with an exchange facing accusations of questionable tokenomics could cast a shadow over the ETF product itself. Why Does the Choice of Exchange Matter for a Trump Media ETF? Selecting the right exchange partner is crucial for the success and perception of a crypto ETF. Here’s why: Reputation and Trust: In the financial world, trust is paramount. Partnering with an exchange that has a solid reputation for security, compliance, and transparency is essential for attracting investors, especially in the traditional finance space. Regulatory Compliance: ETFs are regulated financial products. The exchange partner must demonstrate robust compliance with relevant regulations to ensure the ETF operates smoothly and legally. Market Access and Liquidity: A well-established exchange provides better market access and liquidity for the ETF, ensuring efficient trading and price discovery. Investor Confidence: If investors perceive the exchange partner as risky or unreliable, it can negatively impact the ETF’s adoption and performance. While Crypto.com is a significant exchange with a large user base, the recent CRO controversy could raise eyebrows among potential ETF investors and regulators. The choice of exchange partner directly reflects on the credibility and long-term viability of the Trump Media ETF. Analyzing the Potential Crypto Scam Allegations Against CRO Labeling CRO as a “crypto scam” is a serious accusation. Let’s dissect the elements that contribute to this perception: Lack of Transparency: The reissuance of supposedly burned tokens, without a clear and timely explanation, breeds suspicion. Transparency is foundational in the crypto world, and deviations from it can be perceived as red flags. Tokenomics Concerns: Token burns are often implemented to improve tokenomics and incentivize holding. Reversing a burn can be seen as manipulating the token’s economics, potentially to the detriment of early investors who believed in the burn commitment. Market Manipulation Accusations: In extreme cases, undisclosed token reissuances could be interpreted as a form of market manipulation, designed to benefit insiders at the expense of the broader market. While there’s no direct evidence of malicious intent in this case, the lack of clarity fuels such speculation. It’s important to note that “scam” is a strong term. While the CRO reissuance raises legitimate concerns about transparency and tokenomics, whether it constitutes a full-blown scam is debatable. However, the situation undeniably damages Crypto.com’s reputation and erodes trust within the crypto community. What are the Broader Implications for Crypto Exchanges and Investors? This incident serves as a crucial reminder of several key aspects of the cryptocurrency space: Due Diligence is Essential: Investors must conduct thorough due diligence on crypto projects and exchanges before investing. Reputation, transparency, and tokenomics should be carefully scrutinized. Transparency Matters More Than Ever: Crypto exchanges and project teams must prioritize transparency and clear communication with their communities. Breaches of trust can have severe and lasting consequences. Regulatory Scrutiny is Increasing: As crypto adoption grows, regulatory bodies are paying closer attention. Incidents like this could further fuel calls for stricter regulations and oversight of crypto exchanges and token projects. Reputation Risk is Real: In the highly competitive crypto market, reputation is a valuable asset. Exchanges and projects must act responsibly and ethically to maintain user trust and long-term viability. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors and Users So, what should crypto investors and users take away from this situation? Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with crypto news and developments, especially concerning exchanges and tokens you are invested in. Follow reputable analysts like ZachXBT and independent crypto news sources. Question Everything: Don’t blindly trust claims or promises. Ask critical questions and seek verifiable information, especially when it comes to tokenomics and exchange operations. Diversify Your Holdings: Spreading your investments across different exchanges and tokens can mitigate risk. Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket, especially with projects facing controversy. Consider Exchange Reputation: When choosing a crypto exchange, prioritize reputation, security, and transparency. Established exchanges with a proven track record may offer greater security and reliability. Conclusion: Navigating the Murky Waters of Crypto Trust The Crypto.com CRO controversy is a stark reminder of the inherent risks and complexities within the cryptocurrency market. While the “crypto scam” label might be debated, the incident undeniably highlights the critical importance of transparency, trust, and due diligence in the crypto space. For investors, it’s a call to be vigilant, informed, and discerning. For exchanges, it’s a powerful lesson in the lasting impact of eroded trust. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, incidents like these will shape the future of regulation, investor behavior, and the very foundation of trust upon which this nascent industry must build.

Despite minor pullbacks, XRP has maintained strong support levels and is approaching key resistance zones . With momentum building, a breakout could push XRP toward a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months. Monthly Chart: Consolidation Before a Big Move XRP has declined 4.99% over the past month, fluctuating between $2.36 and $2.58. This period of consolidation suggests a buildup before a significant price movement. Key resistance at $2.70 is the level to watch—breaking above it could drive XRP toward $3.50 and beyond. Meanwhile, $2.36 remains a critical support level, preventing further downside. Daily Chart: Bulls Challenge Key Resistance On the daily chart, XRP is testing its 50-day moving average as support, signaling potential strength. However, the 200-day moving average still looms above, acting as a barrier. If XRP can clear the $2.50–$2.55 resistance zone, it may trigger a rally. A decisive move past $2.70 could open the door to $3.00, a key psychological level. Surpassing this could ignite a surge toward $5.00, marking a potential new ATH. 4-Hour Chart: Bullish Pattern Hints at Breakout Short-term analysis shows XRP forming a bullish flag pattern , a strong indicator of a breakout. Support remains firm at $2.36, and rising buying pressure suggests XRP may soon challenge $2.70. If bulls take control, a sharp upward move is likely.

The new ETP, called iShares Bitcoin ETP, will begin trading on Tuesday on Xetra and Euronext Paris under the ticker IB1T, and on Euronext Amsterdam under BTCN. This is BlackRock’s first crypto ETP outside of North America and follows the success of its $48 billion U.S. Bitcoin fund, which launched in January 2024 and became the biggest ETF debut in history. The new product will start with a temporary fee waiver of 10 basis points, cutting the expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of 2025. After that, it will return to 0.25%, matching the fee of CoinShares’ $1.3 billion physical Bitcoin product, which currently leads the European market in assets. BlackRock partners with Coinbase, issues IB1T from Switzerland The iShares Bitcoin ETP will be physically backed by Bitcoin and held by Coinbase Global Inc., who will reportedly act as the custodian. The product will be available to both institutional clients and qualified retail investors, and will be issued through a Swiss-based special purpose vehicle. Manuela Sperandeo, who leads iShares Product for Europe and the Middle East at BlackRock, said the firm sees rising interest across the board. “It reflects what really could be seen as a tipping point in the industry — the combination of established demand from retail investors with more professionals now really getting into the fold,” Manuela said. Even though Bitcoin ETPs have been around in Europe for years, the market is still relatively small, with about $13.6 billion in total assets across products. That’s tiny compared to the U.S., where crypto ETPs exploded after the SEC approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock’s U.S. version, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, hit $48 billion in assets in just over a year. This European launch comes after months of anticipation and silent buildup. The European expansion is happening while BlackRock is posting record financial results. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the firm’s assets under management hit $11.6 trillion, up from $11.48 trillion in Q3 and $10.01 trillion the year before. That number broke company records. The firm also saw a 21% jump in profits, closing the quarter with $1.67 billion in net income, or $10.63 per share, compared to $1.38 billion, or $9.15 per share, a year earlier. Long-term net inflows in Q4 hit $201 billion, while total net inflows reached $281.4 billion, more than doubling from $95.6 billion in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The majority of that went into ETFs, which brought in $142.6 billion, and fixed-income products, which received $23.8 billion. The growth is being credited to strong market performance and client momentum, especially after Donald Trump’s presidential win in November 2024, which triggered a U.S. stock market rally based on expectations of tax cuts and deregulation. The company’s buying spree also played a role in its expanding influence. In 2024 alone, BlackRock spent roughly $25 billion acquiring Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure fund, and HPS Investment Partners, a private credit firm. Those deals pushed the firm deeper into private markets, where growth has been outpacing traditional public investments. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, commented on how clients are responding to the firm’s aggressive moves. “For many companies, periods of M&A contribute to a pause in client engagement. At BlackRock, clients are instead embracing and rewarding our strategy,” Larry said in a statement last year. The company’s performance was also boosted by market tailwinds. The S&P 500 ended Q4 with a 2.1% gain, closing out the year with a total rise of 23.3%, making it two years straight of 20%-plus returns. On the global side, the MSCI index for world stocks dropped 1.2% in Q4, but still climbed 15.7% over 2024, which was a second year of gains. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

More than 37% of investors identified security risks as the main barrier to using cryptocurrency for payments, according to a survey of 4,599 users conducted by Bitget Wallet as part of its latest Onchain Report shared with Cointelegraph. Still, 46% of users said they preferred crypto payments over fiat for their speed and efficiency. Source: Bitget Wallet Onchain Report Bitget Wallet has implemented multi-layered protection mechanisms to make security a “top priority” and inspire more confidence in crypto payments, according to Alvin Kan, chief operating officer of Bitget Wallet: “This includes MEV protection, which is now enabled by default across major chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, helping users avoid common risks like front-running and sandwich attacks. “ “We also introduced smart authorization detection via our GetShield engine, which actively scans smart contracts, DApps, and URLs to flag malicious behavior before users sign anything,” he told Cointelegraph. Bitget Wallet’s operations are backed by a $300 million user protection fund as an additional layer of assurance in case of an “asset loss due to platform-level issues.” Concerns over crypto payment security by region. Source: Bitget Wallet Onchain Report Security concerns have plagued the industry, especially since the emergence of a new type of phishing attack known as address poisoning or wallet poisoning scams , which involve tricking victims into sending their digital assets to fraudulent addresses belonging to scammers. Victims of address poisoning scams were tricked into willingly sending over $1.2 million worth of funds to scammers in the first three weeks of March. While Gen X users cite security as their top concern, Gen Z users prioritize usability and cost-efficiency, Kan said.

Here's Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-binance-suspends-employee-from-wallet-team-heres-why/,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has suspended an employee for allegedly using inside information to profit from the launch of a token project. Binance Fires Employee Over Insider Trading Allegations In a statement published on X (formerly Twitter) today, Binance revealed that a staff member from its Wallet team purchased a large amount of tokens ahead of the Token Generation Event (TGE) and later sold some of his holdings to make a significant profit. According to Binance, the employee clearly violated company policy by using non-public information obtained from his previous business development role at BNB Chain. The exchange explained that the Wallet team did not have direct access to specific project details, which amounted to misuse of privileged information from its previous position. “This behavior constitutes premeditation based on non-public information obtained from a previous position and is a clear violation of company policy,” Binance said. “As a result, the employee in question has been suspended with immediate effect pending further disciplinary action.” Alleged Token and Investigation While Binance did not disclose the token in question, community members on X quickly pointed to UUU (U DEX Platform), a Binance Smart Chain memecoin. An X user, @pycharts, shared a wallet transaction screenshot showing the sale of over 6 million UUU tokens at around 7 a.m. on March 23, triggering a significant price drop. The screenshot attributes the wallet to Freddie Ng, a member of Binance Wallet's BD and Growth team. In response to these allegations, Binance’s official Chinese X account acknowledged the community’s concerns and stated that an internal investigation is currently ongoing. The exchange pledged to make the findings public once the investigation is complete. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Binance Suspends Employee from Wallet Team!

The project offers a revolutionary solution to the notorious volatility of meme cryptocurrencies — why hold one coin when you can hold a basket of coins wrapped up in one ERC20 token? Investors have praised the model, snapping up presale tokens at the price of $0.01668 before MEMEX hits more markets next week. MEMEX Offers Unique Baskets for Every Risk Appetite The Meme Index platform features four distinct cryptocurrency baskets, each designed to match different investor risk tolerances. These baskets strategically group meme coins to distribute risk while maximizing potential returns. Risk levels correspond directly to volatility ratings – lower volatility offers reduced risk with modest reward potential, while higher volatility presents greater risk alongside amplified profit opportunities. Conservative investors might prefer the Meme Titan Index, featuring the eight largest meme coins by market capitalization. Those seeking more aggressive positions, particularly during bullish market trends, can explore the Meme Midcap Index or the more speculative Meme Frenzy Index. According to official documentation, the Meme Frenzy Index specifically targets high-risk, high-reward tokens characterized by dramatic price movements. The MEMEX token is the gateway to platform features while providing governance privileges — holders can help steer the basket compositions — and staking opportunities. Currently, the presale staking program delivers an exceptional 550% APY, though this rate will decrease as more participants enter the staking ecosystem. By incorporating multiple utilities into their native token, the development team aims to establish sustainable demand for MEMEX, potentially supporting gradual price appreciation over time. Crypto Expert Labels MEMEX “Best Crypto Presale” The innovative approach and MEMEX’s functionality have drawn significant expert endorsements within the cryptocurrency community. YouTuber Borch Crypto recently proclaimed Meme Index the “best crypto presale” currently available, suggesting it carries 50x price potential. Considering the current $4.1 million funding level, such dramatic growth projections remain within the realm of possibility. The analyst particularly highlighted the platform’s governance framework. “I think the concept is really original – the governance is on point,” he said. MEMEX holders can participate in critical decisions affecting the project’s development, including modifying basket compositions. This democratic approach proves especially valuable for the Meme Frenzy Index. With countless microcap meme coins flooding the market, community voting ensures that only the most promising candidates are included in the baskets. Beyond improving performance prospects, this governance structure cultivates stakeholder engagement, strengthens community bonds, and contributes to the meme narrative. Final Chance to Buy MEMEX at a Discount With exchange listings scheduled in just one week, investors face their last opportunity to acquire MEMEX at the fixed presale rate of $0.01668 before market dynamics take control. The platform addresses key pain points in meme coin investing and is the pioneer of decentralized meme coin indexes, already demonstrating market traction for its concept. However, with the presale still active, substantial growth potential remains for early supporters in the coming months. For project updates, follow Meme Index on X or join its Telegram community.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.99. In 2031, FLOW will range between $5.75 to $6.59. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.426 Market Cap $670,724,753.81 Trading Volume $20,997,748.57 Circulating Supply 1,571,065,878.31 FLOW All-time High $46.16 Apr 05, 2021 All-time Low $0.3921 Sep 12, 2023 24-hour High $0.4335 24-hour Low $0.4229 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.07% 50-Day SMA $0.4804 14-Day RSI 42.15 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 45 (Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.6401 Flow price analysis: FLOW sees short-term bullish momentum, $0.448 remains critical TL;DR Breakdown FLOW is testing resistance near $0.448. The coin has broken out above its 50-day SMA. Buying pressure intensifies in the short term. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW jumps above $0.414 The FLOW/USDT chart for March 25 shows the price at $0.427, above the middle Bollinger Band ($0.414), signaling a neutral-to-bullish trend. The MACD is bullish, with the MACD line above the signal line and a positive histogram indicating growing upward momentum. FLOW jumps above $0.414 The RSI is at 42.37, showing room for upside. A move above $0.448 could signal more gains, while a drop below $0.414 might suggest a pullback. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: FLOW breaks above the 50-day SMA The 4-hour chart shows the price at $0.427, just above the 50-day SMA at $0.421, indicating bullish momentum. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is positive at 0.06, signaling mild buying pressure, while the Balance of Power (BoP) is at 1.00, suggesting strong bullish dominance. FLOW breaks above the 50-day SMA The price has recently experienced an upward surge, but it’s now testing resistance near $0.430. A break above this level could lead to further gains, while a drop below the SMA at $0.421 would signal weakening bullish momentum. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5320 SELL SMA 5 $0.4861 SELL SMA 10 $0.4620 SELL SMA 21 $0.4380 SELL SMA 50 $0.4804 SELL SMA 100 $0.6021 SELL SMA 200 $0.6401 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.4451 SELL EMA 5 $0.4829 SELL EMA 10 $0.5574 SELL EMA 21 $0.6433 SELL EMA 50 $0.7199 SELL EMA 100 $0.7211 SELL EMA 200 $0.7150 SELL What to expect from Flow? Flow (FLOW) is in a bullish short-term setup but with somewhat neutral market conditions, suggesting the possibility of a consolidation. The $0.448 resistance remains critical for the next potential breakout. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Why is Flow price rising? Flow has recently bounced off support at $0.355 and is now retesting resistance at $0.433, attributable to growing capital inflow to the market. FLOW price chart Will FLOW recover? FLOW can potentially recover if it can break through resistance levels and maintain momentum. The market’s current consolidation phase suggests a possible breakout, which could either see selling pressure and drive prices higher or lead to further declines. Close monitoring is crucial as market dynamics remain volatile. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest in the coming weeks could push FLOW to $1 and above. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is definitely achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $6-$7 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

The intersection of media and cryptocurrency is heating up as Trump Media, known for its social media platform Truth Social, is reportedly teaming up with crypto giant Crypto.com. This exciting partnership is aimed at launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs), potentially opening up new avenues for investors to tap into the crypto and energy sectors. Let’s dive into what this groundbreaking collaboration could mean for the future of crypto investments and beyond. What’s the Buzz Around This Crypto ETF Partnership? According to a buzzworthy post by the finance and crypto news account @solidintel_x on X (formerly Twitter), Trump Media and Crypto.com have entered into a non-binding agreement to introduce ETFs. This isn’t just any ETF launch; it’s a strategic move that leverages the strengths of both entities. Trump Media brings its brand recognition and reach, while Crypto.com offers its established expertise in the cryptocurrency space and its broker-dealer arm, Foris Capital US LLC. Here’s a quick rundown of what we know: Partnership: Trump Media and Crypto.com (non-binding agreement). Product: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Broker-Dealer: Foris Capital US LLC (Crypto.com’s broker-dealer). Sectors: Cryptocurrencies and Energy, among others. Source: @solidintel_x on X (formerly Twitter). This proposed Crypto ETF launch is still in its early stages, being a non-binding agreement, but the implications are significant. It signals a growing convergence between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset market. Why is a Trump Media Crypto ETF Launch a Big Deal? The involvement of Trump Media in the crypto space is noteworthy. While primarily known for its media ventures, this partnership indicates a diversification strategy into the financial realm. Why is this significant? Let’s break it down: Brand Power: Trump Media brings a massive, politically engaged audience. This could translate to significant interest and investment in their ETFs. Mainstream Adoption: A Trump Media Crypto ETF could further legitimize and mainstream cryptocurrency investments for a broader audience, potentially those who are already followers of the Trump brand. Diversification for Trump Media: Moving into ETFs diversifies Trump Media’s portfolio beyond social media, potentially creating new revenue streams and market opportunities. Crypto.com’s Expansion: For Crypto.com, partnering with a brand like Trump Media can amplify their reach and attract a different segment of investors to their platform and Crypto.com ETF offerings. Imagine the potential reach. Trump Media’s platform combined with Crypto.com’s crypto infrastructure could create a powerful synergy. However, it’s crucial to remember this is a non-binding agreement, and many steps are still needed before any ETF hits the market. Exploring the Potential Crypto.com ETF Offerings The announcement mentions that the ETFs will consist of securities with bets on various sectors, including cryptocurrencies and energy. What could this look like in practice? Let’s consider some possibilities: Potential ETF Theme Possible Holdings Investment Focus Cryptocurrency Diversified ETF Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, etc. Broad exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Energy & Crypto Innovation ETF Renewable energy stocks, oil & gas companies, Bitcoin miners, blockchain energy projects. Intersection of traditional energy and new crypto-powered energy solutions. Digital Asset Leaders ETF Companies holding significant crypto assets (e.g., MicroStrategy), crypto exchanges, blockchain technology firms. Focus on companies leading the digital asset revolution. These are just hypothetical examples, but they illustrate the diverse range of investment products that could fall under this partnership. The specific details of the ETFs, including their composition and investment strategy, will be crucial for investors to evaluate. Challenges and Considerations for this ETF Launch While the prospect of a ETF Launch from Trump Media and Crypto.com is exciting, there are challenges and considerations to keep in mind: Regulatory Hurdles: ETFs, especially those involving cryptocurrencies, face rigorous regulatory scrutiny. SEC approval is a significant hurdle. Market Volatility: Both crypto and energy sectors are known for their volatility. ETFs in these areas could be subject to significant price swings. Non-Binding Agreement: The current agreement is non-binding. There’s no guarantee that it will progress to a finalized partnership and actual ETF launches. Public Perception: Trump Media’s brand is politically charged. This could influence public perception and adoption of the ETFs, both positively and negatively. Competition: The ETF market is competitive. The success of these ETFs will depend on their unique value proposition and effective marketing. Investors should conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved before considering investing in any ETF, especially those in nascent and volatile sectors like cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do? So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on news and updates from reputable sources regarding this partnership and potential ETF filings. Follow accounts like @solidintel_x and established financial news outlets. Due Diligence: If and when these ETFs are officially announced, review the prospectus carefully. Understand the investment strategy, fees, and risks involved. Diversification Strategy: Consider how these ETFs might fit into your broader investment portfolio. Diversification is key, especially with volatile assets. Risk Assessment: Evaluate your risk tolerance. Crypto and energy investments can be high-risk, high-reward. Ensure it aligns with your financial goals. Consult a Financial Advisor: If you’re unsure, seek advice from a qualified financial advisor who can help you navigate these investment opportunities. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Future of Crypto Investment? The potential partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com to launch ETFs is undoubtedly a bold and intriguing development. It signifies the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance and the innovative ways companies are seeking to tap into this burgeoning market. While still in the early stages and facing potential hurdles, this venture could open up exciting new avenues for crypto investment and reshape the landscape of ETFs.

While meme coins can potentially boost holders’ portfolios, most lack utility, which is enough to incur massive losses. This is why Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to plummet despite being tagged as one of the top meme coins in the crypto market. On the other hand, a new and innovative meme coin, DuragDoge ($DURAG) , is gaining significant traction due to its utility-driven features. $DURAG offers different means by which holders and investors can continuously earn, such as community and staking rewards. This is why analysts have confidently named $DURAG the best cryptocurrency to buy now. Read on to find out why DOGE holders are dumping it for the best presale token, $DURAG. Dogecoin (DOGE) at Cross-Roads As 1 Billion Transfers Increases Holders’ Concerns Dogecoin, backed by a strong community and prominent industry figures, is not immune to the volatility of the crypto market. DOGE’s price continues fluctuating, recording over 11% and 30% declines in the past 7 days and one month, respectively. The continuous fluctuation in DOGE’s price erases gains from holders and investors. Recent activities in the crypto market have further caused uncertainty about DOGE’s future for holders. About 1 billion DOGE coins were transferred between exchanges and wallets in the past 24 hours, and this move is believed to have been made by a group of crypto whales. This happened a few days after Coinglass reported that about $43 million worth of DOGE had been withdrawn from various trading platforms. While this increase in whale activity is supposed to boost other holders’ confidence in the token, it is causing them to raise their eyebrows at such transactions. DOGE holders and investors fear that this move will later cause a massive dump and sell-off, leading to more reduced value for DOGE. This is why they are now turning to $DURAG, one of the best crypto coins to invest in. DuragDoge ($DURAG) Continues To Gain Traction With its Promise of Long-Term Rewards DuragDoge is the new meme coin buzzing as the best cryptocurrency to buy now. $DURAG’s massive traction can be attributed to its utility-driven features, which give it an edge over other meme coins. DuragDoge aims to be more than a meme but a way of life for the hustlers, dreamers, and go-getters who dare to aim for the moon. DuragDoge is building a legacy while heading for the global stage as the meme coin representing hood culture and crypto innovations. To ensure its hustlers are working and flexing, they will be draped in $DURAG. DuragDoge’s community will boost members’ creativity, ambition, and determination to be part of something big, especially the underdogs. DuragDoge’s commitment to sustainability, resilience, and longevity is also a reason for its growing traction in the market. DuragDoge aims to provide holders and investors long-term benefits through staking and community incentives. This shows that $DURAG is not a passing trend but a force that has come to stay, making it one of the best crypto coins to invest in. DuragDoge ($DURAG) Continue Recording Groundbreaking Presale Success The deflationary token, $DURAG, is currently the best presale token, as crypto users quickly add them to their portfolios. $DURAG’s presale success is due to the enormous benefits it provides holders, such as the staking and rewards. Token holders who double down on their $DURAG tokens can receive up to 20% APY in rewards. Members will even receive community rewards to boost their creativity and support DuragDoge’s growth. The DuragDoge team assigned 160,000,000 $DURAG tokens for community rewards to prove their plans of delivering these community gains. As a deflationary token, $DUARG’s value will continue to surge despite market conditions. The burn mechanism will regulate its circulation, making it a rare gem. This is why $DURAG’s pre-sales offer crypto users the best opportunity to take advantage of what $DURAG offers. About 1,240,000,000 $DURAGs are available during the ongoing presale at cheaper rates, and this is the best time to enjoy maximum rewards. Conclusion $DURAG is proving it has the potential to become the leading meme coin soon. With its promise of long-term benefits for holders, DOGE holders quickly turn to it to make back profits.

Despite the high yield, I think Coinbase is a better choice at this point in time because of relatively low implied volatility. Current market conditions and seasonal trends suggest Coinbase may perform well in April, making direct ownership more favorable than selling covered calls. The YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) is a single stock covered-call selling ETF with a current distribution rate of 91.17%. Basically, the ETF is distributing the option premia proceeds irrespective of whether the trades were profitable or not. The rate, which is an annualization of recent distribution levels, is greatly influenced by how volatile the underlying stock has been. Because Coinbase is a very volatile stock, the distribution rate tends to be really high. That doesn’t mean the position is very profitable because often the underlying falls while you receive distributions. The graph below illustrates this: Data by YCharts In my last article on CONY, dating back to January, I wasn’t very positive about CONY: I'm quite bullish on Bitcoin. However, I'd rather own Bitcoin directly than any of the proxies like Coinbase or MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) which I've discussed here; why I favor Bitcoin over MicroStrategy . MicroStrategy has its own YieldMax version under the ticker MSTY, advertising a ~102% distribution yield, and for now, I think it is actually preferable to CONY as well as MSTR itself. The key reason that I like MSTY better is because MicroStrategy has increased its authorized share count. I expect it to issue a lot of shares over the coming 12 months. MicroStrategy will likely sell shares into a rising market. I don't expect the company to keep shoving shares into the market if its share price is falling rapidly. If I'm right, this should basically dampen volatility. Especially upside volatility, which is the key problem with crypto-related call selling. At the end of the day, notwithstanding the attractive distribution rate, I'd currently avoid CONY. I'd rather own Bitcoin and even Coinbase itself or MSTY. I'll still rate it a hold because I wouldn't want to short it either. CONY delivered a total return of 29.33% over that timeframe. To be fair, I said I preferred Bitcoin or even MSTY better, but these are down 18.75% and 21.44% as well. Not as much, but it isn’t great either. Right now, I’ll argue COIN is likely preferable to CONY. I’ll still rate CONY a hold. However, last time I only rated it hold because I didn’t want to short it. This time, I think there is a chance the underlying will be surprisingly strong in April and that makes it unfavorable to sell short-term calls against it. I’ll detail why I think Coinbase could do well during April. The first reason is simply that we’ve had a recent market decline. Coinbase got hammered. Data by YCharts Seeking Alpha rates it momentum at F. The worst possible score. However, the market is stabilizing. Volatility is declining. That's true for the broader market as well as for Coinbase. Data by YCharts Looking ahead, seasonality for Coinbase looks pretty bad at first glance, but keep in mind there is very little data: Coinbase seasonality (Seeking Alpha) However, April tends to be a really good month for Bitcoin itself (see the seasonal chart below). As for now, Coinbase ( COIN ) is still quite correlated to Bitcoin. bitcoin monthly seasonality (created by author) I’m wary of the Coinbase seasonal data because it usually holds its earnings call in March, but the next one is coming up at the end of April. I think April could be a lot better this time around. Because generally Bitcoin is also quite strong in April, that lines up favorably. Current Coinbase implied volatility is very low. Only around 10% of the time, over the past twelve months, has implied volatility been lower. In addition, the cost of 30-day ATM puts and calls are very similar. The April $190 put is $12.70 and the $190 call is $13. Usually, puts tend to be a bit more expensive than calls. With speculative stocks like Coinbase, that’s often not the case. The calls can actually be more expensive. The graph below shows this in historical context. Coinbase calls are now relatively inexpensive compared to its puts: IV spread put call (Market Chameleon) This can indicate the market doesn’t expect Coinbase to go on a tear, which makes some sense given important events are quite far out and momentum is terrible. The downside is that the options are pricing that in to an extent, as a call seller you’re not getting paid as much to take on that risk. YieldMax has a line-up of these very high yielding ETFs, with expense ratios of 0.99%, and they are extremely successful. The graph below shows how much AUM the ETF has collected. That’s while these massive distributions are ongoing and the stock hasn’t done very well. Data by YCharts Conclusion CONY's 91.17% distribution rate is very hard to resist, as its rapid growth in AUM illustrates. However, it's crucial to differentiate between a real yield forged in economic fundamentals and one manufactured to achieve an effect. In January, I called this a hold, preferring Bitcoin or MSTY as alternatives within the crypto space. Currently, directly holding Coinbase stock is likely preferable. Coinbase isn't anticipated to do well, but the earnings date has shifted, which may shift seasonality along. Bitcoin also benefits from favorable seasonality. Meanwhile, we're just coming off a modest but noticeable market sell-off and markets appear to be stabilizing. A relief rally is certainly not impossible. Under the specific circumstances, selling covered-calls on Coinbase does not seem like it would be the best choice.",CONY,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-25 09:59:54

Tabit Raises $40M in Bitcoin to Revolutionize Insurance Capital with Digital Assets Barbados-based insurer Tabit has announced the successful raise of $40 million in Bitcoin to support its regulatory capital, making it the first property and casualty insurer to hold its entire regulatory reserve in BTC. The move, disclosed on March 24, marks a significant milestone in the convergence of digital assets and the legacy insurance industry. Founded by former executives of Bittrex, the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in Liechtenstein, Tabit positions itself at the vanguard of a growing trend: leveraging blockchain and crypto assets to modernize long-standing financial frameworks. The raised Bitcoin capital will be used to back US dollar-denominated insurance policies, meaning customers remain insulated from crypto volatility while Tabit benefits from Bitcoin’s upside and alternative yield strategies. While traditional insurers often rely on bonds and fiat reserves to meet regulatory obligations and backstop policy risk, Tabit’s fully Bitcoin-backed regulatory reserve challenges the orthodoxy. The company, which officially launched in January 2025, operates under a Class 2 license issued by Barbados’ Financial Services Commission, enabling it to write property and casualty policies while maintaining alternative capital strategies. The strategy reflects a growing sentiment within parts of the crypto industry: Bitcoin, while volatile, is also seen as a resilient store of value by long-term holders (”hodlers”). For many institutional players, the challenge lies in finding regulated use cases that allow them to earn a yield on their BTC holdings. Insurance may now be one such avenue. Tabit’s announcement arrives amid a broader trend of innovation at the intersection of blockchain and insurance. While most discussions to date have focused on using smart contracts to automate claims or using onchain analytics to improve transparency, a quiet evolution is taking place behind the scenes — one that involves insurance capital itself. Nayms, an onchain insurance marketplace, is a prime example. It connects brokers and underwriters with capital providers using segregated smart contract accounts, offering a secure and transparent funding mechanism. Similarly, Ensuro curates underwriting opportunities and deploys stablecoins as insurance capital. With more than 12,000 active policies and returns as high as 22% APY, Ensuro exemplifies how DeFi principles can power real-world financial products. According to a 2023 report from Boston Consulting Group, the blockchain-insurance market could reach $37 billion by 2030, driven by demand for transparency, capital efficiency, and alternative financing methods. A Strategic Bet on Bitcoin Tabit’s model signals a growing institutional belief that Bitcoin can play a foundational role in capital formation — not just as an investment or hedge, but as a working reserve. By transforming Bitcoin into a yield-generating, regulatory-compliant asset, Tabit is helping redefine how insurers think about solvency, capital efficiency, and risk tolerance. It also presents a new frontier for crypto adoption. Unlike DeFi protocols that often carry opaque risks, Tabit offers US dollar-denominated, regulated policies, giving customers the stability they expect from traditional insurance, while allowing the back-end to leverage alternative capital sources. With the crypto market maturing and regulatory frameworks evolving, Tabit may be the first of many insurance firms to adopt a Bitcoin-native model. Its success could usher in a wave of insurers and reinsurers exploring how crypto can power the next generation of financial infrastructure. Bitcoin In, Tesla Out: Standard Chartered’s Hypothetical ‘Mag 7B’ Index Outperforms Original Tech Giants In a provocative new report, Standard Chartered Bank has unveiled a hypothetical reimagining of the iconic “Magnificent 7” tech index—replacing Tesla with Bitcoin—and the results could fuel a new wave of institutional investment in digital assets. The newly dubbed ”Mag 7B” portfolio, which swaps out Tesla in favor of the world’s leading cryptocurrency, has outperformed the original Mag 7 index in both returns and volatility, according to Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research. The move to position Bitcoin alongside some of the biggest names in tech—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta—challenges conventional asset classification and signals Bitcoin’s emerging role as a multi-functional asset: part tech, part hedge. Kendrick's analysis is rooted in a growing correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq, which he noted is “almost always” stronger than the correlation between Bitcoin and gold, especially in the short term. That behavior, he argues, makes a compelling case for Bitcoin to be treated like a tech stock, rather than just a digital alternative to gold or a speculative commodity. This reframing becomes even more relevant as Bitcoin’s market capitalization has soared to $1.7 trillion, more than double that of Tesla, which currently stands at around $800 billion. The rationale for dropping Tesla—Mag 7’s smallest constituent by market cap—is grounded in both market metrics and a shift in investor perception. Kendrick’s Mag 7B model was backtested beginning in December 2017, a notable decision given that Bitcoin was nearing its then-all-time high of just under $20,000 at the time. The high starting point was chosen deliberately to avoid biasing the outcome in favor of Bitcoin’s massive rally from lower levels. The results speak volumes: Mag 7B beat the original Mag 7 in five of the past seven years Average annual returns were about 1% higher Volatility was nearly 2% lower every year Information ratio—a key measure of risk-adjusted return—was 1.13 for Mag 7B vs. 1.04 for the original Mag 7 In financial terms, these differences are significant. The information ratio reflects how efficiently an asset or portfolio generates returns relative to the risk it takes on. A higher ratio means better risk-adjusted performance, and that’s exactly what Bitcoin brought to the table. The potential real-world implications of Kendrick’s findings are profound. With the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, institutional access to BTC has never been easier. Investors can now gain Bitcoin exposure with the same ease, cost-efficiency, and regulatory comfort as buying any other member of the Mag 7 index. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s multi-purpose function—as a tech asset, a hedge against traditional finance, and a macro portfolio diversifier—makes it increasingly attractive for large funds, asset managers, and even pension schemes that have traditionally shied away from crypto exposure. Looking ahead, Kendrick sees positive momentum building for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. With a key US tariff announcement due on April 2, and the Nasdaq closing out its worst quarter since mid-2022, the stage is set for potential portfolio rebalancing that could benefit both tech stocks and BTC. His analysis highlights how macro trends, institutional infrastructure, and behavioral correlations are converging to make Bitcoin more than just a fringe asset—it’s increasingly part of the core tech narrative. A New Era for Tech and Crypto Convergence? The Standard Chartered report adds momentum to the growing movement that sees Bitcoin as more than just a hedge or a speculative vehicle. Instead, it posits BTC as a dynamic, dual-purpose asset that belongs alongside tech giants, not just in alternative investment allocations. If the market takes Kendrick’s thesis seriously, it could lead to a strategic realignment in institutional portfolios, with Bitcoin earning a spot not just in crypto funds—but in the very same buckets that hold Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Whether or not Bitcoin becomes an official part of tech indices in the future, one thing is clear: the asset’s institutional legitimacy continues to rise, and its role in shaping modern portfolio theory is no longer hypothetical—it’s happening now.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-25 10:00:00

Multicoin, one of Solana’s earliest backers since its seed round in 2018, is doubling down on its conviction that Solana is the most strategically positioned blockchain to power the future of decentralized finance and payments. Samani made it clear that Multicoin’s outlook on the crypto sector has sharpened significantly over the years. “We’ve fundamentally recognized that these systems are financial systems, first and foremost,” he stated. “We need to be focused on investing in things that are fundamentally tied to innovations in finance.” Samani reflected on the broader downturn in venture funding across the crypto space, pointing to a necessary reckoning around utility and real-world applicability. According to DeFiLlama data cited in the interview, venture capital inflows have now dipped below 2017–2018 levels despite increasing regulatory clarity. Samani attributes this to an overdue market correction away from overfunded, non-viable projects. “People, LPs, have funded crypto venture funds with the implicit implication that crypto will substantially impact all parts of the economy. And I have a narrower view — I think it will have a very high impact in financial services. Otherwise, I generally don’t care.” Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Gains Capped—Breaking $150 Won’t Be Easy This recalibration has led Multicoin to double down on areas where product-market fit is finally emerging, including stablecoins, real-world assets (RWAs), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and cross-border payment systems. “We have these areas now where there’s definitive market fit,” Samani said, highlighting projects like Felix Pago’s remittance network in Mexico and growing interest in crypto-native labor marketplaces integrating stablecoin payouts. Solana’s Edge: Speed And On-Chain Order Books Central to Multicoin’s latest thesis is the growing realization that Solana remains unmatched in providing the speed, throughput, and cost structure necessary to support global financial applications at scale. “If you look at core L1 infrastructure, Solana is the fastest horse today,” Samani asserted. He emphasized that after five years since mainnet launch, Solana is now on the cusp of making fully on-chain order books not only possible but functionally competitive with centralized exchanges. “Latency was not low enough. Chain would fall over But as the chain has gotten more stable, as latency’s come down, as throughput is increased, that’s made it more usable for on-chain order books,” Samani explained. He expects the market to reach an inflection point in the next three to six months, where on-chain order books are “functionally usable for both makers and takers, comparable enough to Binance and Coinbase.” Key to unlocking this potential, according to Samani, is “conditional liquidity” — an innovation he believes is now within reach thanks to the maturity of the Solana ecosystem. Ethereum Vs. Solana Samani drew a sharp contrast between Solana’s singular optimization for financial use cases and Ethereum’s generalized approach. “Ethereum’s core problem is they’re not optimized for anything,” he argued. “The definition of focus is saying no to things. And they absolutely refuse to do so.” While Ethereum pursues roll-up-centric scaling, Samani remains skeptical of both the intra- and inter-roll-up challenges. “All of the rollups we have today are entirely centralized in their operations,” he noted. “Ethereum started off maximum decentralization […] and the path to scaling is to centralize and then re-decentralize. It strikes me as bizarre.” Related Reading: Solana Price On The Verge Of A ‘Big Breakout’ — Here’s The Target In contrast, Samani believes Solana’s monolithic architecture — emphasizing low latency and high throughput — is best suited for building the backbone of Internet-native capital markets. “You have to be focused on latency, throughput, and gas cost,” he said. “Bitcoin and Ethereum from inception were always like, ‘Oh my God, scarcity.’ Solana’s perspective has always been, ‘Let’s let Moore’s Law do its thing and run a billion transactions in parallel.'” Regulatory Winds Shifting Samani also described a noticeable shift in the regulatory environment, referencing the White House Crypto Summit where he sat alongside major industry figures. “It was really awesome for me to see that they committed two hours, they sat there with us, they listened, they took notes, and they were asking really good questions,” he said. In Samani’s view, this new dialogue with Washington is already catalyzing changes in capital flows. Multicoin has seen several of its largest LPs — historically venture-only — express interest in their liquid hedge fund product. “Three of our largest LPs have all called us since the election and said, ‘Hey, we would like to explore your liquid fund.’ We feel pretty good that the tides are shifting.” Samani reiterated that, from a risk-reward standpoint, liquid markets — specifically top-performing tokens like Solana and its ecosystem projects — now offer the most compelling opportunities. “My general belief today is that the easiest money to be made in crypto is buying liquid names that are the winners in their respective areas.” Five years after backing Solana in its earliest days, Multicoin Capital remains unwavering in its conviction. “We underestimated the difficulty of on-chain order books,” Samani admitted. “But we never gave up on it, and I think we’re pretty close now.” At press time, SOL traded at $140.

Polymarket, a prominent crypto-based prediction platform, has officially expanded its horizons by launching on the blazing-fast Solana network. This groundbreaking move, initially reported by the reliable crypto news source @solidintel_x on X, signifies a significant step forward for both Polymarket and the Solana ecosystem. What does this mean for users and the future of decentralized prediction markets? Let’s dive in and explore the exciting details. Unveiling Polymarket: A Leader in Crypto Prediction Markets For those unfamiliar, Polymarket stands out as a decentralized prediction market platform that leverages the power of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. But what exactly are prediction markets , and why are they gaining traction in the crypto space? Decentralized Forecasting: Prediction markets allow users to bet on the outcomes of future events. Unlike traditional betting platforms, Polymarket operates on a decentralized blockchain, offering greater transparency and accessibility. Real-World Insights: By aggregating predictions from a diverse user base, these markets can provide valuable insights into public sentiment and potential future trends across various domains, from politics to economics and even crypto prices. Incentivized Accuracy: Participants are incentivized to make accurate predictions, as correct forecasts are rewarded financially. This creates a dynamic and efficient system for information aggregation. Polymarket has already established itself as a key player in this space, offering markets on a wide range of topics. Now, by launching on Solana, they are poised to enhance their platform and user experience significantly. Why Solana? Embracing Speed and Scalability for Prediction Markets The choice of Solana as the new blockchain for Polymarket is strategic and driven by the network’s inherent advantages. Why is Solana the ideal platform for a DeFi platform like Polymarket? Feature Solana Traditional Blockchains (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet) Transaction Speed Extremely Fast (Thousands of TPS) Slower (15-30 TPS) Transaction Cost Very Low ( fractions of a cent) Higher (can be several dollars, especially during peak times) Scalability Highly Scalable Scalability challenges, leading to congestion and higher fees As you can see, Solana’s superior speed and significantly lower transaction costs are game-changers for platforms like Polymarket. For users, this translates to: Faster Transactions: Depositing, withdrawing, and trading on prediction markets will be much quicker, leading to a smoother user experience. Lower Fees: Reduced transaction fees make participating in prediction markets more affordable, especially for frequent traders and smaller bets. This removes a significant barrier to entry for many users. Enhanced Scalability: Solana’s scalability ensures that Polymarket can handle a growing user base and increasing market activity without performance bottlenecks. The ability to now facilitate SOL deposits is a direct benefit of this integration, allowing Solana users to seamlessly participate in Polymarket’s prediction markets using their native SOL tokens. The Benefits of Crypto Prediction: Transparency and Accessibility What makes crypto prediction markets like Polymarket so compelling? Beyond the technological advantages of Solana, the core concept of decentralized prediction markets offers several key benefits: Transparency: Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and market outcomes are recorded transparently and immutably on the ledger. This eliminates concerns about manipulation or lack of fairness often associated with traditional betting systems. Accessibility: Polymarket, being a decentralized platform, is generally more accessible globally compared to regulated traditional markets. This opens up opportunities for individuals worldwide to participate in prediction markets, regardless of geographical restrictions. Decentralization and Censorship Resistance: Operating on a blockchain means Polymarket is less susceptible to censorship or control by central authorities. This aligns with the core principles of decentralization in the crypto space. Innovation in Financial Markets: Crypto prediction markets represent an innovative approach to financial markets, offering new ways to gauge public opinion, hedge risks, and access information. The integration with Solana amplifies these benefits by making the platform more efficient and user-friendly, further driving the adoption of crypto prediction markets. Polymarket as a DeFi Platform: Expanding the Ecosystem Polymarket’s move to Solana strengthens its position not just as a prediction market but also as a significant DeFi platform . How does this launch contribute to the broader DeFi ecosystem? Increased DeFi Adoption on Solana: Polymarket’s arrival brings a well-established DeFi application to the Solana network, potentially attracting more users and developers to the ecosystem. Interoperability and Composability: As part of the Solana DeFi ecosystem, Polymarket can potentially integrate with other DeFi protocols and applications, creating new synergistic opportunities. Yield Generation Possibilities: Users may find new ways to earn yield through participation in Polymarket’s prediction markets and potentially through future integrations with other Solana-based DeFi platforms. Diversification of DeFi Offerings: Prediction markets add a unique and valuable offering to the diverse landscape of DeFi, going beyond lending, borrowing, and trading. By leveraging Solana’s robust infrastructure, Polymarket is not only enhancing its own platform but also contributing to the growth and diversification of the entire Solana DeFi platform ecosystem. Navigating the Challenges: Risks and Considerations While the launch on Solana and the potential of Polymarket are incredibly exciting, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and risks inherent in the crypto and prediction market space. What are some potential hurdles? Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto and prediction markets is still evolving globally. Polymarket, like other platforms in this space, must navigate potential regulatory changes and compliance requirements. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. This can impact the value of assets used in prediction markets and potentially introduce risks for participants. Smart Contract Risks: While blockchain technology is secure, smart contracts are not immune to vulnerabilities. Audits and security measures are crucial to mitigate smart contract risks on platforms like Polymarket. User Education: For broader adoption, user education is key. New users need to understand how prediction markets work, the associated risks, and how to use platforms like Polymarket responsibly. Despite these challenges, the potential rewards and innovation that platforms like Polymarket bring to the financial and information landscape are undeniable. The move to Solana is a bold step towards realizing that potential. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Leap for Prediction Markets Polymarket’s launch on Solana is more than just a platform migration; it’s a revolutionary move that promises to reshape the landscape of crypto prediction markets. By harnessing Solana’s speed, scalability, and low fees, Polymarket is poised to offer a superior user experience, attract a wider audience, and further solidify its position as a leading DeFi platform in the burgeoning crypto space. This integration not only benefits Polymarket and Solana but also contributes to the overall growth and maturity of the decentralized finance ecosystem. As prediction markets continue to gain traction, Polymarket’s innovative approach and strategic move to Solana position it at the forefront of this exciting evolution.

Some altcoins, such as DOGE and ADA, have charted notable gains over the past 24 hours but the day belongs to Cronos (CRO). BTC Stopped at $89K It was just a week ago, last Tuesday when BTC’s price struggled to remain above $81,000 after a $3,000 daily drop. However, it defended that level and spiked above $87,000 just a day later, following the conclusion of the second FOMC meeting for the year and Brad Garlinghouse’s triumphant announcement regarding the lawsuit between his company and the SEC. Nevertheless, bitcoin failed to maintain its run and was pushed south to around $84,000 where it spent the next few days. The first signs of a recovery came late on Sunday when BTC started to regain traction. This culminated on Monday with a surge to just under $89,000, but these factors stopped the asset from reclaiming that level. BTC slipped below $87,000 in the following hours but now stands above that line. Its market capitalization has risen to over $1.730 trillion, but its dominance over the alts has taken a hit and is down to 58.3% on CG. BTCUSD.

42314649,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=699291,1742896856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42314649.jpeg,Trump’s inner circle can’t decide if Russia’s Putin is a friend or a foe,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trumps-circle-decide-putin-friend-foe/,"The divide inside president Donald Trump’s own camp over Vladimir Putin has now gone public. On Tuesday, when U.S. intelligence leaders appear in front of Congress to deliver their first Worldwide Threat Assessment of Trump’s second term, they will be forced to pick a side. That report is expected to reflect either the long-standing intelligence stance that Putin is trying to crush Ukraine and weaken the U.S. and its allies—or the new framing pushed by Trump’s allies, who now describe Putin as a trustworthy future partner who wants to end the war, hold territory, and restart normal ties with the U.S. According to The New York Times , that contradiction is at the center of growing tension inside the administration. The split got sharper after Steve Witkoff, one of Trump’s oldest friends from his real estate days and now his handpicked envoy to the Middle East and Russia, started echoing the Kremlin’s lines almost word for word. Speaking to Tucker Carlson, the pro-Trump independent media journalist, Witkoff rejected the idea that Europe needed peacekeepers to hold Russia back, saying it was “a combination of a posture and a pose.” He called it paranoia. “It’s this sort of idea of we’ve all got to be like Winston Churchill, the Russians are going to march across Europe,” he said. “I think that’s preposterous.” Witkoff downplays Ukraine invasion and calls Putin ‘straight up’ Three years after Russian troops rolled into Kyiv, Witkoff told Carlson that he doesn’t believe Putin wants to take over all of Ukraine. “Why would they want to absorb Ukraine?” he said. “For what purpose, exactly? They don’t need to absorb Ukraine. They want stability there.” He also described his meeting with Putin as honest. “I thought he was straight up with me,” Witkoff said, referring to the same man who told the world he wouldn’t invade Ukraine, right before he did exactly that. This new tone has left American allies, diplomats, and even career intelligence professionals stunned. Before Trump came into power, the general consensus in Washington and across Europe was that they had underestimated Putin for far too long. Back in 2007, Putin made it clear he believed parts of the former Soviet Union should be returned to Russia. He followed up with military action in Georgia, the annexation of Crimea, and sending unmarked soldiers into Donbas to fight a proxy war. Even then, sanctions took time. Europe was late to rearm. That’s something Trump himself still uses when he demands more defense spending from NATO allies. But while he pressures Europe to defend itself, he refuses to say plainly that Russia invaded Ukraine. That denial puts him at odds with several European leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said last week, “I don’t trust Putin.” Starmer told The New York Times, “I’m sure Putin would try to insist that Ukraine should be defenseless after a deal because that gives him what he wants, which is the opportunity to go in again.” Intelligence leaders walk a tightrope ahead of testimony As of now, there is no sign that U.S. intelligence agencies have changed their assessment of Putin. Their conclusions still paint Russia as a threat. But when Tulsi Gabbard, the new Director of National Intelligence, and John Ratcliffe, the new CIA director, testify on Tuesday, they will have to find a way to talk about Russia without openly clashing with the narrative coming from the White House. Witkoff, meanwhile, continues to describe a future where Russia and the U.S. cooperate. He told Carlson that the two countries could “share sea lanes, maybe send LNG gas into Europe together, maybe collaborate on A.I. together.” But in his scenario, Russia keeps the land it currently holds and Ukraine stays out of NATO permanently. “Who doesn’t want to see a world like that?” he asked. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said these comments from Trump’s people are causing confusion inside the intelligence community. “If you grew up in the intelligence community knowing all the awful things Vladimir Putin had done and all of a sudden you have a change in posture where you completely take Russia’s side, how do you make sense of that?” he said. Warner also confirmed that the upcoming intelligence report is still in line with previous assessments and hasn’t been watered down. But what’s said publicly in front of Congress remains unclear. So far, he added, the administration’s public comments on Ukraine have ignored the traditional view that Russia is the aggressor. Foreign governments see Russian talking points in Trump’s messaging All of this is putting a strain on U.S. relationships with intelligence partners abroad. The U.S. has more collection capabilities than anyone, but the data from allies still matters. If partners begin to doubt whether the U.S. is being honest or consistent about its analysis, they could stop sharing sensitive information. Officials from several allied governments said off the record that they were alarmed by how closely Witkoff’s remarks mirrored Kremlin propaganda. For example, Witkoff defended the so-called referendums held by Russia in four occupied Ukrainian provinces. These votes were widely condemned as fake, with reports of people being threatened with torture or deportation if they didn’t vote the right way. Still, Witkoff spoke about them as if they were legitimate elections. “There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule,” he said. The response from Kyiv came fast. Oleksandr Merezhko, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, told Ukrainian media on Monday that Witkoff should be removed from his role. “These are simply disgraceful, shocking statements,” he said. “He is relaying Russian propaganda. And I have a question: Who is he? Is he Trump’s envoy, or maybe he’s Putin’s envoy?” President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking to Time magazine on Monday, took a more careful approach. He said he believed Russia had managed to influence parts of Trump’s team with false information. In a previous interview, he said the disinformation campaign surrounding Trump had damaged their relationship for years. Still, Zelensky pushed back directly against one of Trump’s repeated claims. The U.S. president has said that retreating Ukrainian troops in western Russia had been surrounded. “That was a lie,” Zelensky said.

Meanwhile, Infini filed a lawsuit in Hong Kong after a $50 million crypto hack, using on-chain legal notices to pursue the hacker. In another incident, Binance suspended a staffer over insider trading allegations linked to a token launch. The individual is accused of using confidential information from a former BNB Chain role. Robinhood Faces Scrutiny Over Prediction Markets Massachusetts’ securities regulator initiated a probe into Robinhood’s new prediction markets feature after raising concerns about its potential link to gambling behavior among young investors. According to Reuters , Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin confirmed that his office issued a subpoena to Robinhood last week to obtain details about the company’s marketing strategies and the number of Massachusetts users engaging with its sports-related event contracts, particularly those tied to college basketball tournaments. Galvin criticized Robinhood’s approach, and accused the platform of connecting gambling-like bets on popular sports events to investment accounts, thereby drawing in inexperienced investors with what he described as gimmicks. His office is investigating whether Robinhood’s offerings violate state securities laws and whether they were adequately vetted after previous regulatory concerns. Robinhood unveiled its prediction markets hub on March 17. It offers event contracts via Kalshi, which is a platform registered with and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The offerings include contracts on sports tournaments and economic indicators like the May federal funds rate. A spokesperson for Robinhood defended the move by clarifying that the event contracts are CFTC-regulated. Despite the scrutiny, Robinhood Markets (HOOD) shares closed relatively unchanged on March 24 after a 9% rally earlier in the day. While the CFTC and Galvin’s office have yet to issue official statements regarding the probe, the situation proves that there is still regulatory tension around prediction markets. Event contracts allow users to wager on outcomes ranging from sports and elections to cryptocurrency prices, and they have been gaining popularity through platforms like Kalshi and the blockchain-based Polymarket. However, they also increasingly attracted regulatory attention. Last month, Robinhood withdrew its Super Bowl event contracts just one day after launch, due to a request from the CFTC . As part of the Massachusetts probe, Robinhood was also asked to provide internal communications surrounding the launch of the college basketball contracts, particularly in light of the CFTC’s earlier objection to the Super Bowl offerings. The CFTC reportedly made similar inquiries to Kalshi and Crypto.com about the regulatory compliance of their own Super Bowl-related products. Infini Hack Triggers Legal Battle in Hong Kong While Robinhood faces the Massachusetts legal system, stablecoin payment platform Infini filed a lawsuit in Hong Kong against developer Chen Shanxuan and several unidentified people after a hack that drained almost $50 million in crypto assets. The legal action was initiated on March 24, and was communicated through an on-chain message directed at the attacker, naming Chen and three unknown persons with wallet access as defendants. (Source: Etherscan ) Infini was able to trace 49.5 million USDC from its stolen funds, and these assets are now part of an ongoing legal dispute. The company warned that any parties currently holding the funds cannot claim to be bona fide purchasers without notice of the dispute. To serve the defendants, the Hong Kong court issued an injunction order and a writ of summons through an on-chain message. This is increasingly used to deliver legal notices to anonymous wallets associated with stolen crypto. The summons requires the defendants to appear in court for a return date hearing. In an attempt to recover the funds, Infini previously offered the attacker a 20% bounty after the Feb. 24 exploit . The team claimed it obtained IP and device data tied to the attack and was actively monitoring the blockchain addresses involved. In its message, Infini promised to cease all tracking and analysis and offer immunity if 80% of the funds were returned. Despite this offer and the legal pressure, the attacker did not return any of the assets. The exploit took place not long after Bybit experienced the largest crypto hack on record when $1.4 billion was stolen from its multisignature wallet on Feb. 21. According to Marwan Hachem , COO of cybersecurity firm FearsOff, the timing of the Infini hack seemed strategic. He suggested the attackers took advantage of the global focus on the Bybit breach, believing their operation will go unnoticed during the chaos. Binance Suspends Staffer Over Insider Trading Meanwhile, Binance recently suspended a member of its Binance Wallet team after allegations of insider trading involving non-public information about a project’s token launch. The suspension came after Binance Wallet launched an internal investigation on March 23 in response to a complaint that the staff member engaged in front-running trades to gain improper profits. Crypto insider trading is the illegal practice of using non-public or confidential information about a crypto project or exchange to make profitable trades before the information becomes public. This could involve buying or selling tokens based on knowledge of upcoming listings, partnerships, or events like token launches. It gives an unfair advantage and is considered market manipulation. In a statement that was posted on March 25, Binance said that the investigation revealed that the employee, who joined Binance Wallet last month, previously held a business development role at BNB Chain and allegedly used confidential knowledge of an upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) to buy large quantities of the project’s tokens ahead of its public announcement. The tokens were reportedly sold shortly after the announcement for a large profit. Binance Wallet said the employee used multiple linked wallet addresses to execute the trades and violated company policy by taking advantage of insider information from a former position. The person was immediately suspended, and the company stated it will pursue further disciplinary actions and cooperate with authorities to potentially bring legal charges. Although Binance did not name the individual, users on X identified Freddie Ng, a former BNB Chain operations manager who recently joined Binance Wallet, as the person in question. X user “py ” pointed to wallet activity showing a profit of $82,400 from U DEX Platform’s UUU token, and linked it to an address that was originally funded by “freddieng.bnb,” a handle Ng publicly shared. Binance Wallet acknowledged the role of the community in uncovering the incident but pointed out that rewards for whistleblowing will only be granted to those who submitted tips through its official email channel. As part of this, the company announced it will distribute a $100,000 reward equally among four anonymous people who reported the incident through the proper channel.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-25 10:02:37

Blockchain investigator ZachXBT slammed CRO as a “scam,” accusing Crypto.com of secretly reviving 70 billion tokens that were supposedly burned forever. Meanwhile, investors are furious, claiming the project is too centralized and their voices are being ignored. Will CRO’s price continue to rise, or is trouble ahead? Controversy Over Reviving 70 B CRO Tokens Despite the controversy, the partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com is making waves in the crypto world. The two companies plan to launch ETFs and ETPs that combine cryptocurrencies, including CRO and Bitcoin, with traditional securities However, blockchain investigator ZachXBT strongly criticized Crypto.com, calling CRO a scam. His criticism stems from Crypto.com’s decision to reintroduce 70 billion CRO tokens that had been burned back in 2021. CRO is no different from a scam Your team just reissued 70B CRO a week ago that was previously burned “forever” in 2021 (70% total supply) and went against the community wishes as you control majority of the supply. Unsure why Truth would chose a partnership with your exchange… pic.twitter.com/XNlusLDdZc — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) March 25, 2025 At the time, Crypto.com assured investors the tokens were permanently removed to reduce supply and boost value, making them believe only 30 billion remained. Now, reissuing these tokens has led to frustration and panic within the community. Allegations of Centralization and Manipulation The controversy intensified when reports showed that Crypto.com controls between 70-80% of the voting power on the Cronos network. Even though 77.97% of independent validators opposed bringing back the tokens, and only 11.86% supported it. Despite this Crypto.com pushed the decision through. This has led to accusations of centralization, with many believing the company has too much control over the blockchain. Investors React With Frustration CRO holders reacted quickly and strongly, feeling betrayed by the move. Many loyal supporters of Cronos shared their disappointment. A well-known figure, Wyll Bildeberg, expressed his frustration on social media, saying burned tokens should never return. He warned that this decision could damage trust in the project and the entire crypto market. What’s Next for CRO Coin? Although the CRO saw an immediate surge to $0.115 following the partnership news, since then its price has stabilized around $0.108 reflecting a rise of 30% seen in the last 24 hours. Looking at the daily chart, CRO’s price has formed a bullish pattern. It has climbed slightly above the 50-day moving average, a key bullish signal. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending upward, indicating growing buying pressure. Therefore, if the momentum continues, CRO could rally toward the $0.133 resistance level, which aligns with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level – another 30% jump from here!",News,EN,0,0,CRO|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 10:03:20

However, the price action remains decisive, as a breakout or rejection at this level is likely to trigger a significant move. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ripple has been in a bullish retracement but is now encountering a critical resistance at the 100-day moving average ($2.5). The market is currently experiencing low volatility, reflecting an equilibrium between buyers and sellers. This consolidation phase suggests that a surge in demand or supply will likely trigger a significant move. Given the presence of sellers at this level, a rejection appears more probable. However, if XRP manages a bullish breakout, a short squeeze could propel the price toward the $3 key resistance. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, XRP’s price has been retracing upward but is now losing momentum, leading to sideways consolidation. The market shows low trading activity and lacks a clear directional bias, reinforcing the idea of a temporary balance between bulls and bears. Ripple currently faces strong resistance in the $2.5–$2.8 range, likely filled with selling pressure that could limit further gains. Given these conditions, further consolidation within the $2–$2.8 zone seems more plausible in the mid-term, with an eventual breakout determining the next major trend.

42314563,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142959,1742897117,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exposed: a16z-Backed AI Startup 11x Accused of Deceptive Customer Claims in Venture Capital Funding Scandal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-startup-fake-customer-scandal/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, the allure of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undeniable. Venture capital is pouring into AI startups, promising revolutionary changes. But what happens when the hype overshadows reality? Recently, AI sales automation startup 11x, backed by prominent venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Benchmark, has come under intense scrutiny. Bitcoin World’s exclusive investigation reveals a troubling narrative of alleged inflated customer numbers and questionable financial reporting, raising serious questions about transparency and ethics within the booming AI startup ecosystem. Is this the dark side of the AI revolution venture capitalists didn’t see coming? The Explosive Growth and Sudden Scrutiny of AI Startup 11x Founded in 2022, 11x quickly positioned itself as a rising star in the competitive landscape of AI-powered sales development representatives (SDRs). The company offers an AI bot designed to automate outbound cold sales, from identifying potential clients to scheduling crucial sales calls. This resonated strongly with investors, culminating in a $24 million Series A round led by Benchmark in September, followed swiftly by a massive $50 million Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz. These significant venture capital injections fueled rapid expansion and ambitious growth targets. However, behind the veneer of success, a different story was brewing. Multiple sources, including investors, current, and former employees, have painted a picture of financial instability and potentially misleading practices at the heart of this AI startup. Fake Customer Claims: ZoomInfo and Airtable Deny Endorsements One of the most damaging allegations against 11x is the claim of using fake customer endorsements. Startups often display customer logos on their websites to build credibility and demonstrate market validation. However, Bitcoin World’s investigation uncovered that several companies listed as customers on 11x’s website explicitly denied being clients. ZoomInfo , a prominent sales data and automation tool provider, confirmed they only conducted a short trial of 11x’s product and found it underperforming compared to their own SDR employees. Despite this, ZoomInfo alleges 11x falsely claimed them as a customer across various channels, including sales calls and their website. ZoomInfo’s legal team is now reportedly threatening legal action over deceptive trade practices and false advertising. Airtable , another company whose logo appeared on 11x’s website, also refuted customer status. Airtable confirmed a brief product trial that did not lead to adoption. Yet, 11x continued to list Airtable as a customer on their website even until recently. These accusations of fake customer claims cast a shadow over 11x’s reported growth and raise serious ethical questions. While 11x insists they promptly remove inaccurate customer mentions when requested, attributing any discrepancies to “human error,” the repeated instances and delayed removals suggest a potentially more systemic issue within the AI startup’s customer acquisition and reporting processes. ARR Controversy: Misleading Revenue Reporting Tactics? Another key area of concern revolves around 11x’s method of calculating and reporting Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), a critical metric for SaaS startups and a key indicator for venture capital investors. Former and current employees allege that 11x employed a potentially misleading tactic by including revenue from contracts that were likely to be terminated within a three-month “break clause” period in their ARR calculations. Here’s a breakdown of the alleged ARR controversy: Issue Description One-Year Contracts with Break Clauses 11x reportedly insisted on one-year contracts even for pilot programs but offered a three-month break clause, essentially functioning as a trial period. Inflated ARR Calculation Despite the high churn rate after the trial period, 11x allegedly calculated ARR based on the full year contract value, even for customers who exited after three months. Lack of Transparency Employees claim this practice created a distorted picture of the company’s actual sustainable revenue and growth trajectory, potentially misleading investors and stakeholders. While 11x defends its use of “contracted ARR (CARR)” and claims investors were aware of this metric, the core issue remains transparency and accurate representation of sustainable growth. Venture capital firms expect startups to be upfront about potential opt-out revenue and customer churn. If these allegations are true, 11x’s ARR controversy could represent a significant misrepresentation of their financial health and long-term viability as an AI startup. Product Underperformance and High Churn Rate Beyond the financial and customer claim issues, the actual performance of 11x’s AI product itself is under scrutiny. Multiple sources suggest a high churn rate, with a significant percentage of customers discontinuing service after the trial period. The reasons cited for product dissatisfaction include: Unrealistic Expectations: Some customers reportedly expected 11x’s AI to completely replace human sales teams, leading to disappointment when the results didn’t meet these inflated hopes. Product Limitations: Complaints surfaced about the AI’s performance, including hallucinations (generating inaccurate information) and technical glitches that hindered functionality. Questionable Effectiveness: Customers reported that the number of meetings booked by the AI was disappointing compared to the volume of automated emails sent. Some reviewers even found competitor products more effective and cost-efficient. The alleged product underperformance directly impacts customer retention and further fuels concerns about the long-term sustainability of 11x’s business model. A high churn rate, especially in the competitive AI startup landscape, can be a major red flag for venture capital investors and future growth prospects. Toxic Work Environment and Employee Churn Adding to the mounting challenges, reports of a demanding and stressful work environment under CEO Hasan Sukkar have emerged. Employees described a “hustle culture” taken to extremes, with expectations of constant availability and extremely long working hours. Key concerns about the work environment include: Excessive Work Hours: Employees reported routinely working 60+ hours a week, with pressure to be available at all hours, including nights and weekends. Founder’s Demands: CEO Sukkar allegedly sent messages late at night and early morning, expecting immediate responses. Employees claimed a lack of work-life balance and limited tolerance for time off. Public Shaming: Employees reported instances of Sukkar publicly criticizing individuals in company-wide Slack channels for perceived lack of availability or performance issues. Fear of Retaliation: Speaking out against these practices allegedly carried the risk of dismissal, creating a culture of fear and silence. The high employee churn, with only the CEO remaining from the initial launch team photo, further suggests potential systemic issues within the company culture. While 11x attributes some turnover to the relocation from London to Silicon Valley, the broader narrative paints a picture of a demanding and potentially unsustainable work environment within this AI startup. Venture Capital Giants Respond: a16z Denies Legal Action Given the gravity of the allegations, speculation arose about the response from 11x’s lead Series B investor, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Rumors circulated about potential legal action from a16z. However, a spokesperson for Andreessen Horowitz emphatically denied these rumors, stating that a16z is not suing 11x. Benchmark, the Series A lead investor, declined to comment on the situation. The public stance of these venture capital giants remains crucial as the situation unfolds. Their continued support, or lack thereof, will significantly impact 11x’s future trajectory in the competitive AI market. Conclusion: The Unraveling of an AI Startup Dream? The allegations leveled against 11x paint a concerning picture of a startup seemingly prioritizing rapid growth and inflated metrics over ethical business practices and product efficacy. From fake customer claims and ARR controversy to product underperformance and a demanding work environment, the challenges facing 11x appear multifaceted and deeply rooted. While 11x refutes many of the claims and points to product improvements and customer retention strategies, the sheer volume and consistency of the allegations from multiple sources cannot be easily dismissed. The future of this once-promising AI startup hangs in the balance, serving as a stark reminder of the critical importance of due diligence, transparency, and ethical conduct in the high-stakes world of venture capital and AI innovation. This unfolding story underscores the need for investors and the broader tech community to look beyond the hype and scrutinize the underlying foundations of even the most celebrated AI startups.

They do this by quoting prices to both buyers (bid) and sellers (ask) and taking the opposite side to the transactions. The market maker, which wasn't identified, made a $38 million profit when the MOVE tokens were first offered for trading on the exchange, Binance said Tuesday . Instead of meeting its obligations to ensure sufficient order size and place orders for both bid and ask prices, it placed sell orders for 66 million MOVE tokens one day after the initial listing and “little buy orders.” One-sided market-making activity is widely considered illicit and illegal, and Binance reiterated that strict rules are in place for defaulters. The entity was offboarded on March 18, and both the Movement Labs and Movement Foundation teams were informed of the “irregularities with their market maker,” Binance said in the post. The market maker is no longer able to participate on the exchange and all proceeds were frozen to compensate users, whose details will be available at a later date. “Any project-authorized market makers who do not comply with or breach such principles and rules, Binance will take further actions against such market makers to best protect our users,” the exchange said.

Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) correlation with the Nasdaq appears to be inching closer to a level that has only been reached twice before right before BTC price crashed 20%, data from Singapore-based blockchain firm Matrixport reveals. 📊Today’s #Matrixport Daily Chart – March 25 2025 🔽 Bitcoin-Nasdaq Correlation Hits Extreme: Divergence Likely Ahead #cryptocurrency #BTCETF #Matrixport #BTC #Trump #market #trading #Bitcoin #MarketTrends pic.twitter.com/nwsfrIhERJ — Matrixport Official (@Matrixport_EN) March 25, 2025 In a recent X post , Matrixport revealed that the 30-day realized correlation between Bitcoin proxy IBIT and the Nasdaq is likely due to such factors as the recent repricing of earnings expectations ahead of Q1 earnings season and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions. “This correlation reflects the recent repricing of earnings expectations ahead of Q1 earnings season, along with ongoing uncertainty and the negative overhang from tariff discussions. As a result, Bitcoin is trading in line with the tech sector.” Matrixport You might also like: BlackRock rolls out Bitcoin ETP for European clients Despite the current trend, Matrixport cautions that such high correlations typically do not last for long, noting that “such high correlations have historically been short-lived, suggesting that a divergence in performance between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq may be on the horizon.” The last two times the correlation reached this level, Bitcoin’s price dropped by more than 20%, according to data from crypto price aggregators. While the latest correlation activity could point to Bitcoin potentially decoupling from the Nasdaq’s influence in the near future, there’s still no clear timeline or certainty that such a divergence will happen. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds returned to weekly inflows as BTC settled back above the crucial $85,000 support level, which analysts believe is necessary for the next leg higher. 10x Research’s Markus Thielen noted in a March 23 report that Bitcoin’s reversal indicators have turned bullish, with the 21-day moving average now at $85,200.

Dogecoin has jumped by 5% after House of Doge created a 10M DOGE reserve. Analysts see potential for more gains, with some predicting a new all-time high in the coming months. Shiba Inu has risen by 3.5% amid rising Shibarium activity, higher burn rate, and decreasing exchange netflow – signs of bullish momentum. What’s New Around Pi Network? The controversial crypto project marked a major achievement on February 20 when it finally released its Open Network, which also saw the launch of the PI token. The asset’s valuation experienced huge turbulence during its first trading days, ranging from under $0.70 to an all-time high of almost $3 (registered on February 27). Since then, PI has been experiencing an evident downfall, currently hovering at around $0.92 (per CoinGecko’s data). The exchanges that have already embraced the coin include OKX, Bitget, Gate.io, and CoinEx (the latest to hop on the bandwagon). Additional support from major platforms might positively affect the price and reverse the negative trend. The community expects Binance’s decision, which held a vote last month to check whether its users want to see PI listed on the exchange. Over 86% of the voters clicked the “yes” option, but the company has yet to respect their wishes. Meanwhile, the team behind Pi Network did not extend the KYC process (known as the Grace Period), meaning users who did not take the necessary steps until March 14 risked forfeiting most of their minted PI tokens. Recently, the developers behind the project said some Pioneers will have to complete two-factor authentication (2FA) using a trusted email before their PI holdings get successfully migrated to the mainnet blockchain. Earlier this week, Pi News (a media channel focusing on the project) claimed that PI investors can now see their tokens in the official wallet of the popular messaging application Telegram . Additionally, Pi Network informed that community apps that have complied with the ecosystem’s listing guidelines and completed PiNet migration by May 28, 2025, can “secure their domains without bidding, with certain requirements and restrictions.” DOGE Heads North The biggest meme coin in terms of market capitalization is the best-performing top 20 cryptocurrency today (March 25). Its price has surged by over 5%, and it’s currently trading at above $0.18. DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko Perhaps the most apparent reason triggering the rally is the establishment of “The Official Dogecoin Reserve” by House of Doge – an entity related to the meme coin. “Through the launch of the Reserve and an initial 10 million Dogecoin purchase, House of Doge is creating a proof of concept to show that Dogecoin can facilitate seamless and efficient transactions,” the official statement reads. DOGE’s pump caught the eye of numerous analysts who envisioned further gains in the near future . Ali Martinez, for instance, estimated that the price has broken out of its multi-week triangle, which could be a precursor of a 16% upswing. The X user Trader Tardigrade was much more bullish, projecting an explosion to a new all-time high of over $6 in the following months. SHIB Price Outlook DOGE’s biggest rival has also entered into green territory, albeit registering less substantial gains than the OG meme coin. While Shiba Inu has pumped by 3.5% in the past 24 hours, some important factors suggest this might be the beginning of a new bull run. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko As CryptoPotato reported , those elements include the increased activity on Shibarium, the recent spike of the SHIB burn rate, and the negative exchange netflows (on a weekly scale), which signal reduced immediate selling pressure.

Gox Moves Another $1B in Bitcoin, Fueling Payout Speculation",https://thecoinrise.com/mt-gox-moves-another-1b-in-bitcoin-fueling-payout-speculation/,"Bankrupt crypto exchange Mt. Gox has once again shifted a massive amount of Bitcoin, marking its third major transaction in less than a month. On March 25, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence reported that the defunct Japanese exchange transferred 11,501 BTC, worth approximately $1 billion at current prices, across two wallets. According to Arkham, 893 BTC (roughly $78 million) were sent to the exchange’s cold wallet (1Jbez), while the remaining 10,608 BTC (around $929 million) were transferred to a change wallet (1DcoA). The move follows two previous large-scale transfers earlier this month: 12,000 BTC on March 6 and 11,833 BTC on March 11 —both totaling over $1 billion each. Blockchain platform Spot On Chain noted that one of the earlier transfers ended up on Bitstamp, sparking speculation that the latest 893 BTC sent to the warm wallet could soon be moved to an exchange as well. Bitcoin Payouts Could Be Imminent The latest movements have reignited speculation about creditor payouts, which have been long overdue. Mt. Gox still holds approximately 35,000 BTC, valued at around $3.1 billion, across its wallets. With these recent transactions, many believe the exchange could be preparing to distribute Bitcoin repayments to its creditors. Creditors have the option to receive their compensation in Bitcoin, and despite fears of a market dump , a July 2024 Reddit poll revealed that most creditors were not in a hurry to sell their BTC payouts. This suggests that even if payouts commence, a sudden wave of sell-offs may not be inevitable. A Decade-Long Fallout Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange, handling up to 80% of global BTC trades, filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after falling victim to a massive hack that resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC. In the aftermath, a Tokyo court appointed a trustee to oversee the bankruptcy proceedings and handle creditor compensation. However, the payout process has faced numerous delays. In October 2023, the trustee extended the repayment deadline by another year to October 31, 2025, citing incomplete procedures from many creditors. The exchange’s latest large-scale transfers, combined with its December 2023 move of 24,000 BTC worth $2.5 billion, have kept the crypto community on edge. The post Mt.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/usd-coin-usdc-issuer-circle-launches-usdc-trading-in-another-country-here-are-the-details/,"Circle, the issuer of USD Coin (USDC), is set to launch the stablecoin in Japan on March 26 through a strategic partnership with SBI Holdings. Circle to Launch USDC in Japan on March 26 in Partnership with SBI The move marks a significant milestone for the Japanese blockchain ecosystem, as Circle becomes one of the first global stablecoin issuers to enter the country under Japan’s new electronic payments framework. “Japan has long been at the forefront of the adoption of Web3 and blockchain technology, and Japan’s regulatory leadership has similarly been at the forefront of clear rules for the use of stablecoins in the Japanese financial system,” Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said in a statement. Regulatory Approval and Market Impact Earlier this month, Circle and SBI Holdings received approval from the Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) to issue USDC in the country. Circle has been working with regulators for two years to comply with Japan’s strict financial laws, Allaire said in a post on X. Highlighting the potential impact of the USDC launch, SBI Holdings Chairman and CEO Yoshitaka Kitao said: “We believe this initiative will increase financial accessibility and foster digital asset innovation, aligning with our broader vision for the future of payments and blockchain-based finance in Japan.” USDC Global Presence USDC is currently the second-largest stablecoin with a market cap of around $59.7 billion, according to CoinGecko. It has seen increasing adoption in Asia, with the Philippines’ largest digital wallet, GCash, recently integrating USDC support. The 2024 Circle report found that the Asia-Pacific region accounts for 29% of global digital currency transactions, ahead of Western Europe (22%) and North America (19%). As Circle continues its expansion in Asia, Japan’s pro-stablecoin regulatory stance could position the country as a key hub for digital finance innovation in the region. *This is not investment advice.

Whale wallets with more than 1,000 BTC in them now number 2,077 — just under all-time highs — and 10,000 BTC has left exchanges recently — a textbook sign of long-term holding. As technical indicators suggest Bitcoin could rally by 66% if it breaks the $84,500 resistance level, the analyst predicts new all-time highs. In this environment, however, services like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), whose presale is picking up, could emerge as beneficiaries of a resurgence of goodwill in crypto. Mutuum Finance Presale is Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 3 Presale overall $4.7million+ raised, 6,500 holders) - is priced at $0.02 per token. Demand is still white hot: phase three has already exceeded 50% supply, and with phase four’s upcoming 25% price increase to $0.025, this is urgent. The answer is, early participants can immediately stand to make 25% in paper profits when the next step starts, and the project’s tokenomics guarantees a 200% return at its $0.06 exchange listing. If MUTM were to reach $3 in the weeks after launch, that would mean a jaw-dropping 14,900% and in ROI for phase-three buyers. While many speculative tokens exist, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides real-world utility through decentralized lending and borrowing. Users deposit assets like ETH or stablecoins and receive mtTokens that earn interest and that can be traded or staked across DeFi platforms. This model creates organic demand for MUTM fueled by a buy-and-distribute model that uses platform fees to buy back tokens and redistribute them, carrying continuous upward pressure. Bitcoin’s Rally May be Bullish For MUTM The historical data suggests that often Bitcoin rallies provide great upward momentum for are breakouts of altcoins. If BTC does reach past 95k as predicted, it may also mean capital floods into most high utility projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The platform’s overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer lending features fill in gaps in decentralized finance, providing stability in crypto’s volatility. Moreover, it stays away from the dependence on hype — its revenue-sharing and mtToken both systems create an incentive for long-term holding, unlike meme-based assets vulnerable to aggressive profit-taking. The scarcity of phase three’s inventory highlights a growing FOMO. Investors can see how the presale’s structured price increases—each stage removes access to lower entry points. As we approach the $0.025 phase four threshold, postponing involvement could mean missing out on the last stages of the presale ahead of exchange listings. Security and Transparency Bolster Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is just completing a smart contract audit with CertiK, a milestone designed to increase investor confidence. After completion, the audit results will be made publicly available, further demonstrating the project’s dedication to security. This follows planned platform expansions, including an overcollateralized stablecoin meant to bolster liquidity and utility in its ecosystem. With Bitcoin’s institutional inflows and technical alignment indicating a bullish 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents as a potential hedge. Its presale embodies a balance of accessibility and exponential growth potential, harmonizing DeFi innovation and practical financial solutions. For the investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto adoption, MUTM represent a rare alignment in early-stage pricing and scalable utility. Seizing the Opportunity Window Tokens in the crypto market are seldom guaranteed but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is providing entry at calculated upside with transparent tokenomics and real-world utility. With phase three nearly exhausted and Bitcoin’s rally building momentum, the project finds itself at the intersection of timing and innovation. Those who do are now locked in with tokens before exchange listings boost demand — and price. With the CertiK audit pending, the opportunity for early returns shrinks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating its own ecosystem where lending is synonymous with longevity. For investors, the math is simple: either take action now while phase three is still open, or watch the next DeFi champion rise to the occasion without you.

The volumes of trade have been above $4 billion at peak levels, but the price itself remains virtually unchanged. Summer Slowdown Impacts Crypto Trading Analysts cite seasonal patterns as the major reason for XRP’s current behavior.

Gox Bitcoin Transfer: $77 Million BTC Deposited into Kraken – What’s Next?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mt-gox-bitcoin-kraken-transfer-2/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! A notable event has just unfolded in the world of Bitcoin and crypto exchanges. Remember Mt. Gox, the defunct exchange that’s become synonymous with crypto’s early turbulence? Well, an address linked to Mt. Gox has just made a significant move, transferring a substantial amount of Bitcoin to Kraken. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s grabbing headlines. Massive Bitcoin Transfer Alert: Mt. Gox to Kraken According to on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa, a whopping 893.41 BTC, valued at approximately $77.43 million, has been deposited into the Kraken crypto exchange from an address associated with the infamous Mt. Gox. This massive Bitcoin transfer was preceded by a tiny test transaction of 0.000017 BTC, a common practice to ensure the receiving address is correct before sending large sums. This action immediately sparked discussions and speculations within the crypto community. Why now? What’s the purpose? Is this related to the long-awaited Mt. Gox rehabilitation plan? Here’s a quick rundown of the key details: Source: Mt. Gox-linked address Destination: Kraken crypto exchange Amount: 893.41 BTC Value: Approximately $77.43 million (USD) Preceding Action: Small test transaction of 0.000017 BTC Reported By: On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X Why is this Mt. Gox Bitcoin Transfer Significant? The name Mt. Gox still sends shivers down the spines of many in the crypto world. Once the dominant crypto exchange , it collapsed spectacularly in 2014 after a massive hack, leaving thousands of users with significant losses. The subsequent years have been a long and complex process of rehabilitation, with creditors patiently waiting for the return of their funds. Any movement of Bitcoin linked to Mt. Gox is therefore closely watched as it could signal progress in this drawn-out saga. Here’s why this Mt. Gox related activity is noteworthy: Potential Payouts: The most immediate speculation is that this BTC transfer could be related to the ongoing rehabilitation plan. Creditors have been anticipating payouts for years, and movements of funds from Mt. Gox wallets are often interpreted as steps towards this process. Market Impact: Large Bitcoin transfers , especially those originating from Mt. Gox-related addresses, can sometimes create ripples in the market. Traders and analysts monitor these movements for potential sell-offs or shifts in market sentiment. While $77 million is not market-shattering in today’s crypto landscape, the psychological impact of Mt. Gox related activities remains. Transparency and On-Chain Analysis: This event highlights the power of on-chain analysis. Analysts like @ai_9684xtpa can track transactions on the blockchain, providing transparency and insights into fund movements that would be opaque in traditional financial systems. This visibility is crucial for understanding the flow of digital assets and detecting potentially significant events. Kraken Crypto Exchange: The Recipient The choice of Kraken as the recipient crypto exchange is also interesting. Kraken is a well-established and reputable platform, known for its security and compliance. It’s a logical choice for handling large transactions and potential payouts. It is one of the major players in the crypto space and is well-equipped to manage significant inflows of Bitcoin. Kraken offers several advantages as a platform for such transactions: Feature Benefit Robust Security Protects against theft and hacking attempts. High Liquidity Facilitates smooth and efficient trading if the BTC is intended for sale. Regulatory Compliance Ensures adherence to legal and financial standards. Established Reputation Provides confidence and trust in handling large sums. What Does This Mean for Mt. Gox Creditors and the Bitcoin Market? For Mt. Gox creditors, this BTC transfer could be a glimmer of hope. It may indicate that the rehabilitation process is moving forward and that payouts might be closer than ever. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one transaction, and the Mt. Gox situation is notoriously complex. It’s still uncertain if this deposit directly translates to imminent payouts. As for the broader Bitcoin market, the immediate impact is likely to be minimal. However, continued monitoring of Mt. Gox-related wallet activity is essential. If further transfers occur and lead to a significant amount of BTC entering the market, it could potentially exert downward pressure on prices, at least temporarily. Market participants will be keenly observing for any follow-up actions. Stay Tuned for Updates on Mt. Gox and Bitcoin This Mt. Gox Bitcoin transfer to Kraken is a developing story. The crypto community is watching closely for further movements and official announcements that might shed more light on the purpose of this transaction. Is this the beginning of the payout process for creditors? Will it have any noticeable effect on the Bitcoin price? Only time will tell. For now, this event serves as a reminder of the long shadow cast by Mt. Gox and the enduring interest in any developments related to its vast Bitcoin holdings. It also underscores the importance of on-chain analysis in providing real-time insights into the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

42318120,https://finbold.com/?p=241905,1742902471,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Analyst predicts $10 XRP by 2030,https://finbold.com/analyst-predicts-10-xrp-by-2030/,"XRP is riding a wave of renewed optimism as its price hovers at $2.45. With a market cap of $142.2 billion, XRP is inching closer to overtaking Tether ( USDT ) as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a gap of just $1.6 billion, according to the latest Finbold data . XRP market cap. Source: Finbold This surge in attention comes on the heels of a landmark development: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially dropped its long-standing lawsuit against Ripple Labs, a move that one analyst says could propel XRP to new heights, forecasting a $10 price tag by 2030. XRP’s price performance in the last year XRP has been a standout performer in the crypto market over the past year, boasting a remarkable 287% price increase, outperforming 94% of the top 100 crypto assets, including heavyweights Bitcoin and Ethereum. The token’s resilience is currently trading position above the 200-day simple moving average, a key technical indicator of long-term strength, although it only has 16 green days in the last 30 (53%). In the short term, XRP has posted gains of 1.17% in the past 24 hours and 7.56% over the last seven days, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.8 billion. Despite sitting 38% below its all-time high of $3.92, the token’s recent momentum suggests it’s poised for a potential breakout. XRP 1-week price chart. Source: Finbold The SEC’s decision last week to abandon its legal battle with Ripple Labs has erased a major cloud of uncertainty that has loomed over XRP since 2020. The lawsuit, which alleged that Ripple’s sales of XRP constituted an unregistered securities offering, had long been a drag on the token’s price and adoption. With this regulatory overhang now lifted, traders and analysts are recalibrating their expectations—and the consensus is increasingly bullish. Ryan Lee, an analyst at Bitget, highlighted the significance of this shift. “The resolution of the SEC lawsuit marks a turning point for XRP,” Lee noted. “A breakout from the current $2.35–$2.55 range could lead to extensive moves in either direction, but the upside potential is substantial.” He pointed to $2.50 as a critical level to watch, suggesting that a sustained move above this threshold could set the stage for long-term targets as high as $10 by 2030. Ripple’s strategic moves amplify the bull case Beyond regulatory clarity, Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand its ecosystem are fueling speculation about XRP’s future. The company’s push to promote adoption of its RLUSD stablecoin—a dollar-pegged asset designed to complement XRP’s cross-border payment capabilities—could significantly boost demand for the token. While $10 by 2030 represents a more than 300% increase from today’s $2.44, XRP’s recent performance and favorable market conditions lend credence to the prediction. The token’s $142.12 billion market cap positions it just shy of Tether’s third-place ranking, and continued growth could see it leapfrog USDT in the near future. With daily trading volume up 6.36% to $2.8 billion and a year-long track record of outperforming the broader market, XRP appears to have the momentum to sustain its upward trajectory.

42318548,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=699343,1742902557,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42318548.jpeg,Asia’s economy will avoid a slowdown this year in spite of Trump’s tariffs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/asia-economy-will-avoid-a-slowdown-this-year/,"Asia will keep growing this year even though Donald Trump is pushing new tariffs on U.S. trading partners, according to a report released Tuesday by the Boao Forum for Asia during its annual meeting in China. The report said growth across the region is expected to reach 4.5% in 2025, which is slightly higher than 2024’s 4.4%. It also said South Asia will lead the region with a 5.9% increase, based on data from researchers at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a state-run think tank. The Boao Forum, which is sometimes called “China’s Davos,” warned that while Asia will face some pressure on trade and investment due to global issues, the region still has strong points that will keep it moving forward. The report said, “Asia’s trade and investment will come under strain, but stand to benefit from a number of bright spots.” The report also called Asia a major engine for the global economy despite growing uncertainty around the world. Trump’s trade tariffs trigger new pressure across the region Trump plans to launch reciprocal tariffs on April 2, a date he called “liberation day” during a White House event on Monday. April 1 is when the U.S. will finish reviewing China’s trade record. At a Cabinet meeting earlier the same day, Trump announced that new tariffs would hit industries including automobiles, pharmaceuticals, lumber, and semiconductors. Later that same day, he added that the U.S. would also charge 25% tariffs on countries that buy oil and gas from Venezuela . China and India are two of the economies most exposed to Trump’s planned tariffs. The Boao Forum’s report didn’t skip over the risk. It clearly stated that the pressure from the U.S. president’s trade moves will affect countries that are still heavily tied to exports, especially exports to the U.S. A separate January report by the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) said it expects Asia’s 2025 growth to slow to 4.2%, lowered from earlier projections because of the impact from the tariffs. Even with that, the Boao report said the unemployment rate in Asia will stay around 4.4%, which is better than the global average of just under 5%. But it also said inflation will get worse in 2025 due to a mix of higher wages, rising shipping costs, currency drops, and continued supply chain restructuring. At a press conference held to launch the report, Zhang Jun, secretary general of the Boao Forum, said, “Today’s world is undergoing profound changes. Challenges and uncertainties are piling up and concerns in the international community are growing in face of the various turmoils in the whole world.” Regional trade, e-commerce, and services support Asia’s growth According to the Boao Forum’s findings, goods trade in Asia is starting to bounce back, and services trade is growing fast, especially in tourism, transportation, and digital services. The report said China played a major role in this growth, with both its goods and services trade numbers hitting record highs in 2024. These trade flows helped push the region forward despite global disruptions. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has made regional trade even more connected, with intra-RCEP trade growing about 3% year-on-year in 2024. The trade deal helped several member economies boost their regional links, but not all members are using the full set of trade rules, according to the report. That low use rate is still holding back the deal’s potential. E-commerce is also playing a bigger role. The report said ASEAN’s e-commerce gross merchandise value grew by 15% year-on-year, which shows the speed of digital growth in Southeast Asia. Digital trade is now a major part of how business is done across Asia, and this shift is creating new growth outside of traditional sectors. At the same time, Asia’s financial markets remain stable. The report said most major economies in the region will keep accommodative monetary policies, which means they’ll likely keep interest rates low to keep economies running. Even though foreign investment from outside Asia has been inconsistent, intra-regional foreign direct investment is holding strong, as China, Japan, and ASEAN countries remain the main places where money is flowing inside the region. But the report didn’t sugarcoat the problems. It said Asia’s market integration is not complete, and many countries are still too dependent on exports to Europe and the United States. It also said that policy coordination and trade dispute solutions need more work, which makes it harder to streamline trade between countries in the region. The Boao Forum also warned that sustaining growth across Asia will require more regional cooperation, better integration, and more investment in services and digital industries. Without those things, it’ll be harder to keep up momentum. Markets react as Trump teases flexibility on tariff rollouts Trump’s behavior on tariffs remains inconsistent. He said at a Monday event that he might offer “a lot of countries breaks” from the tariffs. He didn’t explain exactly who would get these exceptions or how they’d be decided. When someone asked if all sector-specific tariffs would start on April 2, Trump answered, “Yeah, it’s going to be everything,” before walking it back by saying, “but not all tariffs are included that day.” Markets didn’t know how to take that. On Monday, U.S. stocks jumped after Trump hinted that the tariffs might not be as severe, as the S&P 500 surged by 1.76%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.42%, and the Nasdaq Composite went up by 2.27%. Tesla’s stock spiked by 11.9%, its best single-day gain since November 6, as Cryptopolitan reported . Across the Asia-Pacific, markets reacted in mixed ways. On Tuesday, Japan’s Nikkei 225 went up by about 0.5%, with the country’s 5-year bond yield hitting 1.165%, the highest since October 2008, based on data from LSEG. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell by more than 2%, showing that not all investors are buying into the idea that Trump’s flexibility means less damage.

On March 24, DAO contributor Nathan van der Heyden introduced a formal proposal to recover unused funds from the Arbitrum Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP), launched in early 2024. The program was designed to establish Arbitrum as a leading blockchain network for Web3 gaming by supporting game studios and developers building on-chain games. Arbitrum Gaming Program Built on Unrealistic Expectations Van der Heyden noted that the program was approved during a period of heightened optimism, which has since proven to be “unsustainable.” In his governance forum post, he called for the DAO to “wind down GCP activities and secure all possible funds” to restore confidence in the DAO’s capital allocation abilities. He also criticized the GCP’s lack of transparency, alleging reluctance to document activities and deliver on initial promises. The proposal has gained support from other DAO members. One supporter echoed the call to preserve remaining funds, emphasizing the importance of acting swiftly to prevent further inefficiencies. However, not all members back an immediate revocation. Some argue for a more measured approach, such as phased clawbacks and improved oversight rather than abruptly ending the initiative. “The desire to protect DAO funds and ensure transparency is valid, but immediately resorting to a complete clawback seems overly harsh and potentially counterproductive,” one member wrote. They suggested implementing flexible reporting standards to allow the GCP to course-correct without dissolving the program entirely. It’s time to cut our losses and secure the treasury. We call on all delegates to support this proposal to wind down GCP responsibly. We hope that this can send a clear signal to all other Arbitrum DAO programs that continued funding is based on results, not past votes. — nathanvdh (@NathanVDH0x) March 24, 2025 The GCP allocated 225 million ARB tokens—then worth approximately $468 million—toward Web3 gaming growth. However, following a $2.2 billion token unlock and market downturn, the value of those tokens dropped to around $215 million by mid-2024. As of now, ARB trades at just $0.38, down 81% from its launch price during the GCP announcement. Web3 Gaming Faces Industry Headwinds The debate unfolds amid broader headwinds in the Web3 gaming sector. ZKsync recently discontinued its liquidity rewards initiative, citing poor market conditions. ZKsync Ignite Program Update After careful consideration, the DeFi Steering Committee (DSC) has decided to not renew Ignite for Season 2 and will be sunsetting the program starting March 17th, 2025 by turning off rewards for period 6 Here's why: — ZKsync Ignite (@ZKsyncIgnite) March 13, 2025 As reported, blockchain gaming saw a dramatic rise in onchain activity in January, marking a threefold increase compared to the same period last year. The sector recorded over 7 million unique active wallets (UAW) daily, reflecting a 386% year-over-year surge. Several blockchain gaming networks saw significant expansion in January. OpBNB emerged as the top-performing gaming blockchain, with Matchain ranking second. Meanwhile, Polygon experienced a 100% increase in gaming activity compared to the previous month. Telegram has also emerged as a significant platform for Web3 gaming, capturing 21% of new game launches in 2024.

Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts, because they’re launching a significant 38 million USDT buyback program for their native MOVE tokens. This isn’t just any buyback; it’s a strategic maneuver designed to inject fresh USDT liquidity into the ecosystem and establish a robust Movement Strategic Reserve. Let’s dive into the details of this power move and understand what it means for the future of Movement Network and its community. Why a MOVE Token Buyback Now? Unpacking the Binance Investigation You might be wondering, “Why now? What’s the backstory behind this sudden surge of activity?” Well, it all started with a notification from Binance. The leading cryptocurrency exchange informed the Movement Network Foundation about an ongoing investigation. This investigation involves a market maker (MM) and several tokens, MOVE being one of them. While investigations can sound concerning, the Movement Network Foundation is turning this into an opportunity. Any funds recovered from this investigation are earmarked to fuel the newly established Movement Strategic Reserve. This proactive approach showcases the foundation’s commitment to transparency and the long-term health of the ecosystem. The Binance investigation , while initially unexpected, has become a catalyst for positive change within the Movement Network. The 38M USDT Cryptocurrency Buyback: A Deep Dive Let’s get into the nitty-gritty of this substantial cryptocurrency buyback . A whopping 38 million USDT is being allocated to purchase MOVE tokens. This isn’t a small sum; it’s a significant injection of capital that speaks volumes about the Movement Network Foundation’s confidence in its project. But what exactly are the goals of this massive buyback? Strategic Reserve Establishment: The primary goal is to create the Movement Strategic Reserve. Think of this as a war chest – a reserve of MOVE tokens held for long-term strategic initiatives. This reserve can be utilized for future ecosystem development, partnerships, and community rewards, ensuring the longevity and growth of the Movement Network. Boosting USDT Liquidity: The buyback program is designed to reintroduce USDT liquidity into the Movement ecosystem. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any healthy crypto market. By injecting 38 million USDT, the foundation aims to improve trading conditions, making it easier for users to buy and sell MOVE tokens. Strengthening Token Value: Buybacks often have a positive impact on token price. By reducing the circulating supply of MOVE tokens, while simultaneously increasing demand through the buyback, the foundation is aiming to bolster the value of MOVE for its holders. Demonstrating Commitment: This MOVE token buyback sends a powerful message to the Movement Network community. It demonstrates the foundation’s unwavering commitment to the project and its willingness to take decisive action to support its ecosystem. Benefits of the Movement Network’s Strategic Move This strategic Movement Network initiative isn’t just about reacting to the Binance notification; it’s about proactively shaping the future of the network. Let’s explore the key benefits this buyback program brings to the table: Enhanced Ecosystem Stability: The Strategic Reserve provides a safety net, enabling the foundation to navigate market fluctuations and unexpected events with greater resilience. Increased Investor Confidence: A significant buyback program like this often boosts investor confidence. It signals that the foundation is financially strong and dedicated to the long-term success of the project. Improved Market Dynamics: By injecting USDT liquidity and potentially increasing the token price, the buyback program can create a more vibrant and attractive market for MOVE tokens. Empowered Community: Ultimately, a stronger Movement Network benefits its community. From improved trading experiences to future ecosystem developments funded by the Strategic Reserve, users are set to gain significantly. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the 38M USDT buyback is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. The success of the buyback in terms of price impact could be influenced by broader market conditions. Execution Strategy: The way the buyback is executed will be crucial. The foundation will need to employ a strategic approach to ensure the buyback is efficient and achieves its intended goals without causing undue market disruption. Long-Term Reserve Management: Effective management of the Movement Strategic Reserve will be essential. Clear guidelines and transparent reporting on the use of reserve funds will be vital for maintaining community trust. Actionable Insights for MOVE Token Holders So, what does this mean for you if you’re a MOVE token holder or considering becoming one? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on official announcements from the Movement Network Foundation. They will likely provide updates on the progress of the buyback and the development of the Strategic Reserve. Monitor Market Activity: Observe how the market reacts to the buyback. Increased trading volume and price movements could present opportunities. Consider Long-Term Potential: This buyback signals a long-term commitment from the foundation. If you believe in the Movement Network’s vision, this could be a positive signal for long-term holding. Engage with the Community: Join the Movement Network community channels to discuss the buyback and its implications with other users. The Future is Moving: What’s Next for Movement Network? The 38M USDT MOVE token buyback is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a statement of intent. The Movement Network Foundation is demonstrating its resilience, its strategic thinking, and its unwavering dedication to its community and ecosystem. By establishing the Movement Strategic Reserve and injecting vital USDT liquidity, they are laying a solid foundation for future growth and stability. This bold move has the potential to significantly strengthen the Movement Network and position it for even greater success in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. This initiative showcases how even in the face of unexpected challenges, like a Binance investigation , crypto projects can adapt, innovate, and emerge stronger. The Movement Network’s response is a testament to their proactive approach and their commitment to building a robust and thriving ecosystem.

While many investors had anticipated a more significant rally, experts point to various factors suppressing momentum, including lackluster market sentiment, reduced liquidity, and the absence of major bullish catalysts. Market Sentiment and Liquidity Constraints Financial analyst Austin Hilton recently highlighted the broader market’s current state of disinterest, which has contributed to XRP’s sluggish price action . In a recent analysis, he explained that many investors have pulled back from the market, choosing to wait on the sidelines for a major development before re-entering. “There are millions of investors who have exited the market, sitting on cash and waiting for a big moment to spark the next rally,” Hilton observed. This reduced participation has resulted in weaker demand, making it difficult for XRP to sustain any significant upward movement. A realistic XRP price prediction! – Lets talk about the resistance levels for $XRP – Also, discussed are the support levels that you need to know about – What you need to know about your XRP holdings – so that you can navigate what is going on right now pic.twitter.com/h9kxG3a0Ex — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) March 23, 2025 Interestingly, institutional investors continue to quietly accumulate XRP, with daily trading volumes reaching as high as $4 billion at one point. However, despite this accumulation, the market has yet to react significantly. Hilton argues that without a powerful catalyst, such as regulatory clarity or an influx of new capital, XRP’s price is unlikely to experience explosive growth in the short term. Seasonal Slowdown Weighs on Crypto Activity Another key factor influencing XRP’s stagnant price is the seasonal nature of cryptocurrency trading. Hilton pointed out that market activity traditionally slows down during the summer months as traders and investors shift focus to personal activities. Historical data suggests that the period between May and July often sees reduced trading volume, and this year appears to be following that trend. However, Hilton believes that as the year progresses, particularly in the fourth quarter, the market could regain momentum. He remains optimistic about XRP’s long-term potential, even if short-term gains remain limited. Key Resistance and Support Levels Define Price Action Currently, XRP is facing strong resistance at $2.60 and $2.80, levels that must be overcome for a sustained breakout. However, without a surge in trading volume and substantial buy pressure, it will be challenging for XRP to surpass these barriers. On the downside, support exists at $2.24 and $2.30. If selling pressure pushes XRP below these levels, the asset could dip under $2, which could further dampen investor sentiment. Hilton emphasized that low market liquidity remains a significant obstacle, preventing XRP from establishing a stronger upward trajectory.

Market analyst Dom sees XRP’s current price behavior as distinct from previous market cycles. Historically, XRP has experienced rapid price spikes, followed by steep corrections. However, this time, price consolidation appears more prolonged, suggesting a shift in market dynamics. “The longer the price remains at a certain level, the more it indicates that market participants agree about its value,” Dom noted. Unlike past cycles, where XRP quickly surged and then collapsed, its current stability above $2 suggests a more sustainable price floor. Dom believes this consolidation phase could be setting the stage for a future breakout. With price acceptance at these levels and trading volume maintaining steady support, XRP could be preparing for a significant upward expansion once confidence returns to the market. At present, XRP is trading at $2.47, reflecting a 3.33% increase in the last 24 hours. While immediate price action remains muted, experts agree that a combination of regulatory developments, institutional adoption, and renewed investor confidence could propel XRP toward a stronger rally in the future.

42318552,https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-launches-bitcoin-etp-europe,1742903040,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,BlackRock launches Bitcoin ETP in Europe,https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-launches-bitcoin-etp-europe?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, launched a Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on multiple European stock exchanges. The iShares Bitcoin ETP began trading on March 25 on Xetra, Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris, according to BlackRock’s product page. The launch follows the success of its iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF), which dominates the US market with $50.7 billion of assets under management, accounting for about 2.73% of the total Bitcoin (BTC) supply. Stephen Wundke, director of strategy and revenue at crypto investment firm Algoz, told Cointelegraph that “the availability of the iShares Bitcoin ETP may not have the same reaction across Europe” as it saw in the US: “Quality investment products through regulated asset managers have been more available throughout Europe than in the US, and secondly, Bitcoin is also more easily purchased. However, the ability for traditional family offices across Europe to hold a small percentage of their asset base in ‘digital gold’ is no doubt a good thing. […] Just don’t expect $60 billion of purchases in the first quarter.” Product details and fee structure The new ETP trades under the IB1T ticker on Xetra and Euronext Paris, while on Euronext Amsterdam it uses BTCN. Bloomberg previously reported that the company was preparing to launch the new product, which followed the firm’s launch of a Bitcoin ETF on CBOE Canada . BlackRock iShares Bitcoin ETP specifics. Source: BlackRock According to Bloomberg, the product launched with a temporary fee waiver of 10 basis points, which decreases the expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of 2025. Europe’s top crypto ETP is the CoinShares Physical Bitcoin ETP, which currently charges 0.25%, making BlackRock’s offering considerably cheaper while the waiver is in place. “There is no doubt BlackRock’s aggressive fee structure was designed to keep competitors out of the market and question the commitment of any new entrants,” Wundke said. Wundke added that “this type of competition is good for investors and ultimately good for digital currencies,” highlighting that players in the market will have to compete to provide the best offering to investors. Related: ‘Successful’ ETH ETF less perfect without staking — BlackRock iShares expanding to Europe This is BlackRock’s first issuance of a crypto ETP outside of North America. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of Europe and Middle East iShares Product, told Bloomberg: “[This launch] reflects what really could be seen as a tipping point in the industry — the combination of established demand from retail investors with more professionals now really getting into the fold.” Related: Bitcoin ETFs log first net inflows in weeks, while Ether outflows continue Ajay Dhingra, head of research at decentralized exchange aggregator Unizen, told Cointelegraph that the move reflects BlackRock’s confidence in the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation framework: “From Trump to Biden and now Trump again, US digital asset policy has been largely inconsistent. In contrast, the EU has steadily embraced compliant blockchain adoption — offering the regulatory stability companies are looking for.” A recent BlackRock earnings report showed that the firm managed over $11.55 trillion on average during the fourth quarter of 2024. Other than the top Bitcoin ETF, the firm also launched its Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF — the top Ether (ETH) ETF, with $3.46 billion in assets under management.

Among the most exciting developments, meme coins have captured massive attention due to their explosive growth potential. While some projects fade into obscurity, others surge to unexpected heights, delivering remarkable returns to early adopters. Recently, two prominent cryptocurrencies—Toshi Coin and FLOKI Inu—have made significant moves in the market.

In a new post on the online writing platform Substack, Palihapitiya cites Federal Reserve data to show that the US dollar has soared to its highest level in four decades. According to the billionaire, a confluence of macroeconomic factors plus the rising adoption of dollar-pegged stablecoins have contributed to the US dollar’s strength against other fiat currencies. “The US dollar is at its highest valuation in 40 years, reflecting the dollar’s strength against other global currencies… This increase in the dollar’s strength stems from multiple factors: the Federal Reserve raising interest rates from near-zero to over 4% has attracted global investors seeking higher returns on dollar-denominated assets, while geopolitical uncertainties have enhanced the dollar’s safe-haven appeal. Dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC have driven extended American currency dominance, creating a form of ‘digital dollarization’ that increases global demand for dollars even in cryptocurrency markets.” Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis But Palihapitiya highlights that a surging dollar is a double-edged sword. While it increases Americans’ purchasing power when buying foreign products and assets, Palihapitiya notes that a strong dollar can weigh down on the performance of American companies. A strong dollar can also trigger a financial crisis elsewhere. “The consequences of the dollar’s strength ripple throughout the global economy. The Federal Reserve is currently facing an additional balancing act, as a stronger dollar helps fight domestic inflation by cheapening imports, but risks triggering financial instability abroad that could eventually harm US markets. US exporters lose competitive ground as their products become more expensive globally.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The latest price action shows that the bulls have broken through the descending trendline, and are now battling with the strong resistance at $6.39. Should this be overcome, the next target is a higher high at $7.31, which also coincides with the last decent resistance level before the all-time high. $BNB breaks out against $BTC Source: TradingView Against its Bitcoin pair (BNB/BTC), it can be seen that a breakout has also occurred from a descending trendline that goes all the way back to November 2022. Will $BNB continue to make ground against $BTC? Possibly, but in the longer term there is probably far more value in Bitcoin than there is in the cryptocurrency of one of the leading exchanges. That said, it will be interesting to see how far the $BNB price can gain on its $BTC pair should the crypto sector really take off into this potential final stage of the bull market. $SUI surge to $3 could be next Source: TradingView The $SUI bulls are staging their own breakout. The price is currently holding above the descending trendline. There is just the small matter of holding the line for the rest of this week. It can also be seen that the major ascending trendline is acting as resistance. Once this can also be overcome, a surge to $3 could occur in a relatively short period of time. $DOGE bounces from solid 0.786 Fibonacci support Source: TradingView $DOGE is the undisputed champion of the memecoins, and as such, it is among the first to break out of its downtrend. The 0.786 Fibonacci has acted as a very solid support, and it might be expected that the price rises from here. Fortune favours the brave While these first breakouts take place, the crypto market is still in the grip of fear. Many will be thinking that this is no more than a relief rally, and that $109,000 was the top. This could certainly still be the case. However, there are lots of signs that suggest that this bull market is not over. Will you be fading it, or will fortune favour the brave?

However, despite the surge, the token is stranded far from its ATH, with the holders awaiting another potential rally, especially as a highly bullish signal reappears. If the pattern continues, the BTC price can surge another 200%. How? Let’s discuss. Bitcoin Price Surge to $88k Amid Bitcoin ETP Launch The drastic shift in investors’ sentiments from bullish to bearish resulted in the Bitcoin price crash. However, BTC is soaring these days as the global financial market witnessed recovery amid the Fed’s keeping the interest rates unchained and other bullish factors. In the last week, the BTC price has surged 5%, hitting a weekly high at $88.6k, but it currently trades at $86.9k after a slight decline. Interestingly, this surge came as Blackrock rolled out Bitcoin ETP for European clients, influencing investors’ sentiments. A clear indication is its trading volume surging 53% to $32.75B. In addition, MicroStrategy’s BTC buying, Oklahoma state passing the Bitcoin Reserve bill, and other events catered to this surge. However, the reappearance of the bullish BTC signal hints at a further rally. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Hash Ribbons Bullish Signal Hint at 200% Rally In its 16 years of history, Bitcoin has seen remarkable rallies. One such rally is in the formation, as the historical pattern suggests a 200% uptrend. The famous Hash Ribbon indicator, which tracks the BTC’s mining activity, is flashing a buy signal, which often results in massive uptrends. The same signal showed up in 2023 when the BTC price surged by 200%. Again, in 2024, this resulted in 120% following the miners’ recovery after the miners’ capitulation period. If history repeats and the pattern continues, there could be another massive breakout as high as 200% or higher. Bottom Line: Is a 200% BTC Price Rally Imminent? The reappearance of a highly bullish and historically proven price pattern indicates the possibility of a 200% rally. Even if the trends change, multiple Bitcoin price predictions claim that the token can easily surpass the $200k mark by the end of the year, increasing its credibility. However, despite the possibility, investors must do further research to confirm the bullish breakout.

This is on the high side, especially as professional money managers reduce their market exposure in reaction to concerns over Donald Trump’s plans. This year, retail investors invested a total of $67bn in US stocks and exchange-traded funds, almost the same amount as the $71bn they invested during the last three months of 2024. The substantial flow shows that individual investors are still optimistic about Wall Street stocks, even though things have been very rough this year. This is all thanks to the president’s unpredictable tariff plans. Not to forget the rise of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which shook Silicon Valley. However, analysts have been advising people to buy as much as possible now instead of panicking. In fact, Steve Sosnick, chief market strategist at Interactive Brokers, said, “Dip-buying has been an essentially foolproof strategy for four of the past five years Doing something that works remarkably well for so long means you’re conditioned to stick with it.” A user on Reddit’s Wall Street Bets discussion board also came up with a slogan: “Respect the dip, be the dip, BUY THE DIP!” Based on the available market data, this sentiment happens to be working. Big investors sell as retail investors buy According to figures from Goldman Sachs, individual investors have only been net sellers of US stocks seven times this year, even though the S&P 500 has gone down 25 days. On the other hand, big investors, who Bank of America monitors, cut their US equity holdings in March in the biggest way ever. In addition, investors who like to take risks have kept buying shares in companies that were big winners in the last two years but lost a lot of money in 2025. Nvidia shares and Tesla shares are the most popular. A report from JPMorgan Chase shows that individual investors bought $3.2B worth of Tesla shares and $1.9B worth of Nvidia shares just last week. To explain this, a law professor at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, Dhruv Aggarwal said that retail investors tend to go for well-known names. Steve Sosnick said that demand for the twice-leveraged ETFs that track and amplify Tesla and Nvidia gains or losses has been just as strong. He also said that stores’ seemingly endless desire for these kinds of products makes some sense, given how profitable it has been to buy stocks when they are down lately. However, big investors are not moved by these sentiments. Apparently, some institutional investors and Wall Street researchers think that rising consumer demand is a reason to be cautious, even though it seems counterintuitive. Stock futures are going down This year, the S&P 500 on Wall Street has dropped 2%, and the technology sector of the index has dropped 8%. The drop is very different from 2023 and 2024 when the S&P 500 went up sharply thanks to a rise in Big Tech stocks. Similar things have been happening lately. The market has made up a lot of the ground it lost this year. As the market opened on Monday, the 30-stock Dow went up almost 600 points or 1.4%, the S&P 500 went up 1.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite went up 2.3%. This is because traders became more hopeful when news came out that the White House might limit the effects of tariffs. However, stock futures in the U.S. went down a little on Tuesday morning. The move came after the major averages went up on growing hopes that President Donald Trump would change his plans for broad tariffs. Those for the S&P 500 went down by 0.15%, and those for the Nasdaq 100 dropped 0.23%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 68 points or 0.16%, taken away from the futures. Things will only settle fully after clarity on Trump’s administration policies. For now, Wall Street is still worried about rising prices and slower economic growth while it waits for the Trump administration to respond with tariffs on April 2.

Stablecoins have come a long way since they first popped up. Now, they are moving steadily into the mainstream as both an everyday payment tool and a dependable store of value, filling in where traditional currencies fall short. According to market data, total stablecoins transaction volume topped $15.6 trillion in 2024, surpassing the amounts processed by Visa. Established financial institutions like PayPal, JPMorgan, and even Visa itself have noticed this shift and are eager to incorporate stablecoins into their services. With the total stablecoin market cap now over $230 billion, it’s tempting to think that they’re unstoppable. You might also like: US leadership in crypto: The focus is on stablecoins | Opinion Yet, there’s a major sticking point preventing stablecoins from reaching their next milestone: the lack of privacy. At present, each transaction—be it USD Coin ( USDC ), Tether ( USDT ), or a newer alternative—can be seen on a public ledger. Anyone can track how much was sent, when it was sent, and the addresses of everyone involved. This transparency is aligned with the spirit of open blockchain networks, but in practice, it presents significant risks for both everyday users and large organizations. I’ve spent years working on privacy solutions in the blockchain world, and I’ve watched stablecoins soar without resolving the privacy challenge that undermines them. Individuals who make on-chain transactions reveal a lot about themselves without even realizing it. Their purchase history, trading patterns, and even relationships with other wallets are all out in the open. Businesses and institutions face an even worse headache. Competitive data, like payroll information and supplier details, is exposed on a public network, which is unacceptable in traditional finance. You’re paying a contractor on-chain, then suddenly realize that your closest competitors can see exactly how much you’re spending. It’s a pretty uncomfortable scenario that keeps many enterprises from embracing stablecoins despite their advantages. The transparency dilemma Privacy isn’t a gimmick. In conventional banking, transactions happen behind closed doors, with checks and balances in place to meet legal requirements. You don’t see your neighbor’s mortgage balance or your competitor’s entire payroll by peeking into their bank statements. With most stablecoins, on the other hand, a simple blockchain explorer can reveal anyone’s transaction history. That level of openness is pretty unusual in the financial world, and it’s a big concern. Consider how transparency affects users’ sense of security and autonomy. If you’re sending funds to a friend, you might be comfortable sharing that you made a payment but not necessarily the entire history of your finances. By mapping out your on-chain activity, a third party can identify your spending habits, personal interests, and business relationships. This surveillance potential worries regulators, too, as it sets criminals and law-abiding citizens in the same fully visible system, using intrusive methods to separate them. The way financial rules are designed now doesn’t really account for public ledgers. Regulators obviously want to keep an eye on illicit activities, but they also get that everyday transactions shouldn’t be a public record. Right now, the regulatory push-and-pull around stablecoins has created uncertainty, with the UK delaying formal guidelines and the European Commission examining how to protect users while still encouraging progress. Meanwhile, in the U.S., officials see stablecoins as a way to strengthen the dollar’s global position. Yet, this huge potential is overshadowed by a major question: how do we ensure strong user protections without turning every payment into a public record? You might also like: The clock is ticking: Europe’s last chance to launch a euro stablecoin | Opinion Why businesses and regulators need confidential stablecoins For enterprises, stablecoins could be a game-changer. They’re fast, predictable, and easy to handle across borders. However, serious businesses also expect confidentiality—especially if they’re dealing with payroll, sensitive invoices, or supply chain transactions. When these details are made public, it puts organizations in a vulnerable position. Competitive leaks, reputational risks, and potential hacking threats become part of the equation. Institutional adoption depends on striking a balance. Regulators must have sufficient oversight to curb criminal activities, and corporations need privacy protections that parallel traditional finance. Without confidentiality, stablecoins will remain an experimental tool rather than a serious contender for the daily flow of corporate funds. Many are wary of adopting a payment method that effectively publishes their internal operations, even if the system works seamlessly otherwise. Privacy, therefore, isn’t just a personal preference—it’s a strategic need. When we talk about stablecoins becoming the next digital dollar, we mean a currency that holds its value against fiat and is readily accepted worldwide. That’s a tall order if privacy is missing from the core design. If stablecoins want to outshine legacy payment systems, they have to address the real-world concerns of the people who use them most—corporations, large institutions, and individuals who simply value discretion. ZK technology: The key to real-world adoption One promising way forward lies in zero-knowledge proof technology. ZKPs allow someone to prove the validity of a transaction or a statement without revealing the underlying information. It’s not magic, but it’s pretty close. The technology basically shows that a transaction is legitimate—and follows all compliance rules—while keeping the specific details out of public view. For example, if a large manufacturer wants to use stablecoins for cross-border payments, they can do so with a ZK-enabled platform. The blockchain confirms that the transaction is valid and within legal parameters. Regulators or auditors with the correct permissions can verify compliance. Yet, the manufacturer’s suppliers, payment amounts, and other private data remain hidden from ordinary observers. This is how you can have genuine privacy while still retaining a system that’s fully auditable where it matters. Archblock’s recent launch of 1USD on a privacy-centric blockchain shows that momentum is growing. These initiatives recognize that transaction confidentiality isn’t just a side feature, it’s a key part of the whole package for mainstream success. And we’ve been following a similar philosophy by building technology that secures on-chain transactions and gives users control over which details get disclosed. Think of it as the next logical step in stablecoin evolution. Encouragingly, regulators are starting to understand that privacy doesn’t automatically mean wrongdoing. If anything, real privacy can make compliance more efficient because investigators don’t have to sift through endless trivial data. They can rely on cryptographic proofs that confirm all requirements are met. This approach keeps honest users safe from prying eyes and ensures malicious actors have less room to exploit open financial records. Final thoughts Stablecoins have already demonstrated that they can process mind-boggling transaction volumes—enough to surpass Visa, one of the world’s largest payment networks. Major financial institutions are backing them for a good reason: they move funds across borders quickly, maintain a stable value, and can be integrated into a vast range of digital services. But there’s a reason many businesses remain hesitant, and it’s not about speed or cost any more. Transparency still looms large, threatening to undermine stablecoins as a truly mainstream form of money. To me, privacy is the linchpin for stablecoin success. We don’t have to accept a world where using a digital currency means giving up on confidentiality. Traditional finance, after all, has figured out how to keep transaction details hidden from the public view while still meeting regulatory standards, and there’s no reason stablecoins can’t do the same. Zero-knowledge proofs and similar cryptographic methods are already paving the way toward a private, compliant digital dollar. That’s the future we should be shooting for: a private digital currency that combines blockchain convenience with the trust and discretion we expect in financial dealings. The technology is within reach, and the next step is for the broader industry—developers, institutions, and regulators—to commit to making privacy the norm instead of afterthought. When that happens, stablecoins will truly be ready for prime time, and the idea of a stable, secure digital dollar will transform from a promise to our everyday reality.

Trading activity for the token has also surged after the protocol reportedly approved an upgrade. According to data from crypto.news, DGB ( DGB ) has gone up by 13.2% in the past 24 hours. On March 25, the token has reached a new weekly high of $0.009392 following news that the community has approve the implementation of Bitcoin ( BTC )’s Taproot activation in its operations. At press time, DGB is trading hands at $0.925. Its market cap has increased alongside its price surge, currently amounting to around $162 million. DGB is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and blockchain protocol that was launched in 2014. DGB tokens are usually used to facilitate payment for decentralized application and smart contract transactions on the blockchain . The tokens can be mined through a proof-of-work consensus using computational power to solve complex mathematical problems, validating transactions, and adding them to the blockchain. DGB’s mining mechanism and scalability has been compared to earlier cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Both DGB and BTC rely on a proof‑of‑work mechanism to secure their blockchains. While DigiByte also follows a PoW model, it employs five different mining algorithms, which are SHA‑256, Scrypt, Skein, Qubit, and Odocrypt. DGB’s multi‑algorithm approach helps to prevent the centralization of mining power and makes the network accessible to a wider range of hardware—from ASICs to GPUs and CPUs. At the moment, DGB’s circulating token supply is at 17.60 billion, which is around 83.8% of its total supply. Meanwhile, there is still approximately 3.40 billion DGB that can be mined or around 16.2% of its total supply. Why is DigiByte’s token trending? The DGB token has been on the rise since the blockchain has been considering an upgrade to its system called the Taproot Activation process through the BIP-9 soft fork. So far, 95% of its blocks have indicated support for DigiByte adopting the Taproot Activation model. According to the site, Digibyte has already begun the process of Taproot activation. However, it is not fully active yet. Initially deployed on Bitcoin in 2021, the Taproot upgrade is a collection of protocol updates that introduce new features that change the way blockchains process transactions. With the Taproot upgrade, transactions require less data and less work as multiple signatures can be combined for verification, rather than being aggregated individually. Additionally, it can also improve smart contract functionality on the blockchain. In Bitcoin’s case, this feature expanded on the types of transactions that could be processed through native smart contracts on the blockchain. Another key benefit brought in by Taproot is the reduction of fees on the blockchain. The upgrade is able to streamline how data is processed, therefore cutting down on resources which leads to lower costs for users. This is one of the reasons why the upgrade is highly anticipated by the DigiByte community.

XRP whale activity muted XRP whale activity has been quiet over the past week, with no significant buying or selling, according to data from Santiment. Wallets with 1 million to 10 million XRP have seen their total holdings remain flat at around 5.8 billion tokens since March 15. This lack of movement from large holders can reduce market volatility, as whales often drive price swings with their trades. Without their influence, XRP’s price has remained rangebound, reflecting a market driven by smaller investors’ sentiment and broader market trends. XRP wallets holding 1M to 10M tokens.

XRP will potentially target the liquidity cluster inside this range if support at $2.40 is lost.

While this explosion of new assets has raised concerns — ranging from liquidity fragmentation to the disruption of a true alt season — some industry veterans see a different narrative unfolding. Rather than signaling market decline, this flood of new tokens may be acting as a catalyst for a stronger, more selective liquidity cycle. Throughout 2024, the sheer volume of launches made it increasingly difficult for low-quality projects to maintain traction. As traders cycled through countless speculative plays, capital became increasingly scarce toward the end of the year, leaving little room for fresh runners to gain momentum. Now, in 2025, we’re seeing a shift. Traders and investors are leaving the endless pump.fun casino to allocate capital toward projects with real fundamentals, product-market fit, and long-term sustainability. One niche within Web3 stands to benefit from this shift more than most: perpetual trading. As one of the most profitable and sustainable models in DeFi, perp trading is uniquely positioned to thrive in a landscape where liquidity consolidates around high-quality projects. Among the projects capitalizing on this trend, DESK (formerly HMX) is one that every trader should be watching — for more reasons than its leading -1 BPS Maker and 1.75 BPS Taker fees. With a strategic focus on two of the most dominant narratives in crypto — Base and AI agents — DESK is aligning itself with key growth drivers. As their airdrop campaign continues, traders have a prime opportunity to engage with a platform built for longevity in an increasingly competitive market. Let’s dive into why investors should get involved and how to get started. DESK Airdrop: The Next Big Opportunity for Perp Traders Even in sideways markets, the top four perpetual DEXs generate over $25,000 in daily fees and more than $10,000 in holder revenue — excluding HYPE, which also operates as an L1. This steady cash flow has positioned perp DEXs as one of the most sustainable and profitable sectors in DeFi. Their ability to capture trading volume and redistribute fees makes them a cornerstone of long-term ecosystem growth. The HYPE airdrop proved just how lucrative early participation in perp trading ecosystems can be. By allocating 31% of its token supply to its genesis event, HYPE turned early adopters into millionaires, with some traders securing seven- to eight-figure rewards. This approach set a new industry benchmark for airdrop structuring, proving that meaningful early-stage incentives drive adoption and long-term success. Now, DESK is taking it a step further. With 38.7% of its total supply committed to early adopters, DESK is raising the bar for community distribution. Paired with the lowest trading fees in the industry during its launch campaign, DESK is positioning itself as the next major player in the perp DEX space. Campaign Details The DESK airdrop operates on a points-based system designed to reward traders for their activity on the platform. Points program start date February 18, 2025 Points distribution 1,000,000 DESK Points distributed weekly, every Friday Weekly Activity Cutoff Tuesdays at 10:00 UTC How to Earn DESK Points Traders accumulate DESK Points based on: Order type Market conditions Trading volume Open interest Ways to Increase DESK Points 7-Day Volume-Based Multipliers Earn up to 2x points based on weekly trading volume. Multipliers update weekly. Community Collaboration Boosts Traders from HMX , Jumper , Pendle , Aerodrome , aixbt , and blocmates receive up to a 1.3x boost on their DESK Points. Trade on DESK here : https://desk.exchange Track your DESK Points & progress here: https://desk.exchange/point Referral Program DESK makes it easy for traders to maximize their rewards — even without placing a single trade. Invite friends to DESK and earn 10% of their DESK Points every week. Registers your account for future DESK referral fees, creating a long-term passive income opportunity. The basics of DESK What is DESK? DESK is a next-generation perpetual trading infrastructure designed to empower both human traders and AI agents with cutting-edge tools and seamless automation. Traders get an unmatched edge with DESK’s ultra-low fees — the cheapest on earth — featuring a Maker fee of -1 BPS and a Taker fee of 1.75 BPS. And as a top 3 perp DEX on Arbitrum by trading volume and a consistent top 5 performer across all chains in revenue generation, DESK has cemented itself as a major player in on-chain derivatives trading. Yet, despite strong fundamentals, its market cap remains undervalued at just $4.66 million. With its recent expansion to Base, DESK is on a mission to power the evolution of trading by delivering high-performance, data-driven infrastructure for professional traders and AI-driven strategies. The New Wave of Trading Infrastructure DESK merges the proven product-market fit of perpetual DEXs with the intelligence of AI, creating a high-performance, on-chain trading ecosystem optimized for automation and strategy execution. By integrating with Eliza OS and soon expanding to Base’s Agent Kits and other AI frameworks, DESK brings its users to the forefront of AI-powered trading innovations. Upcoming Co-Pilot features will further enhance automated trading strategies. As demand for AI-driven trading continues to surge, DESK provides the necessary infrastructure for both individual traders and algorithmic agents to optimize strategies, execute high-frequency trades, and automate risk management — all while maintaining self-custody. By bridging these two rapidly growing sectors, DESK is positioning itself as a fundamental pillar of future on-chain value creation. Core Features and Product Innovations DESK’s infrastructure rivals centralized exchanges (CEXs) while maintaining DeFi’s transparency and security. Orderbook Infrastructure Delivers CEX-grade trading with: Near-instant confirmations Deep liquidity Ultra-low fees 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) — ideal for high-frequency trading Unified Cross Margin Maximizes capital efficiency, allowing traders to speculate on alts without selling majors or yield-bearing positions. Flexible Settlement System Provides more control over trade execution: Deferred Loss Settlement – Reduces unnecessary liquidations in bullish markets. Withdrawal of Unrealized PnL – Lets traders withdraw unrealized profits (uPnL) without closing positions. Sophisticated Liquidation Flow – Prevents major market disruptions. Yield Generation for Lenders Users can deposit settlement tokens to earn passive income, with funds covering borrowing fees for traders. Data Aggregator Infrastructure Aggregates real-time pricing from top oracles while providing: Social sentiment signals Whale activity tracking Trend indicators for predictive analysis DESK SDK A seamless software development kit for rapid HFT integration and unmatched product expansion. Security and Reliability Since launching as HMX, DESK has maintained a flawless security record, with zero major incidents leading to fund losses. Over time, DESK has facilitated over $60 billion in total trading volume and generated $21.5 million in trading fees, proving its resilience and ability to capture sustained demand. With its rebrand to DESK, the team is doubling down on security and reliability, working with Cantina — a top-tier auditor trusted by Coinbase, Uniswap, and Optimism. DESK also maintains 24/7 security monitoring to protect platform integrity and ensure long-term reliability. As perpetual trading infrastructure evolves, DESK is emerging as a key force in the space, combining security, high-performance execution, and AI-driven automation to define the next era of on-chain trading. On-chain trading’s future starts with DESK DESK isn’t just another trading platform — it’s redefining what’s possible in on-chain trading. By merging the speed and efficiency of CEX-grade infrastructure with the flexibility of DeFi, DESK has positioned itself as a leader in intelligent, automated, and capital-efficient trading. Its high-speed, low-latency execution rivals centralized platforms while maintaining full transparency and self-custody. Seamless AI integration allows traders and AI agents to optimize strategies with precision, while innovative perpetual trading mechanics enhance capital efficiency. As AI-driven strategies become more dominant in on-chain finance, DESK is building the infrastructure to support this next wave of trading evolution. By aligning with key industry narratives like Base and AI agents, it is tapping into two of the most explosive growth areas in crypto today. With 38.7% of the total token supply allocated to early adopters, DESK is offering one of the most generous distributions in the space. Start trading and earning .

42319113,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=143091,1742904004,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Critical 70% Bitcoin-Nasdaq Correlation: Is a Divergence Imminent?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-nasdaq-correlation-divergence-alert/,"Are you noticing a familiar dance between Bitcoin and the stock market lately? If you’re invested in crypto, especially Bitcoin, or keep an eye on traditional markets like the Nasdaq, you should be paying close attention to a fascinating trend. The correlation between Bitcoin and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is flashing a signal – and it’s one that could have significant implications for your portfolio. Let’s dive into why this Bitcoin correlation is reaching critical levels and what it might mean for the future of crypto. Why is the Bitcoin Correlation with Nasdaq So High? Recently, cryptocurrency service provider Matrixport highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) that the 30-day correlation between Bitcoin, specifically tracked via the IBIT ETF, and the Nasdaq Composite index is approaching a striking 70%. This is not just a minor statistical blip; it’s a significant indicator suggesting that Bitcoin is increasingly moving in lockstep with broader macroeconomic forces. But what’s driving this heightened Bitcoin correlation ? Several factors are contributing to this phenomenon: Shifting Earnings Expectations: The overall market sentiment is heavily influenced by corporate earnings. When earnings expectations fluctuate, they impact both tech stocks (prominent in the Nasdaq) and risk assets like Bitcoin. Positive earnings reports can boost both, while negative outlooks can drag them down. Market Uncertainty: Global economic uncertainties, such as inflation concerns, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical events, tend to push investors towards similar risk-on or risk-off behaviors across different asset classes. In times of uncertainty, both tech stocks and Bitcoin can be perceived as riskier assets compared to traditional safe havens like government bonds, leading to correlated movements. Tariff Concerns: International trade policies and tariff discussions introduce volatility and uncertainty into the market. These concerns can impact corporate profits, especially for tech companies with global supply chains, and simultaneously affect investor appetite for speculative assets like Bitcoin. What Does a 70% Correlation Actually Mean? A correlation coefficient of 70% (or 0.7) is statistically considered a strong positive correlation. In simpler terms, when the Nasdaq goes up, Bitcoin is highly likely to go up as well, and vice versa. This tight relationship signifies that, for now, Bitcoin is behaving less like an uncorrelated, alternative asset and more like a tech stock or a risk-on investment within the traditional financial system. To put this into perspective, consider these points: Traditional Portfolio Diversification: One of the key arguments for investing in Bitcoin has been its potential to diversify portfolios due to its low correlation with traditional assets. However, a high Bitcoin correlation with the Nasdaq diminishes this diversification benefit, at least temporarily. Risk Management Implications: If Bitcoin is moving in tandem with the Nasdaq, then the risk profile of holding Bitcoin shifts. Investors need to be aware that broad market downturns affecting tech stocks could also significantly impact their Bitcoin holdings. Macroeconomic Sensitivity: This high correlation underscores Bitcoin’s increasing sensitivity to macroeconomic factors. It’s no longer operating in a vacuum but is deeply intertwined with global economic trends and market sentiments. Is a Divergence on the Horizon? Historical Insights into Bitcoin and Nasdaq Movements While the current Bitcoin correlation with the Nasdaq is noteworthy, historical data provides a crucial perspective. Matrixport also points out that historically, such strong correlations between Bitcoin and traditional markets have been relatively short-lived. This raises an important question: Could we be on the cusp of a divergence ? Looking back at previous instances of high correlation, we can observe a pattern: Period of High Correlation Duration Subsequent Market Behavior Early 2022 ~3-4 months Sharp market correction followed by some divergence as Bitcoin reacted differently to specific crypto-related news. Late 2020 – Early 2021 ~6 months Bull market in both tech and crypto, but eventually, Bitcoin’s bull run outpaced the Nasdaq’s gains, leading to divergence in growth rates. Mid-2019 ~2 months Moderate correlation, followed by a period where Bitcoin’s price action became more influenced by internal crypto market dynamics. This historical context suggests that while the current high correlation is significant, it might not be a permanent state. Several factors could trigger a divergence in the near term: Unique Crypto Market Developments: Regulatory changes, technological advancements (like the Ethereum upgrades or new layer-2 solutions), and institutional adoption specific to the crypto space can drive Bitcoin’s price independently of the Nasdaq. Decoupling Macro Narratives: While broad macroeconomic trends influence both markets, specific narratives might emerge that favor one over the other. For instance, if inflation persists, Bitcoin might be seen as a hedge, while tech stocks could face pressure from rising interest rates. Market Overreaction: Sometimes, correlations can be amplified by market sentiment and overreactions. As investors become more attuned to the correlation, any shift in either market could lead to a rapid reassessment and potential divergence . Actionable Insights: Navigating the Bitcoin-Nasdaq Correlation So, what should investors do in light of this high Bitcoin correlation and the possibility of a future divergence ? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Macroeconomic Indicators: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic data releases, earnings reports, and geopolitical developments. These factors are currently significant drivers for both Bitcoin and the Nasdaq. Stay Informed on Crypto-Specific News: Don’t solely rely on traditional market analysis. Track regulatory updates, technological advancements, and adoption trends within the crypto industry. These could be catalysts for divergence . Reassess Portfolio Diversification: Understand that during periods of high correlation, the diversification benefits of Bitcoin might be reduced. Consider adjusting your portfolio strategy accordingly, perhaps by exploring other less correlated assets or adjusting your risk exposure. Prepare for Volatility: High correlation can amplify volatility. Be prepared for potentially larger price swings in Bitcoin, mirroring movements in the Nasdaq. Risk management strategies, such as stop-loss orders or position sizing, become even more crucial. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Bitcoin and the Nasdaq The nearing 70% Bitcoin correlation with the Nasdaq is a critical development that demands attention. It highlights the increasing integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial markets and its sensitivity to macroeconomic factors. While history suggests that such high correlations might be temporary and a divergence could be on the horizon, investors need to remain vigilant and informed. By understanding the drivers behind this correlation and staying attuned to both macroeconomic and crypto-specific developments, you can navigate this evolving landscape and make informed decisions about your cryptocurrency investments.

XLM Turns Bearish, & ETH Price Declines",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/blockdags-achievement-page-turns-user-engagement-into-rewards-xlm-turns-bearish-eth-price-declines/,"Uncertainty still dominates the crypto market as traders hesitate on whether to enter, exit, or await. Stellar (XLM) bearish signals continue as the coin faces tough resistance at $0.2724. Simultaneously, the Ethereum (ETH) market analysis paints a gloomy picture, with ETH dropping below the $2,000 level due to weakening buyer support. As doubt grows around these top crypto coins, the search is on for more promising choices before any major shift occurs. BlockDAG (BDAG) changes the usual approach. Its Rewards Page gives users the chance to earn BDAG by completing easy in-app tasks. This system lets people collect XP (experience points), receive rewards, and grow their BDAG stash just by staying active. Stellar (XLM) Bearish Signals: Can It Bounce Back? Price movement for Stellar shows continued difficulty as it trades near $0.2724, unable to push through important resistance points. Sellers remain in control, and the price is stuck within a declining pattern, making upward movement difficult. Several Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) above the current level act as supply zones, restricting any rebound. Traders are watching closely for a short entry between $0.266 and $0.270. If XLM gets rejected again, it could slip toward $0.255 or even $0.250. With no clear breakout in sight, the Stellar (XLM) bearish pattern could deepen further. Overall sentiment remains low, and with buyers holding back, it’s unlikely XLM will see a strong recovery soon. Ethereum (ETH) Market Analysis: Key Levels Under Pressure ETH’s dip below the $2,000 mark signals decreasing interest from buyers, raising questions about its future strength. On-chain stats highlight that those who bought between $3,200 and $3,500 are now reluctant to commit more, adding more pressure on the Ethereum (ETH) market analysis. Around 1.94 million ETH sits at a loss, and if major holders sell, prices could fall further. The $1,850 level remains crucial, as a breakdown here could lead ETH to $1,600 or even $1,250. Many have started exiting positions, and demand at lower levels looks weak. For now, ETH’s ability to climb is limited, with resistance at $2,630 and $2,800 presenting tough barriers. BlockDAG’s Achievement Page: A Smarter Way to Grow Your Crypto Growing your crypto balance without spending more might sound too good, but that’s what BlockDAG’s Rewards Page is doing. Instead of just waiting on market shifts, users take control by finishing simple in-app tasks. Whether it’s buying BDAG, taking part in bonuses, or joining weekly activities, each step earns XP and unlocks benefits like perks, higher rewards, and spots on the leaderboard. BlockDAG’s presale shows strong results. Currently, in Batch 27, BDAG has jumped 2,380%, from $0.001 to $0.0248. With over 18.9 billion coins sold and $206 million raised, BlockDAG continues building strong momentum. As each batch increases the price, the Rewards Page gives another reason to act before the next price boost. Fresh tasks appear every week, allowing users to build BDAG holdings without waiting for price moves. The most engaged users not only gain XP but also place themselves among top holders.

Cronos ( CRO ), rose 38% to an intraday high of $0.114 on March 25 afternoon Asian time as it broke out of its consolidation range of $0.07-$0.095 in which it had been stuck in for the past 4 weeks. Its market cap was seated at $2.26 billion, while its daily trading volume skyrocketed over 1,300% to nearly $300 million amid a large influx of trading activity. Today’s gains followed reports that Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, has entered into a non-binding partnership with Crypto.com to launch a new line of exchange-traded products under the Truth.Fi brand. These upcoming ETFs and ETPs are expected to include cryptocurrencies like CRO and Bitcoin alongside traditional securities that highlight a “Made in America” theme, touching industries such as energy, manufacturing, and more. Investors are hyped as the initiative appears to be in line Crypto.com’s broader strategy, which includes plans to file for a dedicated CRO ETF later this year , likely in the fourth quarter.

The upgrade will introduce Smart Account SSO, allowing users to log in with Google, Apple ID, or email, eliminating the need for seed phrases or private keys. It also lays the groundwork for the ZK Gateway, which is expected to improve cross-chain interoperability for ZK-rollup chains. Derivatives traders are piling into CRO, with open interest in its futures market nearly doubling to over $44 million in a single day, according to CoinGlass. Social sentiment has also turned positive, with CRO trending on X. Market commentators are bullish on the token’s long-term prospects. One community member predicted a potential surge to $3, a gain of over 2,600% from current levels. Another anonymous analyst, CW8900, noted that a breakout above the $0.235 mark could trigger a full-fledged bull run for CRO. $CRO is breaking through the first sell wall. If it breaks through that sell wall, the next one is at $0.19. And if it breaks through the sell wall at $0.235, there is no more resistance. The real bull market starts from that point. pic.twitter.com/yYNK0dpgs3 — CW (@CW8900) March 25, 2025 CRO technical analysis Technical indicators also point to more gains for CRO ahead. On the 1-day/USDT chart, CRO has moved above the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages, a building sign of a sustained bullish reversal.

A break above this zone could give bulls the confidence to push further, potentially setting their sights on CRO’s December high of $0.214 as the next major upside target. However, community backlash over Crypto.com’s reissuance of 70 billion previously burned CRO tokens has raised questions around transparency. If the situation escalates further, it could stall or even reverse the current bullish momentum. Read more: Particle Network to be listed on Binance and OKX today, what is PARTI?

42319574,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=699364,1742904347,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42319574.jpeg,President Trump finds a way to create yet another trade weapon,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-creates-yet-another-trade-weapon/,"President Donald Trump is now testing something new—“secondary tariffs”—targeting not just Venezuela but any country that dares to buy its oil. If you’re trading with Caracas, Trump wants to slap you with a 25% tariff on your exports to the U.S. This move, which he announced on Truth Social and then made official with an executive order, isn’t just another policy experiment. It’s a direct hit on Venezuela’s oil trade and any nation keeping it alive. The stated reason? Trump claims Venezuela has sent “tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals” into the U.S. He’s using economic pressure to force action. The U.S. already has sanctions on Venezuela. This new idea takes things even further—punishing other countries for working with them. Trump pushes new type of tariff “This is a new concept in economic warfare,” said Francisco Monaldi, who runs the Latin American energy policy program at Rice University. “How is it enforceable? It’s unclear of course.” But Trump’s not waiting for clarity. He’s combining traditional tariffs with what’s known as secondary sanctions—punishments for anyone who does business with a country the U.S. already has under restrictions. In this case, the warning is for buyers of Venezuelan oil. This isn’t just aimed at one or two countries. Venezuela’s oil still reaches Spain, India, and the U.S. through companies like Chevron, Repsol, and Reliance—all operating under special licenses. Then there’s China, which handles a good chunk of black-market oil from Venezuela. And that’s who Trump is really looking at. “China is the main actor this is directed at because it’s essentially the black market for Venezuelan oil,” Monaldi added. “They would not have to do secondary tariffs if it wasn’t for China.” Order targets China, includes Hong Kong and Macau The executive order hands power to Secretary of State Marco Rubio starting April 2. He can decide if a country should be hit with the 25% penalty for importing Venezuelan oil. Whether that’s directly or indirectly doesn’t matter. The order doesn’t list specific targets, but it makes one thing clear—China’s not getting away. The tariff, if triggered, would apply not just to mainland China but also to Hong Kong and Macau, and these are the only locations named aside from Venezuela. Trump is not hiding the bigger play here, as he has completely moved on from financial sanctions, because in his words “financial sanctions could kill the dollar and everything the dollar represents.” Now tariffs, on the other hand, bring in revenue and act as pressure points in negotiations. Trump likes them because they can go up or down. More flexible. More cash. Less risk to the currency. “Sometimes he views tariffs as a form of sanction,” said Josh Lipsky from the Atlantic Council. “He believes, and he’s been clear about this since the campaign, that financial sanctions lead to de-dollarization.” That mindset is driving Trump to invent new tools. Lipsky added that while Joe Biden expanded the use of old economic levers, Trump is building new ones. Tariffs serve three goals under Trump As you can see below, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent broke it down in simple terms. Trump’s tariffs fall into three buckets. First, as leverage in trade talks. Second, to raise revenue and help cover the cost of extending the 2017 tax cuts. Third, to rebalance trade in America’s favor. Trump doesn’t pick one at a time. Sometimes he’s doing all three. That’s how it played out with Colombia. Early in his second term, Trump threatened them with tariffs, sanctions, visa bans, and more. The reason? Colombia refused to accept deported migrants. The country folded fast, worried about getting caught in a costly trade war. A former Biden official confirmed that this is just how Trump works. “In Trump’s mind, the advantage of tariffs is that even if your target doesn’t cave and you have to impose them, at least you get some cash,” said Peter Harrell, who worked on international economics at the National Security Council. The strategy might be clear, but reactions haven’t been calm. China, Canada, and Mexico respond China didn’t wait. They answered with tariffs up to 15% on American farm goods and even banned exports to some U.S. defense contractors. Foreign Minister Wang Yi called the American moves “evil” and “two-faced.” Canada wasn’t quiet either. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the move “a very dumb thing to do.” After Trump rolled out his blanket tariffs, Canada slapped back with 25% tariffs on C$30 billion worth of U.S. goods. That includes orange juice, peanut butter, wine, and coffee. These are still in place. Canada’s waiting to launch a second round, which would hit cars, steel, and aluminum—but they’ve put that on pause for now. Mexico played it differently. President Claudia Sheinbaum skipped the tit-for-tat. She went to the table instead. It worked—for now. Trump said on Truth Social that he’s delaying tariffs on Mexican imports until after April 2 “as an accommodation, and out of respect for President Sheinbaum.” Trump eyes higher tariffs if countries resist Trump isn’t stopping at 25%. If countries keep buying oil from Venezuela, he could push that up to 30% or more. If they start cooperating? He might bring it down. Either way, it’s a tool that lets him adjust pressure in real time. The bottomline is Trump is using the U.S. economy as a weapon, again. He’s targeting foreign governments, corporations, and even grey market operators. And it’s all wrapped in a label he just coined—secondary tariffs. Whether or not it holds up in court, whether or not it’s even enforceable, doesn’t seem to matter to him. It’s live. It’s loud. And like everything else Trump does, it makes very little sense.

On March 19, Pump.fun launched its own Solana DEX to create a “frictionless environment” for memecoin trading. Memecoins launched on Pump.fun previously needed to migrate into the Solana DEX Raydium after bootstrapping liquidity, making the trading platform the most popular DEX in Solana. The Pump.fun team said these migrations slowed token momentum and introduced “needless complexity” for new users. With the new DEX, the project said migrations happen instantly and for free. A week after launch, PumpSwap reached a cumulative volume of more than $1 billion. A Dune Analytics dashboard by onchain analyst Adam_Tehc showed that PumpSwap had an all-time trading volume of $1.1 billion in its first seven days. PumpSwap DEX lifetime trading volume reaches. Source: Dune Analytics PumpSwap exceeds $1.1 billion in trading volume During its first day, the platform had a modest trading volume of about $50 million. On March 24, the volume spiked eight times, recording over $425 million in trading volume. Daily swaps on the platform peaked on March 24, recording 4.2 million transactions. The DEX’s cumulative number of swaps surpassed 11 million, while the number of active users has reached over 388,000, according to the data. The data also showed that the fees on the PumpSwap protocol exceeded $2.1 million, while liquidity provider fees exceeded $540,000. According to the Dune Dashboard’s creator, PumpSwap’s $1 million daily fees generated on March 24 are already “on par” with Pump.fun.

Just as crypto markets react to news and sentiment, so too does the mighty dollar. Recently, the US Dollar has experienced a significant boost, and it’s essential to understand why, especially for those navigating the crypto landscape. This surge isn’t happening in a vacuum; it’s interwoven with strong economic data releases, ongoing tariff discussions, and delicate peace negotiations around the globe. Let’s dive into the factors propelling the dollar and what it means for you. Why is the US Dollar Rallying? Decoding the Economic Data The primary driver behind the US Dollar’s recent strength is undeniably the release of surprisingly positive economic data . Think of economic data as the vital signs of a country’s financial health. Strong readings indicate a robust economy, which, in turn, makes its currency more attractive to investors. Here’s a breakdown of the key data points fueling the dollar’s rise: Job Market Strength: Recent employment figures have consistently exceeded expectations. Lower unemployment rates and robust job creation signal a healthy economy, boosting confidence in the US Dollar. Inflation Indicators: While inflation is a global concern, in the US, some indicators suggest a controlled inflationary environment, or at least within expected ranges. This reassures investors that the Federal Reserve (the Fed) can manage monetary policy effectively without drastic measures that could destabilize the dollar. GDP Growth: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures, representing the total value of goods and services produced, have shown resilience and growth. Strong GDP growth paints a picture of a thriving economy, making the dollar a desirable asset. Consumer Spending: Healthy consumer spending is the backbone of the US economy. Data indicating robust retail sales and consumer confidence further strengthens the positive economic outlook and supports the dollar. These positive economic signals collectively paint a picture of a resilient US economy, making the dollar a haven for investors seeking stability and potential returns. But how do these seemingly abstract figures translate into real-world dollar strength? When economic data is strong, it often leads to expectations of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. Tighter policy, typically involving interest rate hikes, makes holding dollar-denominated assets more attractive because investors can earn higher returns. This increased demand for dollars naturally pushes its value upwards against other currencies. For crypto investors, this is important because the strength of the US Dollar can often inversely correlate with the price of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which is sometimes seen as an alternative to fiat currencies. The Tariff Tango: How Trade Disputes Influence the Dollar Beyond domestic economic data, global trade dynamics, particularly tariffs , play a significant role in shaping the Forex market and influencing the US Dollar’s trajectory. Tariffs , essentially taxes on imported goods, are a tool used in international trade that can have complex and often unpredictable effects on currencies. Let’s consider how tariffs can impact the dollar: Safe-Haven Status: In times of global trade uncertainty or escalating tariff disputes, the US Dollar often acts as a safe-haven currency. Investors flock to the dollar for its perceived stability during economic storms. This increased demand strengthens the dollar’s value. Impact on US Economy (Mixed Bag): The impact of tariffs on the US economy itself is complex. While tariffs might protect certain domestic industries, they can also increase costs for consumers and businesses, potentially dampening economic growth in the long run. The perceived net effect, however, can influence dollar strength. If investors believe tariffs will ultimately benefit the US economy or are simply a temporary negotiating tactic, the dollar might strengthen. Retaliatory Tariffs and Global Growth: Tariffs are rarely a one-way street. When one country imposes tariffs, others often retaliate. This can lead to trade wars, impacting global economic growth. Slower global growth can, paradoxically, sometimes strengthen the dollar as investors seek the relative safety of US assets amidst global uncertainty. Currently, global trade tensions remain a persistent factor. Any news suggesting an escalation in tariffs or trade disputes could further bolster the US Dollar’s safe-haven appeal. Conversely, signs of easing trade tensions or breakthroughs in trade negotiations might temper dollar strength, or at least shift the focus back to purely domestic economic factors. Peace Talks and Geopolitical Risk: The Dollar’s Reaction Geopolitics, and specifically peace talks (or the lack thereof), are another crucial element influencing the Forex market and the US Dollar. The dollar’s role as a global reserve currency means it is often sensitive to geopolitical events and risk sentiment. How do peace talks and geopolitical risks affect the dollar? Risk-Off Sentiment: Heightened geopolitical risks, such as armed conflicts, political instability, or failed peace talks , generally trigger a “risk-off” sentiment in global markets. Investors tend to reduce exposure to riskier assets and seek safety in perceived safe havens like the US Dollar, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen. This flight to safety increases demand for the dollar, pushing its value higher. Impact of Successful Peace Talks: Conversely, positive developments in peace talks or de-escalation of geopolitical tensions can reduce risk aversion. This might lead to a slight weakening of the dollar as investors become more willing to invest in riskier assets and emerging markets, moving capital away from safe havens. However, the impact is often less pronounced than the “risk-off” reaction. Dollar as a Geopolitical Barometer: The US Dollar’s reaction to geopolitical events can be a useful barometer of global risk sentiment. A strengthening dollar in response to geopolitical news often signals increased risk aversion across markets, which can also have implications for cryptocurrency markets. The current geopolitical landscape is complex and fraught with uncertainty. Ongoing conflicts and delicate peace talks in various regions mean that geopolitical risk will likely remain a significant factor influencing the US Dollar in the near term. Any unexpected breakthroughs or setbacks in these situations can trigger swift reactions in the Forex market and impact the dollar’s value. Navigating the Forex Market: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what does all this mean for someone interested in cryptocurrencies? Understanding the dynamics of the Forex market and the factors driving the US Dollar can provide valuable context and insights for navigating the crypto space. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Economic Data Releases: Keep an eye on key US economic data releases, such as employment reports, inflation figures, and GDP growth. Strong data generally supports dollar strength and might create headwinds for crypto prices in the short term. Track Tariff and Trade News: Stay informed about developments in international trade and tariff discussions. Escalating trade tensions could boost the dollar’s safe-haven appeal. Assess Geopolitical Risk: Be aware of major geopolitical events and peace talks . Increased geopolitical risk can strengthen the dollar and potentially influence risk sentiment across all markets, including crypto. Dollar Strength as a Market Indicator: Use the US Dollar Index (DXY) as a broad indicator of dollar strength. A rising DXY can sometimes signal a more risk-averse environment, which might impact crypto market sentiment. Consider Forex-Crypto Correlations: While not always consistent, there can be inverse correlations between dollar strength and certain cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Understanding these potential correlations can inform trading strategies. Example: Let’s say the US releases unexpectedly strong jobs data. This could lead to expectations of interest rate hikes, strengthening the US Dollar. Simultaneously, you might observe a temporary dip in Bitcoin prices as some investors shift towards the strengthening dollar or become more risk-averse. However, it’s crucial to remember that the relationship between the US Dollar and cryptocurrencies is not always straightforward. Crypto markets are influenced by a multitude of factors, including technological developments, regulatory news, adoption rates, and market sentiment specific to the crypto space. The dollar is just one piece of the puzzle, albeit an important one. Conclusion: The Dollar’s Dominance in a Complex World The US Dollar’s recent surge, fueled by robust economic data and influenced by the ongoing complexities of tariffs and delicate peace talks , underscores its continued dominance in the global financial system. For those involved in the cryptocurrency world, understanding these traditional market dynamics is not just academic – it’s practically valuable. By monitoring economic data , trade developments, and geopolitical risks, and by recognizing the potential impact of dollar strength, crypto enthusiasts can gain a more nuanced and informed perspective on market movements and navigate the ever-evolving landscape of digital and traditional finance with greater confidence.

33767162,[object Object],1742904688,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"MicroStrategy’s $10B Win Signals It’s Bitcoin Bull Season, and BTC Bull Token Leads the Stampede",https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-win-signals-its-btc-bull-token-season/,"Michael Saylor is smiling today – and for good reason. The legendary Bitcoin bull and co-founder of MicroStrategy just hit a milestone that would make even the most hardened crypto skeptic raise an eyebrow. His company’s $BTC bet is now over $10B in profit, all thanks to one thing: buying the dip like it’s a clearance sale. But Saylor’s not alone in this stampede of confidence. Just yesterday, another crypto whale scooped up 2.4K $BTC, worth over $200M, adding to a stash that now tops $1.3B. And to make things even more dramatic, a dormant wallet – untouched for eight years – suddenly came to life. When the whales start moving, it’s not a ripple. It’s a tsunami. So what’s going on here? Is this the beginning of another mega bull run? And more importantly – how can regular folks ride the wave? That’s where BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) gallops into the scene. Saylor’s Strategy and the Whale-Sized Bullish Signal In August 2020, MicroStrategy kicked off its bold Bitcoin journey , buying 21,454 $BTC for $250M. Fast forward to today, and the company has stacked over 500K $BTC, purchased at an average price of approximately $66K. With $BTC now trading above $87K, that’s a jaw-dropping unrealized gain in the multi-billion dollar range, reinforcing MicroStrategy’s role as the ultimate corporate Bitcoin bull. Michael Saylor’s secret? Good old Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) – buying steadily over time, no matter the price. It’s the same logic as stocking up on groceries during sales – just with a few extra zeroes. Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales are joining the charge. One just scooped up 2.4K $BTC ($200M) in a single move. Another dormant wallet, untouched since 2016, woke up holding over 3K $BTC – worth more than $250M today. These aren’t retail flutters. When whales move, they’re sending a signal: $BTC isn’t just alive – it’s gearing up for something big. And the bulls, from Saylor to the shadows, are clearly getting ready to run. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Where Bitcoin’s Success Fuels Your Rewards So here’s the million-dollar question: How do you turn whale-sized confidence into potential profit without needing a billionaire’s bank account? Say hello to BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a new crypto project that lets you speculate on $BTC’s rise – with a clever twist. The idea is simple: You get rewarded in $BTCBULL when $BTC hits key price levels. That’s right. Not only can you benefit from the token’s price growth, but if $BTC itself moons, you can get $BTCBULL and $BTC airdrops. It’s like holding a scratch-off ticket that pays out as $BTC climbs. But there’s a catch – and it’s important. To be eligible for these juicy airdrops, you need to do two things: Buy $BTCBULL via the official website or Best Wallet , not just any wallet. Hold your tokens in Best Wallet. At the time of writing, $BTCBULL is priced at just $0.002425 and has already raised over $4M in its ongoing presale. That’s a strong signal that investors are piling in while the price is still in the basement. This isn’t just another meme coin , although the branding and energy may feel similar. $BTCBULL is one of the most intriguing new crypto projects because it ties its utility to $BTC’s performance. The token’s entire supply and distribution model is built around $BTC price milestones. Every time $BTC reaches a new level, part of the $BTCBULL supply is burned, while buyers and holders get rewarded – creating a game-like dynamic where $BTC’s success directly impacts $BTCBULL’s scarcity and potential upside. So if you’re bullish on $BTC and want a high-upside way to play it, this could be your ticket. And let’s be honest – when Saylor is $10B in profit and whales are waking from crypto hibernation, it might be time to start listening to the herd. Why This Matters for Retail Investors Most of us aren’t moving millions in $BTC. But that doesn’t mean we have to sit on the sidelines. Projects like $BTCBULL are trying to give smaller investors a way to benefit from $BTC’s big moments without the need to buy a full coin (or 190K of them). The best part? It’s still early.

Recently, eyes have turned towards World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project with ties to the Trump family, as on-chain data reveals a significant transaction. Let’s dive into what this move means and what it tells us about WLFI’s investment strategy. World Liberty Financial’s Crypto Portfolio Rebalancing: ENA Out, WBTC In According to astute on-chain analyst @EmberCN, World Liberty Financial executed a notable trade in the past day. The project divested 184,000 ENA tokens, acquiring 0.794 WBTC in return. At the time of the transaction, this WBTC haul was valued at approximately $69,000. This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a substantial shift that warrants a closer look. Why would a DeFi project, especially one with such high-profile connections, make this particular move? Decoding the Crypto Portfolio Strategy: ETH and WBTC as Cornerstones The analyst @EmberCN further illuminated a crucial aspect of World Liberty Financial’s holdings: a strong preference for Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). In fact, these two crypto giants constitute a whopping 87% of WLFI’s total portfolio. This concentration speaks volumes about their investment philosophy. It suggests a belief in the long-term value and stability of ETH and BTC, positioning them as core assets rather than speculative plays. Let’s break down what this crypto portfolio allocation potentially signifies: Emphasis on Blue-Chip Cryptocurrencies: By heavily weighting their portfolio towards ETH and WBTC, WLFI appears to be prioritizing established and widely accepted cryptocurrencies. These are often seen as less volatile compared to smaller altcoins, offering a degree of stability in the inherently turbulent crypto market. Long-Term Investment Horizon: The focus on ETH and BTC, as opposed to a more diverse range of assets, could indicate a long-term investment strategy. These cryptocurrencies have demonstrated resilience and growth over time, making them attractive for investors with a longer outlook. Risk Mitigation: Concentrating on ETH and BTC can be a risk mitigation strategy. While no investment is without risk, these cryptocurrencies have larger market capitalizations and more mature ecosystems, potentially reducing exposure to the extreme volatility often seen in smaller crypto projects. Strategic Asset Allocation: The remaining 13% of WLFI’s portfolio, presumably allocated to other cryptocurrencies, might be viewed as more opportunistic or short-term investments. This allows for potential gains from emerging trends while maintaining a solid foundation in ETH and BTC. Why WBTC? Understanding Wrapped Bitcoin’s Role in DeFi The acquisition of WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) is particularly interesting. WBTC is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. This “wrapped” version of Bitcoin allows BTC holders to participate in the DeFi ecosystem, leveraging their Bitcoin holdings for activities like lending, borrowing, and yield farming on Ethereum-based platforms. Here’s why WBTC is gaining traction and why World Liberty Financial might have opted for it: Feature WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) BTC (Native Bitcoin) Blockchain Ethereum (ERC-20) Bitcoin DeFi Compatibility Highly compatible with Ethereum DeFi protocols Limited DeFi integration Smart Contracts Supports Ethereum smart contracts Limited smart contract functionality Transaction Speed Faster transaction speeds (Ethereum) Slower transaction speeds (Bitcoin) Use Cases DeFi lending, borrowing, yield farming on Ethereum, trading on DEXs Store of value, peer-to-peer transactions By acquiring WBTC, World Liberty Financial gains exposure to Bitcoin’s value while simultaneously accessing the vast opportunities within the DeFi project space on Ethereum. It’s a strategic move that bridges the gap between the two largest blockchains. The Significance of the ENA Token Sale Now, let’s address the other side of the transaction: the sale of ENA token s. ENA is the native token of Ethena Labs, a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. While ENA has its own merits and utility within the Ethena ecosystem, WLFI’s decision to reduce their holdings suggests a potential shift in perspective or portfolio allocation. Possible reasons for selling ENA could include: Profit Taking: If WLFI had acquired ENA at a lower price, selling at the current level could be a simple profit-taking strategy. Portfolio Rebalancing: As part of their overall portfolio strategy, WLFI might have decided to reduce exposure to ENA in favor of WBTC or other assets. Risk Assessment: Perhaps WLFI re-evaluated the risk-reward profile of ENA compared to WBTC and opted for the perceived stability of Bitcoin-backed assets. Capital Allocation: The funds from the ENA sale might be earmarked for other strategic investments within or outside the crypto space. What Does This Mean for the Broader DeFi Landscape? While this transaction specifically involves World Liberty Financial, it offers broader insights into the current sentiment and strategies within the DeFi market. The preference for ETH and WBTC, as highlighted in WLFI’s crypto portfolio , could reflect a wider trend among institutional or larger DeFi players. Key takeaways for the DeFi landscape: Flight to Quality: In times of market uncertainty or volatility, investors often gravitate towards established assets like ETH and BTC. WLFI’s portfolio allocation could be indicative of a broader “flight to quality” within DeFi. WBTC’s Growing Importance: The increasing adoption of WBTC underscores its role as a crucial bridge between Bitcoin and the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. Expect to see WBTC continue to play a vital role in expanding DeFi’s reach. Strategic Portfolio Management: WLFI’s actions demonstrate the importance of active and strategic portfolio management in DeFi. Projects are constantly evaluating and adjusting their holdings to optimize returns and manage risks. Transparency and On-Chain Analysis: The ability to track and analyze on-chain transactions, as exemplified by @EmberCN’s analysis, highlights the transparency of blockchain and its value for understanding market dynamics. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can crypto investors glean from this World Liberty Financial transaction? Diversification with a Core Focus: Consider building a diversified crypto portfolio, but with a strong core allocation to established cryptocurrencies like ETH and BTC. Explore WBTC: If you hold Bitcoin and want to participate in DeFi, explore the possibilities offered by WBTC. Monitor On-Chain Data: Pay attention to on-chain analytics to gain insights into the movements of larger crypto entities and potential market trends. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in the DeFi space and understand the strategies employed by various projects and investors. Conclusion: A Strategic DeFi Play World Liberty Financial’s swap of 184,000 ENA for 0.794 WBTC is more than just a routine transaction. It’s a strategic move that sheds light on their investment priorities, highlighting a preference for ETH and WBTC as foundational assets within their DeFi project . This transaction underscores the evolving dynamics of the DeFi market and the importance of understanding portfolio strategies in the crypto world. As the DeFi landscape matures, expect to see more sophisticated portfolio management and strategic asset allocation from key players like World Liberty Financial.

Although investors continue to proceed with caution, new data revealed that bullish sentiment is at its strongest level in six weeks. This shift came as the crypto asset soared to $88,500 where its rally was stopped . Bullish Sentiment According to the latest analysis shared by Santiment, the week started on a positive note for the crypto market, with Bitcoin reaching $88,500 for the first time in 17 days. Ethereum also saw a surge as it surpassed $2,100 for the first time in 14 days. According to the data revealed by the on-chain analytic platform, positive social media comments have been on the rise, which indicates increased optimism among market participants. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s crowd sentiment has hit its highest level since February 14, while Ethereum’s sentiment is also trending bullish, thereby suggesting that the recent rally may continue as investor confidence grows. Cyclical On-Chain Metrics Despite the price appreciation, the Bitcoin IFP (Inflow-Flow Position) metric continues to flash bearish signals. With an IFP of 696k, significantly below the 90-day simple moving average (SMA90) of 794K, this metric suggests no imminent trend reversal to the upside. Additionally, the Bitcoin CQ Bull & Bear Market Cycle Indicator remains bearish. Although BTC is in an uptrend, the indicator has shown weak bearish signals similar to previous downturns. The crucial question remains whether this is just a natural market correction or the start of a deeper bear phase. As the DMA30 is still below the DMA365, no bullish shift can be confirmed based on this indicator alone. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin MVRV (Market-Value-to-Realized-Value) score is currently below its 365-day moving average (SMA365). Historically, this has signaled increased selling pressure, as seen during the August 2024 carry trade crisis when the MVRV score briefly dipped below SMA365. Once that crisis subsided, the MVRV reclaimed the SMA365, which hinted at recovery. Finally, the NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) metric is still below its SMA365 level, which shows that the uptrend could be losing momentum. For Bitcoin to regain strength, the NUPL would need to cross back above its SMA365. While these metrics suggest a period of short-to-mid-term turbulence, none indicate that Bitcoin has reached an overheated cycle top. Drawing comparisons to the carry trade crisis of August 2024, CryptoQuant analysis suggests that the current bearish signals could be linked to macroeconomic conditions, which are similar to last year’s market conditions. Once these macro pressures ease, Bitcoin is expected to recover, but the market must wait and see if history repeats itself.

The reactivation coincides with a recent resurgence for the apex crypto. Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, was trading at about $87,700 as of publication time, according to data provider CoinGecko. Dormant Bitcoin Whale With $250 Million Suddenly Awakens As BTC stages a relief rally on Tuesday amid talks of the upcoming U.S. tariffs, due on April 2, being narrower than originally feared, a whale that has been asleep for 8 years is waking up this week. According to data from blockchain sleuth Arkham Intelligence, the whale has moved 3,000 Bitcoin, valued at $250 million at the time of the transfer. “His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today— and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years,” Arkham wrote in a recent post on the X platform. The movement of BTC from very old wallets often sparks curiosity among crypto community members. In recent years, numerous dormant wallets have come out of hibernation only to transfer the BTC holdings to a new address. Some of these wallets were also discovered to have shifted their BTC stashes to crypto exchanges, suggesting they were looking to take profits after many years of HODLing. Bitcoin Whales Continue Accumulation Spree Meanwhile, a billionaire Bitcoin whale is adding to their stockpile. Arkham pointed out in a different X post that the whale snatched up 2,400 BTC, worth approximately $200 million, on March 24. According to Arkham Intelligence, the whale in question started buying Bitcoin only five days ago after selling its cache in February when the asset’s price was hovering at around $100K and $86K. https://twitter.com/arkham/status/1904214104765571170 Data from CoinGecko indicates that BTC was trading at around $104,000 on February 1 and plunged to $78K lows by the end of that month. Another massive BTC holder, BlackRock, has also been adding to its Bitcoin stockpile over the last week as well. Per Arkham data, the world’s largest asset manager with $11 trillion in assets under management, bought a further 4,054 Bitcoin across 15 separate transactions, bringing its total holdings to 573,878 BTC , or over $50 billion.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|ARKM|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-25 13:31:49

While Ethereum remains one of the most watched assets in the space, some investors are beginning to explore smaller projects with lower entry points and higher potential returns. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining steady traction as one of the most promising pre-launch opportunities. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol aimed at making DeFi more accessible and functional for users. Instead of relying on centralized control or outdated models, Mutuum uses smart contracts to enable users to supply crypto assets and earn passive income, or borrow against their holdings without needing to sell them. The system is built to support two lending structures. In Peer-to-Contract (P2C), users deposit assets into shared liquidity pools where interest rates adjust dynamically based on usage. Peer-to-Peer (P2P), on the other hand, allows lenders and borrowers to engage directly—especially helpful for tokens with higher volatility. This approach gives users options to tailor their experience based on the assets they hold and their personal strategy. What makes Mutuum stand out is its focus on transparency, control, and flexibility. When a user supplies assets, they receive mtTokens that represent their share of the liquidity pool. These tokens automatically increase in redeemable value based on platform activity, giving depositors a passive income stream without locking their funds. Borrowers, in turn, can access liquidity without selling their long-term assets—helping preserve exposure during volatile periods. Ethereum’s recovery outlook strengthens Ethereum, meanwhile, is showing signs of stabilizing after months of downward pressure. The asset has recently tested a key support zone and is now trading near the $2,000 mark. Historically, similar setups have led to major rebounds in ETH’s price, and analysts are forecasting the possibility of a 60–70% increase in the coming months. Institutional interest also remains high, with large-scale investors continuing to accumulate ETH on the dip. While ETH’s long-term potential is largely undisputed, its current market cap and pricing make it less accessible for those seeking high-multiple returns. The expected rebound could bring strong gains, but for many smaller investors, the focus is now on early-stage projects that offer more room to grow—particularly as altcoin season approaches. Why MUTM is gaining traction MUTM’s presale is entering a crucial stage. Over $4.76 million has already been raised, and more than 6,600 holders have joined the ecosystem. The project is currently in Phase 3 of its presale, where tokens are priced at $0.02. With 71% of this phase already completed, a 25% price increase is expected soon as the sale progresses into Phase 4. This window presents a rare entry point. Early investors are securing positions before the next price jump, positioning themselves for a guaranteed 3x return at launch, when the token will be listed at $0.06. What makes the timing even more compelling is the planned beta release of Mutuum’s platform, expected to launch alongside the token. This alignment of product rollout and market debut is seen as a key driver of early momentum, increasing demand as users engage with the protocol right from the start. Ethereum may be on track for a rebound, but in terms of potential return on investment, projects like Mutuum Finance are hard to ignore. With its functional design, growing presale traction, and launch-ready roadmap, MUTM is emerging as one of the most watched altcoins heading into the next market phase. For those looking to move early and capture upside before altcoin season takes full shape, now might be the time to look closer at what Mutuum has to offer.

As of March 24, the USDT supply on Ethereum hit over $75 billion, while the USDC supply stood at a little over $39 billion. USDe, USDS, DAI, FDUSD, and PYUSD accounted for $5.39 billion, $4.49 billion, $2.95 billion, $2.07 billion, and $714.23 million of the total Ethereum stablecoin supply, respectively. The current Ethereum stablecoin supply accounts for over half of the total stablecoin market cap, which has surged to about $230 billion as of March 2025. The interest in stablecoins also increased despite the downward trend seen in the crypto markets this year. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been experiencing liquidations, dumps, and price plunges over the past few months due to continued macroeconomic uncertainty, including President Trump’s economic policies. The crypto market trends over the past few months saw a retracted interest from speculative and risk assets to less volatile assets. The negative sentiment led to Bitcoin’s price dropping below $77,000 severally in the past few weeks. Most altcoins have also failed to maintain the momentum seen at the end of last year and in January this year, leading to speculation that the altseason would not happen in the 2024/2025 bullish cycle. Stablecoin production remained consistent, especially during the recent ETH price plunge to around the $1,900 level. Stablecoin dominance remains visible across other metrics Stablecoin supply grew from just under $150B to $230B in the past year, a 59% surge!!! institutional adoption. -> real world assets. -> crypto becoming financial infra. Stablecoins are eating the future of money. pic.twitter.com/b74ce4s4ur — AgriDex Intern (@AgridexIntern) March 23, 2025 The overall stablecoin supply growth year-on-year as of March this year stood at about $80 billion, marking approximately 59% growth. The supply grew on Ethereum the most from $75.3 billion in March last year to over $132 billion this March. Other blockchains also saw significant surges in stablecoin supply, including Solana, BNB Chain, Tron, Base, Arbitrum, and more. The coins have also managed to increase their supply by over 10% since January this year, amounting to over $20 billion in supply surge. An increase in stablecoin supply has been associated with an increase in crypto market liquidity. One contributing event to the upward momentum seen in stablecoin supply is the recent $1 billion USDT by Tether a few days ago. Ethereum has shown superiority in stablecoin dominance through the spiked monthly transfer volumes and active stablecoin addresses. Ethereum stablecoin monthly transfers saw over a $2 trillion year-on-year change as of February 2025, with February 2024 monthly transfers at $1.9 trillion and February 2025 monthly transfers at $4.1 trillion. A recent CoinMarketCap report stated the significance of Ethereum’s ecosystem as stablecoin usage grew. The report indicated that Ethereum’s ecosystem was necessary as a settlement layer for stablecoin transactions. Ethena Labs’ head of research, Andrew Hong, also recently mentioned that stablecoin flows are usually directed to chains with robust infrastructure and where stablecoin use cases are required. Hong added that the Ethereum stablecoin ecosystem continued to demonstrate notable resilience. Institutional adoption increases stablecoin growth A recent Dune Analytics and Artemis report dubbed “The State of Stablecoins 2025: Supply, Adoption & Market Trends” cited growing institutional interest, and DeFi stablecoin adoption contributed to the growth in the stablecoin market. The report highlighted the growth through the 53% spike in active stablecoin user addresses, changing from 19.6 million in February last year to 30 million in February this year. Dune and Artemis revealed that institutions and DeFi applications were leveraging stablecoins more for payments while increasing their accessibility across multiple platforms. The Federal Reserve has also been considering the importance of stablecoins in bridging digital and traditional finance. The Fed Governor Christopher Waller mentioned last month that the integration of stablecoins in the economy could help boost the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global markets. Waller also compared stablecoins to commercial bank money while insisting on the digital assets’ ability to open new payment gateways. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Cardano stabilizes above $0.70 as investor sentiment improves, while Rexas Finance gains traction with a $47.47m presale. Table of Contents Cardano’s price action: Is a $6 ADA surge possible? Rexas Finance set for a major rally following Cardano uncertainty What’s next for Rexas Finance? With a little 1.3% increase over the past 24 hours, Cardano (ADA) has stabilized above the $0.70 level as consumers try to underline control. This follows a protracted slump starting on March 2 that left traders on the brink. Investor mood is exhibiting indications of recovery even as trading volume dropped 26.6%, indicating a period of less volatility. Rising from 15 to 19, the Fear and Greed Index suggests ADA might have momentarily struck a bottom. Buyers are carefully buying at lower levels, hoping for a reversal. At the same time, the market is still anxious — many question whether ADA might explode to $6 as it gradually shows a rare graph pattern. You might also like: Why XRP will pump in 2025, but Rexas Finance at $0.20 could still challenge it Cardano’s price action: Is a $6 ADA surge possible? Cardano has outperformed some significant cryptocurrencies, notably Solana and Ethereum, which have witnessed more significant losses of 33.6% and 42.7%, respectively, despite a 12.6% drop since the start of the year. Due to this relative strength, ADA has been under observation by traders seeking durable assets. Former U.S. President Donald Trump listed Cardano as one of the cryptocurrencies under consideration for a possible U.S. digital asset reserve on March 2, acting as a fresh catalyst. After Trump stated that the government would only hold assets already in use, stopping speculation about fresh acquisitions, ADA saw a temporary price surge following the announcement, but the increase was fleeting. ADA gained great support at $0.640, where purchasing pressure helped to steady its price after reversing from its initial advance. At $0.763, Bitcoin is now almost reaching a significant resistance point. A breakout over this level could indicate a considerable momentum change that might even turn the present downtrend around. ADA has also produced a higher low on the daily chart, a positive technical indication implying rising demand. Should it effectively remove the $0.763 barrier, traders could witness a more extensive rebound developing. Momentum indicators stay mixed, reflecting market anxiety. Although ADA’s price structure is improving, its capacity to maintain an ascent depends on more buying pressure. Should bulls raise the price, a 15% surge might be the initial sign of a longer-term breakthrough. Still, a leap to $6 is a more aspirational goal requiring a significant change in market mood and broader acceptance. With Cardano’s price movement yet uncertain, a fresh competitor in the crypto scene, Rexas Finance, is drawing investor interest with its robust market introduction. Rexas Finance set for a major rally following Cardano uncertainty Rexas Finance is a novel platform transforming the digital asset market, particularly in real-world asset tokenizing. Rexas Finance is stretching the possibilities of blockchain use by letting users tokenize anything, including real estate, goods, and intellectual property. Entering Stage 12 at $0.20, RXS’s presale has been remarkable, generating nearly $47.47 million. Investor interest is at an all-time high since 91.47% of the presale target ($56,000,000) has already been filled. The Rexas Finance team has chosen a public presale model instead of many blockchain initiatives seeking venture capital backing, guaranteeing greater ecosystem involvement. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listings have raised investor trust and visibility, accentuating the buzz around RXS even more. Rexas Finance has had a Certik audit to establish its legitimacy, therefore providing further security and openness for possible purchasers. What’s next for Rexas Finance? With its official launch date set for June 19, 2025, Rexas Finance is preparing to debut at $0.25, marking the final stage of its presale. The project is also set to list on three top-tier exchanges, which is expected to drive further liquidity and demand. Driven by the growing acceptance of RWA tokenization and the unique features of the Rexas Finance platform, market analysts estimate a possible 120x surge in the following weeks following the debut. With its practical uses, which allow flawless ownership, fractionalization, and blockchain trading of actual assets, RXS distinguishes itself from many speculative tokens. Rexas Finance is a good alternative for conventional cryptocurrencies like ADA for investors searching for the next great prospect. Investors looking for the next big opportunity may find Rexas Finance a promising alternative to traditional altcoins like ADA.

Bitcoin (BTC) reached an intraday peak of $88,635 before declining and steadying itself around $86,500. The flagship cryptocurrency has been marginally down over the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is marginally up as it attempted to move past $2,100. However, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has been unsuccessful so far, reaching a peak of $2,099 before declining to its current level of $2,045. Solana (SOL) has registered a marginal increase and is trading around $138. Markets have not seen much movement during the ongoing session. Ripple (XRP) is down over 1%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 4%, trading at $0.182. Cardano (ADA) is up 0.50%, while Chainlink (LINK) has registered a marginal increase to push above $15. Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Avalanche (AVAX) are also marginally up. However, Toncoin (TON) , Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) are trading in the red. IMF Officially Begins Tracking Bitcoin (BTC) The International Monetary Fund (IMF) published the seventh edition of its Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7) on March 20. The latest edition marked the first time cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) , have been integrated into global standards for tracking cross-border economic activity. The manual is developed in collaboration with over 160 countries and outlines the statistical rules used by central banks and finance ministries to record trade flows, capital movements, and financial services. The update does not give digital assets legal status or any official backing. However, it marks a crucial step in how governments and international institutions measure crypto-related activities. Crypto transactions, which run into trillions of dollars annually, have always been inconsistently reported or not reported at all. This led to significant gaps in economic data and gave a limited view of the scale of crypto’s cross-border impact. BPM7 addresses the problem by providing clear definitions and accounting rules for different digital assets. As a result, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, staking rewards, and NFTs will be tracked alongside other forms of capital flows, investments, and services. Acting SEC Chair Urges Move Away From Enforcement Mark Uyeda, acting Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), chaired the inaugural session of the agency’s Crypto Task Force roundtable on March 21. The acting SEC Chair urged the commission to move away from regulation through enforcement when dealing with crypto assets. Uyeda argued the SEC must embrace formal rulemaking processes to bring clarity to the digital asset space. “This approach of using notice-and-comment rulemaking or explaining the Commission’s thought process through releases – rather than through enforcement actions – should have been considered for classifying crypto assets under the federal securities laws.” Uyeda also discussed the inconsistent application of the Howey Test, the Supreme Court’s standard to identify investment contracts, and how the inconsistencies complicated the classification of crypto assets. He cited his time as Chief Advisor to the California Corporations Commissioner, arguing that a certificate of deposit with an attached bonus qualified as an investment contract, a position rejected by the court. Uyeda also noted that the legal community remains divided, with some federal circuits requiring pooling of investor funds and pro rata profit distribution while others accept a broader interpretation centered on shared risk. There is also a disagreement on whether the investor’s profits must stem from post-sale efforts by the promoter or if significant actions taken before the sale are sufficient to meet the Howey Test’s threshold. “Differences in opinions among various courts is not unusual. After all, a judicial opinion is limited to particular facts and circumstances of that case. When judicial opinions have created uncertainty for market participants in the past, the Commission and its staff have stepped in to provide guidance.” Mt. Gox Moves $1 Billion In BTC Defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has moved $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) into two wallets, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The address associated with the defunct exchange transferred 893 BTC ($78.11 million) to its hot wallet and 10,608 BTC ($927 million) to a change wallet identified as 1DcoA. The transfers are the latest in a series of on-chain movements of funds that began four weeks ago. The platform moved over $900 million worth of BTC on March 11, and over $1 billion worth of the flagship cryptocurrency. However, unlike previous transfers, the current transfer has not impacted the spot price. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a substantial drop during the ongoing session, with the price down almost 1% after failing to push above $90,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $86,883. According to a Standard Chartered analyst, traders will be better off treating Bitcoin as a tech stock than a hedge against inflation and volatility, thanks to its high correlation with the Nasdaq. The analyst tested his theory by creating a hypothetical “Mag7B” index, a spin on the “Magnificent 7” index, replacing Tesla with Bitcoin. The Magnificent 7 refers to tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. If BTC is added to the mix, its market capitalization makes the flagship cryptocurrency the sixth-largest in the group. BTC has been retreating during the ongoing session after failing to reclaim $90,000. Traders also feel less skeptical, with open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts rising by 10% in one day, according to data from CoinGlass. There are over $57 billion worth of open derivatives contracts. The figure had dropped below $45 billion earlier this month. According to the analyst, if Bitcoin was swapped into the Mag7 Index in 2017, it would have outperformed the index by 5%. Additionally, traders who swapped Bitcoin for TSLA over the past seven years would have experienced fewer price fluctuations. “Perhaps more important than returns is Mag 7B’s lower volatility relative to Mag 7 every year. Over the full period, average annualized volatility is almost 2% lower for Mag 7B than for Mag 7.” Stock correlations have been a hotly contested topic among Bitcoin investors. In late 2024, BTC appeared to break away from gold and equities, completely outperforming every asset class. “Furthermore, during the period since President Trump’s inauguration on January 20, BTC has traded like most of the Mag 7 stocks. If we compare price declines against [volume] levels over this period, BTC trades in a similar vol-adjusted fashion to NVDA, while TSLA trades a lot like ETH.” BTC started the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising almost 4% to move past the 200-day SMA and reach an intraday high of $85,363 before settling at $84,002. Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $84,398. However, BTC lost momentum on Sunday, dropping over 2%, slipping below the 200-day SMA and settling at $82,611. Buyers returned to the market on Monday as BTC rose almost 2% and settled at $84,016. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $81,187 before settling at $82,725, ultimately registering a drop of 1.54%. Markets rallied on Wednesday following the FOMC meeting. As a result, BTC surged over 5%, going past the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $86,875. Source: TradingView However, the rally lost momentum on Thursday, and BTC dropped over 3%, slipping below the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $84,215. Price action remained muted on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines to settle at $83,822. However, sentiment changed on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising almost 3% to cross the moving averages and settle at $86,116. Bullish sentiment persisted on Monday as BTC set its sights on $90,000. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to an intraday high of $88,824 before settling at $87,523, ultimately registering an increase of almost 2%. The current session saw BTC down by nearly 1% as sellers looked to lower the price. If buyers can retake control, BTC could reclaim $90,000. However, if sellers continue to exert control, BTC could slip below $85,000 or lower. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is down almost 1% during the ongoing session as it struggles to stay above the key $2,000 level. ETH had rallied since the weekend, going past $2,000 on Monday. However, it has lost momentum since, with sellers looking to drive the price below $2,000. According to analysts from Standard Chartered, ETH is stuck in limbo after giving away its value for free to Layer2 networks and is struggling to attract investor interest. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has dropped over 40% in three months, leading analysts to state it is facing a “midlife crisis.” “It's hard to get too excited about amazing feats of engineering when there [are] so many competing things now in the attention economy.” Ethereum’s developers are also struggling with internal disagreements, while user activity has stagnated. Carol Alexander, Finance Professor at the University of Sussex, stated that Ethereum’s decentralized finance vision feels much further away now than a year ago, and decision-making in the Ethereum community was a bit of a shambles. ETH started the previous week on a bullish note, rising over 2% and settling at $1,928. The price registered a marginal increase on Tuesday despite facing selling pressure, and settled at $1,933. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH surged over 6% to reclaim $2,000 and settle at $2,058. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level thanks to the 20-day SMA, which acted as a dynamic resistance level. As a result, ETH dropped almost 4% on Thursday, slipping below $2,000 and settling at $1,983. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell nearly 1% and settled at $1,965. Source: TradingView Sentiment changed over the weekend as buyers returned to the market. As a result, ETH registered an increase of almost 1% on Saturday and settled at $1,981. The price continued to push higher on Saturday, rising 1.33% to reclaim $2,000 and settle at $2,007. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price rose almost 4%, moving past the 20-day SMA and settling at $2,082. The current session sees ETH marginally down after buyers lost momentum. Sellers are looking to drive ETH below $2,000. If the price dips below this level, it could decline to $1,800. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is looking to continue its rally and push towards $150 as buying pressure returns. SOL had plunged over 7% on Sunday after failing to go past the 20-day SMA and settled at $126. Buyers returned to the market on Monday, and SOL registered an increase of 1.58% and settled at $128. However, SOL was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping over 2% and settling at $125. Bullish sentiment returned on Wednesday as markets rallied after the FOMC meeting. As a result, SOL surged over 8%, reclaiming $130 and settling at $135. However, SOL could not move past the 20-day SMA and dropped almost 6% on Thursday, slipping below $130 and settling at $127. Source: TradingView Despite the bearish sentiment, SOL registered a marginal increase on Friday and settled at $128. Saturday saw another marginal increase before a rally on Sunday, taking SOL past $130 and the 20-day SMA to $132. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL rallied over 6% to cross $140 and settle at $141. The current session sees SOL up almost 1% as it sets its sights on $150. The RSI sits above the neutral zone while the MACD is bullish, indicating buyers have the upper hand. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) started the previous week on a bullish note, rising almost 2% and settling at $2.34. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as XRP fell to an intraday low of $2.22 before recovering and settling at $2.28, ultimately registering a drop of over 2%. XRP rallied on Wednesday as the broader market turned bullish. As a result, XRP surged over 11%, going past the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $2.54. However, the rally was short-lived and XRP was back in the red on Thursday, dropping over 4%, slipping below the 50-day SMA, and settling at $2.43. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell over 2% and settled at $2.38. The price continued to drop on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $2.37. Sentiment changed on Sunday as XRP rose almost 3% and settled at $2.44. The price registered a marginal increase on Monday, crossing the 50-day SMA to settle at $2.45. The current session sees XRP marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Sellers will look to drive the price below the moving averages and $2.40. On the other hand, buyers will look to retake control and drive XRP towards $2.50. Algorand (ALGO) Price Analysis Algorand (ALGO) started the previous week positively, rising over 3% and settling at $0.191. However, the price was back in the red on Tuesday, falling almost 3% and settling at $0.186. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as ALGO surged over 7% and settled at $0.199. Despite Wednesday’s positive sentiment, ALGO was back in the red on Thursday, dropping over 2% and settling at $0.195. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as the price fell over 4% and settled at $0.187. Source: TradingView The weekend saw a recovery as ALGO registered a marginal increase on Saturday, rising over 2% on Sunday to settle at $0.191. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as ALGO surged over 6%, crossing the 20-day SMA and settling at $0.203. The current session sees ALGO up over 2% and trading at $0.208 as buyers look to push the price higher. Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) has continued to push higher during the ongoing session after breaking out of its trading range over the weekend. If buyers can retain control, TAO could rally to $300. TAO registered a substantial increase last Monday, rising over 5% and settling at $254. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as the price fell almost 3%, slipping below $250 and settling at $247. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as TAO rose 6.40% and settled at $262. However, it lost momentum on Thursday, dropping over 4% and settling at $251. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Friday as TAO fell over 2%, slipping below $250 and settling at $246. Sentiment changed over the weekend, and TAO registered a marginal increase on Saturday. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as TAO rose almost 4% to reclaim $250 and settle at $257. Buyers retained control on Monday as TAO registered an increase of 4.37% to go past the 20-day SMA and settle at $268. The current session sees TAO up almost 2% and trading at $273. Filecoin (FIL) Price Analysis Filecoin (FIL) has been trading in a steady upward trajectory since falling to a low of $2.44 on March 11. However, it struggled to push beyond $3 last week after encountering stubborn resistance at this level. FIL surged over 6% last Monday to settle at $3.02. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $3 and settling at $2.92, but not before dropping to a low of $2.82. Bullish sentiment returned Wednesday as FIL surged past the 20-day SMA to reclaim $3 and settle at $3.10. However, the rally was short-lived, and FIL was back in the red on Thursday, dropping almost 2% and settling at $3.05. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as the price plunged almost 5%, slipping below $3 and the 20-day SMA and settling at $2.90. Sentiment changed on Saturday as FIL rallied nearly 3%, reaching an intraday high of $3.06 before settling at $2.99. Buyers retained control on Sunday as the price rose 1.17% to end the weekend at $3.02. FIL started the current week on a bullish note, rising over 3% to reach an intraday high of $3.20 before settling at $3.12. The current session sees FIL marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Buyers will look to retake control and push FIL past the 50-day SMA. On the other hand, sellers will look to drive the price below $3. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

But as we witness the explosive rise of AI, it's time for crypto to face the truth: the true technological revolution of our era is artificial intelligence, and crypto will play a supporting role rather than be the star. This isn't about diminishing the industry’s importance or the quality of what it’s built. I helped pioneer institutional investing in Bitcoin, and I’ve operated and invested in numerous companies building on-chain. I also earned a Ph.D in AI. The simple truth is that building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems should be the mission, whether or not blockchain rails are included. With respect to pure crypto, the only segment left standing is DeFi. Objectively a better version of TradFi, DeFi boasts better engineering, programmability, and composability. This is properly captured with the meme: Internet Capital Markets . Stablecoins and tokenization have shown exceptional product-market-fit , and they remain crypto’s truest (read: only) demonstration of real tangible value to date. As such, the institutions are coming, and for good reason. BlackRock, Robinhood, and even crypto-native stalwarts like Coinbase are building out crypto products in the expectation of imminent regulatory clarity. Moving instant global payments and settlement along with more complex financial instruments on-chain is a no-brainer. Otherwise, there’s AI. There’s TradAI like the big labs, model builders, and LLM providers. There’s open-weight AI like DeepSeek and Mistral. There’s open-source AI like Nous. AI apps like Cursor and Lovable. Agents like Manus. Robotics. And even Decentralized AI or Crypto x AI (we’ll get to that in a minute…). In short, there's already more demand for AI products and services than there has ever been for pure crypto applications. This is captured by another meme: if you’re in crypto, pivot to AI . This shouldn't surprise us. While crypto has struggled to find mainstream use cases beyond speculation and gambling, AI is already improving productivity and working its way into transforming industries everywhere across the world. What’s more? A sobering reality for crypto – further accentuated by recent memecoin activity and what’s been colloquially called “crime szn” – has been the disconnect between token values and actual technological utility . While decentralized technology itself is revolutionary, the value captured by tokens has historically been driven more by memetic appeal than by genuine technological value creation (there have been calls to get grounded in “fundamentals” as of late, but we’ll see if it has legs…). This isn't necessarily a criticism – meme value is real value in many ways – but it highlights a fundamental weakness of crypto as a standalone industry. This doesn't mean crypto’s rekt. In fact, blockchain and crypto protocols may become essential components of a future AI tech stack. But they'll serve as infrastructure underlying AI-first products and services, rather than as standalone products. Consider ways to Make AI Cheap Again : distributed computing power for training and inference, verifiable computation and data provenance, tokenized access to computational resources, decentralized storage of training data, and transparent reward mechanisms for contribution. Distributed computing and DePIN architectures as well as transparent verification systems have proven their utility. But – and this is crucial – they'll do so in service of AI products and services that solve real problems for mainstream users who neither know nor care about the underlying technical infrastructure. We could envision protocols built using blockchains generating revenue through licensing or usage and being paid in other tokenized forms of value like stablecoins – a model in stark contrast to the token-as-the-product model currently a la mode. For founders and teams currently focused on crypto-native applications, this represents both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is expanding beyond the comfortable but limited crypto ecosystem, represented primarily by Crypto Twitter and [Insert Your Favorite Conference Here]. The opportunity is participating in the genuine technological revolution that AI represents. What does this mean in practice? First, teams need to start thinking bigger. Founders should be asking themselves how AI can transform their target market, and then consider how crypto technology might help enable that transformation. This means fundamentally changing how we approach building and marketing crypto products. Instead of starting with tokenization, tokenomics, or even blockchains in general, begin with real-world problems that AI could solve. Only then should teams identify where decentralized systems could enhance the AI, and implement these pieces of the stack where they genuinely add value. Leverage crypto where it makes sense, especially where it can mitigate costs or improve efficiency, but keep the focus squarely on delivering value through intelligence and automation. For example, companies could use blockchains to create decentralized marketplaces for critical processes, making AI more accessible and cost-effective ( Vast.ai , a Nazaré portfolio company, does this for GPUs, and Orchid has been re-defining the internet and privacy with decentralized markets for years). Agents might also use cryptographic verification or privacy systems to safely and securely act on our behalf online using our login information, identities and credit cards, or even private keys and wallets on-chain. In both cases, crypto serves the larger goal of making AI systems more effective and trustworthy. The companies that will thrive in this new landscape are those that understand this dynamic. They will either build AI-first products that incorporate crypto where it adds genuine value, or they will build crypto services explicitly designed to improve AI-based products or services. The market won’t support teams running around wielding the hammer that is blockchains treating everything like a nail. Ultimately, this is about properly understanding the relationship between crypto and AI. The future belongs to AI as the primary framework while thoughtfully incorporating crypto where appropriate. For much of the crypto industry, this is a moment of truth and a profound recalibration. We can either cling to the narrative of crypto as a standalone revolution and speculative tokens as retail products, or we can embrace crypto's supporting role as excellent technology in service of AI. The latter may be less glamorous (and perhaps less valuable to investment portfolios), but it's ultimately more likely to create real lasting value and impact. The sooner we accept this reality, the better positioned we'll be to contribute meaningfully to the technological transformation that's already underway. It's time for the crypto industry to think bigger than itself.

Gordon is astounded that over half of the population’s younger citizens own crypto but not equities. Gordon believes that a crypto tax will redirect funds to local stocks and positively impact the economy. Gordon suggests that the UK government reduce taxes on stocks while introducing taxes on crypto as a way to redirect funds from unproductive assets to productive forms of capital. She reasons that companies produce jobs and that further stock investment could boost employment. She wants to encourage people to invest their money in shares and not spend too much on cryptocurrency. Gordon claims that crypto does not feed back into the economy and laments that over half of Brits under 45 have crypto holdings but no equity. Gordon wishes that the stock stamp duty tax be removed and replaced with a crypto tax. According to Gordon, cryptocurrencies are nonproductive assets that do not contribute to economic growth compared to productive assets such as shares that provide capital, employ people, pay tax, and innovate. However, entire countries, such as America and El Salvador, embrace Bitcoin and insist that digital assets have tangible benefits for the economy. The London Stock Exchange has seen many companies drop out of the market, corresponding with a decline in IPOs and a general lack of confidence in U.K. equities. Working with the Capital Markets Taskforce, Gordon wishes to address this problem by taking immediate action to revitalize the domestic market. One of her proposals is to reallocate pension funds into unlisted companies, releasing up to £100 billion in capital. U.K. investors, however, continue to embrace cryptocurrencies, seeing the innovative technology as a way to hedge against inflation and secure funds in the event of a bank run. Online exchanges have fuelled the popularity of crypto, offering accessible platforms that appeal to younger people. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) estimates that over 2 million people have traded crypto in the past year. According to Chainalysis, the U.K. jumped from 14th place in 2023 to 12th place in 2024 regarding crypto adoption, and this was happening when the FCA was heavily scrutinising digital assets. Bivu Das, the U.K. manager of Kraken, believes that the U.K. is on the brink of mass crypto adoption. EY, a consulting firm, found that the London Stock Exchange had its quietest year on record, with 18 companies listing in 2024, as compared to 23 companies listed in 2023, and 88 companies delisting from the exchange in 2024. Companies have stated the reason for their move, saying lower liquidity and valuations have forced them out of the market. Gordon believes that Trump has lost trillions of dollars in the American market through his tariffs and subsequent global supply chain disruption. She believes that the U.K. is a safe haven from such a threat and could potentially become a trading hub once again.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|United Kingdom,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-25 13:39:59

However, a technical update by Hyperliquid is making that process easier for both developers and users, with the direct linking of tokens on HyperCore and HyperEVM platforms now being possible. HyperCore is its native platform for spot assets (think tokens you can trade directly), and HyperEVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) network that executes smart contracts on Ethereum. Tokens on HyperCore, dubbed “Core spot,” can be linked to their counterparts on HyperEVM and are called “EVM spot.” Once linked, users can transfer them using simple actions — like a “spotSend” on HyperCore or a standard ERC-20 transfer on HyperEVM. Linking a core spot token to an EVM spot token isn’t automatic. The process starts with the token’s “spot deployer,” or the entity behind it, which ensures the token’s supply matches up on both sides of the transaction. Then, they send a “spot deploy action” to HyperCore, proposing an ERC-20 contract on HyperEVM to pair with their token. Next comes verification. If the EVM contract was deployed directly by an individual, they confirm it with a specific transaction nonce (a unique number assigned to each transfer on a blockchain). If it was deployed by another contract (say, a multisig for added security), the contract’s first storage slot must point to the HyperCore deployer’s address. Finally, a “finalize” action locks it all in place — ensuring both sides agree on the link. Allowing linking lets users tap into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem — such as lending, borrowing, and trading — without leaving the Hyperliquid ecosystem entirely. Why Does it Matter? But how does that matter? It’s because moving tokens between ecosystems isn’t a straightforward process. Take Ethereum as an example, with billions locked in protocols like Aave or Uniswap. But if someone wants to send a token from another network, say Solana, they need a bridge — a third-party service that locks your tokens on one side and mints a wrapped version on the other. That comes with a security risk, as bridges remain one of the most exploited blockchain-based services in recent years. The above friction exists even within Ethereum’s ecosystem, as moving assets between its mainnet and layer 2 blockchain (such as Optimism or Arbitrum) isn’t always seamless. Hyperliquid’s approach is different from just bolting on a bridge. HyperCore is a high-speed, purpose-built platform for spot trading, while HyperEVM is an EVM-compatible layer that taps into Ethereum’s DeFi toolkit. By letting tokens move directly between them — without a third-party intermediary — developers can create products that cut out the technical chops required to move assets (which is easy for heavy crypto users, but may be challenging for beginners). Tokens like HYPE, HyperEVM’s gas token, don’t need a separate ERC20 contract to work on both sides. Send HYPE from HyperCore, and it lands as native gas on HyperEVM. Send it back to HyperCore via a system address (0x222), and it’s credited instantly based on an event log. It’s not perfect just yet; however, Hyperliquid warned in its technical documents that risks of unverified contracts or supply mismatches exist as of Tuesday.",Tech|DeFi,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN|ARB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-25 13:40:22

The exchange confirmed the suspension on March 25, stating that the employee allegedly used non-public information to front-run token trades and make profits. Binance Discovers Front-Running Scheme According to Binance’s X post, the internal probe was launched on March 23 after the company received a complaint accusing the staffer of exploiting insider knowledge. Preliminary findings revealed that the employee, who joined Binance Wallet last month, previously worked in a business development role at BNB Chain. During their former role, the staffer allegedly learned about an upcoming TGE and used the information to purchase a large volume of the project’s tokens before the official announcement. Following the token launch, the employee reportedly sold part of their holdings for substantial profits, prompting Binance Wallet to take immediate action. The exchange stated that the staffer was suspended pending further disciplinary measures and that legal action would be pursued in collaboration with authorities. On-Chain Evidence and Community Whistleblowers While Binance did not publicly name the accused employee, blockchain sleuths and community members on X identified Freddie Ng, a former operations manager at BNB Chain, as a potential suspect. Ng’s LinkedIn profile shows he joined Binance Wallet’s business development team last month. X user “py” pointed to on-chain evidence indicating that a wallet involved in the front-running scheme was linked to Ng. According to DEX Screener, one of the wallets made $82,400 in profits by trading U DEX Platform (UUU) tokens. The wallet in question had received UUU tokens from another wallet initially funded by the address “freddieng.bnb”, which Ng had previously shared on his X account. Binance Wallet acknowledged the public’s efforts in uncovering the incident but clarified that only whistleblowers who reported via email would be eligible for a reward. The exchange announced a $100,000 bounty, split equally among four anonymous whistleblowers, for their role in exposing the front-running trades. Binance emphasized its zero-tolerance policy for insider trading and stated that it would fully cooperate with relevant authorities.

We hear much talk about adopting Bitcoin reserves on the national level. However, Brazil came to crypto adoption from a workers’ perspective by introducing a bill that suggests employees will be allowed to demand up to 50% of their salary in crypto. Table of Contents The bill PL 957/2025 What does this bill aim for? Political context The bill PL 957/2025 On Mar. 12, 2025, a descendant of the Brazilian royal family, federal deputy and self-proclaimed prince Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Bragança, introduced the bill PL 957/2025 . The bill aims to allow Brazilian employees to request that their employers pay salaries in crypto. At least 50% of the salary must be paid in Brazilian real, the national currency and the only legal tender of Brazil. There are a few exceptions to this rule: expatriates and foreign remote workers can have 100% of their salary in crypto under the regulation of the Central Bank of Brazil. Other employees may get a full salary in crypto under the special contract only if a private service provider pays the compensation. The exchange rate is not negotiable; it must align with the rate authorized by the Central Bank of Brazil. Employers will have to provide workers with a statement containing a gross amount of compensation expressed in Brazilian real, a share of the salary paid in crypto, conversion rate, and more usual info like charges, discounts, or bonuses. The taxes will stay the same as if the compensation is paid in Brazilian real. Such matters as the 13th salary, paid leave, and others will not be affected if an employee decides to use or not get paid in crypto. Also, the bill protects employees from potential attempts of fraud or price manipulation from the employer’s side. On top of that, the bill obliges employers to provide employees with all the needed educational material about virtual assets, including risks associated with the use of cryptocurrencies and their price volatility, teach employees how to prevent fraud and secure crypto funds, and practically demonstrate how to exchange crypto for fiat and vice versa. What does this bill aim for? The bill pursues various goals, some of which are articulated in the bill itself, while the media, lawmakers, and experts single out others. According to the text of the bill, “seeks to align the national legal system to innovations and the new dynamics of the digital market, ensuring security of employers and employees who wish to adopt this remuneration on a voluntary basis.” According to the text, the current Brazilian labor law doesn’t align with the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies. The requirement to keep at least 50% of the remuneration paid in Brazilian real is aimed at providing predictability and financial stability while allowing employers and workers to experiment with modern digital assets, paving the way for individual freedom and innovation. If it becomes a law, the legislation will empower workers to choose the most convenient way of earning without imposing any discouraging limitations on them. The bill names Japan, Switzerland, and Portugal as the countries that already employ cryptocurrencies legally. Interestingly enough, all the named countries decided against creating a Bitcoin reserve while adopting crypto the other way–the Zug canton of Switzerland began to collect taxes in crypto, a huge digital flea market Mercari in Japan allows crypto payments, and the Portuguese energy company Luzboa accepts crypto to pay for the electricity bills. This indicates that different countries adopt crypto differently, and Bragança believes it is important to join the crypto bandwagon on time. According to the bill, the new law can boost Brazil’s fintech sector and attract new professionals from other countries. Some media outlets commenting on the legislation named potential reduction of payment fees and a decrease in inflation among the possible benefits of the proposal. Political context Brazil is the world’s tenth-largest economy . Timely adoption of crypto is important for Brazil to preserve its leadership in Latin America and keep its place among the most competitive economies around the world. The crypto regulation in Brazil is rather friendly. However, it requires more clarity. Various legislation projects are currently being worked on. For instance, Brazil is eyeing the creation of a sovereign Bitcoin reserve. Read more: Bitcoin reserve bill introduced in Brazil’s Congress Although the bill is hardly applicable to the country’s external affairs, it echoes the country’s recent suggestion to consider cryptocurrencies as the means of exchange between the BRICS members. The potential use of crypto (stablecoins and CBDCs) is aimed at undermining the U.S. dollar hegemony in international trade and facilitating the independence of the BRICS economic bloc from the U.S. Russian companies are already using crypto, citing ease of use and low costs as the main benefits on top of the fact that crypto allows these companies to dodge Western sanctions. This experience can solidify the bloc’s striving to put international trade on-chain.

One of the names generating increasing traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi token backed by real world assets and designed to support a more reliable, scalable model for borrowing and lending. Still in its presale phase and priced at just $0.02, MUTM is being viewed by many as a standout contender for significant upside over the coming year. Real World Asset Integration at the Core What gives Mutuum an edge over many other tokens in the DeFi space is its RWA-focused architecture. Rather than relying only on volatile crypto assets, the protocol is building out a lending system that includes asset-backed components—starting with its overcollateralized stablecoin that reflects real value from supplied crypto. This approach addresses one of DeFi’s longest-standing challenges: maintaining stable participation while bridging the gap between blockchain tools and real-world finance. The result is a system that not only supports traditional crypto lending and borrowing but also adds depth through mechanisms grounded in actual economic value. For long-term users, this opens the door to steadier yield and enhanced capital efficiency, without the typical uncertainty that surrounds unbacked DeFi models. Mutuum’s platform is structured around lending and borrowing. Users who supply crypto assets receive mtTokens, which represent their position in the pool and gradually grow in redeemable value. The interest users earn is flexible, driven by live market demand—rather than a fixed rate—so returns can increase as borrowing activity rises. On the borrowing side, users access funds by locking up more collateral than they take out, protecting the system against default. This structure helps maintain on-chain liquidity while allowing users to retain exposure to their assets—making it especially useful during volatile market cycles when selling is not ideal. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The presale is already making noise. Mutuum has raised over $4.9 million and attracted more than 6,700 holders, with its current phase nearing 75% completion. Once this stage wraps up, the price is expected to move to $0.025, marking a 25% increase from its current level. This momentum isn’t just from individual buyers—larger wallets are also starting to take notice, locking in their positions before the token lists publicly. The appeal is simple: the project is gaining traction, the utility is clear, and the upside from this entry point could be substantial. Beyond speculation, Mutuum’s structure is designed to create sustainable demand for its token. A portion of the protocol’s earnings is routinely used to purchase MUTM from the open market and distribute it to users holding mtTokens. This process—known as the buy-and-distribute mechanism—ensures there’s a steady stream of buy pressure, which can help support long-term value growth as activity on the platform increases. Add to that the future exchange listings expected for MUTM and the launch of its beta platform, and you get a clear formula for growing exposure and interest. As more investors and users come into the ecosystem, the network effects could play a major role in price appreciation. Mutuum is more than just a DeFi platform—it’s building a complete lending infrastructure backed by real assets, driven by live market demand, and built to adapt. Whether it’s individuals seeking passive income or advanced users exploring leveraged strategies, the platform offers the tools to do both while maintaining transparency and control. To celebrate its strong presale performance, the team behind Mutuum is currently running a $100,000 giveaway. Participants will have the opportunity to earn bonus rewards and take part in community incentives. Details and entry requirements can be found on the project’s official website. Mutuum Finance isn’t just creating hype—it’s building function. Backed by real world assets and reinforced by practical mechanisms that encourage participation, it’s shaping up to be one of the few early-stage tokens with both a clear vision and strong fundamentals. For those looking to enter at the ground floor of something with real long-term potential, MUTM might just be one of the most compelling opportunities this cycle.

Trump has 9.3 million followers on Truth Social. The Solana-based $TRUMP token was created on January 17, reaching a peak of $14.5 billion in market cap by January 19, the president’s inauguration day. “I LOVE $TRUMP — SO COOL!!! The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”, wrote Trump on Truth Social. The Truth Social post triggered a 15% increase in price. The momentum of the rise is still moving, despite $TRUMP being a meme coin. The largest wallet on the network, presumably the project’s wallet, did not sell during the pump, even though doing so would have made a large profit for them. The wallet totals 83.5% of the supply. The price is trading around a key resistance level and could break through this level and rise further. The $TRUMP coin has experienced wild volatility, rising in billions during Trump’s presidential inauguration and crashing 75% during wider market turmoil. Democrats have attacked it, wishing to create new legislation to stop public officials from promoting meme coins. When asked about his meme coin in January, Trump said he didn’t know much about it but had heard it was doing well on the market. When the coin dropped in price, many people said the coin’s popularity was over. However, the recent pump shows there is still a lot of interest in the meme coin. Critics of the coin say that Trump is setting a dangerous precedent where public officials use their position to benefit themselves financially. The $TRUMP coin went up 7.7% at one stage, but even at this level, it was down 84% from its all-time high. Luis Buenaventura, head of crypto at GCash, said that this showed a lack of interest in the meme coin despite short-term pumps. Meme coins were around long before the $TRUMP token. Many buyers of meme coins may have never bought a token before. But in 2013, the first major meme coin, Dogecoin, was created as a joke at first but then became a popular blockchain. Many meme coins rise quickly and then suffer a crash. Others rise in popularity only to stabilise later, enriching early investors but losing money for everyone else. To many, the $TRUMP coin may look like a pump-and-dump scheme, with a pump caused by a social media post and insiders pulling the rug by withdrawing funds. But there is no indication at this stage that insiders withdrew their holdings. The $TRUMP coin has over 650,000 holders. The Trump brand is well known throughout the world. Many people may buy and associate the coin with Donald Trump, the U.S. president. If the economy improves and Trump remains president, economic changes may further boost the price. Further, the Fed may start boosting market liquidity, boosting meme coins like the $TRUMP token, leaving people with more leftover money to use on speculative assets. Meme coins have followed trends in the broader crypto industry, seeing massive declines as the major tokens fell in value. The LIBRA coin incident, a very similar situation to the current article, involved the president of Argentina promoting LIBRA just before it suffered a rug pull from insiders. The incident, for many, marked a decline in meme coin popularity. However, the $TRUMP insiders did not pull the rug and had enough confidence in the meme coin to ride a massive price decline. Meme coins present a serious problem for investors, who must consider a large amount of coins available for purchase. The SEC even described meme coins as akin to collectables, such as trading cards or memorabilia, suggesting a possible approach to judging the worth of these tokens. Further, successful meme coins are few and far between, meaning that most will not be profitable. One factor for judging the worth of a meme coin is whether it has a cult like following. The $TRUMP coin may still be successful, given that it has that one key feature of a successful meme coin.",Cryptocurrency|News|Donald Trump|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-25 13:48:24

Its support for smart contracts and focus on academic research have built a strong foundation, keeping ADA in the conversation as a long-term hold. Despite slower price movement compared to other altcoins, ADA is viewed by many as a project with underappreciated strength. As the network’s ecosystem continues to expand, investor sentiment remains optimistic about a breakout in the months ahead—especially if broader market conditions become more favorable. The token’s current consolidation phase may be setting the stage for renewed momentum. Ripple (XRP) XRP, on the other hand, has been trading under the spotlight thanks to its legal clarity and continued expansion in cross-border payments. With increasing institutional use and a growing presence in real-world finance, XRP is seen as a utility-driven token positioned for another rally. Its ongoing role in remittances and enterprise adoption makes it an attractive pick during periods of market transition. Although XRP’s short-term price action has fluctuated, analysts still believe a move toward the $3 range is possible once a clear trend resumes. Many long-term holders are maintaining their positions in anticipation of the next upward wave, especially given how XRP has historically performed during bullish altcoin phases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , however, is generating even more excitement at the moment. Unlike other tokens waiting for momentum to return, MUTM is actively building during its presale phase—and investors are taking notice. The project recently passed over 6,600 holders and raised more than $4.74 million, with over 71% of its third presale phase completed. With the token still priced at just $0.02 and set to rise by 25% in the next phase, buyers are locking in their positions before the next price jump. MUTM is powering a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that allows users to earn passive income or unlock liquidity using their digital assets. Whether participating through shared liquidity pools or direct peer-to-peer interactions, users are given full control of their funds. This structure appeals to those seeking real-world utility instead of speculative hype. What sets Mutuum apart is its focus on sustainable token value. A portion of platform revenue is used to buy back MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to liquidity providers—creating consistent buying pressure. The platform is also planning to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin, offering users another tool to maintain liquidity without selling their crypto holdings. The long-term growth forecast for MUTM is drawing attention from both whales and retail investors alike. Experts predict the token could climb to $5 in the months following its official launch. From today’s presale price of $0.02, that would represent a 24,900% increase—a rare opportunity, especially in a market where larger assets typically move in smaller percentages. Mutuum’s development team is also working closely with CertiK for a full audit of its smart contracts. Once completed, the audit results will be shared across the platform’s official channels—further boosting trust and transparency ahead of launch. To add to the momentum, the team has launched a $100,000 giveaway campaign, rewarding early participants and expanding community engagement. With a product-driven roadmap, low market cap entry point, and increasing investor interest, Mutuum Finance is quickly being recognized as one of the top altcoin picks of 2025. For those looking to add real utility to their portfolio, MUTM is emerging as a name to watch closely.

Arthur Hayes Thinks So!",https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/can-ethereum-hit-5000-before-solana-reaches-300-arthur-hayes-thinks-so/,"The post Can Ethereum Hit $5,000 Before Solana Reaches $300? Arthur Hayes Thinks So! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum’s price movement has been slow compared to other major cryptos, but BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes remains bullish. In a bold prediction, he claims that Ethereum (ETH) will reach $5,000 before Solana (SOL) hits $300. This statement has sparked debates on whether ETH can outperform SOL in the coming months. ETH to Hit $5k Before SOL hits $300 Ethereum has always been known for its strong fundamentals and vast ecosystem. While Solana has been gaining momentum, Hayes believes Ethereum will hit $5,000 before Solana reaches $300. A major factor driving Ethereum’s growth is the upcoming Dencun upgrade (EIP-4844), which aims to improve network speed and scalability, making transactions faster and cheaper. This could significantly boost demand for ETH. Meanwhile, layer-2 solutions could either strengthen Ethereum’s dominance or challenge its base-layer position, depending on how well the ecosystem adapts. Additionally, the increasing institutional interest in spot Ethereum ETFs is pushing ETH closer to the $5,000 mark. Overview of Ethereum & Solana Prices Arthur Hayes’ bold Ethereum prediction comes as ETH faces a slight price dip. Currently, Ethereum is down over 1%, trading around $2,052. Despite this, ETH recently broke above the $2,069 resistance for the first time in two weeks after bouncing off a key support level last Friday. If ETH fails to hold above $2,069, it could drop toward $1,818. However, a strong breakout could push it toward $2,267. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below neutral but trending upward, suggesting bearish momentum is weakening. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) has been gaining traction. Its price is up 0.5% today, trading at $139.4. Recent bullish factors have supported its growth, and analysts predict SOL could reach $144 by the end of the month.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,ETH|SOL|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 13:50:13

The product will give Emirates NBD’s high-net-worth clients access to private loans and other assets. It will be built on BlackRock’s Alternative Investments platform, which manages more than $450 billion in assets. It is also supported by over 1,000 personnel in more than 50 countries. On the other hand, Emirates NBD is one of the biggest banks in the MENAT (Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey) area. It has offices in 13 countries and more than 9 million registered customers. As of December 31, 2024, its total assets were $271 billion. Marwan Hadi, Group Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management at Emirates NBD, said, “Innovation is a cornerstone at Emirates NBD, and we are pleased to partner with BlackRock to offer access to best-in-class, products in alternative markets through a dedicated platform while supporting the growing needs of investors in the region.” He also said that the bank was fully committed to advancing investing in the UAE and the rest of the area through its services. BlackRock’s focus on private markets in the Arabic world Private markets, which used to be open to only institutional buyers in the region, are now the fastest-growing part of asset management. By the end of the decade, alternative assets are expected to be worth $30 trillion. Emirates NBD Asset Management and BlackRock will launch the first evergreen products for the UAE wealth market, specifically designed to help with income and growth plans. Along with these plans, BlackRock will use its open architecture approach to help Emirates NBD Asset Management with its plans to give more private market services by adding marketing, education, training, and technology. Why the Middle East? There are many international players in the Middle East private credit market because of the demand, making it a ready market Rachel Lord, Head of International at BlackRock, said, “We are delighted to partner with Emirates NBD as they build out their private markets platform. Spurred by investor sentiment and facilitated by product innovation, technology, and regulatory advancements, wealth allocations to private markets are predicted to increase materially over the next five years.” She added that the combination of Emirates NBD’s distribution skills and reach across the area with BlackRock’s knowledge and leadership in private markets around the world will be very appealing to investors in the Middle East. The financial placing for private markets Globally, banks lend about 22% of their total loans to small and medium-sized businesses. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) banks give less than 2% of their loans to small and medium-sized businesses, while MENA banks give less than 10%. While getting personal guarantees for government-backed contracts, well-known entities, and big family groups is easier, local credit funds have noticed that banks are still mainly interested in working with smaller businesses. This is where the gap is. One reason for this focus is that big government building projects in places like Saudi Arabia and the UAE need a lot of money. This makes banks less liquid. Therefore, access to capital for ambitious entrepreneurs and businesses that are growing is still a big problem in the area. Borrowers who don’t have bank accounts benefit from the ease of access, privacy, and flexibility of private credit. It also usually has better capital terms than standard financing for new businesses. In fact, many business owners like private credit because it lets them keep more equity in their businesses and is an important step in the transition from startup funding to standard bank financing. For these reasons, global and foreign companies are quickly entering the market. In 2022, Following Chimera’s $2 billion private credit joint venture with Alpha Wave, Lunate was created as an alternative asset manager with $110 billion in assets. According to Bloomberg, Lunate is apparently interested in buying a minority stake in global private credit leader HPS Partners. Mubadala is currently the biggest. After forming at least seven partnerships with companies like Apollo, Ares, Blackstone, and Goldman Sachs, it has promised over $5 billion in private loan investments in the UAE and other countries. New companies are entering the asset class every month, including Rasmalah, Ruya Partners, Shorooq Partners, Jada Fund of the PIF, and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). Now, with the new partnership, there is a new giant in the market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Gox Makes $1 Billion BTC Transfer,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-price-unfazed-as-long-bankrupt-exchange-mt-gox-makes-1-billion-btc-transfer/,"Mt. Gox caused a stir early Tuesday, transferring huge amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) to two wallets. This is the third notable on-chain movement of funds by the long-defunct Japanese crypto exchange this month as it works to resolve outstanding compensation claims from former users who lost assets during its 2014 hack. Mt. Gox Shifts New Bitcoin The transfer, tracked by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, directed 10,608.16 Bitcoin to an unlabeled address. Roughly 893 BTC was then sent to Mt. Gox’s hot wallet amid Bitcoin’s recent price rebound. The top crypto closed in on the $89,000 mark on Monday before settling around $87,342 as of press time. According to CoinGecko data, BTC is currently trading a paltry 0.1% higher than it was this time yesterday. Past large-scale movements from wallets associated with Mt. Gox typically have negatively impacted the Bitcoin price as they preceded repayments to the scandal-ridden exchange’s creditors, but today’s movement has not affected the spot price so far. The latest transfer follows a previous movement of $930 million in Bitcoin on March 11, with the majority of the sum being shifted to another unknown address. Also, on March 6, Mt. Gox transferred $1.07 billion to a new wallet. Market pundits note that while some creditors have already received fiat currency payments, many await full compensation in Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The extended timeline affects thousands of former users who lost assets during one of the industry’s most notable setbacks. The exchange postponed its complete creditor payout deadline by one year to Oct. 31, 2025, citing ongoing verification and processing requirements for claimants. This means that until then, no transaction on Mt. Gox’s part will increase selling pressure on BTC or BCH. Launched in 2010, Mt. Gox was once the most popular platform for buying and selling the world’s first cryptocurrency online, servicing roughly 70% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide in 2013. The Tokyo-headquartered exchange, however, suffered a security breach in 2014 and lost a whopping 850,000 Bitcoins, forcing the company to declare bankruptcy. The collapsed exchange retains about 35,583 Bitcoin in its wallets, valued at $3.1 billion at current prices.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|MT GOX,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|BCH|MARKET|ARKM,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-25 13:54:02

In a recent analysis, a top expert has set a “conservative” target of $15 for Ripple’s native asset, sparking market discussions. Besides, it also comes amid market optimism over a potential resolution in the Ripple Vs SEC case end, which has long dampened the broader market sentiment. XRP Price Fails To Breakout Despite Market Optimism XRP price was down about 0.7% today at $2.43 after touching a 24-hour high and low of $2.50 and $2.41, respectively. Notably, the crypto has been consolidating in this range over the past few weeks despite soaring market optimism over Ripple’s legal win. For context, CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently shared key insights on the firm’s future. Besides, he also said that the US SEC would drop the Ripple Vs SEC case. This has caught the eyes of the market participants, but it appears that the news has failed to boost the prices. However, with soaring optimism, the market pundits anticipate a potential breakout ahead for the crypto. Expert Eyes XRP Rally To $15 In a recent analysis shared on X, renowned expert EGRAG CRYPTO has set a “conservative” price target for XRP at $15. This prediction is part of a tiered target system, which also includes a “normal measurement” of $22, an “extended target” of $44, and a “personal target” of $27. The conservative target of $15 suggests that the expert believes, based on the technical trends, that the XRP price has significant growth potential. Even in a more cautious market scenario, it can record a massive rally ahead. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X In addition to the price targets, EGRAG CRYPTO also emphasized the importance of taking profits strategically. The expert advised investors to start taking profits rather than waiting for a single peak, citing the wisdom of securing profits to avoid potential losses. A Closer Look Into The Future Potential In response to a user’s inquiry about XRP price in the next bear market, EGRAG CRYPTO reassured investors that the price is unlikely to drop below $1. This prediction suggests that Ripple’s native asset has a strong foundation and is poised for long-term growth, even in the face of market volatility. Echoing a similar sentiment, another expert Dark Defender also hinted towards a short-term rally ahead for the crypto. In a recent X post, Dark Defender said that XRP must breach the $2.75 level to continue its upward run ahead. Source: Dark Defender, X He also noted that it faces “little hassle” at $2.55 and strong support at $2.42. However, once $2.75 is breached, the Dark Defender said that Ripple’s coin will target the $5.85 in the near term. It also resembles the latest Ripple coin price analysis , which indicates a potential rally to $5 citing the recent market trends.

42323782,https://invezz.com/?p=2635681,1742910924,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,ARB price jumps as Arbitrum DAO considers taking down Gaming Catalyst Program,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/25/arb-price-jumps-as-arbitrum-dao-considers-taking-down-gaming-catalyst-program/,"Arbitrum DAO is reportedly reconsidering its Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP), potentially reclaiming 225 million tokens. The Gaming Catalyst Program aimed to cement Arbitrum’s status as a powerhouse in on-chain gaming. However, a steep decline in the ARB token’s value and operational missteps have sparked a proposal to wind down the GCP and reclaim its unused tokens. Following the news of the proposal to wind down the program, the ARB token price has jumped to a daily high of $0.3945, signaling market optimism if the proposal is to sail through. A bold vision meets harsh realities The Gaming Catalyst Program kicked off with a bold vision to make Arbitrum a go-to platform for on-chain gaming development. With an allocation of roughly 225 million ARB tokens, valued at approximately $468 million at the time, the initiative set out to back promising studios and projects. The goal was clear: drive innovation in Web3 gaming and boost network growth. At its launch, the program generated excitement, promising to bridge blockchain technology with immersive gaming experiences. However, that excitement has since faded, and the ARB token’s value has plummeted by 77% since the GCP’s debut, slashing the fund’s worth to about $215 million by June 2024. This dramatic drop has put pressure on the program’s viability, prompting questions about whether it can deliver on its lofty promises. Transparency troubles and sponsor exits A slew of operational issues has also fueled the push to rethink the GCP. At the heart of the discontent is a lack of transparency. Community members have voiced frustration over opaque fund usage, with little clarity on how the 225 million tokens are being spent. Reports of team salary hikes within the program have also deepened the skepticism, especially as tangible results remain elusive. For many in the DAO, these concerns point to a troubling disconnect between the program’s leadership and its backers. Adding to the woes, the GCP has failed to meet its reporting commitments. Regular updates and transparency reports—promised at the outset—have been sporadic at best, leaving the community grasping for insight into the program’s progress. This lack of accountability has eroded trust, with some DAO members arguing that the program’s management has lost sight of its original mission. The potential exit of key sponsors, such as Treasure DAO, has further dimmed the GCP’s prospects, signaling a loss of confidence from influential players. The push to reclaim 225 million ARB tokens Faced with these mounting challenges, a proposal has emerged to wind down the GCP and reclaim its unused tokens. Spearheaded by DAO member Nathan van der Heyden, the plan calls for recovering the 225 million ARB tokens to protect the DAO’s treasury. Heyden argues that they “must wind down GCP activities and secure all possible funds to safeguard the DAO’s funds and restore investor confidence.” Heyden’s proposal reflects a growing sentiment that the program’s shortcomings outweigh its potential. The proposal has sparked a lively debate with supporters seeing it as a pragmatic move to cut losses and redirect resources to more promising ventures, while critics urge caution, warning that a full clawback could stifle innovation and alienate gaming developers still committed to the ecosystem. What’s next for the Arbitrum GCP? If the DAO opts to reclaim the tokens, the ARB price could see a short-term lift as funds return to the treasury. But it might also cast a shadow over Arbitrum’s ambitions in gaming, potentially slowing momentum in a sector still ripe with opportunity. A rejection of the proposal will put the onus on the GCP to turn things around, likely under tighter scrutiny and with less room for error. As the DAO weighs its options, the outcome will test its ability to navigate choppy waters. Can it salvage a struggling initiative, or will it pivot to new priorities?

While most altcoins failed to sustain the uptrend, meme cryptocurrencies remained elevated. Dogecoin reserve announcement and Shiba Inu’s potential breakout retained optimism in the sector. Data shows the market value of meme cryptocurrencies increased by 6% in the past 24 hours to $57.61 billion. Source: Coingecko The $6.56 billion 24-hour trading volume suggests massive interest in the alt category.

Furthermore, the Doge reserve will significantly reduce transaction fees, making the meme coin attractive for business. DOGE price breakouts The reserve announcement triggered bullish trends for Dogecoin’s price. The original meme coin gained 5% over the past 24 hours to $0.1864. The upswing has opened the path toward the post-test reversal target at $0.1945 (23.60% FIB level). A decisive closing above $0.20 (200 Exponential Moving Average) would shift DOGE’s trajectory to bullish. Continued gains could trigger upswings toward $0.2536 (50% FIB level), translating to an over 25% surge from current prices. However, sudden selling activities could catalyze declines to $0.1739 (50 Exponential Moving Average). The $0.15 support barrier would prevent further declines. Failure to sustain this foothold will ruin Dogecoin’s anticipated recovery. Shiba Inu is ready for recovery SHIB gained over 2% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.00001346. Chart by Coinmarketcap Various factors suggest continued uptrends for the second-largest meme token. Firstly, SHIB’s burn rate exploded in the past day, destroying over 1 billion tokens. Token burns are crucial since they reduce asset supply. Shiba Inu started burning tokens three years ago and has removed over 410 trillion tokens from circulation, leaving around 584 trillion. Also, SHIB’s exchange netflows indicate optimism. Data from CryptoQuant shows outflows surpassed inflows over the past week. That reduces immediate selling momentum as investors switch to self-custody. Furthermore, the latest Shibarium milestone could enhance Shiba Inu’s bullish trajectory. The L2 platform has witnessed significant activity resurgence lately, processing multi-million transactions daily. Enthusiasts should also watch broad market developments. Continued bearish sentiments could delay anticipated meme coins’ recovery. Bitcoin whales booked profits after BTC’s latest rally above $88K. Ali Martinez quoted Santiment’s chart, which shows wallets holding 10,000 – 100,000 Bitcoin assets dumped over 20,000 tokens amid price rallies. Source: Ali on X Significant whale sell-offs could trigger temporary price retracements. Bitcoin trades at $87,230 and needs a closing above $90,000 to ensure near-term uptrends.

42323171,https://crypto.news/?p=14348208,1742911006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/42323171.jpeg,From the Ethereum Foundation to BR Capital: Vlad Martynov’s Blockchain Odyssey,https://crypto.news/from-the-ethereum-foundation-br-capital-vlad-martynov/,"In this exclusive interview, crypto.news sits down with Vladislav Martynov, a seasoned high-tech entrepreneur and blockchain pioneer. From his early days co-founding a startup with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s parents, to his current role as a managing partner at BR Capital, Martynov shares his journey through the evolving world of blockchain and offers insights into its future. CN: Can you briefly introduce yourself? VM: I’m a high-tech entrepreneur who co-founded my first startup in the late ’90s with Dmitry and Maia Buterin, parents of Vitalik Buterin. We began selling an innovative Enterprise Resource Planning system. After exiting that venture, we pioneered one of the first SaaS-based CRM and membership management solutions in the early cloud era. My fascination with disruptive technologies grew, especially after Dmitry introduced me to Bitcoin in 2012 and later, in 2014, shared his son Vitalik’s vision for Ethereum — a decentralized, permissionless platform. CN : Which led you to where? VM: Soonafter, I joined the Ethereum Foundation’s Advisory Board to promote blockchain education and developer growth, co-founding BlockGeeks and the Ethereum Competence Center. During the 2016–2017 ICO boom, I advised select startups — exploring tokenization and stablecoins — but most failed due to immature technology and markets. This inspired me to create BR Capital, a regulated fund focused on DeFi and Web3, where I now work as a managing partner to support startups and attract global capital with confidence and security. You might also like: Podcast: Vlad Martynov on Ethereum ecosystem and venture capital in crypto CN: How does BR capital operate? Is there a strategic vision behind the fund? VM: At BR Capital, we blend VC insight with hands-on building — our algo-trading platform since 2017 is a testament to that. Newcomers, including traditional finance, bring interest, but navigating blockchain’s complex layers to reach the app stage demands experience. VCs with deep knowledge are key to deploying capital effectively. CN: What about the current investment climate for blockchain startups? VM: The investment climate for blockchain startups is more appealing now than in past cycles. Regulatory acceptance and institutional adoption are outpacing retail growth, shifting focus from infrastructure to practical Web3 applications like marketplaces, rewards, and privacy-enhanced social networks — opportunities absent in earlier cycles. Technology has matured, with advancements like Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions easing the Web2-to-Web3 transition. Plus, younger generations find crypto intuitive, akin to touchscreens post-smartphones, while credit cards feel outdated. This mix makes the current cycle uniquely ripe for innovation. CN: What advice would you give blockchain startups seeking funding in the current environment? VM: Past cycles overemphasized technology over product. Now, founders must prioritize product, leveraging Web3 business models while nailing fundamentals: clear reasons to switch to Web3, strong product-market fit, solid UX, and sound financial management. Focus on delivering value, not just tech. CN: Are there specific technologies or initiatives that you are currently looking at? VM: Yes, several stand out. AI-enhanced security to proactively protect against cyber threats, bolstering resilience. Abstract Accounts that simplify Web3 access with secure, user-friendly digital identities. Zero Knowledge Proofs might enable privacy-preserving DEX-bank collaboration, fostering trusted data exchanges. I also support initiatives linking Web2 and Web3, like traditional institutions adopting crypto and DeFi, or Web3 apps enhancing Web2 UX with models like GameFi. Our investment in Pave Bank reflects this — its PaveNet layer integrates third-party services into a regulated banking environment, leveraging DeFi’s programmability for seamless money management. CN: How do you think traditional financial institutions are adapting to DeFi, and what role will regulation play? VM: Initial steps include offering crypto accounts, as Revolut has done successfully, though DeFi integration lags. Next, banks could use DEXs for low-cost swaps, staking (e.g., 4% yield), and lending (e.g., 10 %+), outpacing traditional interest rates, often zero on business accounts despite fees. Pave Bank and hopefully Revolut are eyeing this. Regulation will shape competitiveness: efficient, reward-focused banks will thrive; outdated, costly ones will falter. CN: Do you envisage any collaborative opportunities between DeFi and TradFi? VM: Banks could integrate DeFi services into crypto accounts, as noted in Q14. Traditional players might tokenize real-world assets (e.g., real estate, commodities) for DeFi protocols, enabling fractional ownership and trading on DEXs, diversifying investment options. Blockchain could also boost TradFi’s security and transparency—unlike centralized systems like ByBit, which falter during hacks, or traditional finance, frozen by events like Buffett’s sell-off or the 2008 crisis, DeFi and crypto remain resilient. CN: How do you see the regulatory climate in the next cycle, particularly with respect to the new Trump administration’s stance towards crypto? VM: Global regulators have resisted crypto, with only smaller nations exploring progressive laws, wary of U.S. dominance. Recently, both Biden and Trump shifted to pro-crypto stances, driven by young, tech-savvy voters (25-30) who prefer Web3 and find crypto intuitive. Traditional finance now sees blockchain as the future internet, unstoppable in adoption. Trump’s personal experience with censorship, bolstered by his blockchain-savvy family, fuels genuine intent to lead this revolution — unlike Biden’s political pivot. His team, including Department of Government Efficiency outsider Elon Musk and appointed crypto czar David Sacks, signals action on legislation like asset tokenization and DeFi integration. Coupled with the recent news of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and clarity on digital asset regulation, I expect a more supportive approach under Trump, unlikely to worsen from here. CN: Lastly, how might policy changes impact the growth and adoption of blockchain technology in the U.S. and globally? VM: As I mentioned, Radical perspectives for and against blockchain are softening and coming closer together, leading to better discussions about tokenisation, efficiency, and transparency of the financial system. I also think that as soon as the US increases the amount of the National Reserve in Bitcoins and creates a sizable stockpile of crypto assets, there will be a domino effect: other countries will follow in the same direction. Many countries from Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and even Europe have been waiting for more specifics from the Trump administration and the SEC. Current price volatility in the markets is a short-term chaos. Inevitable given the sudden shift to very different policies in the US, with political meme coins, unclear policies on tariffs, revenge tariffs, etc. Time is needed for everything to settle down. Medium-term, I’m extremely bullish for late 2025, by which time we’ll have clearer policies and longer-term beyond that.

Blackrock recently integrated blockchain technology and launched a tokenized Treasury fund on Solana. The fund has already accumulated $1.7 billion in cash and Treasury bills, with expectations to surpass $2 billion in early April. On the other hand, Polymarket, a leading Ethereum-based prediction market platform, announced its integration with Solana. With this integration, Polymarket aims to reduce fees and make the platform more accessible, as Solana can easily process 65,000 transactions per second. With this, the social sentiments for Solana have turned extremely bullish, with the influencers hyping potential boosts in confidence and adoption. The technicals have turned bullish but are yet to offer a validation of a rise from the bearish trajectory. In such scenarios, the question rises whether the SOL price can make it to $160 ahead of the monthly close? The weekly chart of SOL price suggests the price has entered the bullish range after remaining bullish for the second consecutive week. Besides, the token does not display any upward pressure, which paves the way for the price to maintain a healthy upswing. The RSI has rebounded from a crucial support just below 40, while the weekly DMI is heading for a bullish crossover. With this crossover, the trend is expected to flip to bullish, which could elevate the levels close to $160. Why is securing $160 extremely important for the SOL price rally? The Solana price displayed massive strength throughout 2024 by maintaining significant volatility. Amidst this, the levels around $160 have been an important price zone as they have been offering strong resistance and support whenever the rally approached the range. Hence, breaking through the range may attract fresh volume onto the platform, which may further push the price towards the next barrier at $180. Once these levels are secured, Solana (SOL) price may rise above $200.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-25 13:57:34

Table of Contents Dogecoin’s journey to $4 and Shiba Inu’s fight to stay relevant Lightchain AI: Merging blockchain and AI for real-world impact Lightchain AI: Leading the next crypto movement Dogecoin is making headlines with its ambitious $4 price target, driven by renewed interest and mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI continues to gain momentum, positioning itself as a major contender in the AI-blockchain space. Priced at just $0.007, Lightchain AI has already raised over $17.9 million, fueling investor confidence in its potential to reach $5 by 2025. As both coins surge, Shiba Inu is also vying for a spot in the race, with analysts debating whether it can keep up. Will Dogecoin and Shiba Inu maintain their momentum, or will Lightchain AI take the lead? Let’s take a closer look. Read more: Lightchain AI’s crypto presale breaks $17.9m, ready to propel the bull run with XRP and ADA Dogecoin’s journey to $4 and Shiba Inu’s fight to stay relevant Dogecoin (DOGE) has known tumultuous times, while various predictions regarding its reaching of the price of $4 have been given. Some experts suggest that should DOGE stick to the premier support zones and benefit from good market conditions then it might reach this target. However, the rise in price would be a kind of an obviously-no-market that would beat Ethereum with the market capitalization maybe surpassing that of the other which, as a result, spawns (sic) many concerns about its sustainability. ​ Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) was unleashed into the cryptocurrency realm as a memecoin, the project has been striving its hardest to become the most well-known cryptocurrency on the market. The project has extended its ecosystem to include peer-to-peer finance (DeFi) platforms like ShibaSwap and is developing Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain focused on speeding up and the reduction of resource consumption. With the token burn mechanism, SHIB hopes to get the numbers down, thus increasing the value of the currency. Despite these efforts, SHIB finds itself in a difficult place, as it is still a memecoin and is sometimes dismissed as it does not serve a practical purpose. For Both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, the fate of their future lies solely with their ability to come up with ideas and implement them so that they can provide real benefits to community members. Lightchain AI: Merging blockchain and AI for real-world impact Unlike memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Lightchain AI is designed for practical use cases. Its unique zero-latency AI transaction engine allows for rapid execution of AI processes directly on the blockchain, making it an ideal platform for developers building decentralized applications (dApps) that demand high-speed performance. What sets Lightchain AI apart is its unique self-regulating tokenomics system, which maintains a balance between token supply and demand to support long-term value growth. By using deflationary strategies, such as burning tokens collected from transaction fees, it gradually reduces supply to help drive price increases over time. The platform’s AI-powered cross-chain compatibility further enhances its utility by enabling seamless interaction with multiple blockchain networks. This interoperability expands its ecosystem and encourages collaborative development, positioning Lightchain AI as a frontrunner in the next era of blockchain advancements. Lightchain AI: Leading the next crypto movement Forget the hype-fueled rise of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu — Lightchain AI is here to change the game. While memecoins rely on buzz and community momentum, Lightchain AI is built for the future, combining cutting-edge technology with real-world utility. With its zero-latency AI transaction engine, self-regulating tokenomics, and AI-powered cross-chain compatibility, Lightchain AI isn’t just another crypto — it’s a game-changing platform setting a new standard. For investors looking for more than fleeting trends, Lightchain AI seems to be a top pick for 2025.

The United States accounts for over 40% of the Bitcoin network’s global hashrate but still leans heavily on China-made mining rigs. China-based Bitmain reportedly holds as much as a 90% market share in the Bitcoin mining manufacturing market. “Trump’s continued focus to support the US BTC mining industry highlights the urgent need to address US reliance on foreign technology,” Auradine’s chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta, told Cointelegraph in a recent interview. US Bitcoin firms hit a major supply problem last year, with thousands of Bitcoin ( BTC ) miners held at ports of entry by the US Customs and Border Protection . One of the firms affected believed it was due to a mistaken belief that the chips were illegally imported Chinese radio frequency devices. It took months before they started being released. Gupta said that US-China trade tensions have also disrupted the flow of foreign Bitcoin miners. “These trade tensions have increased supply chain disruptions with many hardware shipments facing delays and uncertainties,” Gupta said. The US was already competing with China to win the high-end chip manufacturing market, but the recent trade tensions have only “intensified” these challenges for US-based crypto miners, he added. China-based Bitmain is said to hold the majority of the Bitcoin mining manufacturing market. It expanded its production line into the US last December to improve supply chain efficiency. Gupta said his firm could also stand well-positioned amid Trump’s plan to ramp up onshore manufacturing as a “dramatic increase in demand” for electricity would, in turn, “put a tremendous deal of pressure on the electric grid” — making it more important for Bitcoin miners to operate off-grid. Auradine recently announced the launch of its new Teraflux AH3880 hydro-cooled Bitcoin miner, competing with the likes of Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan. Related: Bitcoin mining hashprice stays flat despite higher difficulty: Report Asked whether a further uptick in Bitcoin mining activity in the US could hurt Bitcoin decentralization, Gupta said that securing the Bitcoin network with more energy-efficient solutions in the US would be a “net positive” for Bitcoin but said there could be risks if the increase outpaces technology in sustainability and decentralization. Over 95% of the network’s hash power already comes from the US and China alone, according to the Hashrate Index.

This milestone, announced on Tuesday, makes USDC the first global dollar-backed stablecoin authorized under Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) framework. A strategic partnership with SBI Holdings supports circle’s entry into the Japanese market. According to the announcement, SBI VC Trade, an SBI Holdings subsidiary, will officially launch USDC on March 26 as part of this initiative. Major Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance Japan, Bitbank, and BitFlyer, are also preparing to list USDC in the near future. That said, the approval represents a major step in Japan’s efforts to regulate and integrate stablecoins into its financial ecosystem. With increasing adoption of Web3 and blockchain technology, Japan has established clear regulatory guidelines, positioning itself as a leader in digital asset governance. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, emphasized Japan’s progressive approach, stating, “ We are honored to bring USDC to businesses and consumers in this market. With the strong support of SBI Holdings and leading exchanges, USDC is set to be a secure and transparent digital dollar for Japan’s evolving digital economy.” Elsewhere, Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO of SBI Holdings, called the partnership a milestone, stating, “ This initiative enhances digital asset accessibility and promotes financial innovation, aligning with our vision for the future of payments and blockchain-based finance in Japan.” Notably, Circle has been working for over two years to secure approval for its stablecoin operations in Japan. In July 2023, Allaire revealed that Circle was planning to introduce USDC in the country. At the time, he highlighted Japan’s evolving regulatory framework for stablecoins and expressed confidence that the nation could become a key market for cross-border crypto transactions. Under a legislation passed in June 2022, stablecoins in Japan must be backed by the yen or another legal currency and provide holders with the right to redeem them at face value. Meanwhile, the approval in Japan follows a series of strategic regulatory moves by Circle. In July 2024, the company became the first global stablecoin issuer to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. Furthermore, in January 2024, Circle filed a draft registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a potential initial public offering (IPO), signaling its intention to further establish itself as a leader in the stablecoin industry. Additionally, in December 2024, Circle partnered with Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, to increase the adoption and availability of USDC across Binance’s ecosystem, underscoring the company’s proactive approach to global regulatory compliance and stablecoin market expansion.",Cryptocurrency|News|Circle|USDC,EN,0,0,ASIA|USDC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-25 14:00:37

Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act passed the State House of Representatives with a 77-15 vote and now moves to the Senate. A separate Oklahoma bill aims to allow residents to receive salaries in Bitcoin. Arizona is also pushing forward with two bills — one creating a digital asset reserve from confiscated cryptocurrencies and another permitting up to 10% of state treasury funds to be allocated to Bitcoin. Both bills cleared the House Rules Committee on March 24 and are headed for a full House vote. Bitcoin Laws, a group tracking digital asset legislation, notes that Oklahoma is now tied with Texas in the “State Bitcoin Reserve Race,” while Missouri is also reviewing a Bitcoin reserve proposal.

The solution tokenizes and fractionalizes the account receivables of accredited buyers to create smaller and supplier-specific representations. Vancouver-based Pelago Labs claimed that its integration with Stellar was aimed at developing a crypto-enabled supply chain financing platform that unlocked pre-settlement liquidity for suppliers. The solution empowers suppliers to secure the working capital they need, backed by the buyer’s credit, to improve cash flow efficiency. According to Pelago Labs, suppliers can settle funds accessed through the platform in USDC on Stellar through PolyFlow’s liquidity-pool-based payment channel. The funds can alternatively be settled through off-ramps to local currencies via authorized providers. Pelago’s supply chain financing platform also integrates an on-chain KYC system built by PolyFlow and an enterprise-grade wallet. Pelago streamlines supply chain financing through Stellar integration The Pelago Labs team published a press release on Tuesday revealing that Pelago now leverages Stellar’s smart contract platform to build its supply chain financing platform. These digital certificates empower suppliers to secure the working capital they need, backed by the buyer’s credit, to ensure seamless order fulfillment—even for suppliers without direct contact with the end buyer. Denelle Dixon, CEO & Executive Director of the Stellar Development Foundation, said “the power of blockchain technology to transform the future of finance was on full display with Pelago’s crypto-enabled supply chain financing platform.” She added that giving small and medium-sized enterprises access to credit and liquidity on-chain unlocked economic opportunities that drove adoption. The Pelago team explained that suppliers could now settle funds accessed through the platform in USDC on Stellar via PolyFlow’s liquidity-pool-based payment channel. “This innovative solution demonstrates the practical utility of the Stellar network and USDC in facilitating real-world working capital lending…to enable SMEs to access decentralized financial solutions that eliminate liquidity constraints and streamline their access to working capital.” ~ Raymond Qu, co-founder of PolyFlow Raymond Qu added that smart contracts on Stellar enabled efficient scaling and the ability to handle complex business models. These attributes made smart contracts on Stellar a tool for building Pelago’s supply chain financing solution. Creditor deploys a $1M+ USDC credit facility on Pelago SCF Last month, two Pelago Supply Chain Finance Platform suppliers successfully secured a $1,000,000 USDC on-chain loan from creditor Trusta Labs on the Stellar network, powered by PolyFlow’s PayFi protocol. The Pelago team acknowledged that Pelago SCF directly helped two suppliers overcome cash flow issues by providing access to working capital. These suppliers leveraged on-chain credit to secure funding ahead of buyer payments, thus ensuring operations did not stop and financial flows were stable. The Pelago Labs team also disclosed that it is committed to transforming supply chain finance by offering crypto-backed lending to real-world businesses. Through Pelago SCF, creditors can deploy digital assets to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) while suppliers gain access to funding without traditional banking barriers. The Pelago Labs team also mentioned that the Pelago SCF platform on Stellar provides suppliers with equal access to global financial systems at a lower cost. The Stellar network permits trading in digital assets while integrating with the traditional economy. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Rexas Finance (RXS) is emerging as one of the most promising altcoins and can deliver the same returns as Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. Rexas claims to have built a solid foundation in DeFi, tokenization and asset ownership. As the final stage of its presale nears completion, speculation is mounting on whether RXS can deliver an astronomical 21,175% surge by early 2026. With a $0.20 presale price and a $0.25 launch price, the upside potential is massive for those who enter early. But what makes RXS a standout investment? Let’s examine its presale success, tokenization model, ecosystem expansion, and market positioning. Presale Success and Early Demand Signal Major Upside The foundation of any explosive crypto rally often begins with a strong presale, and Rexas Finance has excelled in this regard. As of now, over 91% of tokens have been sold in the final presale stage, raising more than $47 million out of the $56 million hard cap. Such overwhelming investor participation signals confidence in RXS’s long-term potential. Historically, projects with highly successful presales tend to perform exceptionally post-launch. Take Solana (SOL), which was available for mere cents before skyrocketing to $260+ at its peak, or early Ethereum investors who saw gains exceeding 10,000%. Given the structured approach of Rexas Finance, the strong community backing, and the rapidly growing demand, the price trajectory for RXS post-launch could follow a similar path. Additionally, early adopters have extra incentives through staking rewards and governance privileges, reinforcing long-term holding strategies over short-term trading. The ability to earn passive income while waiting for price appreciation makes RXS an even more attractive investment option. Revolutionizing Asset Tokenization for Long-Term Growth What separates Rexas Finance from mainstream cryptos like Shiba Inu or meme coins is its real-world asset tokenization model. With Rexas Token Builder, users can tokenize various physical assets, including real estate, commodities, and even intellectual properties, proving that blockchain investments can indeed hold value. Rexas claims that tokenization is a revolutionary technique in finance simply because it allows illiquid assets to have fractioned ownership and liquidity. Now, instead of needing millions of dollars to invest in high-value real estate, RXS tokens enable the ownership of blockchain-backed portions of properties, turning once-inaccessible investments into opportunities for all. This concept is already gaining traction in institutional finance, and Rexas Finance is positioned at the forefront of this shift. A major reason why RXS could experience a 21,175% surge lies in the potential for mass adoption of tokenized assets. If institutional investors, real estate developers, or even art collectors begin utilizing Rexas Finance for fractionalized ownership, demand for RXS tokens will surge exponentially. A Thriving DeFi and dApp Ecosystem to Drive Utility While many tokens rely solely on speculation, Rexas Finance is building an entire ecosystem around RXS utility. The Rexas DeFi platform allows its users to easily trade assets, perform multi-chain swaps, and stake, thereby allowing investors to interact more readily with their investments. Also, its dApp ecosystem of Rexas Launchpad and Rexas Treasury cultivates a self-sustaining blockchain system. The demand for decentralized applications (dApps) is on the rise, and blockchain projects that integrate DeFi solutions effectively tend to have long-term successful growth. Ethereum’s hype in the dApp market maintained its growth, and Solana’s speed allowed it to try out as an alternative blockchain. With Rexas Finance providing a multi-chain compatible infrastructure, it could attract significant attention from developers looking for scalable solutions. Moreover, the more projects launched on Rexas Launchpad, the greater the demand for RXS tokens, hence further increasing adoption and price. Growth powered by an economy fosters sustainable long-term value, and RXS is positioning itself beyond just a speculative investment—it’s an infrastructure for finance powered by blockchain technology. RXS Price Potential: Can It Really 21,175x? Price predictions in the crypto space are speculative, but historical trends indicate that well-structured projects with strong presales, real-world use cases, and thriving ecosystems can generate massive returns. If we compare RXS to previous high-growth assets: Ethereum surged from under $1 to over $4,800 Solana rocketed from $0.50 to $260+ BNB started at just a few cents and reached over $600 If Rexas Finance follows a similar trajectory, an initial $0.20 investment could skyrocket to double-digit dollar levels within a few years. A 21,175% increase from $0.20 would put RXS at around $42.35, a level that may seem ambitious today but is within reach given the tokenization boom and DeFi expansion. Additionally, market cycles play a crucial role in crypto growth, and if RXS rides the next bull run with mainstream adoption, exchange listings, and institutional backing, such exponential gains are possible. Conclusion Rexas Finance is shaping up to be one of the most promising blockchain projects heading into 2025 and beyond. With its highly successful presale, innovative tokenization model, strong DeFi ecosystem, and strategic roadmap, RXS has the potential to be a top-performing altcoin. While predicting a 21,175% increase may seem bold, history has shown that well-positioned cryptos can defy expectations. Early adopters of Ethereum, Solana, and BNB saw life-changing gains, and Rexas Finance offers a similar opportunity for forward-thinking investors. With a $0.20 presale price and a structured approach to long-term growth, those investing in RXS today could look at transformative returns in the coming years. The question is—will you be among the early believers who capitalize on this emerging blockchain revolution?

Analysis Firm Announces Expectations, Points to June!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-trumps-signal-be-enough-to-drive-bitcoin-higher-analysis-firm-announces-expectations-points-to-june/,"While there has been a slight recovery in Bitcoin and altcoins in recent days, it remains unclear whether this is a relief rally or a sustainable recovery. At this point, analysis company QCP Capital, which shared its current analysis, wrote that the market is neutral. QCP Capital said in its latest analysis that the US stock sell-off that has negatively impacted Bitcoin and the crypto market may be over, and April was a historically strong month for risky assets like BTC. Analysts at JPMorgan and a growing number of strategists are telling clients that one of the steepest declines in recent memory for U.S. stocks may be over. According to analysts JP Morgan and strategists, the combination of improved market sentiment and historically positive seasonal factors is a bullish signal for risky assets like Bitcoin. Analysts said that the key factor in BTC’s surge above $88,000 was US President Donald Trump’s signaling of possible tariff flexibility, but options markets remain cautious ahead of major macro events such as the upcoming PCE data. Analysts stated that PCE and option data could be the next important catalyst for BTC and the crypto market, and that the upward trend could emerge from June. “The second quarter, and April in particular, has historically been one of the best periods for risk assets, second only to the festive December rally.” Risk assets had one of their strongest trading days of the year as fears around the April 2 tariff deadline temporarily eased. Trump signaled on Monday that he could provide exemptions or reductions, which helped calm market jitters. BTC briefly rose above $88,000. While the second quarter is typically one of the strongest periods for risk assets, the options market remains cautious and the bullish trend is not expected to become evident until June, according to options data. “Investors are focused on this week's three-month option expiration and upcoming PCE inflation data, which could be the next major catalyst.” *This is not investment advice.

XRP nears resistance after strong six-month growth XRP is trading between $1.97 and $2.55. Over the past week, its price increased by 11.31%, indicating strong short-term momentum. This rise contrasts with the past month’s decline of 6.32%, showing recent recovery. Over six months, XRP’s price surged by 326.07%. This significant growth highlights its long-term potential. The nearest resistance level is at $2.80. Breaking above this point could lead to further price increases. The nearest support is at $1.65, offering a safety net if the price dips. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 59.10. This suggests the coin is approaching overbought conditions but still has room for growth. Given the recent weekly increase and impressive six-month performance, XRP may continue to rise. It could soon test the $2.80 resistance level, potentially leading to new highs. Solana rebounds but faces key resistance ahead Solana (SOL) is currently trading between $113.46 and $145.80. In the past week, its price has increased by 6.10%, indicating a potential upward trend. However, over the past month, SOL has dropped by 24.34%, and over six months, it has decreased by 8.41%. The recent weekly gain suggests that buyers are returning to the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 61.69, which is above the neutral 50 level, hinting at bullish momentum. If this trend continues, Solana could challenge the nearest resistance at $149. Breaking through the $149 resistance could open the path for further gains. Reaching this level would require an increase of around 9% from the current upper trading range of $137.80. Traders will be watching closely to see if SOL can sustain this momentum. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $100.76. If the price reverses, a drop to this support would mean a decrease of approximately 11% from the current lower trading range of $113.46. Considering the past month’s significant decline, investors are cautious but hopeful for a continued recovery. Conclusion While XRP and Solana have shown impressive gains, their short-term potential seems limited. Analysts suggest that these established coins may not match the rapid growth expected from newer projects in the current bull run.

42326181,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/tax-season-vs-tax-year,1742915400,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Tax season vs tax year: What’s the difference?,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/tax-season-vs-tax-year?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"What is the tax year? When filing taxes, understanding the tax season and year is crucial for staying compliant and avoiding penalties. A tax year is the 12-month period in which your income, deductions and credits are recorded for tax purposes . This period is essential because it defines the timeframe for calculating all your earnings and tax liabilities. In many countries, the tax year aligns with the calendar year, which runs from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, but this is not always the case. Some countries and businesses may follow a fiscal year, starting and ending on different dates. The tax year runs from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 in the United States. Any income you earn within that period is reported in the following year’s tax return. For instance, if you earned income between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2024, you would report that income in your 2025 tax return. While the calendar year is common, some businesses and countries use a fiscal year. For example, in the UK, the tax year for individuals runs from April 6 to April 5 of the following year. Similarly, many companies might follow a fiscal year, such as April 1 to March 31. Why tax year matters Tax year matters because of: Record-keeping: For accurate tax reporting, keeping track of your earnings, deductions and credits within the defined tax year is crucial. This ensures that you report the correct amount of income and claim eligible deductions or credits. Consistency in accounting: Whether for personal finance or business accounting, using a defined tax year helps maintain consistency in reporting and ensures that all financial transactions are aligned with the same period, simplifying financial analysis and tax compliance. What is the tax season? A tax season is the official window during which individuals and businesses file their tax returns for the previous tax year. This filing period can last a few months and is dictated by local tax authorities. In the US, tax season typically begins in late January and ends on or around April 15 (unless extensions or special rules apply). For example, if you earned income in 2024, you would file your tax return during the 2025 tax season, between late January and April 15, 2025. If you miss this deadline, you may be subject to penalties or interest charges unless you file for an extension. Why tax season matters Tax season is important because of: Compliance deadlines: Filing your tax return within the designated season is crucial to avoid penalties or interest charges. Tax authorities often impose fines for late submissions, and the longer you delay, the more costly the penalties can become. Paperwork and preparation: Tax season is also a time for taxpayers to gather necessary documents such as W-2 forms, 1099s and other income or deduction records. This period allows individuals and businesses to finalize their deductions, review tax laws and ensure all paperwork is ready for filing their returns. Proper preparation during tax season can help maximize deductions and minimize taxes owed. In the United States, the W-2 form is issued by employers to report an employee’s wages and the taxes withheld during the year, which is essential for completing individual tax returns. On the other hand, the 1099 form is used to report various types of income other than wages, such as income from freelance work or interest earned. The 1099 is typically provided by clients or financial institutions, and both forms are crucial for accurately filing taxes during tax season. Employers and payers must send these forms to employees and contractors by Jan. 31 each year. Key differences at a glance: Did you know? Some businesses and individuals may choose a fiscal year that doesn’t align with the calendar year. For example, a fiscal year could run from July 1 to June 30. Major countries’ tax years and filing windows Some countries follow the calendar year (e.g., the US, Canada, Singapore). Others use fiscal years or different periods (e.g., the UK, India, Australia, Switzerland), with varying filing deadlines and extensions based on local regulations. Different countries have varied start and end dates for both the tax year and tax season. Below is an overview of selected countries: Always verify deadlines with official government websites, as dates can change due to policy updates or extraordinary circumstances. Did you know? The IRS finalized regulations requiring brokers to report gross proceeds from digital asset sales starting in 2025 using Form 1099-DA. Crypto tax year and filing deadlines: What you need to know For cryptocurrency, the tax year and filing deadlines are often treated similarly to traditional assets. Still, the specifics can vary depending on the country and how cryptocurrency is classified (e.g., capital gains, income). Generally, the tax year for crypto follows the same period as traditional assets (e.g., Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 in the US and Canada) but with certain exceptions for crypto-specific rules, such as: Key considerations for crypto taxation Tax year: Most countries align the crypto tax year with the calendar year, so if you trade or hold cryptocurrencies, your transactions from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 are typically reported in your tax filings for the following year. Tax season and deadlines: Crypto-related tax filings are generally made during the same tax season as traditional assets. However, the complexity of crypto transactions (e.g., trading, staking, mining) may require additional reporting and documentation. For example: United States: Cryptocurrency gains are reported as part of your 2024 tax return (filed by April 15, 2025). United Kingdom: Crypto must be reported under the self-assessment system by Jan. 31 after the end of the tax year (April 6 - April 5). Special considerations: Different crypto transactions (like trading , staking or mining) may need to be reported separately, and some countries may have specific guidelines for capital gains, income from mining, or airdrops that must be disclosed in the tax filing. Additionally, cryptocurrency exchanges may send users tax documents like 1099-Ks or 1099-Bs in the US, similar to traditional financial assets. Crypto tax reporting Many countries are still updating their regulations to address the complexities of cryptocurrency taxation, so it’s essential to stay updated on national tax authority guidelines and any changes in cryptocurrency regulations. The table below provides a snapshot of the reporting requirements for crypto in the listed countries, focusing on how taxes are applied based on the type of crypto-related activity (capital gains vs. income). Also, please note that not all crypto transactions are taxable events. For example, transferring cryptocurrency between wallets or accounts you control is generally considered a non-taxable event, as it does not involve a change in ownership or a realization of gains. However, this can vary significantly from country to country. In some jurisdictions, even wallet-to-wallet transfers might require reporting if the transferred amount later influences the calculation of gains when a taxable event occurs. It is essential to consult local tax guidelines or a professional adviser to determine which transactions are exempt from taxation in your region Common mistakes to avoid while reporting crypto taxes Avoiding crypto tax mistakes requires meticulous record-keeping, accurate classification of gains and income and staying updated on tax regulations. Here are the common mistakes to avoid while reporting crypto taxes: Failing to report all transactions: Many taxpayers neglect to report every transaction, including small trades, staking rewards or airdrops, leading to discrepancies and potential audits. Confusing capital gains with income: Mixing up capital gains and income from crypto activities (like mining or staking ) can result in incorrect tax reporting. Crypto earned through mining or staking may be considered income, not capital gains. Not keeping proper records: Failing to maintain a detailed record of crypto transactions (dates, amounts, exchanges used) can make it difficult to accurately calculate gains or losses, especially if trading on multiple platforms. Ignoring hard forks and airdrops: Some taxpayers overlook income from hard forks and airdrops. These are considered taxable income at the fair market value when received and must be reported. Not using the correct valuation method: Incorrectly calculating the value of crypto at the time of the transaction, especially during volatile periods, can lead to inaccurate tax filings. Underestimating foreign crypto income reporting: If you trade on foreign exchanges, you may need to report foreign accounts and income, failing which could lead to penalties under international tax reporting laws. Forgetting to report crypto-to-crypto transactions: Swapping one cryptocurrency for another is a taxable event in many countries, and failing to report these trades can lead to errors in your tax filings. Not considering taxation for DeFi gains: DeFi income from liquidity provision, yield farming , or staking can be complicated. Many taxpayers mistakenly assume these are not taxable, which leads to issues down the line. Countries with low or no crypto taxes (as of March 2025) Countries like Portugal, Singapore, Germany, Switzerland, and the UAE offer attractive, low or zero crypto tax environments for investors. As of March 2025, several jurisdictions continue to attract crypto investors with their favorable tax environments: Portugal: Renowned for its crypto-friendly policies , Portugal still exempts individual crypto capital gains for non-professional traders, making it a top destination for those looking to minimize tax liabilities on digital asset investments. Singapore: With no capital gains tax, Singapore remains an attractive hub for crypto investors. While personal trading benefits from this favorable policy, businesses engaged in crypto-related activities must adhere to standard corporate tax rules. Germany: Crypto held by private investors for more than one year is tax-free in Germany. This rule encourages long-term holding, providing significant tax advantages for investors willing to commit to extended periods. Switzerland: Switzerland’s tax system offers leniency for private crypto investors, as capital gains on personal investments are typically tax-free. However, income from crypto activities may be subject to taxation, and the specific treatment can vary by canton. United Arab Emirates (UAE): The UAE has emerged as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction by offering zero capital gains tax on crypto investments for individuals, attracting global crypto investors seeking a tax-efficient environment. These countries exemplify some of the most attractive tax regimes for crypto investors as of 2025, though regulations continue to evolve, so it’s essential for investors to stay updated on local guidelines.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|FORKS,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-25 15:10:00

Major Price Surge Could Be Next!,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-doge-set-for-a-breakout-major-price-surge-could-be-next/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to capture market attention, currently valued at $0.1914. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency has surged 4.7% in the past 24 hours and gained 15.9% over the last week, indicating strong bullish sentiment. As DOGE hovers near a key resistance level, traders are eager to see whether the momentum will push prices higher or trigger a correction. DOGE Price Performance Across Different Timeframes: 4-Hour Chart Insights DOGE has followed a clear upward trend, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows—a strong indicator of bullish control. The price is inching closer to the $0.194 resistance level, a crucial point that could determine its next major move . If buying pressure remains strong, a breakout could propel DOGE further upward. 1-Hour Chart Observations On the 1-hour chart, DOGE is consolidating near $0.189, a sign that traders are accumulating before a potential breakout. Such sideways movement often signals an impending sharp price move, either upward toward resistance or downward if momentum weakens. 15-Minute Chart Behavior The 15-minute timeframe highlights increased market activity, with DOGE fluctuating between $0.187 and $0.190. This short-term volatility suggests that both buyers and sellers are actively engaged, battling for control. If DOGE holds above $0.188, it could reinforce bullish strength.

If DOGE breaks above $0.194, it could gain momentum toward $0.203, with the possibility of reaching $0.217 in a continued rally. However, if resistance holds firm, a retracement toward $0.172 is likely, where buyers may re-enter the market. Traders should closely monitor Bitcoin’s (BTC) movement, trading volume, and overall market sentiment, as these factors will heavily influence DOGE’s next move. A decisive breakout or rejection at key levels will determine the cryptocurrency’s short-term trajectory. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

They Will Compete for Prizes Worth More Than 60,000 Euros. At Money Motion, 20 teams will present their innovative solutions on March 27 th and 28 th. FinTech has experienced turbulent changes in recent years, but one thing is certain – innovation has never been more necessary. According to a KPMG report, investments in FinTech globally have fallen to $95.6 billion, the lowest level in the past seven years. Nevertheless, Europe remains a strong FinTech hub with more than 350 unicorns, and major companies like Revolut and Klarna are announcing public offerings, signaling a return of optimism. Money Motion , the largest FinTech conference in the region, taking place on March 27 and 28 at the Zagreb Fair, is sponsored by leading regional industry brands – Mastercard, Monri, ASEE, OTP Bank, A1 Croatia, Croatia Insurance, and LAQO. The event will gather more than 2,000 participants from all continents and feature a hundred speakers on four stages. Leading global experts in finance, technology, and cryptocurrencies will share their knowledge and experiences, while the startup stage will host one of the most exciting competitions of the year – the Money Motion Startup Pitch . Young entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to present their ideas before investors and partners ready to support the next big thing in FinTech. As many as 20 teams are bringing solutions that can shape the future of financial services – from the digital transformation of banking and data security to DeFisolutions and AI automation. The top three will share the most valuable prizes yet – checks totalling €10,000, $20,000 in credits on platform X provided by Aleph, a €5,000 small booth at the next Money Motion, a $20,000 ‘Talk the Walk’ award from Infobip, six months of free coworking space at the House of Blockchain in Zagreb, and an exclusive spot at the Fundraising Bootcamp in London worth €10,000. We present the stories, visions, and innovations of the competitors below. Neno Rakić from the HAMAG-BICRO agency on the Money Motion Startup stage last year Small and medium-sized enterprises are the key to economic stability and growth in both Croatia and Europe. A1 Croatia has been aware of this for years, developing solutions for its business users to facilitate digitalization, optimization, and the development of new products and services in the digital age. “We are aware that technology plays a key role in business optimization, increasing productivity, and ensuring a competitive advantage. Our goal is to be their reliable digital partner, providing them with advanced ICT solutions through an as-a-service model – from cloud services, security solutions, and data center services to business connectivity solutions,” said Daniel Šimić, Director of Business Customers at A1 Croatia. Daniel Šimić , Chief Director for Business Customers, A1 Croatia To enable entrepreneurs to operate smoothly, they continue to invest in developing a gigabit network and expanding 5G infrastructure. Their network already ensures top-tier connectivity across Croatia, and they have recently added Starlink to their portfolio, providing stable internet even in locations where there was previously no signal. This has been particularly helpful for business users in rural and remote areas – from agricultural holdings and tourist facilities to construction and transport companies. “The SME segment has growing needs for flexible and secure digital services, and at A1 Croatia, we continuously develop innovative solutions to facilitate their daily business operations. Digital transformation is not a luxury, but a necessity, and our task is to provide small and medium-sized enterprises with the tools they need to grow and adapt to a dynamic market. With strong telecommunications infrastructure and tailored digital solutions, we continue to support the development of the SME segment and strengthen the local and regional economy,” added Šimić. Josip Majher , Member of the Management Board of HPB Hrvatska poštanska banka (HPB), one of the five largest commercial banks in the country, proudly supports the StartupStage, emphasizing the ambition for continuous progress and top results. In line with this, HPB, ZICER, and EFZG have recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding initiating collaboration to develop the FinTech community in the country. This aims to encourage innovation in the financial sector, connect the academic community with financial institutions and entrepreneurs, and support the development of startups through the ZICER Acceleration Program – StartupFactory. “As a key financial partner, HPB will provide startups with access to financial services and pilot projects and participate in FinTech regulation development with the Ministry of Finance. The Bank’s goal is to strengthen the FinTech industry and implement domestic FinTech solutions to improve business operations, positioning HPB as a desirable employer for IT professionals. HPB is dedicated to innovations that enhance financial services and the customer experience, reinforcing its role in FinTech development through digital transformation and community collaboration,” said Josip Majher, a member of HPB’s Management Board. For the third consecutive year, the Money Motion StartupPitch competition will be supported by the Croatian Agency for SMEs, Innovations, and Investments (HAMAG-BICRO). “As the most important government agency dedicated to creating a financial ecosystem that supports the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, we especially focus on entrepreneurs with ideas and innovations to facilitate their market entry. Entrepreneurs in the development phase of their services or products often lack access to financing, so HAMAG-BICRO offers targeted programs. Besides financing, HAMAG-BICRO provides expert mentoring and support to entrepreneurs, increasing their chances of successfully entering the market. We support conferences like Money Motion, especially the startup competition, which we have sponsored for the third consecutive year,” said VjeranVrbanec, President of the Management Board of HAMAG-BICRO. Winners Will Be Chosen by an Expert Jury of Six Investors and Industry Professionals The thrilling competition will take place on the first day of the conference on the Startup Stage, and the winners will be announced at the end of the second day before the final ceremony.

CONY uses a synthetic covered call strategy, generating income through call options on COIN, but doesn't directly invest in Coinbase shares. CONY's performance is significantly lower than COIN's, with a 0.39 correlation during bull runs, making it less suitable for capital protection. Suitable for income-focused investors and volatility harvesters, but not for long-term holders or those seeking capital protection due to high risks and market uncertainties. YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) is an ETF that provides exposure to COIN by offering an extraordinary dividend yield. I consider it too risky with its annual expected return of -16% with its value loss of up to 70% YoY. In this article, I will inform investors who are looking at CONY for the first time about the ETF and explain in detail why I hold a “hold” position. With approximately $945 million in assets under management as of March 2025, CONY has an expense ratio of 1.22% , which is relatively high compared to traditional income ETFs. While this expense ratio is high compared to traditional ETFs, it is very similar to specialized options strategy products. CONY’s investment objective is to generate monthly income on COIN while allowing limited participation in COIN’s price increase. Unlike traditional covered call ETFs, CONY uses a three-piece “synthetic covered call” strategy. CONY doesn't directly purchase Coinbase shares, but instead it creates synthetic positions with call options from 6 months to 1 year. It then sells out-of-the-money call options (usually 5-15% above the COIN price) to generate monthly income through premium collection. US Treasury bonds in the fund also act as collateral for the option positions. So I must say that this is not the right fund for investors looking for a fund that invests directly in COIN. Competitive Landscape Analysis When I look at assets, CONY is YieldMax’s third-largest ETF. YieldMax has 44 single-stock option income ETFs like CONY right now. These 44 ETFs have $9.18 billion in total assets, they have an average expense ratio of 1.17% and an average dividend yield of 56.11%. So it's obvious that CONY is slightly above average in terms of expense ratio, but it is among YieldMax’s highest dividend yielding ETFs. Compared to traditional covered call ETFs like JEPI, JEPQ, QYLD or XYLD, CONY’s dividend yield is outstanding, but I must say that there is also excessive volatility and concentration risk. Yes, traditional ETFs can underperform during bull periods, but they perform much better during corrections too. That's why, in my opinion, this makes CONY a riskier investment than traditional ETF's, especially during sideways and down markets. Performance and COIN Relation CONY 99% correlated with COIN since its launch in August 2023. However, primarily for the purpose of generating income, the fund’s ability to sell call options limits its upside potential during strong bull markets. When you factor in a relatively high expense ratio and a dividend yield of up to 208% the stock inevitably fails to perform as strongly as COIN. Data by YCharts I want to elaborate on this issue by looking at the price movements since August 2023. In December 2024, when COIN reached its peak return of 333%, it is seen that CONY had a return of -6.91% which is very close to the time it was launched but on the negative side. When I look at the most recent prices, CONY has lost 56.84% of its value since its launch while COIN seems to have gained 139.78%. So I have to say that COIN is a much more advantageous investment than CONY for investors who are not looking for dividend yield. So what should an investor considering CONY for dividend investment expect? COIN’s business model performance is also strongly correlated with cryptocurrency market trends, especially BTC-USD. Cryptocurrency exchanges like COIN make significant profits from increased transaction fees, especially during periods of new user participation. When I look at new address data, I can see that new user participation periods usually peak during bull movements. Number of New Addresses of Bitcoin (glassnode.com) That's why to see if CONY is a fund that both protects capital and brings good dividends for income focused investors, I will first analyze the impact of BTC-USD on COIN. Then I will analyze how this correlation can be reflected in CONY in the coming period and whether this will be enough to protect the price of CONY. tradingview.com (tradingview.com) Since CONY was launched, BTC-USD did 3 bull runs. The first run occurred in November 2023 and BTC-USD increased by 20.19%. This increase flared up expectations for a new bull season. During this process, COIN's revenue grew YoY for the first time since 2021 and these developments increased its share price by 139.51%. CONY also increased by 50.55% during this run. So, mathematically, COIN's return was 6.91 times higher than BTC-USD as the bull season hype attracted new investors to the market. During this process, CONY's rise was limited to only 0.36 times of COIN. In the February 2024 run, BTC-USD increased by 62.24% and this increase was reflected in COIN as 116.91%. Since the market had already priced for the bull market sentiment, COIN's return was only 1.88 times higher than BTC-USD. During this period, CONY also increased by 43.04% and CONY's return, like the previous run, remained limited to 0.37 times COIN. After this run, COIN was calm for almost 6 months. BTC-USD's last reaction came in October 2024. With this reaction, BTC-USD increased by 64.13% and this increase was reflected in COIN as 108.24%. So COIN's return was only 1.69 times more than BTC-USD in this run and likewise, CONY's return remained limited to 0.44 times COIN. Nov 2023 Run Feb 2024 Run Oct 2024 Run CONY 50.55% 43.04% 47.32% COIN 139.51% 116.91% 108.24% BTC 20.19% 62.24% 64.13% COIN/BTC 6.91 1.88 1.69 COIN/CONY 0.36 0.37 0.44 The conclusion I want to make here is that except for extraordinary circumstances like when sentiment turns to bullish expectations after a long bear season, the correlation between Bitcoin and COIN is 1.78 during bull run periods. Regardless of sentiment, the correlation between COIN and CONY is 0.39 on average during every running period. tradingview.com (tradingview.com) Relying on the price action method, I expect COIN to continue its pullback to at least $155, which is a support that it tested as support and resistance in recent years. I expect this move to create a pressure on CONY and drop it slightly below the $8 level, which currently holding. After this level, if BTC-USD makes another bull run like before, it would take COIN to its peak of $350, which means an increase of 125.81%. tradingview.com (tradingview.com) If this scenario happens, I calculate that CONY will rise 49% with the 0.39 correlation average I mentioned in the previous calculations, which means taking $12 area again. But for CONY to hold above $12 for a longer time, this run should continue uninterrupted, which I don't think is possible. Even though there's a positive scenario, I am not sure that the current uncertainty of the market and the macroeconomic risks, especially due to various US-based political decisions, will push Bitcoin into a run in the near future. That's why I think that CONY will have a downtrend in the long term as it has right now, albeit at a low angle. But after these uncertain times are over, it will still have a chance to rise in bull markets and try to maintain certain critical levels, such as $12. Which Investors Is It Suitable For? If you are an investor looking for capital protection, I'd say that this ETF is not suitable for you based on the quantitative calculations I have stated in the previous paragraphs. I think that investors looking for capital protection should turn to ETFs such as SCHD, QQQ, VOO etc. But if the goal is to prioritize current income over capital growth, if you don't want to hold digital assets directly and hopeful about the future of COIN as a company, CONY can be a suitable ETF. But again, in this scenario, I recommend that you take into account the qualitative calculations in the previous paragraphs and understand that I don't think the general trend will be an upward trend. Although it is not a very large audience, I can say that it is an ETF suitable for volatility harvesters too. I'm talking about investors who avoid buying digital assets but want to capture the high volatility of cryptocurrency assets. Risks CONY’s synthetic closed call approach carries various risks because of its nature. Due to gamma risk, losses can accelerate during adverse price movements. And due to theta decay, it requires active management since time value erosion occurs. This means that this ETF is not suitable for investors who will buy and hold it for very long periods. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for United States (fred.stlouisfed.org) I would also like to talk about qualitative risks. I mentioned that CONY is indirectly affected by Bitcoin. There have been various pressures towards Bitcoin since the beginning of 2025. For example, President Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China have increased economic uncertainty and unexpectedly reduced risk appetite among investors. This has triggered a sell-off in high-risk assets like Bitcoin. While this selling wave creates low volume on Bitcoin, it can push investors who benefit from COIN's services away from COIN too. There is also the risk of direct competition to COIN. Platforms like Robinhood have slowly started to gain market share with lower fees and user-friendly interfaces. At the same time, the regulatory environment has become more favorable and has started to attract traditional financial institutions to the crypto space. I think these are starting to challenge COIN’s competition in the cryptocurrency space. These risks may cause CONY to fail to reach the $12 level I mentioned, and may even fall below its current price. So I think my readers should be careful. Conclusion Since I think the future of the cryptocurrency market is bright, and I know that COIN is not in a bad position in the sector, I think CONY is a suitable investment, especially for investors who are looking for cash flow, not capital protection. I don't think that BTC-USD's correction is over. Since I think that investors who don't approach risky instruments in market and macroeconomic uncertainty will keep COIN neutral, I find the ""hold"" position more logical for now.",CONY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-25 15:10:47

The platform was built using the Cosmos SDK and it easily connects to other networks, supporting smart contracts. It is also fast, handling about 10,000 transactions every second. With tools provided by the platform, developers can create and manage assets that are in line with regulatory standards. MANTRA wants to make it easy for newbies and institutions to gain access to the world of Web3. In the market of today, a blockchain that integrates security with regulation is a rare sight. The platform’s focus on regulation makes it easier for players who have been cautious about the risks of the market to enter. MANTRA also acts as an alternative when users need platforms that mix scalability and efficiency. As global governments continue to find ways to regulate the crypto sector, its approach to the market might help MANTRA. While the market has been predicted to continue to change, the unique features that MANTRA provides make it an interesting option in the market. Chainlink (LINK): Bridging Blockchain and Reality Chainlink is a decentralized network that acts as the link between smart contracts and real-world data. To simplify it, it helps platforms get information from outside their networks. This is important because blockchains are not built to source data. For instance, if they need data like weather updates or stock prices, they need a connector to source for that information. Chainlink uses a network of messengers called oracles to bring the data from external sources on the chain. To ensure that the information is correct, it uses a system that gets specific data from different sources. The token is powered by the LINK token, which ensures that users that provide reliable data are rewarded, and stakers secure the network. In the current market, the thing that sets Chainlink apart is its practical utility. As the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and smart contracts continue to grow, there is a need to ensure that external data brought on the network are accurate. Chainlink fills the gap, with its technology widely used in the market. Its token, LINK, also has a clear use case, with its position in the crypto space stronger than most tokens. With the need to integrate real-world applications and blockchain, Chainlink will remain the go-to platform. This ensures that LINK remains the best bet for investors who are looking for gains in the market. XLM: The Cryptocurrency Lighting Up Global Payments Stellar Lumens or XLM has proven to be more than just a digital asset. The token was launched in 2014 as part of the Stellar network which is an open system that ensures money transfers are fast and cheap. Unlike some digital assets built to replace traditional finance, Stellar was built to make it better. The platform ensures that users can send money across the border using any currency, with the system even supporting digital assets. The network has processed billions in transactions and partnered with firms, showcasing its value in the real world. In the market of today, XLM is important because of its approach to the market. While most coins focus on trends, Stellar focuses on solving the issue of costly payments across the border. With the technology it provides, users and businesses can move funds quickly through different currencies with ease. As the world continues to work on its connection, projects like these will be in demand. In comparison to other tokens, Stellar is looking for ways to make the existing financial structure better. Its ability to use different currencies makes it a key player in the financial sector. Conclusion While SUI, OM, LINK, and XLM are good options for traders, XYZVerse 9XYZ) stands out with its unique integration of sports and meme coin culture to drive massive growth and community success.

The market is buzzing, and a new wave of meme coins is taking over, offering massive growth potential and utility that extends beyond just being an internet joke. If you’re on the hunt for the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long-term gains , you’re in the right place. These coins aren’t just about the hype; they’ve got real staying power and serious investment potential. One standout in this new wave is BTFD Coin, which just hit Stage 15 of its presale with only one stage left before the big launch. The token price has surged from $0.00016 in Stage 14 to $0.0002 in Stage 15, and predictions suggest it could reach $0.0006 at launch and even skyrocket to $0.006. That’s a potential ROI of 200% at launch and a jaw-dropping 2900% surge if it hits the higher target. With over $6.41 million raised, 71 billion tokens sold, and a community of over 11,500 holders, this is one presale that’s closing in fast. And the best part? The legendary 100% bonus code LAUNCH100 is still up for grabs, meaning you can double your tokens at checkout before time runs out. Dive into why BTFD Coin and three other meme coins—Turbo, COQ Inu, and Brett—are among the best picks for long-term gains. 1.

STRF's structure avoids equity dilution, providing a reliable yield, unlike STRK, which includes a conversion option to common stock. Saylor's strategy leverages both STRF and STRK to maximize Bitcoin accumulation while minimizing dilution, adapting to market conditions. The plan's success hinges on Bitcoin's long-term performance, with STRF providing a safety net for yield-focused investors. Roughly two months ago, I shared a piece explaining MicroStrategy's (now rebranded as ""Strategy"" in a nod to its Bitcoin-centric identity) first preferred stock issuance ( STRK ). Given how much attention that article received and the significant interest I see from Seeking Alpha readers in all things Strategy, I think it's prime time to discuss the company’s latest financial tool to come online: its second perpetual preferred stock issuance, trading under the ticker STRF. Announced just three days ago, this new $500 million offering builds on the success of STRK and seeks to boost further the company’s relentless pursuit of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) accumulation. For context, following today's (Monday) 8-K update from Saylor and Co., MSTR holds 506,137 BTC acquired for ~$33.7 billion at ~$66,608 per bitcoin. This is 2.41% of all the BTC to ever exist. MSTR's BTC Purchases YTD (strategy.com/purchases) With STRF, Strategy aims to continue to double down on its plan of ""distilling worthless FIAT for the best asset in the world,"" as Michael Saylor famously puts it. STRF: The Yield King Steps Up So, STRF comes in with $500 million (5 million shares at a $100 par value), double the initial $250 million STRK offering (later upsized to $584 million). STRK tempted investors with an 8% dividend and a conversion hook into Class A common stock at a $1,000 strike (1/10 conversion). STRF? It’s a different beast with a fixed 10% cash dividend ($10 per share, $2.50 per quarter ), no equity upside, just pure income. Unpaid dividends compound at 1% extra per year, capping at 18%, a safety net for yield chasers. Like STRK, it’s perpetual, with no maturity date or standard call provisions, only dissolving if issuance dips below 25% of the original pool or tax laws shift dramatically. Saylor is now essentially pitching to a new class of investors: income-hungry titans like pension funds, insurers, and banks that hardly want to touch MSTR’s insanely volatile common stock but would love to earn a fat, reliable yield. STRF’s 10% trumps STRK’s 8% and the 7.55% preferred stock average. Now, is the yield rich and an expensive financing method? Sure. But there are a couple of things to take note of. Firstly, Strategy’s $100-$150 million software cash flow and $44.5 billion BTC war chest laugh at the $50 million annual tab. Not that MSTR will ever have to (or plans to) sell Bitcoin, but the balance alone is too strong to have such fears. Besides, MSTR could issue stock at a premium to NAV (current premium to NAV stands at 2.14) to pay any dividends if the preferred offerings were to extend, which would make for additional accretion on the per-share metrics of the common stock. Speaking of extending these preferred offerings, we know that this is exactly what Strategy plans on doing. Saylor has hinted multiple times in interviews and podcasts that he wants to capture small (yet still massive dollar-wise) of the multi-hundred billion preferred stock market and fixed-income market by offering highly attractive, BTC-backed products that even big institutions just can't refuse. They can't buy BTC or other exotic yield-producing BTC products, but they can certainly buy the preferred of a U.S.-listed company. And with an eye-catching 10% yield, STRF is likely to build a strong following. Now, similar to the ATM launched by Strategy on its STRK preferred, I am certain we will certainly see a similar ATM announcement in the coming days, which will allow Strategy to start printing STRF at its discretion. Here's the difference between the two preferred and how Strategy might think about it. STRK vs. STRF: The Math of Accretion To grasp STRF’s usefulness, let’s crunch the numbers against STRK. Note that there isn't a ""better option"". Both are engines of Bitcoin accretion that are essentially tuned to different frequencies. STRK’s Play: STRK’s $584 million (expanded) raise at $100 par, with an 8% dividend ($8/share), offered conversion at 1/10th of common stock (effectively a $1,000 strike against MSTR’s $335 price today). That’s a 198.5% premium. Raising $584 million meant 5.84 million preferred shares, convertible into 584,000 common shares. Annual dividends? $46.72 million. If paid in stock at $335, that’s ~139,000 shares yearly, a sliver of dilution for massive capital. STRF’s Muscle: Now, STRF’s $500 million at $100 par, with a 10% dividend ($10/share), skips conversion entirely. Its 5 million shares carry a $50 million annual payout. No equity overhang, just a fixed cost. Raising $500 million at today's $335 through common stock ATM would demand ~1.49 million shares, triple STRK’s converted equivalent. So, what's STRF’s edge? It locks in $500 million without ever touching Class A shares outstanding. But here's where it gets intresting. What is scale it up to raise, say, $2 billion through a preferred ATM, above par, say, at $125 (which is what I believe will happen as investors chase the fat yield). STRK at $125: Strategy would need to issue 16 million shares, converting to 1.6 million common shares. Dividends: $128 million/year, or ~382,000 shares at $335. Total dilution after 5 years? ~3.51 million shares. STRF at $125: 16 million shares, no conversion. Dividends: $160 million/year or ~478,000 shares at $335. Five-year dilution: ~2.39 million shares—1.12 million less than STRK, with no equity kicker to dilute further. In other words, STRF wins on simplicity and permanence, and STRK on long-term upside if MSTR catapults past $1,000. So what's Saylor’s genius? He’s wielding both like a maestro, picking the tune that sings loudest. He can tap any preferred at any time based on which one is more accretive to common holders. For example, if STRF rallies to $150 as investors chase the yield (and that is not a far-fetched scenario, significantly if rates drop notably in the next couple of years and large institutions find themselves in need of better yields), raising $500 million shrinks to 3.33 million shares, cutting dividends to $33.3 million, or a 6.67% effective yield. More capital, less cost, more Bitcoin. The Shadow of a Bitcoin Bust The most obvious risk to this whole plan is, of course, if BTC sinks long-term, say, hover to $40,000. The $44.5 billion war chest would shrink to $20 billion. Dividends would bite harder, too, as MSTR common issuances to pay dividends may not work if the premium to NAV weakens (or goes negative). Still, STRF holders, cushioned by payout compounding and an actual hard asset ensuring they get the money first over common holders if such an event ever occurs), might still sail above par. The ATM will falter, and accretion will stall, of course. But here's the thing: investing in MSTR, STRK, or STRF means you are at least somewhat bullish on BTC in the first place. The whole ""what if ""BTC falls"" argument is irrelevant here, as Strategy has essentially created financial instruments for those who, in the first place, believe in the Bitcoin network and/or are bullish in BTC. Saylor’s Masterstroke: Flexibility Meets Firepower To sum this up, what makes Strategy’s playbook a value-creation powerhouse is its adaptability. Saylor’s got a tool for every tempo. When markets dip, and yields look juicy, STRF’s 10% pulls in the ""looking-for-safety"" capital without extra dilution, allowing stacking Bitcoin at bargain prices. Then, if MSTR’s stock hovers low but investor appetite for equity upside grows, STRK’s $1,000 strike offers a premium-rich lifeline, as Saylor can pile BTC with minimal share creep. And when Bitcoin’s roaring and MSTR trades at a fat NAV premium (which we have seen to be the case even during BTC's descent), Strategy can fire up the ATM, raising billions fast to double down on the rally and pay off any liabilities in another highly accretive move. For common shareholders, MSTR remains a leveraged play that will likely translate to massive gains if BTC's price goes up.",STRK|BTC-USD|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-25 15:17:37

( WLFI ), a decentralized finance project inspired by former President Donald J. Trump, has revealed plans to launch USD1 , a new stablecoin tied to the US dollar. This digital token is designed to be redeemable 1:1 for USD and aims to appeal to both institutional investors and sovereign entities. USD1 will be backed entirely by short-term US Treasury securities, bank deposits , and other highly liquid assets. Its goal is to combine the speed and innovation of decentralized finance (DeFi) with the stability and trust offered by traditional financial systems. WLFI’s co-founder, Zach Witkoff, highlighted that USD1 aims to bridge the gap between DeFi and conventional finance by providing a stable digital currency that can be confidently used for international transactions. USD1 will first be available on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain , with plans to add more blockchain networks over time. Each USD1 token will be supported by real-world financial reserves, and those reserves will be regularly audited by independent accounting firms. This is intended to reassure users that the token’s value is secure and transparent. The project’s creators say their focus is on keeping things simple and stable. Unlike other stablecoins that take risks with complicated strategies to increase returns, WLFI is avoiding those tactics. Instead, the platform wants to build trust through clarity and consistency, offering a straightforward stablecoin that businesses and institutions can use without fear of unexpected volatility. USD1 is being pitched as a key building block for the future of decentralized finance. With traditional institutions still cautious about crypto, WLFI is positioning this new token as a digital asset that can be easily adopted by serious players in the financial world. By offering a secure and well-regulated stablecoin, WLFI hopes to drive more adoption of DeFi tools on a global scale. WLFI also said the token will help reduce the risks often seen in the crypto market by relying on proven methods of reserve backing. Its conservative strategy is meant to make USD1 a reliable option for high-volume transactions and cross-border payments. According to Witkoff, USD1 will offer benefits that many algorithm-based and anonymous tokens can’t match. By ensuring every token is fully supported by real, verified assets, WLFI believes it can give institutions the confidence they need to begin using stablecoins in daily operations. The launch of USD1 is part of WLFI’s larger plan to build a full ecosystem around financial freedom and accessibility. Their platform is intended to support more than just stablecoins—it also includes tools for governance and decentralized decision-making, encouraging users to play an active role in shaping the network. WLFI, drawing inspiration from Trump’s vision of financial independence, wants to offer users control over their money through decentralized technology. By removing barriers and technical complexity, they aim to bring more people into the world of DeFi—especially those who may not have experience with crypto before. While many stablecoins exist in the market today, WLFI says USD1 stands out because of its mix of regulatory clarity , simplicity, and real-world backing. As they move forward with this plan, the team behind WLFI says they’ll continue sharing updates and developments on their official social media channels. The stablecoin’s release marks a bold move toward merging DeFi with mainstream finance, a step that could reshape how digital assets are used around the world. WLFI’s conservative but confident approach could give USD1 a unique place in a market where trust and stability are more important than ever. USD1’s dollar peg, real reserve backing, and institutional focus could set a new standard in the stablecoin space, especially at a time when regulatory scrutiny and demand for safer crypto products are growing fast.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-25 15:17:42

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Tesla’s $800 billion market wipeout isn’t about technology; it’s a stark lesson in the power of reputation, something Graphite Network has been building around from day one. Table of Contents Analyzing Graphite Network’s reputation core Graphite Network’s reputation framework has more to show Tesla’s market capitalization has taken a brutal $800 billion hit, dropping nearly 50% from $1.5 trillion in December 2024 to about $760 billion by March 10, 2025, according to data from Nasdaq. The culprit? Elon Musk’s polarizing political moves and statements, which have tanked sales and spooked investors despite Tesla’s tech and capital strengths. Musk’s Trump administration role at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), far-right endorsements like Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland, and divisive rhetoric, have all soured the brand. Public polls conducted by CNN in March, show 53% of Americans now view Elon Musk negatively, and boycotts are hitting hard. In several locations, Tesla cars and charging stations are facing vandalism, sales are down 49% in China and 76% in Germany, and used Cybertrucks are reselling for 58% less than last year. This isn’t a tech failure, it’s a reputation collapse that’s dragging Tesla down. In 2025, trust moves markets as much as performance does, something Elon Musk may have underestimated. People are more skeptical, more selective, and far quicker to react. Trust is no longer a soft asset; it’s the foundation. Graphite Network saw this shift coming long before reputation became a headline risk. The team behind this blockchain was already building around it . That’s why, this time crypto.news reached out to Marko Ratkovic, CTO of Graphite Network, for his perspective, given the project’s focus on building around reputation from day one. “Markets don’t just reward innovation – they punish broken trust,” says Ratkovic. “Tesla’s drop reinforces what we at Graphite Network know well: reputation isn’t a side effect of success – it’s what creates it.” Graphite Network’s reputation-based infrastructure and L2 applications are designed not just for web3 users, but to meet the expectations of TradFi institutions, helping bridge the gap between conventional finance and blockchain in a way that’s built to last and onboard millions to this space. Analyzing Graphite Network’s reputation core Graphite Network aims to redefine the reputation game based on its robust reputation-based blockchain features. It’s built on a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) Polymer 2.0 blockchain, delivers 1,400 transactions per second with predictable fees, rivaling TradFi systems for speed and scale, but that’s just the beginning of the story. The setup fee, paid in @G , blockchain’s native coin, which enforces a one-account-per-user structure, cuts down on fake or duplicate profiles to a large degree. That’s a big plus for everyone looking to work with blockchain users without added risk. Graphite Network’s Trust Score system rates users based on behavior like transaction history, KYC status (since going through KYC is optional), and accounts they have been interacting with, creating a blockchain-verified credibility metric. The Zero-Knowledge-Proofs KYC system allows decentralized apps to verify users’ information, such as location or ag, without revealing their personal information, offering a privacy-first solution that still aligns with traditional finance’s compliance needs. An upcoming feature of Graphite Network’s KYC system, tagged addresses, will bring more transparency to blockchain transactions. Each address will be linked to a specific purpose, like charity, so fund usage is clear. If funds are misused, the system can flag it instantly, and smart contracts will be able to block shady transactions. This adds another layer of accountability to how money moves on-chain. Through reputation-based smart contracts, Graphite Network allows businesses and developers to build in trust as part of the logic. A bank, for example, could require a minimum Trust Score or verified identity before issuing a loan. This approach makes blockchain transactions more secure, transparent, and aligned with real-world expectations. Together, all these elements position Graphite Network as a practical, reputation-first powerhouse in the blockchain space. On top of that, the team makes it possible to actually connect worlds of blockchain and traditional finance, and that’s what their Bank Integration Demo is all about. Graphite Network is building the infrastructure banks actually need: secure, reputation-driven, and compatible with traditional finance standards. It aims to position itself as a realistic partner for financial institutions looking to step into crypto without compromising on trust, compliance, or user safety. Graphite Network’s reputation framework has more to show In 2025, Graphite Network will introduce L2 solutions that don’t just run on blockchain; they’ll run on trust, with reputation built into how they’re used in everyday scenarios. Drawing from its 2025 roadmap , Graphite Network plans to launch: A Phonebook Reputation MVP which will link reputation metrics to phone numbers via smart contracts, creating a decentralized ID system. This could transform how trust is verified in blockchain interactions, as the user’s phone number would carry their reputation Trust Score, making it visible for everyone to see before transacting with them. A Web3 Reputation-Based Dating App MVP that will bring trust to online dating, using blockchain to validate profiles and cut through scams, therefore offering a safer, reputation-backed way to connect. Imagine a dating app that highlights someone’s trust score in their profile. This helps to flag creeps before you meet. With the introduction of a Hotspot Bundle Initiative , the realm of decentralized internet and blockchain transactions is opening up to those who have been left behind by traditional internet access. These packages of hardware and software will enable individuals in remote or low-connectivity areas to operate nodes and become part of the web3 ecosystem, fostering a more inclusive and equitable decentralized economy. Graphite Network is also developing a dePIN-powered Geo Game that will merge entertainment and education, utilizing DePIN technology to deliver an innovative gaming experience that simulates real-world economic systems. Through this game, players will be able to participate in auctions, trade assets, and observe the impact of inflation, gaining a deeper understanding of financial phenomena within a safe and interactive environment. A Competitive Voting System that will tie governance influence to reputation, not just token stacks. This will be a first-of-its-kind approach to fix decentralized decision-making flaws as the people who have the best reputation get more say than the ones with the biggest holdings. It’s a big deal because it makes decisions fairer and rewards real effort, stopping rich players from rigging the game in decentralized setups. By launching these L2 solutions, Graphite Network is proving that reputation can fix real headaches, like fraud, distrust, and unfairness, making it a vital piece of a blockchain-powered future where trust drives value. Tesla’s plunge won’t kill it; its tech and capital are too deep. But it’s a wake-up call that proves reputation still rules, no matter how deep your pockets are. Graphite Network’s not here to patch Tesla’s wounds, but instead, it’s here to lead the shift. Its reputation-based architecture and upcoming L2 solutions offer a trust-driven bridge between TradFi and web3. In a hyper-connected world where perception outshines profits, Graphite Network is betting on trust as the ultimate currency, and it might just be right. The network is also soon launching @G on CEXs, a move that could deliver strong returns for those who believe in a reputation-based crypto environment.

XRP community figure Vet recently revisited the incident, highlighting how the user mistakenly spent an excessive amount while executing multiple transactions. Details of the Unusual Transactions According to the data shared, the user incurred fees totaling 297,951 XRP across four transactions. The breakdown of each transaction fee is as follows: 73,238 XRP, 75,742, 74,903, and 74,068. These transactions were initiated on September 11, 2017, at 07:24 a.m. (UTC) from an unidentified XRPL address , ‘rKLPB…57UGn’. They specifically offer cancel transactions, which allow users to withdraw previously placed orders on the XRPL decentralized exchange. Notably, the same user executed a fifth offer cancel transaction that day, but it incurred a standard fee of only 0.21 XRP, making the four costly transactions stand out even more. At the time, the asset’s market value was relatively low, meaning the total 297,951 XRP fee amounted to $65,549. However, based on the token’s current price of $2.47, the same amount would be worth approximately $736,955. Possible Cause of the Excessive Fees Vet speculated that the incident was likely caused by an automated system rather than a manual input error. The transactions may have been executed by a bot that incorrectly processed fee parameters within a user’s account script. Given how the XRP Ledger operates, any fee above the required minimum is accepted and processed, even if it is significantly higher than necessary. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The XRPL typically offers one of the lowest transaction fees in the cryptocurrency industry. Users can transfer substantial amounts with minimal costs, often as low as a fraction of an XRP. A notable example occurred when Ripple and other entities transferred $1.88 billion worth of XRP while paying only $0.0013 per transaction. Current Status of the Wallet Even with the mistake, the wallet responsible for the transactions remains active. Its most recent recorded activity was on June 28, 2023, and it currently holds a balance of 19.80 XRP. Cases of excessive fees on the XRP Ledger are rare due to its efficient fee structure. However, this 2017 incident remains the largest transaction fee ever recorded on the network, standing as an example of how errors—whether technical or human—can lead to substantial financial consequences.

Analysts see ADA poised for gains, with projections ranging from $1 to $1.50 if current support holds. However, rising RSI suggests caution as the asset nears overbought territory. Whales on the Move Again Cardano’s native token has performed quite well in the past 24 hours, with its price rising to $0.76 (per CoinGecko’s data). This level represents a 7% increase on a weekly scale, while some important factors signal that the rally might be just starting. ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko An example of this is the whales’ activity. According to the renowned analyst Ali Martinez, large investors purchased 240 million ADA last week. The stash equals over $180 million (calculated at current rates). Accumulation of this type can encourage retail investors and smaller players to follow suit and distribute fresh capital into the ecosystem. Additionally, buying millions of tokens from whales reduces the circulating supply of ADA, which might be followed by a price surge (assuming demand keeps its level or heads north). Earlier this month, large investors scooped up 190 million tokens in the span of 24 hours. At the time of the accumulation, the price hovered at around $0.72, or 4% less than its ongoing rate. On another occasion in November last year, whales bought millions of ADA when the coin’s valuations stood at around $0.90. Just a few days later, the price briefly climbed beyond $1.30. ADA’s Next Potential Targets Crypto X is rammed with analysts who believe ADA is about to chart substantial gains in the near future . The analyst using the moniker FOUR | Crypto Spaces claimed that the asset is currently “at the defining moments.” They said ADA has been holding strong above the $0.68-$0.70 support level, expecting a reversal towards $1.30 “with strong volume.” “ If loses this support, that I think will be the worst-case scenario,” the analyst added. Coin Signals also chipped in. They assumed that ADA is heading for “the breakout” after bullish consolidation around the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). The analyst set a short-term target in the range of $1-$1.50. Meanwhile, traders should keep in mind that ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been on the rise recently. Currently, it stands just south of the bearish zone of 70, indicating that the asset might be overbought and headed for a possible pullback.

It’s called USD1, and it’s pegged 1:1 with the US dollar, according to a statement from his family company World Liberty Financial Inc. (WLFI) today. The company says the token is fully backed by short-term US government treasuries, USD deposits, and other cash equivalents. Every token equals one dollar, no exceptions. WLFI says it built the whole thing to give people a stablecoin they don’t have to second guess. The token will launch on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, with plans to hit other blockchains soon. WLFI said audits will come from a third-party accounting firm and that full transparency will be a core feature. The idea is to keep USD1 fixed at $1, using reserves people can actually verify. WLFI picks BitGo for custody and liquidity WLFI picked BitGo to hold the reserves. BitGo is known for managing billions in crypto for institutions. Their role here includes qualified custody, trading services, and liquidity support through BitGo Prime. They’re supposed to keep everything locked down, regulated, and insured. “The launch of USD1 represents a significant advancement in institutional-ready crypto,” said Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo. “Our clients demand both security and efficiency, and this partnership with WLFI delivers both – combining deep liquidity with the assurance that reserves are securely held and managed within regulated qualified custody.” WLFI is not aiming this coin at casual traders. The company made it clear this is for institutions and sovereign investors who need a way to move large sums without touching traditional rails. WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff said, “We’re offering a digital dollar stablecoin that sovereign investors and major institutions can confidently integrate into their strategies for seamless, secure cross-border transactions.” Zach also said USD1 isn’t like algorithmic stablecoins or anonymous DeFi projects. There are no risky yield schemes, no unbacked promises. “USD1 provides what algorithmic and anonymous crypto projects cannot—access to the power of DeFi underpinned by the credibility and safeguards of the most respected names in traditional finance,” he said. WLFI claims its whole structure is inspired by Trump. The project was designed with his name and approach in mind. The company says it’s building a governance platform and a full DeFi protocol that normal people can actually use. WLFI says it wants to make tools that remove the friction from crypto, and give people access to financial systems without depending on centralized middlemen.

42327032,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61659,1742916977,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here Are Key Factors That Could Propel XRP to $100,https://timestabloid.com/here-are-key-factors-that-could-propel-xrp-to-100/,"XRP has gained significant attention in the cryptocurrency market, particularly as analysts speculate on the possibility of its value reaching $100 . While this price target may seem ambitious, certain developments could contribute to substantial growth. Regulatory clarity, the potential introduction of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and increasing institutional interest are among the factors that could drive long-term price appreciation. Currently, the token faces resistance at $2.41 despite recent bullish sentiment. Broader market conditions, particularly Bitcoin’s price stability at around $87,000, have contributed to XRP’s struggle to gain upward momentum. However, with positive industry developments, some analysts, including Armando Pantoja, believe a surge to triple-digit prices is achievable over time. Regulatory Clarity Following the SEC Lawsuit For years, XRP’s price performance has been hindered by regulatory uncertainty stemming from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple. The SEC alleged that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. This legal battle created hesitation among institutional investors and limited XRP’s broader market potential. Recent developments indicate that the SEC has formally dismissed its claims against Ripple. CEO Brad Garlinghouse has confirmed this resolution, marking a turning point for the company. Once the case is officially closed, the token will no longer carry the regulatory risks that previously discouraged institutional participation. This outcome could pave the way for greater adoption by major financial entities, increasing demand and market confidence. The Role of XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) The potential approval of XRP-based ETFs could significantly enhance the asset’s market accessibility. These financial products allow investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly managing the cryptocurrency, making it more appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Several firms , including Grayscale , WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, have submitted ETF applications to the SEC. Some of these proposals have already been acknowledged by regulators, indicating progress in the approval process. If granted regulatory approval, these ETFs would increase liquidity, attract more capital, and contribute to more stable price discovery, reinforcing the asset’s market position. Ripple’s Escrow and Possible Government Collaboration Another potential catalyst for XRP’s value appreciation is Ripple’s escrow strategy. Currently, Ripple holds approximately 37.1 billion XRP in escrow, periodically releasing a portion into circulation. Speculation has emerged that the company may donate a significant amount to the U.S. government’s digital asset reserves following discussions about XRP’s inclusion in national financial frameworks. If Ripple proceeds with such a donation, it could strengthen the company’s relationship with regulators while also demonstrating its commitment to supporting governmental initiatives. This move could enhance its credibility in institutional finance and increase demand, potentially leading to upward price pressure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Interest and Market Adoption With regulatory concerns diminishing and ETF prospects improving, institutional interest in XRP is expected to rise. Large financial institutions often avoid assets with regulatory ambiguity, but a more transparent framework could encourage them to integrate the asset into their financial products and payment solutions. Greater institutional involvement would likely result in higher transaction volumes and improved liquidity. These factors contribute to market stability, reducing the likelihood of extreme price fluctuations and fostering long-term growth. Assessing the Feasibility of XRP Reaching $100 Despite its potential, XRP’s path to $100 would require a massive increase from its current price of $2.41. Reaching this milestone would represent a growth of approximately 4049%, bringing its total market capitalization to around $5.8 trillion. For context, the entire cryptocurrency market is currently valued at $2.81 trillion. Skeptics argue that such a valuation is unlikely, considering the scale of growth required. However, historical precedent shows that substantial price increases are possible in the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin, for instance, was once valued at a few cents before surpassing $84,000 and achieving a trillion-dollar market cap. While XRP reaching $100 would require significant market shifts, sustained regulatory clarity, increased institutional adoption, and financial product integration could drive long-term appreciation.

The exploit has not affected the GMX protocol or GM tokens used in those vaults, but only specific liquidity hubs for decentralized lending. Contracts related to GMX and Magic Internet Money (MIM) Spell lending vaults have been exploited for 6,260 ETH, locked in related liquidity vaults. The decentralized lending vaults on Arbitrum were exploited for WETH and ETH; then, the funds were bridged through Stargate to the Ethereum mainnet for laundering. The attacker moved MIM, USDC, USDC, ETH, and WETH, finally swapping all assets on Ethereum for further mixing. Stargate Bridge helped the easy movement of funds, as it held $160M in available liquidity. Arbitrum is a rare choice for a hack, but still offers multiple options to move into Ethereum for more liquidity and swapping option. The stolen funds ended up in three ETH addresses, which are now monitored for further movements or mixing. Some of the addresses are not yet tagged as belonging to an exploit, while the initial address was labeled as Fake Phishing right after the attack. GMX users not affected, only MIM vaults lose funds GMX itself has only given the model to build MIM Abracadabra vaults and use GM tokens for passive income. GMX explained its protocol remained sound, and did not lose ETH or other assets. MIM remains close to its $1 peg, surviving the attack at $0.99, a usual range for a stablecoin. Following the news of the exploit, GM tokens fell from $14.70 to $13.37, in line with the token’s general sliding trend. https://x.com/GMX_IO/status/1904509326129238479 No issues were discovered with GMX contracts, and the problem is not with the project’s technology. GMX users are not affected, just the GMX V2 pools. GMX V2 is a decentralized perpetual exchange with $341.48M in available liquidity. MIM uses the exchange’s pools but has not yet announced its exact vulnerability. The project claimed the exploit originated with the Abracadabra/Spell cauldrons, which are liquidity pools for borrowing against collateral of GM tokens. The GMX and MIM teams, as well as other security researchers are still looking at the flaws in the smart contracts that allowed the hacker to transfer funds in a single transaction. The attacker has already started moving the ETH into smaller batches of 1,000, sending it to alternative addresses. For now, the attacker remains uncertain, but the practice of moving into ETH and splitting it into smaller wallets resembles previous techniques used by the Lazarus group. The initial funds also came from an address linked to the Tornado Cash mixer, often favored by DPRK hackers. None of the funds remained in USDT or USDC, which could be tracked down or frozen. Currently, there is no opportunity to freeze funds, and further trading or laundering is possible through DEX protocols. The Abracadabra Spell lending protocol is a relatively small Arbitrum DeFi app, but still managed to attract hackers for some of its pools, known as Cauldrons. The Abracadabra Spell lending app carries $48.84M in liquidity, while the other version, Abracadabra, carries over $52M in value locked. MIM can be produced through the vaults and used for additional liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem. The MIM Swap exchange carries an additional $17.7M in DEX liquidity. The Cauldrons are simply lending pools, which allow traders to perform both borrowing or leverage operations on-chain or cover their loans and reduce leverage. MIM hacked for the second time In January 2024, MIM was also hacked through its lending smart contract. The reason was that the contract used shares to calculate the outstanding debt. Due to a precision calculation vulnerability, MIM lost $6.5M , following flawed flash loans. The exploit hinged on flawed calculation of amount owned, allowing the hacker to withdraw more funds. This time, the transaction record shows no flash loans or other microtransactions. The hacker needed some funds to interact with the protocol, managing to gain access to stablecoins, as well as WETH on Arbitrum. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The company aims for $10B in BTC gains and a 15% BTC yield in calendar year 2025. Raised $18.8B via equity and $6.2B in convertible debt to fund its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Adoption of FASB fair value accounting adds $12.75B to retained earnings, eliminating impairment drag on earnings. Leverage stands at ~$6.8B in debt; a 50% BTC drop could cut the coverage ratio to just 7.5x. Investment Thesis MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin ( BTC ), owning 471,107 BTC valued at ~$46.1B as of February 2025. Its bold strategy has generated $15.7B in unrealized gains-and the company is now chasing another $10B, along with a 15% BTC yield, this year. Funded by $18.8B in equity and $6.2B in convertible debt, the bet is massive. But with $6.8B in debt, a sharp BTC drop could strain liquidity. Can MicroStrategy keep riding the Bitcoin boom? So far, it's even outperformed BTC itself-just as Saylor predicted. Data by YCharts $10B in BTC Gains and 15% BTC Yield for CY25 MicroStrategy's main growth driver is its aggressive and systematic BTC acquisition strategy. It has been executed through capital market operations. As of February CY25, the company holds 471,107 BTCs, acquired at a total cost of $30.4B . This translates to an average purchase price of $64,511 per BTC. The market value of these holdings stood at $46.1B as of February, which represents an unrealized gain of ~$15.7B. This massive accumulation has made MicroStrategy the largest corporate holder of BTC. The distinction provides the company with unique exposure to BTC's price movements. Q4-Deck The company raises capital sharply under its BTC strategy. MicroStrategy employs a multipronged approach, utilizing equity, convertible debt (minimal interest), and cheap fixed-income securities to fund its BTC purchases. In Q4-24 and Q1-25, the company raised $18.8B in net proceeds through its at-the-market (ATM) equity, the largest such program in the US capital markets ever. This equity issuance was done in a manner that minimized market disruption, with sales accounting for only 2.9% of the average daily trading volume of MSTR stock. Additionally, MicroStrategy issued $6.2B in convertible notes with a blended annual interest rate of 0.56% to take advantage of favorable market conditions to secure low-cost debt. The company also introduced Strike ( STRK ), a perpetual preferred stock that raised $584M and offers an 8% fixed dividend . Now, STRK has a total offering price of up to $21B (under the ""ATM Program"") for investors focusing on lower volatility exposure to BTC. Q4 Deck Moreover, this capital-raising strategy has allowed MicroStrategy to outperform BTC's price appreciation through intelligent leverage. Intelligent leverage is central to its treasury operations. The company's BTC Yield measures BTC accretion per share due to capital market activities and reached 74.3% in CY24, far beyond its initial target range of 6-10%. This performance boosts MSTR compound market value beyond simple BTC holdings. For CY25, the company has set a revised BTC Yield target of 15% with a target to derive $10B in BTC dollar gains and continue executing accretive capital transactions. Here, a structural advantage for MicroStrategy is its adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) fair value accounting standard for BTC holdings (effective Q1 CY25). In detail, this transition marks a high improvement over the previous accounting treatment, which required BTC to be classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset subject to impairment charges but no upward revaluations. Under the old rules, MicroStrategy recognized $1.8B in impairment charges in CY24 that distorted its reported earnings. The new standard eliminates these impairments and allows the company to recognize unrealized gains in net income to more accurately reflect its financial standing. The immediate accounting impact of this change includes a $12.75B cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. This adjustment reflects the revaluation of BTC holdings from their carrying value to market value as of January 1, CY25. Q4 Deck Going forward, MicroStrategy will remeasure the fair value of its BTC holdings at the end of each quarter in net income. This shift may boost investment standards in MSTR. How? The elimination of impairment charges removes a historical earnings drag, improving the bottom line and solidifying valuations. The fair value accounting change also has strategic implications. By providing real-time visibility into the value of its BTCs, MicroStrategy can communicate its treasury strategy to the street and analysts. This transparency is valuable, where its equity value is closely tied to BTC's market price. Additionally, these recognized unrealized gains may improve MicroStrategy's access to capital markets (better risk profiling), as lenders can accurately assess the collateral value of its BTCs. Further, MicroStrategy maintains a sharp approach to capital structure, balancing leverage and liquidity to support its BTC buying. The company's $6.2B in convertible notes have maturities staggered between CY28 and 2032. It minimizes refinancing risks till the Fed fund rate normalization is near 0%. Redeeming $500M in senior secured notes (CY28) and Calling $650M (CY25) and $1.05B (CY27) convertible notes also reduces near-term debt obligations. The company's leverage ratio (debt-to-BTC value) stands at ~8% that is well below its long-term target range of 20-30%. It provides flexibility for future capital raises. The STRF further diversified funding sources while maintaining upside potential through conversion features. Q4 Deck Finally, instead of going to traditional valuation, I am focusing on the MSTR-BTC correlation. The correlation is getting stronger ~1. With 1 ((BTC)):2.5X ((MSTR)) price return ratio over 5 years and CY30 price targets (by ARK Invest's analysts ), MSTR has a massive possible price return. If we take bear case CAGR and the price return ratio, MSTR can provide >52% (21%*2.5X) price return per year till CY30. cointelegraph.com Data by YCharts $6.8B Debt Load Faces Liquidity Risk if BTC Drops 50%, Cutting Coverage to 7.5x On the loose side, MicroStrategy employs aggressive leverage moves to amplify its BTC exposure with convertible debt outstanding and perpetual preferred stock ((STRK)) issuance carrying a high dividend obligation. The company's debt coverage ratio appears healthy at 15x (BTC holdings of $46.1B vs. $3B of out-of-the-money convertible debt), but this could deteriorate rapidly in a BTC downturn. A 50% decline (a normal event) in BTC's price would reduce coverage to just 7.5x, potentially triggering covenant renegotiations or massive credit rating downgrades. The $3B in convertible notes due CY28-CY32 were issued with near-zero coupons based on expectations of equity conversion; if MicroStrategy's share price underperforms BTC, holders may demand cash redemption instead, which can create a bank run. The STRK preferred stock introduces additional fixed obligations, with $58M in annual dividends that must be funded through operations or additional capital raises. It is manageable today, given the $20B raised in Q4-CY24. However, longer market weakness can force MicroStrategy to cut the dividend, damaging its credibility with income-focused guys. The company's plan to issue more fixed-income securities in CY25 (targeting 20-30% leverage) could backfire if BTC volatility increases. Now, MicroStrategy's so-called unique value proposition as a leveraged BTC play faces growing competition from spot BTC ETFs (like IBIT). These ETFs attracted $140B in global inflows during CY24 . The ETFs offer direct BTC exposure without any operational risks, leverage costs, and equity dilution (associated with MicroStrategy's structure). As ETF fees continue declining (currently 0.2-0.8%), they may erode MicroStrategy's premium valuations for its equity and debt offerings. Coinglass Similarly, with the maturation of BTC derivatives markets with regulated futures and options now widely available, institutional investors can create better tailored exposure without relying on MicroStrategy's convertible bonds and preferred shares. The company's advantage in ""intelligent leverage"" through capital markets may diminish as traditional products catch up to crypto market sophistication. Finally, other corporations adopting BTC treasury strategies (like Tesla, Block, and Marathon Digital) can also dilute MicroStrategy's first-mover advantage. If these companies develop more efficient accumulation methods based on solid actual operations, they may attract capital that would otherwise flow to MSTR. It will hit hard on MSTR valuations. Takeaway MicroStrategy offers a bold, high-octane way to bet on Bitcoin-amplifying upside through smart capital structuring, low-cost leverage, and now, fair value accounting that better reflects gains. With over $46B in BTC and a 15% yield target, the stock has even outpaced Bitcoin itself. However, its $6.8B debt load and rising competition from spot ETFs add serious risk if BTC turns south. If you're bullish on Bitcoin and can stomach volatility, MSTR could deliver massive returns-but it's not for the faint-hearted.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-25 15:42:11

BUIDL has been expanded over time to Arbitrum (ARB), Aptos (APT), Avalanche (AVAX), Optimism (OP), and Polygon. In essence, BUIDL allows investors to hold a fixed value token worth $1 and have daily accrued dividends paid directly to investors’ wallets. According to Securitize, BUIDL reached a new ATH of $1.7 billion today, up 165% from 30 days ago, and is expected to surpass $2 billion by early April. “In the year since the launch of BUIDL, we have experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets, reinforcing the value of bringing institutional-grade products to the chain.

Today, March 25, 2025, with 3.75% upside momentum, the asset has successfully moved out of the narrow range between $0.69 and $0.75. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA now appears bullish. With its decent upside momentum, it has breached the resistance at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. Based on recent price momentum and historical patterns, if ADA holds above the $0.76 level, there is a strong possibility it could initially soar by 13% to reach $0.85 in the coming days. However, if this upside momentum continues and market sentiment remains unchanged, ADA could potentially rally another 35% to reach the $1.15 level in the future. Source: Trading View ADA Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.762, registering a price surge of over 4.20% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume jumped by 30%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors following the recent breakout. Key Liquidation Levels for Traders As of now, the sentiment appears bullish, which is also reflected in traders’ behavior as they are strongly betting on long positions, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . On-chain metrics reveal that traders are currently over-leveraged at $0.72 on the lower side, where they have built $26 million worth of long positions in the hope that ADA’s price won’t fall below this level. On the other hand, $0.768 is another over-leveraged level, where traders betting on the short side have built $6.35 million worth of short positions. Given the current price momentum and market sentiment, these $6.35 million worth of short positions are at risk of liquidation as the price approaches the $0.768 level.

On March 25, prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT took to X, accusing the exchange of essentially betraying its community by resurrecting the tokens, which represented 70% of the total supply. ZachXBT tweeted , “CRO is no different from a scam.” He argued that the move directly contradicted the initial promise of a “permanent” burn, a step taken in 2021 to reduce the token’s circulating supply. This decision, he claimed, went against the wishes of the community, which has long voiced concerns about centralized control over CRO’s supply. The controversy follows a major partnership announcement between Crypto.com and Trump Media. The two parties are exploring a non-binding agreement to launch US crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through Crypto.com’s broker-dealer, Foris Capital US. Crypto.com Defends CRO Token Re-issuance Following the intense criticism, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek defended the re-issuance and explained during a March 25 AMA that the initial token burn in 2021 was a defensive move amid a hostile regulatory environment. Marszalek stated that, with the “war on crypto” now over under the new US administration, Crypto.com needed to adopt a more “aggressive” approach to foster growth. He also went on to highlight that the re-issuance was necessary to support the company’s investment plans and further dismissed the concerns, arguing that this was what the community wanted and needed to compete on a global scale. “The original token burn from Q1 2021 was a defensive move. At that point in time, it made a lot of sense. Now we have strong support from the new administration, the war on crypto is over. There’s a need for an aggressive investment to win. I am always very supportive of thinking big, of being bold.” Debate Over Centralized Control and Transparency The move has raised additional governance concerns, with a report by Unchained suggesting that Crypto.com’s validators control up to 70% of the voting power on the blockchain. The report also pointed out that despite most token holders opposing the proposal, two major voters, Falcon Heavy and Starship – both allegedly controlled by Crypto.com – exercised significant influence due to their large CRO holdings. The proposal passed with 62.18% in favor, 17.61% against, and over 20% abstaining. This has cast doubt on the fairness of the decision-making process. Critics argue that this concentration of power undermines decentralization and transparency, two key principles that are crucial to the ethos of the cryptocurrency industry.

According to them, using the debt’s interest to support Kyiv is not enough. Senators asked questions in a letter signed by Republicans Todd Young and Lindsey Graham and Democrats Richard Blumenthal and Tim Kaine. This marked a rare instance of senior Republicans publicly urging a tougher stance on Russia. Democrats Richard Blumenthal and Tim Kaine also signed it. One of the questions was, “How does the Administration view using all financial tools at its disposal to increase pressure on Russia to end the war?” Well, if asked, Trump is good at using whatever he can to put pressure on people. Another question was, “Specifically, does the Administration believe that U.S. and EU-held assets should be used as leverage in negotiations with Russia to bring an end to the war? If so, how?” Their letter, sent on March 21, coincided with U.S.-Russia negotiations in Saudi Arabia, where officials discussed a potential Black Sea maritime ceasefire as a first step to broader peace talks. Senators ask Trump to push allies to cease assets that will help Ukraine In the letter, the senators asked the administration if it planned to push the EU, G7, and other partners to help Ukraine by using Russian government assets. In addition, they asked if Ukraine could use these funds to buy defence equipment. This is not the first time questions have been asked. For years, U.S. lawmakers have pushed for Russia’s frozen assets to be used to help rebuild Ukraine instead of American government money. Russia invaded Ukraine in full in 2022, and the US and its partners froze between $300 billion and $350 billion in Russian government assets. Most of which were held in European banks. They are mostly U.S., British, and European government bonds kept in a European assets depository. According to sources, only about $7 billion exists in U.S. banks. Due to legal worries, Washington has not fully seized the assets. Furthermore, it has never before seized central bank assets from a country with which it is not at war. On this record, it has chosen to use the interest earnings to help Ukraine. What are the odds that all frozen assets will be released? European leaders want to use those assets to help rebuild Ukraine. However, they have yet to reach an agreement on how to avoid legal challenges or set a bad example for the rest of the world. In addition, European officials have decided to back loans to Ukraine with interest income from the frozen Russian assets but not the assets themselves. On the other hand, Moscow has a different stance. It said that any possible transfer of assets is theft and has apparently said that it is willing to use frozen European funds for reconstruction as long as some of the money goes to help the parts of Ukraine that Russia occupies. The U.S. has the “Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act,” which was passed by the U.S. Congress in 2024 and signed into law by former President Joe Biden that April. The law gave the president of the United States the power to send Russian assets that were taken in the United States to Ukraine. The US is most likely to release the assets.

These gains coincided with a recovery across the cryptocurrency market with Bitcoin price reaching a two-week high above $88,000. As risk assets record a fresh uptick in demand, 4 crypto coins have stood out with bullish analysis and could easily post price 4x gains. These coins are Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK), and Pepe Coin (PEPE). Cryptocurrency Price Prediction as US Stock Market Adds $1.5T The US stock market recorded massive gains yesterday after adding $1.35 trillion to its market capitalization. This marked the biggest single-day gain in history, fueled by a surge in technology stocks like Google, Meta, and Nvidia. Besides the stock market, cryptocurrencies also experienced gains as the total market cap surged to the highest level in more than two weeks. The positive investor sentiment towards risk assets follows President Trump’s pivot on tariff policies. As the Wall Street Journal reported , Trump will no longer be going forward with aggressive tariff pans. Instead, the US will only impose reciprocal tariffs to countries that currently have a trade imbalance. As US stocks and the cryptocurrency market recover, below are four coins that traders should consider buying for 4x price gains. 4 Crypto Coins That Could Record 4X Price Gains The four crypto coins that traders can buy today for 4X gains are XRP, DOGE, LINK, and PEPE. These coins have strong fundamentals and a bullish technical outlook that could lead to price gains as the cryptocurrency market recovers. Ripple (XRP) XRP price today trades at $2.44 with a 1.2% decline in 24 hours. This altcoin could be on the verge of a massive price rally amid reports that the Ripple lawsuit ends this week . The SEC will hold a closed-door voting meeting on Thursday, and speculation is rife that this will culminate the official end of this case. The XRP price chart also shows a possible bullish breakout. According to one analyst, Ripple has collected all the sell-side liquidity below price, and it could be on the verge of recording an all-time high past $3.40. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin price could also make a bullish breakout soon as meme coins surge as the cryptocurrency market recovers. The total meme coin market cap is at a 14-day high of $54 billion, highlighting a spike in speculative trading activity. DOGE, as the largest meme coin, could benefit from this shift in investor sentiment. Technical indicators also show a bullish Dogecoin price prediction . The RSI and the AO bars are all tipping north, suggesting that an uptrend is underway. After flipping support at $0.164, DOGE is now aiming at the resistance level of $0.35. If it breaks above it, it may spark a rally to $0.46. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is also a top cryptocurrency to buy for 4x price gains. A recent Coingape article, Chainlink secured a partnership with the Abu Dhabi Global Market for tokenization. This partnership could unlock a massive rally. The four-hour price chart for LINK price proves the bullish thesis. The RSI is rising and has reached 68, indicating a bullish momentum, while LINK is attempting to break out from an ascending parallel channel. If this breakout occurs, it could drive significant gains for Chainlink price. LINK/USDT: 4-hour Chart Pepe Coin (PEPE) PEPE coin could also easily register a 4x price gain. At press time, this frog-themed meme coin trades at $0.0000080 with a slight 3% gain in 24 hours. The four-hour price chart shows that PEPE has breached critical resistance at the 200-day SMA, confirming that the trend is now bullish. The rising RSI line also confirms strong buying pressure, making PEPE one of the best crypto coins to buy today. PEPE/USDT: 4-hour Chart Summary of Cryptocurrency Price Prediction The cryptocurrency market recorded slight price gains after the SU stock market added $1.5 trillion, marking its best day in history. As the market sentiment shifts, the top crypto coins that seem poised for recovery are XRP, DOGE, LINK, and PEPE.

While the market correction pummeled Ethereum below the $2,000 mark and Bitcoin was barely hanging on to $84,000, PEPE also rose by 5% weekly however. However, amidst the meme coin frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fundamentally changing the crypto landscape with an unprecedented presale which has already amassed $4.7 million over 6,500 holders. Whereas PEPE’s path depends on speculative volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines utility in DeFi with a presale framework that can deliver instant profit, making it a serious contender in the race to $1.5. Critical Test for Pepe’s Volatile Ascent The current 24-hour price recovery of Pepe Coin demonstrates a dramatic shift against Dogecoin’s 5% market sharing, indicating its unclear market performance. Analysts identify $0.000008 as a vital breaking point because owners that cross this threshold may reset PEPE prices to $0.000015 leading to a 100% increase. The MACD indicators have started an upward crossover pattern while RSI rests at 59 points which indicates more movement potential in the market. PEPE exposes itself to major price drops whenever Bitcoin encounters decline due to its heavy dependence on meme-driven demand. The advisory to acquire the risky but potentially rewarding asset faces significant risk because PEPE lacks intrinsic value making its price performance reliant on other digital coins. Mutuum Finance Launches Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to soar even with market volatility because it finished 65% of its phase 3 presale at $0.02 for each token. The current phase three of Mutuum Finance has reached more than 65% of its supply capacity which will trigger a price hike to $0.025 for phase four. Participants in the early presale will experience a 200% profit when MUTM eventually lists for $0.06. The presale appreciation enhances the value of MUTM but its mtToken-based lending platform keeps demand fueled beyond presale completion. After its launch phase 3 participants will obtain returns of 17,400% with projected price averages of $3.50. This systematic expansion, which meme coins like PEPE lack, grounds MUTM’s allure to investment-savvy players. In contrast to PEPE’s hype driven rise, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) includes a buy-and-distribute strategy that redirects at least 80% of platform sale profits to token buybacks. Staking rewards are always up for grabs, keeping the supply locked and creating constant demand and a disincentive to sell. Moreover, mtTokens earn interest over time, allowing holders to earn passive yield without needing to sell their assets. These mechanics insulate MUTM from the meme coin volatility, buying stability through utility-led adoption. Presale Progresses, Security Improvements Loom Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently completing a Certik audit for its smart contracts which will undoubtedly enhance investor confidence. In its completion, the announcement will open up new visibility within crypto communities, which likely boosts presale engagement. As phase 3 approaches its maximum limit, it means the window to get $0.02 tokens is closing quickly. Not only does 25% price jump in phase 4 risk being missed, but also a 100x post-launch boom. Pepe (PEPE) might take meme culture to short-term peaks but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is writing the DeFi blueprint for long-term value. MUTM may become a key catalyst for the next wave of crypto innovations, both because of strong presale interest and real lending use cases. Suppose you’re an investor looking to protect yourself from the unpredictability of speculation. In that case, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has provided a careful way to benefit from the next step in the evolution of DeFi —and before phase 3 sells out. Phase 3 Closes Soon, Buy MUTM Now The clock is ticking for investors to grab Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.02. Phase 4 promises life-changing returns, and Certik audit only just around the corner, and hesitating now might mean losing out.

42327806,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=718111,1742918413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42327806.jpeg,"Crypto Expert Arthur Hayes Reveals Why Bitcoin Price Will Touch $110,000 Before $76,500",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-will-touch-110000/,"Bitcoin has entered a period of relative calm, with its price oscillating between $81,000 and $89,000 over the past several sessions. This newfound stability has reassured many traders, as the odds of a sharp decline below $80,000 have diminished significantly. Selling pressure is starting to ease, buyers are gradually stepping in, and the market appears to be in an accumulation phase, which is often a precursor to another rally. Even with selling pressure easing, there’s still a risk of breakdown below $80,000 at any moment. However, dormer BitMEX CEO and renowned crypto investor Arthur Hayes recently shared a bold projection that Bitcoin will reach $110,000 before retesting the $76,500 price level. Arthur Hayes Predicts $110,000 Will Come Before Any Pullback to $76,500 As it stands, Bitcoin is closer to $75,000 than it is to $110,000, but popular crypto commentator Arthur Hayes believes the leading cryptocurrency will reach the latter before the former. A climb to $110,000 will translate to a new all-time high for Bitcoin, as its current peak is $108,786, set in January. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Arthur Hayes Says Be Patient After Bitcoin’s 36% Crash, Reveals Possible Bottom At present, Bitcoin is trading about 20.3% below that high, and concerns about a deeper correction are valid. The possibility of a pullback to $76,500 is still a genuine concern, especially since that price sits just under this month’s local low, and it can be quickly retested before another bounce upwards. Hayes’ comments on social media platform X offered both a price target and a macroeconomic rationale. Hayes stated, “I bet $BTC hits $110k before it retests $76.5k,” clarifying that the momentum of the market and shifts in monetary policies are more likely to push the Bitcoin price up rather than another correction towards $76,500. He went further to suggest that once Bitcoin crosses $110,000, it may not look back until it starts approaching $250,000. This price target resonates with outlooks from other crypto analysts. Incoming Shifts In Monetary Policies Central to Hayes’ reasoning is the Federal Reserve’s changing stance on liquidity. He pointed out that the Fed is transitioning from quantitative tightening (QT) to a new phase of quantitative easing (QE), particularly in the Treasury markets. Although the Fed has been engaged in quantitative tightening (QT) since June 2022, there are now discussions about pausing or slowing down the balance sheet runoff. According to Reuters, some analysts predict a shift towards a more QE-like approach.

Hayes also dismissed concerns about inflation, stating that the Fed Chairman appears to view it as “transitory inflation.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $86,600, having traded at an intraday high of $88,713 in the past 24 hours.

If Bitcoin hits the $98,000 mark in the next quarter, other major coins like XRP and Ethereum could see remarkable growth. Stay tuned to discover which digital assets are positioned for a breakout. Bitcoin Market Pulse and Levels Bitcoin experienced a mixed trend with a month change showing a decline of 10.04%, while the six-month performance surged by 37.39%. The price action reveals recent short-term weakness countered by a strong mid-term recovery. Price volatility marked the past period with fluctuations under pressure, indicating market hesitancy despite underlying growth signs evident from the longer-term rally. Current trading sees Bitcoin fluctuating between roughly $74,047 and $98,803. Immediate support rests near $63,732, with resistance first seen around $113,244 and a further hurdle at $137,999. The indicators show balanced pressure with momentum on the positive side, suggesting a neutral trend and offering trading opportunities within established levels. XRP: Short-Term Dip Amid Long-Term Surge Facing Key Levels XRP registered a modest gain of 3.67% over the past week and a decline of 5.79% for the month. However, the coin has shown impressive growth of 316.30% over the last six months. Price movements have experienced volatility, reflecting a strong recovery as XRP rebounded from recent setbacks while achieving significant long-term gains. The mixed price behavior indicates a market readjustment across different time frames. The trading range is currently between $1.60 and $2.88, with solid support at $1.06 and resistance at $3.61, along with a secondary resistance at $4.89. Indicators show an RSI near 51, suggesting a neutral market. Bulls appear to be in control for now, and traders may want to focus on strategies around the support zone or a potential breakout above $3.61 for upward momentum. Ethereum Trading Outlook: Weight of Declines Amid Key Zones Ethereum saw a 25.76% drop over the past month and a 20.41% fall in the last six months. A recent 6.52% weekly increase provided a brief spark amid an overall declining trend. The price exhibited volatility, trading between $1766.31 and $3020.97 during this period. The sustained downward movement reflects persistent selling pressure, while the weekly gain hints at potential short-term recovery. Current trading levels focus on support at $1294.44 and resistance at $3803.76, with additional benchmarks at $39.78 and $5058.42. Negative moving average and oscillator readings indicate bear control, while the RSI is close to neutral at 46.03. Traders may explore cautious strategies between these levels, watching for breaks above resistance or below support for clearer trend indicators. Conclusion If BTC hits $98,000 in the second quarter, it could trigger significant movements in XRP and ETH . Such a rise in Bitcoin's price may drive investor interest and momentum across the crypto market. XRP might see increased trading activity, pushing its value higher. ETH could also experience a price boost, especially with ongoing upgrades and developments. The overall market could benefit from this scenario, creating new opportunities for gains.

The report also indicated that some sector-specific duties may be imposed, which added optimism for investors. Eastspring Investments expects the U.S. real economy data to continue to look decent through March. Eastspring Investments’ economists also believe that the data are largely pre-tariffs. The firm argued that hard data will only begin to reflect the post-tariff economy from April and May onwards. U.S. Treasury yields edge higher amid Trump’s expected tariffs US government bond yields climbed on Monday as investors digested reports that President Donald Trump could soften the hit from a tranche of tariffs expected next week. Also boosting yields was an unexpectedly strong reading for the US services PMI for March. #ausecon #auspol — CommSec (@CommSec) March 24, 2025 Reports that President Donald Trump’s tariffs might be more limited in scope caused U.S. Treasury yields to move higher on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported that planned tariffs from April 2 by the White House were set to be narrower in scope. The firms also reported that the planned tariffs will likely exclude some industry-specific duties, which provided optimism for investors. Data revealed that the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield moved nearly two basis points higher at 4.346%. The data also showed the 2-year Treasury moved over one basis point higher at 4.051%. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data released yesterday indicated a reading of 54.3, which was higher than 51 in February. Monday’s PMI data also exceeded the 51.5 Dow Jones consensus estimate. A reading above 50 signals economic expansion, while a reading below 50 points indicates economic contraction. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price data for January, which tracks changes in residential home prices, is expected later today. Investors are also expecting the weekly initial jobless claims to be out on Thursday. The major data release this week will be the personal consumption expenditure index on Friday, which is the Fed’s favored measure of inflation. Trump highlighted that his reciprocal tariff plans will have “flexibility,” but he seemed to oppose the idea of making exceptions for the forthcoming duties. He told reporters at the Oval Office that people were coming to him and talking about tariffs. He also added that “a lot of people are asking if they could have exceptions.” The President argued that “once you do that for one, you have to do that for all.” The U.S. President mentioned that he did not change his mind when he issued top automakers a one-month exemption on a prior round of import duties early this month. He also sounded optimistic about the April 2 start date for his reciprocal tariffs after he referred to it as America’s “liberation day.” The Head of State acknowledged that the plan will effectively assign tariff rates to all countries that have their own tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump also said that countries with other non-tariff trade policies that his administration opposes, such as value-added taxes, could be subject to new duties. The U.S. President highlighted on Sunday that he plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding the tariffs. China retaliated and issued tariffs on U.S. agricultural products in response to Trump’s broad tariffs on Chinese imports. The Fed lowers its outlook for economic growth The Fed lowered its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast from 2.1% in December to 1.7%. The Fed also revealed that it left its borrowing rate targeted between 4.25% and 4.5%, where it has been since December. Fed chair Jerome Powell said that the Fed will move in quarter percentage point increments despite Trump’s tariffs, tax breaks and deregulations. “If the economy remains strong, and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2%, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly, or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly.” – Jerome Powell , Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The FOMC also noted that the uncertainty around the economic outlook had surged and that the Fed was “attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.” Powell also believes that inflation has started to move up in response to tariffs. He argued that there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year. The Fed’s dot plot showed that 19 FOMC members, both voters and nonvoters, expect the benchmark fed funds rate at 3.9% by the end of 2025, which is equivalent to a target range of 3.75% to 4%.

By press time on March 25, the world’s premier cryptocurrency had underperformed the hopes of many bulls and, despite the latest positive moves , remains some $20,000 below its recent highs. Still, BTC’s overwhelming success and proliferation are nowhere seen better than in the big picture, and zooming out beyond the shortest of timeframes reveals just how far Bitcoin has come and how much price appreciation its fundamental structure enabled. Seeking to escape the current woes, worries, and fears, Finbold elected to examine the coin’s path over the last five years and see how much a $5,000 investment made on March 25, 2020, would have risen by today. Bitcoin investment made five years ago would have appreciated this much To begin with, Bitcoin is changing hands at $88,649 at press time, having fallen 7.77% year-to-date (YTD), risen 25.62% in the last 12 months, and skyrocketed more than 65,000% since 2014. BTC all-time price chart. Source: Finbold On March 25, 2020 – exactly five years before press time – BTC was trading at approximately $6,681, having fallen from the 2019 highs above $10,000. Such a setup means that, within just 60 months, Bitcoin soared nearly $82,000 – 1226.88% – for an average daily gain of $44.91, though the real picture isn’t as elegant or straightforward due to high volatility. Finally, the price appreciation ensures that traders who invested $5,000 in 2020 would have close to one entire Bitcoin, and the value of their cryptocurrency holdings would have risen to $66,354 – $61,354 in profits.
