This cycle. The market is skeptical on meaningful follow through for now, so that is not at all priced in,” Back stated. if the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve happens prepare for 7 figure bitcoin. this cycle. the market is skeptical on meaningful follow through for now, so that is not at all priced in. — Adam Back (@adam3us) November 18, 2024 The bold prediction sparked discussions among industry experts and enthusiasts. James Van Straten, a noted crypto analyst, responded, “7 figures? I don’t think I’m mentally prepared for 6.” Acknowledging the market’s doubt, Back replied, “That’s a fairly big ‘if’ though. At least if we infer from market price, the market thinks a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is unlikely. If that becomes real, I’d expect a rapid repricing.” Can Bitcoin Rise To $1 Million Per Coin? The conversation highlights the market’s skepticism regarding the feasibility of the US government accumulating such a significant Bitcoin reserve. Van Straten, like other experts, suggested that a nation might consider “front-running” this potential scenario, to which Back noted, “There’s no good way to buy 1 million BTC other than very, very quietly. Even then, once it leaks, the entire world gets FOMO and a price teleport happens.” Related Reading: Is $135,000 Bitcoin’s Current Ceiling? This Model Says So Portal, a custodyless interoperability protocol for Bitcoin, weighed in on the discussion via X: “If the US starts one, surely the rest of the world will start to follow suit as well.” This sentiment underscores the potential global ripple effect of a US-initiated SBR on Bitcoin adoption and valuation. Skepticism was also voiced by X user AndyLiteMan (@LiteAndy), who critiqued Back’s astronomical prediction: “As much as that would be exciting, it’s not going to happen. We hear this every cycle.” Back maintained his position, emphasizing the conditional nature of his prediction: “I said ‘if,’ and that market doesn’t believe it so far.” Adding another layer to the unfolding narrative, Dennis Porter, CEO and founder of the Satoshi Act Fund—a US nonprofit advocating for Bitcoin adoption—claimed on November 18 that Donald Trump’s team is considering an executive order to establish a national SBR, as Bitcoinist reported. “I’ve heard that the Trump team is considering an Executive Order for a National ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ in order to beat any state from passing it into law first,” Porter disclosed via X. “I can confirm that US Senate offices are backing this plan up. Game on President Trump. The race is on.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market Is Still In An ‘Healthy Growth’ Phase, Says Analyst—Here’s Why Porter, deeply involved in legislative efforts surrounding Bitcoin adoption, noted that his information stems from “private conversations with people familiar” with the matter and his direct involvement in promoting SBR language across the United States and internationally. Notably, it is crucial to distinguish between the proposals being discussed. Porter’s reference to Trump’s consideration pertains to an executive order that would establish a national SBR. This contrasts with Trump’s previous suggestion at the Bitcoin 2024 conference to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve by retaining all “seized coins” obtained through law enforcement actions. Furthermore, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the Bitcoin Act, which proposes the US government purchase 1 million BTC over five years, allocating 200,000 BTC per year. Addressing this legislative initiative, Back commented on a Polymarket prediction market screenshot showing a 36% chance for “Will Trump create a national Bitcoin reserve?” He clarified, “Optimistic IMO and depends on what they mean. ‘Not selling seized coins’ is very different from Senator Lummis’ SBR bill to buy 1 million BTC.” The latter could send the Bitcoin price skyrocketing. Back highlighted the logistical challenges of such a substantial acquisition: “There’s no good way to buy 1 million BTC other than very, very quietly. Even then, once it leaks, the entire world gets FOMO and a price teleport happens.” At press time, BTC traded at $92,329.

As the blockchain ecosystem gains traction, both analysts and investors are beginning to pay attention. This surge reflects the growing appeal of its blockchain, which offers fast, low-cost transactions, making it an attractive option for decentralized applications (DApps) and developers searching for a more efficient platform. Related Reading: Poland Could Lead With Bitcoin Reserve, Presidential Hopeful Says Solana’s value boost isn’t temporary. It signals a bigger trend in cryptocurrency investing toward alternative financial systems. As blockchain usage grows, Solana leads due to its technical skills and growing recognition of its possibilities. DeFi Hotspot: Solana’s Growing Influence It’s hard to overlook Solana’s rapid proliferation in decentralized finances (DeFi). On November 17, the network’s infrastructures were credited with among crypto’s highest processed fees to date. Five of the ten most significant fee-charging platforms were built on the Solana blockchain. Raydium, a famous automated market maker, led the list with over $11 million in fees, followed closely by Jito, a liquid staking protocol, with close to $10 million. The surge in activity is being fueled in part by the resurgence of memecoin craze, as investors return to the market with renewed enthusiasm. As the DeFi ecosystem on Solana grows, its capacity to execute massive transaction volumes without breaking the bank positions it as a leading contender in the fast developing blockchain race. Price Predictions: Will Solana Reach $400? With the given upward momentum, analysts are becoming more positive about the Solana prospects. Titan of Crypto has also commented that SOL can possibly reach $400 as it seems to be creating a break out pattern. This pattern is known as Cup & Handle and is seen as a positive signal for further gains, especially when Solana hits its all-time high. #Altcoins #SOL $400 is next! 🚀#Solana is breaking out from the Cup & Handle pattern on the monthly timeframe. Once it clears its previous ATH, it could soar straight to $400! pic.twitter.com/CILozp95uN — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) November 17, 2024 Another famous figure in the crypto field, Peter Brandt, has expressed similar comments, saying that Solana’s swing upward will drive its price further higher. Solana’s recent performance supports these predictions—only this week, SOL achieved a high of $248, representing an 11% increase in just seven days. SOL, at the time of writing, was trading at $246. Often times price moves in swings whereby the swings are relatively equal in price. I am sure Elliott traders get quite precise (as they tend to do ) but I just use swing targets as a guide pic.twitter.com/QBGzOAZTHi — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) November 18, 2024 Solana’s surge has also enabled it to surpass Binance Coin (BNB) in market capitalization, cementing its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. This confirms its position as one of the most powerful players in the industry, putting it on course to compete with other important assets, such as the stablecoin USDT. Related Reading: XRP On Fire: Over 90% Weekly Growth Catapults Altcoin To Fresh 2-Year High The Road Ahead For Solana However, Solana seems to be poised to continue upward momentum in the future. Solana is very well positioned for future growth thanks to great performance in the DeFi sector, favorable price expectations, and ever-increasing market capitalization. If it is able to maintain the level of performance at present and attract even more developers and users to its ecosystem, then it play an even more important role in the blockchain world in months and years to come.
