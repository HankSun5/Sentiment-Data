This alarming omission raises questions about AI transparency and the tech giant’s commitment to responsible AI development. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-watchers alike, this development in the AI space is crucial, as AI’s increasing influence can have far-reaching implications across various sectors, including blockchain and digital currencies. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s causing ripples. Unpacking the GPT-4.1 Launch and the Missing Safety Report Omission On Monday, OpenAI unveiled GPT-4.1, boasting enhanced performance over its predecessors, particularly in programming benchmarks. While the performance upgrades are noteworthy, the conspicuous absence of a safety report – traditionally a standard accompaniment to OpenAI’s model releases – has become the focal point. These reports, often termed ‘system cards,’ detail the rigorous safety evaluations conducted on AI models, offering insights into potential risks and mitigation strategies. However, for GPT-4.1, this crucial piece of documentation is nowhere to be found. When questioned by Bitcoin World, an OpenAI spokesperson stated that GPT-4.1 is not considered a ‘frontier model,’ hence justifying the lack of a dedicated system card. This explanation, however, hasn’t quelled concerns, especially given the industry norm of prioritizing AI safety and transparency. Why AI Transparency Matters: The Industry Standard Safety reports serve as a vital tool for AI transparency . They typically include: Internal Testing Details: Outlining the types of tests conducted by the AI lab itself to assess the model’s safety. Third-Party Evaluations: Incorporating assessments from external partners, adding an independent layer of scrutiny. Potential Risks: Openly acknowledging and detailing potential downsides, such as the model’s propensity for deception or harmful persuasiveness. Good Faith Effort: These reports are generally viewed by the AI community as genuine attempts to foster independent research and red teaming efforts, crucial for identifying and mitigating risks. In essence, these reports are the AI industry’s benchmark for demonstrating accountability and a commitment to AI safety . The absence of such a report for GPT-4.1 is a deviation from this established norm, prompting unease among safety researchers and industry observers. Lowered Reporting Standards: A Growing Trend? Unfortunately, OpenAI isn’t alone in facing criticism over reporting standards. Several leading AI labs have seemingly been scaling back their transparency efforts in recent months, leading to backlash from the AI safety research community. Google’s Delays: Some tech giants have been slow in releasing safety reports, raising questions about their commitment to timely transparency. Lack of Detail: Even when reports are published, they sometimes lack the comprehensive detail that was once standard, making thorough evaluation challenging. OpenAI’s Past Issues: OpenAI itself has faced scrutiny. A previous safety report in December was criticized for presenting benchmark results from a different model version than the one actually deployed. Furthermore, the system card for their ‘deep research’ model was released weeks after the model itself launched. This apparent trend towards reduced transparency is concerning, particularly as AI models become more powerful and integrated into various aspects of our lives. AI Model Release and Voluntary Transparency: A Double-Edged Sword Steven Adler, a former OpenAI safety researcher, points out a critical aspect: safety reports are not legally mandated. They are voluntary commitments made by AI companies. While this allows for flexibility, it also creates a potential loophole. OpenAI has publicly committed to transparency, even highlighting system cards as a ‘key part’ of their accountability approach in a blog post preceding the UK AI Safety Summit in 2023. They further emphasized the value of system cards in providing insights into model risks leading up to the Paris AI Action Summit in 2025. Adler aptly summarizes, “System cards are the AI industry’s main tool for transparency and for describing what safety testing was done. Today’s transparency norms and commitments are ultimately voluntary, so it is up to each AI company to decide whether or when to release a system card for a given model.” This voluntary nature places the onus on companies like OpenAI to uphold their self-imposed standards of AI transparency . Concerns Mount Amidst Safety Practice Scrutiny The decision to ship GPT-4.1 without a system card comes at a sensitive time. Current and former OpenAI employees are increasingly voicing concerns about the company’s AI safety practices. Just last week, Adler and eleven other ex-OpenAI employees filed an amicus brief in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, arguing that a for-profit OpenAI might be incentivized to compromise on safety measures. Recent reports in the Financial Times further suggest that competitive pressures are pushing OpenAI to reduce the time and resources allocated to safety testing. This alleged shift in priorities amplifies the significance of the missing safety report for GPT-4.1. Performance Gains and Heightened Risk: A Critical Juncture for AI Safety While GPT-4.1 may not be OpenAI’s most powerful model overall, it boasts substantial improvements in efficiency and latency. Thomas Woodside, co-founder and policy analyst at Secure AI Project, highlights that these performance enhancements actually make a safety report even more critical. His reasoning is straightforward: greater sophistication in a model often translates to higher potential risks. The increasing capabilities of AI models necessitate robust AI safety measures and transparent reporting. However, many AI labs, including OpenAI, have resisted legislative efforts to codify safety reporting requirements. OpenAI, for instance, opposed California’s SB 1047, which would have mandated safety evaluations and public reporting for many AI developers. Conclusion: The Path Forward for AI Transparency OpenAI’s launch of GPT-4.1 without a safety report marks a concerning deviation from established industry norms. While the company justifies this decision by categorizing GPT-4.1 as non-frontier, the absence of a system card raises valid questions about AI transparency and commitment to AI safety . As AI models become more integrated into our world, especially in sectors like cryptocurrency and finance, the need for robust safety evaluations and open reporting becomes paramount. The industry stands at a crucial juncture, where voluntary commitments to transparency must be reinforced by consistent action and perhaps, eventually, by more formalized standards to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.

The stablecoin market, already a vibrant space, is about to get even more dynamic. Industry experts at Fireblocks are signaling a major escalation in stablecoin competition , with traditional financial powerhouses like banks and payment firms gearing up to launch their own digital currencies. What does this mean for the future of finance and the crypto landscape? Let’s dive in and explore this exciting development. Why is Stablecoin Competition Heating Up? According to Ran Goldi, SVP of payments at Fireblocks, we’re on the cusp of a new era in the stablecoin market. Several factors are converging to fuel this stablecoin competition : Regulatory Tailwinds: The regulatory landscape is becoming clearer, especially in regions like the EU with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Pending legislation in the U.S. is also providing a framework for banks and financial institutions to operate within the crypto space. This clarity is giving institutions the confidence to move forward with their stablecoin strategies. Growing Demand for Digital Payments: The need for efficient and cost-effective cross-border payments is rising. Stablecoins offer a compelling solution, providing faster transaction times and lower fees compared to traditional systems. Technological Maturity: Blockchain technology and stablecoin infrastructure have matured significantly, making it easier and safer for banks and payment firms to launch and manage digital currencies. Goldi predicts a surge in stablecoin offerings, estimating as many as 50 new stablecoins could emerge by the end of the year. This influx of new players will undoubtedly intensify the stablecoin competition and reshape the market. Bank Stablecoins: A New Era of Digital Currency? The entry of banks into the stablecoin arena is a game-changer. For years, the crypto market has been largely dominated by decentralized players. Now, traditional financial institutions are stepping in, bringing with them trust, regulatory compliance, and vast customer networks. But what exactly are bank stablecoins , and what advantages do they offer? Bank stablecoins are digital currencies issued by regulated banks and pegged to a fiat currency, typically the US dollar or Euro. This backing by traditional banks provides a level of security and stability that some perceive as lacking in purely crypto-native stablecoins. Here’s a breakdown of the potential benefits: Benefit Description Enhanced Trust and Security Backed by regulated banks, offering greater assurance and consumer protection. Regulatory Compliance Designed to meet stringent regulatory requirements, reducing compliance burdens for users. Integration with Traditional Finance Seamless integration with existing banking infrastructure and payment systems. Wider Adoption Potential Banks’ established customer base and brand recognition can accelerate stablecoin adoption. However, the rise of bank stablecoins also presents challenges. Interoperability between different stablecoin platforms and ensuring robust security protocols will be crucial for widespread adoption. Moreover, the regulatory landscape is still evolving, and banks will need to navigate complex compliance requirements across different jurisdictions. Stablecoin Regulation: MiCA and Beyond Regulation is playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of stablecoins. The EU’s MiCA regulation is a landmark piece of legislation that provides a comprehensive framework for crypto-assets, including stablecoins. MiCA aims to foster innovation while mitigating risks, and it’s already influencing how stablecoin issuers operate in Europe and beyond. Key aspects of stablecoin regulation under MiCA include: Licensing Requirements: Issuers of significant stablecoins will need to obtain licenses and adhere to strict operational and capital requirements. Reserve Requirements: Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves to back their tokens, ensuring they can meet redemption requests. Consumer Protection: MiCA includes measures to protect consumers, such as transparency requirements and mechanisms for dispute resolution. In the United States, while there isn’t a single, comprehensive federal framework yet, various agencies are actively working on stablecoin regulation. Pending legislation is expected to bring more clarity and potentially pave the way for broader adoption of digital currency and stablecoins within the U.S. financial system. The Power of Crypto Payments: Cross-Border Transactions and Beyond One of the most compelling use cases for stablecoins is in crypto payments , particularly for cross-border transactions. Traditional cross-border payments can be slow, expensive, and involve multiple intermediaries. Stablecoins offer a faster, cheaper, and more efficient alternative. Goldi highlighted the increasing use of stablecoins in cross-border payments, noting that banks in Brazil and Singapore are already actively utilizing them. This real-world adoption underscores the practical benefits of crypto payments for businesses and individuals engaged in international trade and remittances. While USDT (Tether) currently dominates the global stablecoin market, USDC (USD Coin) is positioning itself to gain ground, particularly in Europe, due to its licensing under MiCA. The regulatory clarity provided by MiCA could give USDC a competitive edge in the European market and beyond. Navigating the Digital Currency Landscape: What’s Next? The digital currency landscape is evolving rapidly, and the intensifying stablecoin competition is a key driver of this change. Banks and payment firms are not just dipping their toes in the water; many are actively developing strategies for stablecoin adoption and implementation. CoinDesk reports that numerous banks are currently drafting stablecoin strategies, with actual implementations expected to begin as early as 2026. This timeline suggests that we are still in the early stages of this transformation, but the momentum is building. Key Takeaways for Navigating this Evolving Landscape: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, particularly in regions relevant to your business or interests. Explore Stablecoin Options: Evaluate different stablecoins and their suitability for your payment needs, considering factors like regulation, security, and interoperability. Prepare for Change: The financial landscape is shifting. Businesses and individuals should prepare for increased adoption of digital currencies and explore how stablecoins can enhance their operations. Engage with the Ecosystem: Participate in industry discussions, attend conferences, and network with experts to gain deeper insights into the evolving stablecoin market. The stablecoin market is poised for explosive growth and innovation. As banks and payment firms enter the fray, stablecoin competition will intensify, driving further development and adoption of digital currency solutions. This is a space to watch closely, as it promises to reshape the future of finance and payments.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-massive-xrp-price-breakout-incoming-heres-why/,"XRP may be on the verge of a dramatic price breakout, according to crypto market analyst Amonyx, who predicted a “massive” upward move in the coming sessions. As technical signals and on-chain metrics begin to align, the digital asset appears to be approaching a critical inflection point—one that could redefine its short-term trajectory and possibly send shockwaves through the broader altcoin market. MASSIVE $XRP BREAKOUT INCOMING!!! pic.twitter.com/GfL6kLjzdY — Amonyx (@amonbuy) April 15, 2025 Technical Indicators Signal Imminent Breakout Amonyx’s analysis is underpinned by classic technical breakout principles. XRP has recently been consolidating within a narrowing range, forming what many chartists identify as a bullish continuation pattern, such as a symmetrical triangle or ascending triangle—both of which historically precede upward breakouts when supported by volume and momentum indicators. Price action is tightening, volatility is compressing, and XRP is hovering just below resistance levels that have previously capped its rallies. These conditions often serve as the prelude to explosive price movements, especially when investor sentiment starts leaning bullish. Momentum Building Across Key Market Metrics In tandem with the technical picture, there is growing evidence of heightened interest in XRP across various market layers. Trading volume has begun to swell, suggesting increasing participation. Derivatives markets have also seen rising open interest and bullish bias , indicating that institutional and high-leverage traders are anticipating movement. Moreover, on-chain data reveals renewed activity among whale addresses and long-dormant holders—an encouraging signal that large players may be positioning ahead of what they expect to be a significant shift in price action. Macro and Fundamental Tailwinds While technical and on-chain signals point to near-term momentum, macro-fundamental factors could provide the necessary fuel for a sustained rally. XRP continues to benefit from positive developments within the Ripple ecosystem, particularly its expanding global partnerships and potential future involvement in regulated digital payment infrastructure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, as discussions around tokenization, stablecoins, and CBDCs gain traction among central banks and financial institutions, XRP’s use case as a bridge currency positions it strategically at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain. The Sentiment Factor: Cautious Optimism or Euphoria? Despite the building pressure, traders and investors remain divided on whether this is the breakout that finally propels XRP back toward previous all-time highs—or just another false start in a long consolidation. Amonyx, however, remains confident that the current setup is unlike past attempts, emphasizing the strength of supporting signals and the broader market’s readiness to rotate into large-cap altcoins. If the breakout materializes, it could trigger a wave of FOMO (fear of missing out), drawing in sidelined capital and amplifying the rally further. As always, volume confirmation and the ability to flip resistance into support will be critical in validating the move. With technicals coiling, sentiment shifting, and macro narratives aligning, XRP is entering a pivotal phase that could result in substantial price action. While caution is always warranted in volatile markets, Amonyx’s forecast is backed by a confluence of data points that suggest XRP is not just knocking on the door of a breakout—it’s about to kick it open. For now, all eyes remain on the charts. The next move could be historic. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Musk’s dual role as a business magnate and government official is reigniting debates over where ethical lines should be drawn when private-sector leaders step into public power. Lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren are pushing for tighter oversight of special government employees. Over 50% of Americans believe Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk and tech companies overall have too much influence on U.S. government, according to a new poll this week from UMass Amherst. New Poll Finds Majority Believe Musk Influences Federal Government Too Much Conducted from April 4 through to April 9 , the poll found that over half of the U.S. believes Musk, tech companies, and Wall Street at large wield too much influence over the federal government under U.S. President Donald Trump. Majority of Americans Distrust Elon Musk’s Efforts to Cut Federal Spending, New National UMass Amherst Poll Finds : UMass Amherst https://t.co/0pLkdRWC5o — UMass Poll (@UMassPoll) April 15, 2025 Meanwhile, 59% of surveyed participants said that they had little to no trust that Musk would not use his position of power to benefit his own business interests. “Only three months into his tenure at DOGE, questions concerning Musk’s conflict of interests, his legal authority to cut federal programs, and the actual budgetary savings that DOGE has elicited continue to swirl,” says the poll’s director, Professor Tatishe Nteta. “Given the unpopularity of Musk’s efforts to rein in federal spending, it is no surprise that many expect Musk to return to his businesses and to put Washington, D.C., in his rearview mirror,” he added. Democratic U.S. Lawmakers Push Back Musk, who has been a proponent of cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin in the past, has faced widespread backlash for his new position in Trump’s administration. The SpaceX founder has largely spearheaded a campaign directed at cutting government regulations in a bid to curb America’s excess spending, though critics argue his role goes too far. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who recently urged the Department of Justice to reverse its decision to disband its crypto enforcement, co-sponsored a bill on Monday that would order ethics checks on special government employees like Musk. Trump, meanwhile, has also faced criticism for his business affiliations while in the Oval Office, with Fortune reporting Tuesday that he will launch his own crypto-infused, Monopoly style real estate game.

Coyne now faces nearly a decade behind bars which shows the growing stakes for cybercriminals. The continued rise of phishing—now infiltrating even government officials’ accounts—shows that cybercriminal networks remain highly active and dangerously effective. According to a press release on April 14 from England and Wales top prosecution agency, the Crown Prosecution Service, British citizen Zak Coyne has been sentenced to almost a decade prison for operating a phishing service intended to generate scams for fraudsters. Labhost’s Zak Coyne Profited Off Of Laundered Crypto The press release stated that Coyne played an “integral role in the creation, operation and administration” of Labhost, a one-stop phishing as a service site for scammers. Zak Coyne, 24, facilitated extensive fraudulent conduct worldwide by creating and running a 'one-stop shop for phishing' online. Today he has been sentenced. https://t.co/YLfp6rGVGs pic.twitter.com/nEM2A2IeDH — Crown Prosecution Service (@CPSUK) April 14, 2025 Coyne, who received $230,000 worth of laundered cryptocurrency for “designing and administering” Labhost’s website, was apprehended at Manchester Airport on Monday. Users of Labhost would pay a monthly service and in turn garner access to websites that appeared to be legitimate government, commercial and banking URLs they could then use to defraud unsuspecting victims. The massive scheme saw over one million victims in 91 countries defrauded, with losses of victims in the U.K. accounting for £32 million ($42 million USD). Coyne pleaded guilty to one count of making or supplying articles for use in fraud, one count of encouraging or assisting the commission of an offense and one count of transferring criminal property at Manchester Crown Court. “This was a sophisticated worldwide criminal enterprise which enabled others to perpetrate fraud on a massive scale, resulting in losses totalling more than £100 million,” Thomas Short, Specialist Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said. “Fraud is far from a victimless crime and the harm caused by Coyne’s offending are measured not just in monetary terms, but also in the distress inflicted on countless victims who fell prey to these scams,” he added. Phishing Scams Continue To Pervade Society News of Coyne’s arrest and subsequent guilty plea comes amid the concerning continuation of phishing attacks at large, with 48% all emails in 2022 found to be spam. On Tuesday, the BBC reported that Government Minister Lucy Powell’s X accunt had been hacked to promote a cryptocurrency scam . Overall, Coyne’s conviction shows the growing international efforts to crack down on cyber-enabled fraud, as authorities grapple with the rising tide of phishing scams that continue to exploit millions of victims worldwide.

Bitcoin has been known for its high volatility and sharp price swings, but data from Nasdaq composites volatility over the past 30 days shows that it surpassed Bitcoin for the first time last week after President Trump reportedly put a hold on tariffs for most countries apart from China for 90 days. For China, Trump increased the tariffs targeting the country. High volatility in the cryptocurrency space has been a constant feature and it’s one of the few things that set’s it apart from the equities market. However, recent trends show that it’s gradually changing as pointed out by industry observers. The volatility landscape is changing For the first time in a long time, Nasdaq’s 21-day realized volatility overtook Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility, reaching 59.8% compared to Bitcoin’s 46.4% on April 10, according to data from Dow Jones Market Data. It’s important to note that Bitcoin trades around the clock, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, while U.S. equities only trade on weekdays from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. ET. This wider trading window can sometimes smooth out extreme fluctuations in crypto as pointed out by analysts. However, the market experienced some resurgence on Monday, ending on a high note after the Trump administration announced that it would exempt smartphones, electronic integrated circuits, and some consumer-electronics products as well as machines used in making semiconductors from the tariffs. Although the White House has added that these exemptions were temporary. Analysts have also pointed out that tariffs affect the stock market directly as they impact the actual companies listed there and their profit margins, which in turn impacts consumer and investors’ confidence. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is relatively insulated or not as impacted by the effects of tariffs. Greg Magadini, the director of derivatives at crypto-data platform Amberdata, has also highlighted another guardrail for Bitcoin’s volatility. Magadini noted that Bitcoin’s volatility has been on a decline in part due to institutional involvement, especially after the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year. Policy stability and regulatory shift may be the answer The Donald Trump administration is known to have a pro-crypto regulatory stance, which stakeholders also see as influential in relatively stabilizing Bitcoin. The president signed executive orders to create a federal framework for digital asset regulation and even proposed the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve . Trump’s stance on crypto marks a major shift from the Biden administration. Under the new administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dismissed lawsuits against several crypto companies, and the President has pardoned some players in the crypto space convicted for crypto-related crimes, such as former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. The reduction of speculative volatility may be attributed to these moves boosting institutional confidence in Bitcoin. While it remains to be seen whether this trend continues, the recent convergence in volatility between equities and Bitcoin suggests a changing narrative.

His message, though unconventional, taps into a long-standing tradition in the XRP community, where speculation often dances with mythology and pattern recognition in pursuit of the truth. Ok here is the real moon date joking around aside! Can I tell the world Pee? APRIL 19: The XRP Phoenix Rises — A Master Decode Alright Riddlers, XRP Army, and anyone still paying attention… the clues have been in plain sight. Here’s why I believe April 19, 2025, is the XRP… pic.twitter.com/hocS5MbPjV — David Rule (@XRPFREEE) April 14, 2025 The Resurrection Framework and Biblical Parallels Rule begins his argument by anchoring his timeline in biblical resurrection imagery. Referring to John 11:39, where Lazarus had been dead for four days before being resurrected, he draws a symbolic parallel to April 15 as the “death” point, representing systemic collapse or symbolic transformation. Four days after this, April 19 becomes the date of rebirth, or in XRP terms, the day the “Phoenix rises.” This motif, recurrent in XRP lore, aligns with the idea of rebirth after destruction—echoing Ripple’s ongoing battle for regulatory clarity and its hoped-for transformation into the financial standard. Mr. Pool and the Cryptic Timestamp A key anchor in David’s decode is a Mr. Pool post from April 3, 2022, which displayed the reversed phrase “NATIONAL YCNEGREME” (National Emergency). Posted at 5:46 PM, Rule uses riddler logic to flip and reduce the timestamp, ultimately calculating the number 18—a suggested nod to April 18 as the date of a global emergency broadcast or financial event. Following that, April 19 becomes the logical “aftershock,” the moment of emergence from chaos. David suggests this aligns with the archetypal “Order out of Chaos” narrative, frequently cited in esoteric and occult traditions. The Numerological Argument and the 36 Code Using a combination of number flips and summations, David decodes April 19 (4/19) into the number 36—a number repeatedly referenced in XRP riddler circles. The number is derived through symbolic inversions (e.g., flipping 9 to 6, subtracting and adding digits) that reflect a common theme in this subculture: hidden meanings beneath the surface. Notably, David draws attention to how XRP itself is numerologically encoded with 36, further reinforcing his thesis that April 19 is more than a date—it is a symbolic cipher. Astrological and Esoteric Timelines Astrology also plays a central role in David’s code. April 19 marks the final anaretic degree of Aries—considered one of the most potent and karmically charged degrees in the zodiac. It represents a threshold moment, when fire gives way to earth as Taurus begins—a sign historically linked to finance, stability, and material wealth. Combined with the shifting moon into Taurus, Rule suggests the cosmic alignment points toward massive movement in assets like XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He also ties the date to the occult calendar, specifically the “blood sacrifice to the beast” window from April 19 to May 1, known in esoteric circles as a time of both chaos and ritual rebirth. Rule argues that Mr. Pool’s apocalyptic imagery—cities burning, phoenix symbolism, digital resets—all mirror this arc of destruction leading to renewal. Riddler Visuals and BG123’s Confirmation No XRP moon date decode would be complete without mentioning BearableGuy123 (BG123), the mysterious figure behind many of the XRP community’s most famous riddles. David Rule points to one of BG123’s visuals showing a rocket passing a star—interpreted as April—before shooting into space. Combined with consistent references to 19s, 36s, and mirrored clocks, Rule believes BG123 visually endorsed this exact timeline for XRP’s ascension. A Convergence of Codes and Culture For seasoned XRP followers, this decode by David Rule is more than numerology or internet riddles—it’s a cultural narrative, woven with deep symbolism and a sense of prophetic destiny. While critics might brush off such theories as speculative fiction, the XRP community has long embraced this unique blend of logic, pattern recognition, and metaphorical language to navigate a market that often defies conventional analysis. In sum, Rule’s breakdown presents April 19, 2025, as the culmination of hidden signals, time-tested symbolism, and spiritual metaphor. It’s the day the phoenix rises, the financial reset begins, and XRP fulfills its long-awaited potential. Whether one believes in riddler logic or not, one thing is certain: the date is now etched in XRP folklore. Bookmark it. Watch it. April 19.

While OpenAI’s Sora has garnered significant attention for its impressive capabilities, and Runway is a well-established player with its Gen-series models, Google’s entry with Veo 2 is a powerful statement. Let’s briefly compare these key players: Sora (OpenAI): Known for its highly realistic and cinematic video outputs, Sora is still in limited access and not yet widely available to the public. Its capabilities are impressive, but accessibility remains a question. Runway Gen-4: Runway has been a pioneer in AI video tools, offering a range of features and a more accessible platform. Gen-4 represents their latest advancement, focusing on enhanced realism and control. Veo 2 (Google): With its integration into Gemini Advanced, Veo 2 prioritizes accessibility and user-friendliness. While initial outputs might be considered “basic” compared to Sora’s cinematic quality, Veo 2’s strength lies in its immediate availability and integration within the Google ecosystem. The competition is beneficial for users, driving innovation and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with AI video . Each platform offers unique strengths, and the choice will likely depend on user needs, technical expertise, and desired output quality. The Power and Limitations of Veo 2’s Video Generation Capabilities Currently, Veo 2 offers a taste of the potential of AI video generation .

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has hinted at future integrations between Gemini AI models and Veo, aiming to enhance Gemini’s “understanding of the physical world.” This suggests that Veo 2 is just the first step in a more ambitious roadmap for Google’s AI video capabilities. Current Limitations of Veo 2: Video Length: Limited to 8-second clips. Resolution: 720p resolution may not be sufficient for all professional applications. Access Restrictions: Currently limited to Gemini Advanced subscribers and personal accounts. Monthly Limits: Users are subject to monthly video creation limits. Despite these limitations, Veo 2 provides a powerful entry point into AI video generation for Gemini Advanced users. The ease of use, direct integration, and sharing capabilities make it a valuable tool for experimenting with and understanding the potential of this technology. Ethical Implications and the Future of AI Video Generation The rise of AI video generation technologies like Veo 2 also brings forth important ethical considerations and potential disruptions to creative industries. Concerns about job displacement, misinformation, and the authenticity of digital content are increasingly relevant. A recent study by the Animation Guild highlights these worries, estimating that over 100,000 jobs in the US film, television, and animation sectors could be disrupted by AI by 2026. These concerns are valid and warrant careful consideration as AI video technology evolves. Watermarking technologies like Google’s SynthID are a step in the right direction to address authenticity, but broader discussions around ethical guidelines, responsible use, and workforce adaptation are crucial to navigate the impact of AI video generation on society and the creative economy. Key Ethical and Future Considerations: Job Displacement: Impact on creative professions and the need for workforce adaptation. Misinformation: Potential for misuse in creating fake or misleading video content. Authenticity: Ensuring the provenance and authenticity of AI-generated videos. Ethical Guidelines: Developing industry standards and ethical frameworks for AI video generation . Future Enhancements: Continued development towards higher resolution, longer videos, and more sophisticated creative controls. Google AI ’s move to bring Veo 2 to Gemini Advanced is a significant milestone in the evolution of video generation . While still in its early stages, Veo 2 offers a glimpse into a future where creating compelling video content becomes more accessible and democratized. As competition intensifies and technology advances, the world of AI video is poised for rapid transformation, presenting both exciting opportunities and critical challenges for creators, industries, and society as a whole.

This sudden liquidation has put the asset in a bearish condition, plunging under $1. After reestablishing support above the $5.6 level to form a new bullish pattern last week, OM bounced back and increased well. The buying was short-lived under $7 due to a rejection, and the price dropped briefly into a calm phase for days. Unfortunately, that week ended in pain following a sudden massive crash below $1 within an hour, sparking roughly 100% loss in a single day. According to JP Mullin, the co-founder and the CEO of Mantra protocol, the crash came as a result of “forced closures of positions”, citing timing and depth of the crash came as a result of insufficient warning or notice. While this scenario looks similar to that of the Luna and FTT collapse saga in 2021, history might be repeating itself with a similar pattern, as this could be an indication of a full-scale crypto bearish season as few altcoins might follow the trend in the next few days. Additionally, being one of the first tokens to kickstart bull run, with over 50x increase in a year, OM is among the best-performed altcoins with massive returns on investment during the bull cycle. But considering the latest crash to a year low, the bulls are trapped in a big loss, and from a technical standpoint, they may not recover from it. OM’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the bears are technically in control, reclaiming $0.465 and the recent yearly $0.37 low would be their next target. Breaking it could plunge the price to $0.2 and $0.1 in the near term. In case of a major recovery, the key level to keep in mind for a retest is $1. Right above this resistance lies the $2 and $3 levels.

Dioukarev's proposal comes amidst discussions in Sweden's Parliament about halting the sale of confiscated Bitcoin assets and instead accumulating them as part of the country's financial strategy. The move is seen as part of a broader trend of national interest in Bitcoin, especially as other countries, including the United States under the Trump administration, explore similar policies.

What if you could directly spend your crypto, seamlessly and globally? Well, get ready to ditch those conversion hassles because Solayer, the innovative Solana (SOL) re-staking protocol, is changing the game with their brand-new crypto debit card , the “Emerald Card”! Unveiling the Emerald Card: Your Gateway to Seamless Cryptocurrency Payments Solayer, known for its pioneering InfiniSVM infrastructure, has just announced the launch of the Emerald Card, a game-changing crypto debit card designed to simplify how you use your digital assets in the real world. According to reports from The Block, this card allows users to make purchases using cryptocurrencies without the need for immediate fiat conversion. This is a significant leap forward, bridging the gap between the crypto world and traditional commerce. Imagine paying for your morning coffee or your online shopping spree directly with your Solana or other supported cryptocurrencies – that’s the power the Emerald Card puts in your hands. Why is the Emerald Card a Game Changer for Cryptocurrency Payments? Let’s dive into what makes the Emerald Card stand out in the increasingly crowded crypto landscape: Direct Cryptocurrency Spending: The core benefit is clear – spend your cryptocurrency payments directly without the intermediary step of converting to fiat. This saves time, reduces potential fees, and simplifies the entire purchasing process. Global Reach: Availability in 100 countries, including the United States, is a massive win. This widespread accessibility ensures that a large global audience can benefit from this innovative crypto debit card . Seamless Integration: Compatibility with Apple Pay and Android Pay, along with tap-and-pay functionality, means the Emerald Card fits effortlessly into your existing payment habits. It’s designed for convenience and ease of use. InfiniSVM Infrastructure: Built on Solayer’s robust InfiniSVM infrastructure, the card benefits from a secure and efficient backbone, ensuring reliable transactions. Benefits of Using a Crypto Debit Card Like the Emerald Card The advantages of using a crypto debit card extend beyond mere convenience. Let’s explore some key benefits: Enhanced Financial Flexibility: Access and spend your crypto holdings just like traditional funds, providing greater control and flexibility over your assets. Reduced Conversion Fees: Bypass exchange fees associated with converting crypto to fiat for everyday spending. Wider Crypto Adoption: The Emerald Card promotes wider adoption of cryptocurrency payments by making them more accessible and user-friendly for daily transactions. Potential Rewards and Incentives: While not explicitly mentioned in the initial announcement, crypto debit cards often come with rewards programs, cashback, or other incentives, potentially adding extra value for users. (Further details on Emerald Card rewards are awaited). Potential Challenges and Considerations While the Emerald Card presents an exciting opportunity, it’s important to consider potential challenges and factors that users should be aware of: Challenge Consideration Regulatory Landscape: Cryptocurrency regulations vary significantly across countries. Users should be aware of the legal and tax implications of using a crypto debit card in their jurisdiction. Volatility of Cryptocurrencies: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate. Spending crypto directly means the purchasing power might change between the time of purchase and the actual transaction settlement. Adoption by Merchants: While the Emerald Card integrates with existing payment systems, widespread merchant adoption of cryptocurrency payments , in general, is still evolving. Security and Custody: Users need to understand how the card handles security and custody of their cryptocurrencies. It’s crucial to use reputable and secure platforms. Solana’s Expanding Ecosystem and the Role of Solayer Solayer’s launch of the Emerald Card further strengthens the Solana ecosystem. Solana has been gaining significant traction in the crypto space due to its high transaction speeds and lower fees compared to some other blockchains. Protocols like Solayer, built on Solana, are contributing to its growth by developing innovative applications and services. The Emerald Card is a prime example of how Solana’s infrastructure can be leveraged to create practical and user-centric cryptocurrency payments solutions. How to Get Your Hands on the Emerald Card? (Actionable Insights) While specific details on how to apply for the Emerald Card are yet to be fully released, here’s what you can do to stay informed and potentially be among the first users: Follow Solayer’s Official Channels: Keep an eye on Solayer’s official website, Twitter, and other social media channels for announcements regarding the Emerald Card launch, application process, and availability. Join the Solayer Community: Engage with the Solayer community on platforms like Telegram or Discord to get updates and insights from other users and the team. Sign Up for Notifications: Look for options to sign up for email newsletters or notifications on Solayer’s website to receive direct updates about the Emerald Card. The Future of Cryptocurrency Payments is Here Solayer’s Emerald Card is more than just another crypto debit card ; it’s a symbol of the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency payments . It represents a move towards greater accessibility, usability, and real-world application of digital assets. By eliminating the friction of fiat conversion and leveraging the speed and efficiency of the Solana blockchain, the Emerald Card paves the way for a future where spending crypto is as seamless and convenient as using traditional currencies.

Last month, Semler Scientific disclosed that it had received a civil investigative demand, or CID — essentially, a subpoena from a federal agency that typically precedes a lawsuit — from the DOJ back in 2017. The company at that time said it had complied with several subsequent subpoenas over the following years and began initial settlement discussions with the DOJ in February. That news, along with the decline in the price of bitcoin, had helped crater SMLR shares, which were lower by 37% year-to-date as of the close of trading on Tuesday. In today's disclosure, Semler said that it had inked an agreement with crypto exchange Coinbase allowing it to borrow both cash and digital assets, using its bitcoin holdings as collateral. If the company’s settlement agreement with the DOJ is approved, Semler “intends to borrow under the Coinbase master loan agreement and use such proceeds (along with its cash on hand) to pay the proposed settlement with DOJ.” Semler Scientific’s settlement agreement with the DOJ is in principle, meaning that it is not yet set in stone. Ready to restart bitcoin purchases With the DOJ cloud hanging over it, Semler had not added to its 3,192 bitcoin stack for more than two months, but that appears as if it will soon change. ""Excited to buy more bitcoin,"" tweeted company Chairman Eric Semler as the settlement (in principle) was announced.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors watching the tech landscape, the synergy between AI and cloud computing is undeniable. In a strategic move signaling deeper integration, AI startup Anthropic, backed by Amazon, has announced the formation of a dedicated team to accelerate the adoption of its AI products within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. This development underscores the exploding growth in the AI cloud sector and the intensifying competition among tech giants. Unveiling the Anthropic AWS Partnership Team: What’s the Big Deal? Anthropic’s creation of this new team isn’t just another corporate reshuffle; it’s a clear indicator of the escalating importance of their relationship with Amazon. Here’s a breakdown of why this news is significant: Dedicated Focus: This team is solely dedicated to growing Anthropic’s business within AWS. This concentrated effort suggests a serious commitment to leveraging AWS’s massive customer base. Revenue Driven: Job listings explicitly mention “multi-billion dollar revenue opportunities,” highlighting the immense financial stakes and expectations tied to this partnership. Strategic Alignment: The team will work closely with senior leadership from both Anthropic and Amazon, indicating a deeply integrated and strategically aligned approach. Global Scale: The initiative aims to build programs that scale across global markets, showcasing the ambition to establish Anthropic’s AI as a leading solution worldwide through the AWS infrastructure. This dedicated team is designed to be a growth engine, specifically targeting AWS customers to integrate Anthropic’s cutting-edge AI models, like the Claude family, into their operations. For those in the crypto space tracking technological advancements, this move exemplifies how AI infrastructure is being built on cloud platforms, mirroring the foundations of many blockchain projects. How Does This Impact AI Cloud Growth and the Competitive Landscape? The Anthropic AWS Partnership is a powerful combination with significant implications for the broader AI and cloud computing sectors. Consider these key impacts: Impact Area Description Accelerated AI Adoption By making Anthropic’s AI more readily accessible to AWS customers, this partnership will likely accelerate the overall adoption of advanced AI technologies across various industries. AWS Competitive Edge Exclusivity and optimized performance of Anthropic’s models on AWS Bedrock give Amazon a competitive advantage in attracting businesses seeking robust AI solutions. Anthropic Revenue Surge Leveraging AWS’s vast reach can propel Anthropic towards its ambitious revenue targets, aiming for $12 billion by 2027. Market Consolidation Concerns Regulatory bodies are scrutinizing these deep tech partnerships, raising questions about potential market dominance and reduced competition in the AI landscape. For crypto investors, the growth of the AI cloud growth sector is relevant as it represents a significant area of technological advancement and investment. Just as cloud infrastructure underpins much of the current internet, it is becoming the bedrock for the AI revolution. The success of companies like Anthropic and their partnerships with cloud giants like AWS will shape the future of AI accessibility and deployment. AWS AI Adoption : Why are Customers Turning to Anthropic? What makes Anthropic’s AI so appealing to AWS customers? Several factors are at play: Cutting-Edge Models: Anthropic’s Claude models are recognized for their advanced capabilities in natural language processing and understanding, attracting businesses needing sophisticated AI. AWS Bedrock Optimization: Anthropic has specifically optimized its models to run efficiently on AWS Bedrock, offering performance advantages and exclusive features. Seamless Integration: Collaborations with AWS partners like Accenture and Palantir streamline the integration of Anthropic’s AI into existing enterprise workflows via the AWS ecosystem. Proven Track Record: The fact that “tens of thousands” of Bedrock customers are already using Claude models speaks to the technology’s proven value and reliability. The ease of AWS AI adoption through platforms like Bedrock is a key driver for businesses. For the crypto community, this ease of access mirrors the ongoing efforts to simplify blockchain technology and cryptocurrency adoption for mainstream users. The Regulatory Gaze on Anthropic Revenue and Big Tech Partnerships While the Anthropic AWS Partnership promises growth and innovation, it’s also attracting regulatory scrutiny. Here’s what you need to know about the oversight: FTC Investigation: The Federal Trade Commission is examining the impacts of Big Tech investments in AI startups like Anthropic, concerned about competitive balance. CMA Scrutiny: The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority investigated whether Amazon’s partnership gives it undue influence over Anthropic. Focus on Lock-in and Data: Regulators are concerned that these partnerships could lead to vendor lock-in and the sharing of sensitive data, potentially undermining fair competition. No Enforcement (Yet): While concerns are present, neither the FTC nor CMA has initiated enforcement action against the Anthropic-Amazon deal so far. The regulatory landscape is crucial for the long-term trajectory of the AI industry. For crypto markets familiar with regulatory uncertainties, the scrutiny of Anthropic revenue streams and Big Tech influence is a familiar narrative. The balance between fostering innovation and ensuring fair competition remains a key challenge. Cloud AI Strategy : What Does This Mean for the Future? The Anthropic AWS Partnership is a microcosm of the broader cloud AI strategy being adopted by major tech players. Key takeaways for the future include: Cloud as the AI Platform: Cloud infrastructure is solidifying its position as the primary platform for developing, deploying, and scaling AI solutions. Strategic Alliances: Deep partnerships between AI specialists and cloud providers will become increasingly common to drive innovation and market reach. Focus on Enterprise Adoption: The focus is shifting towards making AI accessible and practical for enterprise applications, driving real-world business value. Continued Regulatory Scrutiny: Expect ongoing regulatory attention to ensure a competitive and fair AI market as these partnerships evolve. In conclusion, Anthropic’s dedicated AWS team signifies a major push to capitalize on the exploding AI cloud growth . This partnership is not just about two companies; it’s a bellwether for the direction of the AI industry, highlighting the crucial role of cloud platforms and strategic alliances in shaping the future of artificial intelligence. For those in the cryptocurrency world, understanding these technological shifts is vital as AI and blockchain technologies potentially converge and reshape industries in the years to come.

But despite its recent rally, a jump to $20 — a figure often thrown around by ultra-bullish holders — would require historic levels of market cap expansion and investor inflows. While XRP fights for every dollar of growth, a new contender is making waves with a much lower barrier to upside: MAGACOIN FINANCE , a fast-growing altcoin project catching the attention of traders and analysts alike. Here’s a quick look at where XRP stands right now: Current Price: $2.13 Intraday High: $2.21 Intraday Low: $2.08 24-Hour Change: +0.019% Despite solid price action, even the most optimistic analysts agree — reaching $20 would require XRP to become the second-largest asset in all of crypto. That’s a tall order. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering something far simpler: massive upside from a micro price. FROM $0.0002908 TO $0.007 — A STRAIGHTFORWARD 25X OPPORTUNITY MAGACOIN FINANCE recently SOLD OUT Stage 6 of its presale and is now gaining steam with Stage 7 LIVE . Its current presale price sits at $0.0002908 , with a confirmed listing target of $0.007 — translating to a direct 25x ROI , or 2,300% gain for early investors. That kind of return doesn’t require a billion-dollar market cap shift — it just takes continued presale momentum and strong post-listing demand. So far, the project is delivering both. Already trending in crypto news outlets , MAGACOIN FINANCE is now featured by major crypto publishers , with over 12,500 holders joining the movement in just a few weeks. WHY ANALYSTS CALL IT A NEXT 100X ALTCoin JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW The appeal isn’t just in the numbers. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as a textbook early-stage opportunity , with the kind of viral community traction and presale structure that helped previous breakout projects gain liftoff. Many experts believe a CMC listing is around the corner , further elevating visibility just as demand spikes heading into the final presale stages. XRP may or may not hit $20 — but MAGACOIN FINANCE doesn’t need to go anywhere near that to make millionaires. The path to 25x is already in place,” said one analyst in a recent April watchlist update. FINAL THOUGHT: DIFFERENT GAME, DIFFERENT TIMELINE 🔥 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER — ENDS SOON! USE MAGA50X XRP still holds long-term potential — but it’s a slow grind to the top. MAGACOIN FINANCE , on the other hand, is built for momentum now. With its low price point, massive upside potential, and strong pre-launch interest, it’s become one of the most talked-about tokens heading into Q2. With Stage 7 now LIVE , a presale price of just $0.0002908 , and a listing target of $0.007 , the setup is clear. You don’t need a $20 token when a 25x return is sitting right in front of you.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 149,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s weekly logarithmic moving average convergence divergence (LMACD) histogram indicator is starting to strengthen, signaling a possible rally. The LMACD histogram indicator is designed to signal changes in an asset’s trend, strength and momentum. Shrinking bars on the histogram suggest that an asset’s trend momentum is weakening. In Bitcoin’s case, the histogram’s declining red bars may indicate that a market reversal is in sight. Says Dave the Wave, “Bull markets climb a wall of worry. First strengthening histogram on the weekly BTC chart in 18 weeks/4.5 months. Weekly MACD itself has not been below the zero-line, in bear territory, since Feb 2023, i.e.; an ongoing bull market.

43387832,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=731865,1744761655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43387832.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Fails To Launch With $751 Million In Outflows, Are Institutions Cashing Out?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-sees-massive-outflows/,"The Bitcoin price continues to face headwinds, as the latest report on Digital Asset Fund Flows shows a staggering $751 million in outflows from the digital asset. The sheer volume of this withdrawal raises alarm bells about whether institutions may be cashing out from the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price Faces Pressure Amid Massive Outflows CoinShares’ weekly report on Digital Asset Fund Flows has disclosed a massive $795 million in outflows from the crypto market—shockingly, $751 million of which came from Bitcoin alone. This mass exodus marks one of the largest single-week outflows of the year, and it comes at a time when the price of Bitcoin has hit a wall. Related Reading: $9.41 Billion In Shorts At Risk Of Liquidation If Bitcoin Price Hits This Level James Butterfill, the Head of Research at CoinShares, revealed that since early February 2025, digital asset investment products have suffered cumulative outflows of approximately $7.2 billion, effectively erasing almost all the year-to-date inflows. Notably, this week marks the third consecutive week of declines, with Bitcoin leading the downturn and recording the most significant losses among major digital assets. As of this report, net flows for 2025 have dwindled to a modest $165 million, a sharp drop from a multi-billion dollar peak just two months ago. This steep decline underscores a cooling sentiment among institutional investors and highlights a growing sense of caution amid ongoing market volatility. Currently, the Bitcoin price is struggling to regain past all-time highs, with recent outflows serving as one of the many barriers hindering the cryptocurrency’s breakout potential. Until these outflows reverse and the market stabilizes, Bitcoin’s path to setting new all-time highs remains challenged. Despite losing $751 million in outflows, Bitcoin still maintains a moderately positive position with $545 million in net year-to-date inflows. However, the sheer scale and speed of the latest outflows raise concern. The fact that Bitcoin suffered such a massive withdrawal signals a potential shift in sentiment among institutions. Whether it’s due to profit-taking or macroeconomic uncertainty, this move suggests that big players are beginning to pull out — at least in the short term. In addition to Bitcoin, Ethereum saw $37 million in outflows, while Solana, Aave, and SUI also posted losses of $5.1 million, $0.78 million, and $0.58 million, respectively. Surprisingly, even short Bitcoin products, designed to benefit from market downturns, weren’t spared, recording $4.6 million in outflows. Tariffs And Political Volatility Drive Outflows One of the key drivers behind the pullback across digital assets is the rising economic uncertainty sparked by tariff policies that have adversely influenced investor sentiment. The wave of negative sentiment began in February after United States (US) President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on all imports coming into the country from Canada, Mexico, and China. Related Reading: Trump’s Tariff Pause Could Push Bitcoin Price Above $100,000, Pundit Reveals Exit Point However, a late-week rebound in crypto prices was seen after Trump’s temporary reversal of the controversial tariffs, providing a brief respite for the market. This policy shift helped boost total Asset Under Management (AUM) across digital assets from a low of $120 billion on April 8 to $130 billion, marking an 8% recovery.

While both coins remain in focus, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing broader attention after raising $214 million and posting a 2,380% rise in price. Now, its newly launched 600% Golden Ticket offer is drawing waves of new participants. With special airdrop access and a major global convention on the horizon, interest continues to climb. The highly anticipated 7th AMA, scheduled for April 17, has further added to the momentum surrounding what many now view as one of 2025’s most promising blockchain stories. Solana’s 16.7% Recovery Strengthens Confidence Among Big Players Solana’s price trend is beginning to shift in a positive direction. After retreating close to the $100 mark, it has climbed back by 16.7%, now holding steady above $120. Analysts link this upward move to renewed accumulation from major entities, highlighted by a recent $3.72 million SOL acquisition by a large whale—a strong show of faith in Solana’s future growth. Chart indicators back this optimism. Solana has established firm support above $100 and has moved past a key downward trendline at $107. The next notable zones to watch are $130 and $140, which may trigger further upside action. With its fast, low-cost framework still favored by developers, Solana continues to stand out as a key Layer-1 altcoin heading into the second quarter. Dogecoin Gears Up for Potential Breakout Toward $0.40 Dogecoin is showing early signs of building momentum. Currently trading near $0.14, it’s been consolidating tightly, with forecasts now pointing toward a jump to $0.21 or even a possible test of $0.40 if the trend holds. Technical markers like the RSI suggest bullish behavior is gaining ground, indicating an upward breakout could be forming. Excitement around Dogecoin has been revived by ETF rumors and rising usage across payment platforms. These developments are reigniting interest from retail buyers, especially as it nears key resistance levels. If these barriers are crossed, Dogecoin could reenter the spotlight with strong price action in the coming sessions. BlockDAG’s 600% Golden Ticket Pushes Presale Success Higher Beyond what’s happening with Solana and Dogecoin, BlockDAG’s achievements continue to set it apart. In just ten months, the project has generated $214 million in crypto presale funds while climbing 2,380% in price. But the latest move—the launch of its 600% Golden Ticket bonus—is taking things to a new level. Anyone joining the ecosystem with code BDAG1200 will receive 600% more coins, setting a new benchmark for presale incentives. Alongside this, participants will also receive early access to an exclusive coin airdrop, adding further appeal. These features, backed by strong project fundamentals, have pushed BlockDAG to the top of the Layer-1 conversations heading into 2025. The campaign is being actively highlighted ahead of the April 17 AMA, where the team plans to reveal fresh roadmap updates and strategic initiatives. There’s also strong excitement around the first BlockDAG Global Convention, which will move the discussion from digital platforms to live events in multiple cities. While the full schedule remains under wraps, those attending are expected to gain early exposure to various elements of the BlockDAG network. CEO Antony Turner, speaking during the third keynote, described the current phase by saying: “We’re not simply dreaming about the future—we’re shaping it, building it, and defining it with purpose and commitment.” The platform’s hybrid model—blending Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with Proof-of-Work (PoW)—delivers both scalability and security. This architecture enables parallel transaction handling without compromising on decentralization. With large-scale miner preparation already underway, BlockDAG is delivering the kind of performance many protocols only claim to provide. Final Words! Solana’s recent price growth and Dogecoin’s move toward key levels are both worth watching, but BlockDAG’s numbers already show strong traction. A 600% Golden Ticket bonus, $214 million raised, exclusive airdrops, and a fast-approaching AMA give this project real presence. People joining the platform are doing so for its performance, community rewards, and its practical use potential. From mining to long-term engagement and network activity, BlockDAG offers a wide range of features. As the Global Convention nears, the project continues to shift expectations for what a presale success can look like in 2025.

Its inclusion in the exchange’s second “Vote to Delist” program triggered strong community backlash and renewed discussion about privacy’s role in crypto. While voting remains open until April 16, 2025, but Binance’s final decision rests on internal checks like liquidity and development activity. Including Zcash for vote raised concerns, voiced by figures like Gemini Co-Founder Tyler Winklevoss, about exchanges sidelining privacy tech. Crypto advocate Zooko tagged Binance CEO Richard Teng, arguing Zcash’s inclusion is unjustified. Zcash is privacy technology that protects human rights. I hope @binance does not delist it.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell to $83,600, extending the retreat from the two-week high of $86,440 reached earlier in the day, CoinDesk data showed. Payments-focused XRP followed a similar trajectory, falling over 2% to $2.08, while Cardano's ADA token slipped 4% to $0.61. The CoinDesk 20 Index , a broader market gauge, weakened over 2%. Meanwhile, coins supposedly associated with artificial intelligence (AI) continued to fare worse as shares in NVDA tanked 8% to $89.10 after the company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it expects to write down $5.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter due to the new restrictions on exports of its H20 chip to China. The news came a day after unusual activity in NVDA put options pointing to an impending market swoon. The futures tied to the Nasdaq index fell over 1% as well, offering negative cues to risk assets in general. The next catalyst awaiting release Wednesday morning Eastern time is the U.S. retail sales report for March. Per economists polled by Dow Jones, the data is expected to show a 1.2% increase in consumer spending on the month, up from a 0.2% climb in February. A better-than-expected report will likely help assuage recession fears triggered by President Donald Trump's trade war with China and other trading partners. However, there is a risk that markets will dismiss it as backward-looking, failing to account for the major escalation in trade tensions seen this month. Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell is also scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago on his outlook for the U.S. economy. ""All eyes are on Powell. Markets are holding their breath for Powell on Wednesday. Between the trade war and rising recession chatter, traders are watching for any hint the Fed might be forced to cut sooner than expected,"" Secure Digital Markets said in Tuesday's research note. The forward-looking market-based measures like the inflation breakevens have dropped amid trade tensions, pointing to the disinflationary impact of Trump's tariffs. That could provide the Fed with a leeway to cut rates. Early this week, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the bank would be forced to quickly make a series of ""bad news"" rate cuts if the U.S. president reimposes the levies unveiled on April 2. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations on April 2 but quickly suspended the same for most nations, excluding China, for 90 days.

Mantra set aside 300 million OM, 16.88% of the token’s nearly 1.78 billion total supply, for its team and core contributors. They are currently locked and were scheduled to be released in stages between April 2027 and October 2029, according to an April 8 blog post. The team’s tokens are worth around $236 million, with OM currently trading around 78 cents but were worth around $1.89 billion before the token sank on April 13, going from around $6.30 to a low of 52 cents and wiping over $5.5 billion in value, according to CoinGecko. Source: JP Mullin Many community members welcomed Mullin’s pledge, but others saw the token burn as a potential blow to the team’s long-term commitment to building the real-world asset tokenization platform. “This would be a mistake. We want teams that are highly incentivized. Burning the incentive may seem like a good gesture but it will hurt the team motivation long term,” said Crypto Banter founder Ran Neuner. Mullin suggested a decentralized vote could determine whether to burn the 300 million team tokens. Mantra recovery process already underway Mullin promised a post-mortem statement explaining what went wrong to be transparent with the community. Speaking to Cointelegraph on April 14, Mullin outlined plans to leverage the $109 million Mantra Ecosystem Fund for potential token buybacks and burns to stabilize OM’s price, which had fallen from $6.30 to as low as $0.52. Related: Red flag? Mantra's TVL jumped 500% as OM price collapsed Mullin’s firm has strongly refuted rumors that it controls 90% of OM’s token supply and engaged in insider trading and market manipulation. Mantra claims the OM price implosion was triggered by “reckless liquidations,"" adding that it wasn’t related to any actions undertaken by the team. OKX and Binance were among the crypto exchanges that saw significant OM activity right before the token collapse. Both exchanges denied any wrongdoing, attributing the collapse to changes made to OM’s tokenomics in October and unusual volatility that ultimately triggered high-volume cross-exchange liquidations on April 13.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) together with Dogecoin (DOGE) benefit from whale accumulation and technical breakouts yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart as a presale project which combines DeFi utility and explosive growth dynamics. The Phase 4 presale of MUTM has drawn $6.8 million from 8,300 holders as the project aims for a 67% increase while DOGE seeks triple-digit gains and SHIB prepares for a similar climb. This demonstrates an investor movement toward operational financial crypto projects. Shiba Inu Nears Critical Resistance Shiba Inu (SHIB) challenges the crucial resistance point of $0.00001201 while awaiting a breakthrough to determine its forthcoming movement. Experts predict that breakout levels above the current barrier at $0.00001201 could spark a 67% price surge toward $0.00002 because of daily trading at $194 million. SHIB faces a challenge given that its $7.08 billion market value exists in spite of meme-based speculation when compared to new crypto systems offering defined infrastructure. The SHIB price moves with market sentiments combined with retail public opinion at present yet future investors in the MUTM presale can avoid volatility by using stepwise increasing price point tiers. Dogecoin Whales Fuel Optimism Dogecoin brought the price back to $0.16 which indicates that whales may create a 3x price rise to $0.50 as they buy 1.83 billion tokens worth $640.5 million. Dogecoin shows possible upward movement based on the falling wedge pattern combined with bullish RSI divergence but its price action remains controlled by macroeconomic trends and social media trending effects. Derivatives market open interest has risen 5.62 percent to $1.5 billion while this derivative lacks fundamental value which exposes it to intense market sentiment changes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a lending solution by using its mtTokens to drive organic demand and implementing revenue-dependent buyback strategies which mitigate market instabilities. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) established new presale standards through the sale of 405 million tokens at $0.025 during Phase 4. The start of Phase 5 sees Mutuum Finance increasing their token price from $0.03 which would give all current investors an instant 20% return before the platform goes live. The planned tokenomics will enable a 140% ROI at the $0.06 listing price followed by projected market developments that anticipate a price surge to $3.50 which represents a 13,900% increase from current market value. MUTM provides unique value as a decentralized lending protocol that generates interest through mtToken and stake rewards which builds continuous buying momentum unlike the absence in meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a Certik smart contract audit which will receive its official release soon. The investment community gains more confidence through this measure at the same time its pre-sales become increasingly popular thanks to new tracking tools monitoring the top 50 holders. Participants who hold their positions receive bonus items that encourage holding time through additional tokens while promoting price stability following the project launch. Getting In Fast In the Market Changes While SHIB and DOGE hinge on speculative rallies, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) merges DeFi innovation with presale urgency. Phase 4 offers a $0.025 entry point that is quickly disappearing which will significantly reduce possible profits for those who join during Phase 5. The initial positions taken by early supporters in the present moment give them the opportunity to enjoy a 140% upward movement at MUTM’s launch and onward exponential expansion when its lending system activates. The declining reputation of Cardano contrasts with these alternative cryptocurrencies which choose different directions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives investors a calculated DeFi entry ticket during Phase 5 while SHIB and DOGE represent a high-risk hype-centered opportunity. The time remains short for prospective investors who want to achieve first-mover advantage because Phase 4 has started and audits are approaching. Secure your position in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 4 today—before prices rise and tokens sell out.

ETFs will include staking via TD pic.twitter.com/FSw149Xkm4 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 14, 2025 Staking Features Could Boost Returns For Investors One of the main features distinguishing these Solana ETFs is their capacity for staking the underlying SOL positions. The OSC has allowed the issuers of ETFs to stake some portion of their Solana, and this could unlock extra returns for investors in excess of price appreciation alone. TD Bank reported that returns from staking SOL can be higher than those from Ethereum staking, and thus these products could be more appealing to yield-starved investors. The bank also referred to them as “the world’s first spot Solana ETFs,” emphasizing the innovative character of these financial products. US Solana ETF Market Experiences Mixed Results The US market so far has only futures-based Solana ETFs, with limited success. Balchunas noted that two SOL futures ETFs in the United States, Volatility Shares 2x SOL ETF and Volatility Shares SOL ETF, have failed to gain investor attention since their launch in March 2025. Both of these products have only accumulated a combined assets under management of nearly $14 million. For comparison, the Teucrium 2x XRP ETF performed better even though it came out later after the SOL products, implying unequal investor interest in disparate cryptocurrency ETFs.

He advised followers not to engage with the account until prominent attorney John Deaton could verify whether it had been compromised. “This post looks wrong in many ways. Please do not trust this until you see confirmation he hasn’t been hacked,” David Schwartz wrote . The warning followed a post by John Deaton on X touting Arch Public , a crypto-related website. To long-time followers, the post (tagging big names, including crypto exchange Gemini) came across as an endorsement and raised eyebrows. Recognized for his vocal, energetic defense of XRP holders and calls for regulatory clarity, including recent lobbying for the Hinman documents to see the light of day, Deaton usually sticks with legal skirmishes, policy wonkery, and the rights of crypto investors. By contrast, the Arch Public post came across as strange, with some market watchers finding its lack of background, explanation, or context that usually makes its way into his updates suspicious. Deaton breaks silence to reaffirm intentions, vows to address concerns in live session Ripple CTO urged the lawyer’s 354,000 followers to remain cautious following the suspicious post. His concern sparked reactions from other users. Many began questioning whether Deaton’s account had been taken over, especially with the unusually long silence. Others shared screenshots of the post, highlighting the red flags in its writing. Deaton later issued a clarification in response. He reiterated his devotion to democratizing investing for everyday people , a cause he argued has informed why he has backed projects like XRP, Bitcoin, SpendTheBits, and the free algorithm from ArchPublic. These projects, he said, were intended to give everyday investors access to opportunities that have traditionally been available only to the financial elite. Deaton acknowledged past criticism, including accusations of being a Ripple plant and being targeted by Bitcoin maximalists. However, he maintained that if a tool can help people build wealth without requiring payment or risk, he’s willing to stand behind it—regardless of skepticism. He continued to say that he was traveling and hoped to go live on April 16, 2025, on X at 3 PM EST to address concerns or questions. He noted that he was grateful for genuine concern and misinformation or misperception. Deaton also addressed some of his criticism, including allegations that he was a “Ripple plant” and backlash from Bitcoin maximalists. Still, he continues to stand by his belief that if a platform can help people build wealth without needing to put money on the line or risk anything, it’s worth his support. Deaton noted that he would go live on X at 3 PM EST on April 16, 2025, since he was traveling. He noted that he intended to clear up “any question that anyone was confused about. He was grateful for the legitimate concern and acknowledged the mix of misinformation surrounding the incident.

Additionally, on April 15, h ackers targeting Ethereum scaling protocol ZKsync stole about $5 million of its native ZK crypto because of “a compromised” administrative account that allowed them to take control of unclaimed tokens from a recent airdrop. The crypto industry has suffered a series of thefts, prompting questions about the security of customer funds, with hacking hauls totaling more than $2 billion in 2024 – the fourth straight year where proceeds have topped more than $1 billion.

BlockDAG’s New Testnet Launch Shakes Up HBAR & XLM Holders,https://thecoinrise.com/is-1-bdag-closer-than-you-think-blockdags-new-testnet-launch-shakes-up-hbar-xlm-holders/,"Investors are watching closely as three major altcoins make headlines—Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), and BlockDAG (BDAG). While all three coins show signs of potential growth, only one is pairing that potential with hard, measurable progress. Stellar (XLM) is recovering from a steep 65% drop, with analysts pointing to a descending wedge—a bullish technical pattern. If confirmed, this could signal a short-term rally toward $0.42 or even $0.47. Similarly, Hedera (HBAR) has spiked 10% after announcing integration with Chainlink’s cross-chain protocol (CCIP), broadening its access to over 46 networks. Momentum indicators show short-term promise, though a decisive break above $0.20 is needed for confidence in long-term gains. But while XLM and HBAR offer “if-this-then-that” scenarios, BlockDAG is already executing. A live Beta Testnet with over 170,000 active wallets, 10,000 custom ASIC miners en route before the mainnet, and a $214 million presale without any institutional capital? That’s not speculation. That’s traction. BDAG has jumped 2,380% since Batch 1, now priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27—and that growth is rooted in delivery, not hype. Stellar (XLM) Eyes Breakout After 65% Crash – Is This the Start of a Big Rebound? Stellar (XLM) might be gearing up for a strong comeback after dropping over 65% since its November 2024 high of $0.636. The coin is now trading inside a descending wedge—a pattern that often signals a bullish breakout. On April 7, XLM bounced off a key support area near $0.21, backed by a bullish candlestick and key Fibonacci level. While the RSI remains below 50, showing lingering bearish momentum, the MACD hints at a trend shift. Chart analysts also spot a completed five-wave downtrend, suggesting a potential rally could be next, targeting $0.37 to $0.42. With Stellar sponsoring the 2025 Paris Blockchain Week, momentum could build fast. If the breakout confirms, XLM might push even higher toward $0.47. For buyers eyeing a high-upside play after a major correction, Stellar could be a solid bet in the coming weeks. HBAR Surges After Chainlink Deal — Is This Just the Beginning? Hedera’s (HBAR) recent 10% spike comes after big news: it’s now integrated with Chainlink’s cross-chain protocol (CCIP), connecting it to over 46 blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB, and Polygon. This move boosts Hedera’s DeFi potential, especially with its current low $70 million total value locked. HBAR is now testing a key resistance after bouncing from $0.126. While momentum indicators show strength, short-term charts hint at exhaustion. Still, long-term buyers might see an opportunity if HBAR breaks past $0.1675 and targets the $0.20 mark. Hedera’s edge lies in its speed—processing up to 10,000 transactions per second—far ahead of Ethereum and Bitcoin. If this Chainlink deal gains traction, HBAR could rally further. With trading volumes surging and market attention shifting, HBAR is warming up. For those eyeing a strong project with real-world use, now might be the time to watch HBAR closely. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Goes Live as $1 Price Target Draws Closer BlockDAG has officially launched its live Beta Testnet, marking a major step forward for the project. Over 170,000 users are already exploring the network, each receiving 10,000 BDAG testnet coins through a structured vesting model that mirrors how the mainnet will function. This isn’t just for show—the testnet provides real usage data, helping shape the final version of the network. Unlike many other crypto projects, BlockDAG is using the testnet as a practical onboarding tool, not just a promotional stunt. At the same time, BlockDAG’s custom mining hardware is being prepared for rollout. Around 10,000 X30 and X100 ASIC miners are set to ship before the 2025 mainnet launch. The presale results speak volumes: $214 million raised and 19.3 billion BDAG coins sold without support from big-name buyers. Since Batch 1, BDAG has climbed an impressive 2,380%, now priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27. With this kind of momentum, a move past the $1 mark isn’t just possible—it’s starting to look likely. BlockDAG isn’t just making promises—it’s delivering real progress. BlockDAG’s Going Viral In April — Here’s Why It Matters XLM and HBAR may eventually confirm bullish patterns or unlock new utility through integrations. But so far, these developments remain early-stage catalysts—ideas still needing validation in the open market. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is already operating like a post-mainnet project. Its Beta Testnet is live and growing. Real data is being collected. Real users are engaging with the ecosystem. The hardware layer is readying for deployment, creating a full-stack approach—rare even among top-tier layer-1 chains. The presale’s $214M raise and sale of 19.3 billion coins without VC or institutional support speaks to one thing: community belief built on delivery. As the $1 price target draws closer, BDAG isn’t chasing trends—it’s setting them. For serious crypto buyers looking for a project that’s past promises and into proof, BDAG offers the clearest signal in a crowded altcoin market.

BlockDAG Presale Hits $214M In April — Can Pi Coin or MANTRA Catch Up?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/over-2380-roi-blockdag-presale-hits-214m-in-april-can-pi-coin-or-mantra-catch-up/,"In a market driven by hype cycles and social sentiment, clarity comes not from the loudest project but from the one that’s delivering under the radar. Right now, three names are making noise for very different reasons. Pi Coin is attracting attention with its ambitious $3 price target, driven by controlled coin unlocks, strong community backing, and speculation around a potential coin burn. While still unlisted on major exchanges, it’s managed to build an active ecosystem that has early believers hopeful for a breakout—if execution follows promise. MANTRA (OM) is taking a bolder route, positioning itself as a serious contender in the Real-World Asset (RWA) and DeFi infrastructure space. With strategic backing from names like Google Cloud and partnerships with entities such as DAMAC and ZAND Bank, its momentum is real. Then there’s BlockDAG (BDAG)—a project less dependent on what might happen and more rooted in what already has. A presale raising over $214 million, third-party security audits from Halborn and CertiK, and a staggering 2,380% ROI since Batch 1—all point to one thing: buyer confidence backed by real fundamentals. While others sell potential, BlockDAG is quietly delivering results. Pi Coin Eyes $3? Here’s Why buyers Are Buzzing Over the Latest Price Jump Pi Coin surged over 9% recently, sparking excitement that it could hit $3 by June. Trading around $0.58, the rebound comes amid low coin unlocks and growing market confidence. Analysts say a possible coin burn by the Pi Core Team could balance supply, boosting chances for a rally. Despite recent dips, the Pi Network is gaining traction. With nearly $94 million worth of coins set to unlock in the next month, supply pressure remains, but optimism is high. If positive news drops and momentum holds, Pi could break resistance at $0.6133 and head higher. For early buyers, this could be a golden window. If Pi delivers on development promises, returns could multiply. Still, crypto markets are unpredictable—so watch key levels closely and don’t miss what might be Pi’s next big breakout. MANTRA (OM) Set for a Big 2025? Here’s Why Smart buyers Are Watching Closely MANTRA (OM) is quickly becoming a major player in the real-world asset (RWA) coinization and DeFi space. With the upcoming launch of Mantra Chain and partnerships with names like DAMAC, ZAND Bank, and Google Cloud, the project is gaining serious momentum. The $108 million MANTRA Ecosystem Fund aims to supercharge growth, backed by key players like Laser Digital and Amber Group. Whale activity also shows strong confidence—recent large buys followed earlier sell-offs, hinting at a bullish long-term outlook. OM is now trading around $6.34, holding strong above key moving averages. A push past $6.50 could trigger a run to $8 or even $10. For buyers looking to enter the RWA sector early, buying OM on dips near $5.60 with a stop loss at $4 could be a smart move ahead of 2025 gains. BlockDAG’s Secure Approach Wins Buyer Trust as Presale Crosses $210M BlockDAG is turning heads in the crypto space—not with flashy promises, but with real progress and solid foundations. Unlike many projects that rush to launch, BlockDAG has focused on building a secure, scalable ecosystem from the ground up. Its recent Keynote 3 update emphasized the project’s commitment to transparency and long-term reliability. Backed by thorough audits from top security firms Halborn and CertiK, BlockDAG has implemented advanced multi-layer protection. These independent checks aren’t just for show—they prove the platform is built to last. The presale numbers are just as impressive. BlockDAG has already raised over $214 million, selling more than 19.1 billion coins. Now in Batch 27, each BDAG coin is priced at $0.0248. Early participants, who bought in at just $0.001 during Batch 1, have seen returns of up to 2,380%. With this kind of growth and a strong security backbone, BlockDAG is quickly becoming a top pick for buyers looking for more than just hype. It’s not just a coin—it’s a carefully built ecosystem designed for real, lasting impact. What’s Next? Pi Coin is speculative, driven by timing and tokenomics. It has potential—but relies on future decisions from the core team to meet its $3 ambition. MANTRA is better structured, with visible industry partnerships and a growing footprint in RWA tokenization. It’s a serious contender, especially if adoption increases and Mantra Chain delivers. But BlockDAG is in another league—already proving its model works, both technically and financially. Its security-first approach, validated by top-tier audits, instills rare confidence in a market known for rug pulls and broken roadmaps. Add to that a transparent presale strategy, a massive fundraising milestone, and a product focus beyond hype—and it’s clear who’s playing the long game.

You get a digital ecosystem that doesn’t just survive—it dominates. From decentralized finance integrations to enterprise tools disrupting inefficient systems, these three names stand out. Qubetics , Avalanche, and Chainlink are not riding trends; they’re writing the blueprint for what’s next. Avalanche is gearing up for a game-changing upgrade that slashes transaction costs and boosts scalability. Chainlink is quietly locking arms with major players like PayPal and Ripple. These aren’t casual updates—they signal serious momentum. Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping in where traditional networks stalled—overcoming compatibility roadblocks, simplifying smart contract development, and future-proofing finance for the real world. With the QubeQode IDE, Qubetics enables seamless app deployment across chains, fixes cross-network fragmentation, and puts control directly into the hands of devs and digital natives. It’s precisely what blockchain needed to grow up. Qubetics ($TICS): Developer Freedom Meets Scalable Real-World Tools Qubetics isn’t built for hype. It’s engineered for function. The project offers a powerful mix of real-world utility and developer-first design that makes it one of the top cryptos to join this week. The QubeQode IDE is at the center of this evolution—a next-gen integrated development environment that simplifies multi-chain application building. Whether a fintech platform needs cross-border transaction tools or a logistics company demands transparent supply chain data, QubeQode can deliver, with speed and precision. More than 24,800 token holders have already joined the Qubetics network, with over 508 million $TICS tokens sold. The best crypto presale is in its 30 stage and has raised over $16.1 million, with $TICS currently priced at $0.1729. For early buyers seeking strong fundamentals and explosive potential, Qubetics isn’t just one of the top cryptos to join this week — it’s the platform that answers critical market needs. A $200 Play Could Flip into Life-Changing Value A $200 contribution fetches roughly 1,156 $TICS tokens. If the token’s value reaches $10, you’re sitting on $11,560—from just a couple of hundred dollars. It’s the type of move that gets overlooked until it’s too late. That’s how early-stage wealth begins—quietly, before it gets loud. This level of entry is already proving popular among freelancers, remote workers, and everyday professionals looking to escape unstable local currencies. It’s not about throwing big money—it’s about planting it in the right soil. Qubetics is proving fertile for those who act early. Avalanche (AVAX) Surges 16% as DeFi Rebounds and Real-World Adoption Gains Traction Avalanche (AVAX) has posted an impressive 16% weekly gain, trading around $19.90. This growth reflects renewed momentum in its DeFi ecosystem, with Total Value Locked (TVL) surging to $1.63 billion across more than 430 protocols. Platforms like Benqi, Trader Joe, and Aave are driving this revival, with Benqi reporting a 19% increase in lending and borrowing operations. Analysts note that if AVAX breaks through the $24–$26 resistance zone, it could make a strong push toward the $30 mark—territory last reached in early February. Meanwhile, institutional inflows into AVAX-based DeFi solutions have jumped 28% quarter-over-quarter, signaling deeper trust and interest from professional market participants. Looking ahead, Avalanche is preparing for a massive infrastructure leap with its Avalanche9000 upgrade, expected in December 2025. This update is set to reduce deployment costs for layer-1 networks by a staggering 99.9%, signaling a structural change rather than a simple performance improvement. Developers, enterprises, and institutions alike are eyeing this upgrade as a game-changer for scalability and cost-efficiency. On top of that, transaction fees on the C-Chain are expected to drop by 25%, making DeFi and cross-chain operations more accessible for the average user. Beyond the technical breakthroughs, Avalanche is driving adoption in the real world. The newly introduced Avalanche Card allows users to spend AVAX, USDT, and USDC anywhere Visa is accepted—merging digital assets with everyday commerce. This real-world payment utility, combined with upcoming scalability advancements, places Avalanche among the top cryptos to join this week. While many chains promise performance, Avalanche is delivering measurable utility, bringing blockchain from code to checkout in a way few projects can match. Pi Network Integrates Chainlink, LINK Boosts Utility Across Web3 Chainlink has officially integrated Pi Network into its decentralized oracle services, enabling real-time Pi token pricing through 22 new data feeds. This move enhances Pi’s ability to support smart contracts, DeFi, and blockchain gaming with secure external data. Since the announcement, Pi Coin surged over 30%, with bullish forecasts predicting a climb toward $2.5. The integration marks a key milestone in Chainlink’s expansion into broader ecosystems. Chainlink is the infrastructure giant most community members don’t see—until they use an app powered by its oracles. It’s had a bumpy road price-wise, hitting a recent low of $11.87, but don’t mistake that for weakness. LINK has found solid ground at a 644-day trendline. Technically, that sets the stage for stronger moves. What’s more interesting, though, is what’s happening off-chain. Chainlink has integrated with PayPal and Venmo as of April 2025, making its tech accessible to a wider consumer base. It’s also partnered with Ripple to enhance RLUSD’s pricing accuracy and reliability. Even Aave has adopted Chainlink’s Smart Value Recapture (SVR) to tighten DeFi efficiency. For those focused on protocol strength and cross-industry integration, Chainlink remains one of the top cryptos to join this week. It doesn’t aim for the spotlight—it builds the infrastructure that others rely on. Why These Three Projects Stand Out This Week While many tokens chase trends, Qubetics, Avalanche, and Chainlink are solving hard problems with precision. Qubetics leads by arming developers with the tools they actually need—like QubeQode—and it’s already raised over $16.1 million from enthusiastic early buyers. Avalanche is preparing to crush high-fee barriers with its December upgrade and is now helping digital assets behave like fiat in real-world transactions. Meanwhile, Chainlink keeps building the backbone of DeFi and real-world finance, partnering with global names and refining protocols under the hood. Whether you’re looking to build, scale, or secure your digital future, these are the top cryptos to join this week . For those ready to make bold moves, Qubetics stands out with unique utility and unmatched presale traction. Avalanche and Chainlink add depth and reach, making this trio hard to overlook.

Qubetics offers real-world utility through its QubeQode IDE, supports multi-chain app deployment, and has already raised over $16.1M in its presale. How will Avalanche9000 upgrade impact AVAX users? Avalanche9000 will reduce layer-1 deployment costs by 99.9% and lower C-Chain transaction fees by 25%, significantly improving network efficiency. Why is Chainlink’s integration with PayPal and Ripple important? These integrations expand Chainlink’s utility in both centralized finance (PayPal, Ripple) and DeFi (Aave), enhancing its real-world value and adoption.

Cole said in an April 14 open letter to Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi that Intuit’s growth is admirable, but Bitcoin ( BTC ) is the best way to ensure the company’s long-term success and hedge against any potential disruption caused by artificial intelligence. Intuit’s flagship products are its tax preparation app TurboTax and the small business accounting software Quickbooks. The company laid off 10% of its staff in July to pursue its AI endeavors, but Cole said the firm needs an additional hedge because TurboTax is at risk of being automated away by AI. “While we appreciate Intuit’s own investments and internal implementation of AI, we believe an additional hedge is warranted, and that a Bitcoin war chest is the best option available,” Cole said. An excerpt from Matt Cole’s letter urging Intuit to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheets, among other suggestions. Source: Strive Asset Management That Bitcoin war chest , he added, will ensure Intuit has “enough strategic capital to weather the AI storm and act from a position of strength through the turbulence of the AI revolution.” Cole sent a similar letter to GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen in February to advise the gaming retailer to use its $4.6 billion in cash to buy Bitcoin. GameStop’s Cohen acknowledged the letter in an April 1 regulatory filing and revealed his company had finished a convertible debt offering that raised $1.5 billion, with some proceeds earmarked for buying Bitcoin. Strive urges Intuit change crypto policy In his letter to Intuit, Cole said the firm should reconsider the acceptable use policy for its marketing platform Mailchimp, which he claims has continued to suspend crypto-related accounts over policy violations. Source: Strive Asset Management Cole said he “remains concerned that Intuit’s censorship and de-platforming policies discriminate against Bitcoin enthusiasts, which may harm long-term shareholder value.” Mailchimp has said that crypto-related content isn’t necessarily banned under its policy, and crypto content can be sent provided the sender isn’t involved in the sale, exchange, or marketing of crypto. Related: Saylor signals Strategy is buying the dip amid macroeconomic turmoil Its current acceptable use policy states that the platform might not allow accounts that offer “cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies, and any digital assets related to an initial coin offering.” According to Cole, Mailchimp likely adopted its policies when the legal status of crypto and related businesses was uncertain, but said with the crypto-friendly Trump administration , it’s time to “amend the acceptable use policy to end the blanket ban on crypto-related businesses.” Intuit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

33767162,[object Object],1744770633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Risk Stays High Despite Recent Drop – Correction Or Warning Sign?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-market-risk-stays-high-despite-recent-drop-correction-or-warning-sign/,"Bitcoin is facing a critical test as global markets remain volatile and macroeconomic tensions escalate. After weeks of price swings and uncertainty, BTC is trading above the $85,000 level — a psychological and technical threshold that bulls have managed to defend. Momentum appears to be building, but the real test lies ahead: reclaiming the $90,000 mark to confirm a recovery and shift broader sentiment. Despite the recent bounce, the market environment remains fragile. CryptoQuant insights reveal that market risk is still elevated, even as Bitcoin’s price attempts to stabilize. According to their latest data, only 24% of the circulating supply is currently in an unrealized loss — a relatively low figure when compared to previous major corrections. Historically, such a level is often associated with early-stage pullbacks rather than full-scale capitulation. This suggests that while bulls are stepping in, the broader market hasn’t fully flushed out excess risk, leaving room for additional downside if sentiment turns again. As the geopolitical climate remains tense and the macroeconomic outlook uncertain, Bitcoin’s next move will be crucial in determining whether this is the start of a sustained recovery or simply a temporary relief rally within a larger correction. Bitcoin Price Steadies But Market Risk Remains Elevated Global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty continue to drive Bitcoin price behavior, with recent action hinting at a potential shift in momentum. As inflation begins to trend lower and the U.S. stock market shows signs of fragility, many analysts expect the Federal Reserve may eventually be forced to lower interest rates to prevent a deeper economic crisis. However, with trade negotiations between the U.S. and China evolving quickly, the timeline for any monetary easing remains unclear. Despite Bitcoin’s recent bounce above $85,000, on-chain data from CryptoQuant highlights that market risk is far from resolved. While BTC has undergone a notable correction—dropping over 30% from its all-time highs—only 24% of the circulating supply is currently in an unrealized loss. This is historically a low level, often seen during early-stage corrections, not during deep capitulation phases. The unrealized loss component is currently concentrated within the historical bottom zone, meaning that long-term holders are the ones absorbing the downside. This pattern typically reflects resilience but also signals caution: such phases tend to precede extended periods of sideways consolidation or further volatility rather than an immediate rally. In summary, while bullish momentum is building, the market remains vulnerable. A sustained move higher will likely require improved macro clarity and confirmation of policy shifts before Bitcoin can fully break into a renewed uptrend. Technical Details: Price Holds Above Key Indicators Bitcoin is currently trading at $85,500 after successfully pushing above the 4-hour 200 MA and EMA, both positioned around the $84,000 level. This technical breakout is a positive sign for bulls, who now need to maintain price action above these indicators to confirm a shift in short-term momentum and initiate a broader recovery phase. Holding above the $84K zone is crucial, as it signals strength and buyer commitment at this level. If bulls can continue to defend this range and reclaim the psychological $90,000 level, Bitcoin could quickly move into higher supply zones, potentially targeting a new local high and breaking the current consolidation pattern. However, despite this positive momentum, risks remain. If BTC fails to maintain support above the $84K zone and dips below $81,000, it could trigger renewed selling pressure. Such a breakdown would likely result in a sharp drop toward the $75,000 support region, a level closely watched by analysts for its historical significance. For now, Bitcoin’s price structure remains cautiously optimistic. Sustained buying interest and favorable macro conditions will be required to support further gains and confirm the beginning of a lasting recovery.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated the hit in 2025 from reduced travel and boycotts could total 0.3% of gross domestic product, totaling around $90 million. Data from the International Trade Administration showed that the number of non-citizens who had entered the U.S. by plane plummeted almost 10% in March compared to a year earlier. The report also noted that foreign tourism has been a blow for the U.S. recently after the pandemic-era restrictions sparked a resurgence of international travel. U.S. travel declines amid geopolitical frictions US Economy Is Set to Lose Billions as Foreign Tourists Stay Away https://t.co/DXWMIS1rbZ pic.twitter.com/wOpY5OiHwg — Ray Wang (@rwang07) April 15, 2025 Potential U.S. visitors are now rethinking traveling to the U.S. amid increased hostility at the border, rising geopolitical frictions, and global economic uncertainty. Curtis Allen, a Canadian videographer, canceled an upcoming U.S. vacation after President Trump imposed tariffs on his home country and suggested it should become the 51st U.S. state. Allen said, “We’re not just staying home; we’re going to go spend the same money somewhere else.” “Given what we know about how much Canadian travel has fallen off, that’s potentially a bit worrying for that region.” -Omar Sharif, president of Inflation Insights. According to ITA data , foreign travelers spent approximately $254 billion in the U.S. in 2024. The analytics firm also estimated in early March that the country would receive 77 million visitors in 2025. The data came out just before news of detentions at U.S. airports made headlines, where travelers from countries like France and Germany were ensnared. Canadians, who contribute the largest number of foreign travelers in the U.S., are choosing to stay put as Trump heightens attacks on the country’s economy and sovereignty. Bloomberg Intelligence analysis revealed that roughly $20 billion in retail spending from international tourists in the U.S. may be compromised. A monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report on consumer prices published on April 10 indicated that early signs of a sharp pullback are already showing up as airfares, hotel rates, and car rental costs fell in March. Sharif also highlighted that the decline in hotel rates was driven by an almost 11% drop in the Northeast in particular, possibly a result of fewer Canadians traveling there. Canada remains resilient despite challenging U.S. traveling conditions Patrick Keyes, sales and marketing manager at Rainbow Air Helicopter Tours in Niagara Falls, said that the timing is “very interesting” for the firm, which just invested $25 million in a new building, an enhanced fleet, and a virtual reality attraction ahead of the busy summer season. Keyes also added that “we are waiting to see the fallout.” A report by OAG Aviation Worldwide also reported that Canadian flight reservations to the U.S. have plummeted by 70% through September versus the same period last year. U.S. summer bookings have also dropped by 25% among European tourists at Accor SA hotels. The firm’s Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Bazin maintained the drop could be attributed to border detentions creating a “bad buzz” and diverting tourists to other destinations. Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Megan Peters mentioned in a March 31 report that U.S. tariff announcements and a more aggressive stance towards historical allies hurt global opinions about the state. The duo also believe that tariffs will lead to U.S. gross domestic product growth to underperform consensus expectations in 2025. Todd Davidson, CEO of Travel Oregon, Oregon’s tourism commission, said the company was continuing efforts to attract foreign travelers. Davidson noted his team was on a trip to pitch the state at an adventure tourism conference in Vancouver. He also acknowledged that his team will host sales and marketing partners from the UK, India, and Brazil in the coming weeks. The company’s senior executive maintained that his team was also contemplating whether the commission will need to tweak its strategy more toward domestic visitors as the situation unfolds. He added, “Oregon is not and will not take its eye off those international markets.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

TRUMP was last trading just under $8 per coin, up a modest 10% from the lows it hit around $7 last week, but still very much stuck in a long-term downtrend. The meme coin has continually found resistance at its 21DMA over the last three months. TRUMP has now dropped around 90% from its post-launch highs above $70. But things could be about to go from bad to worse. 4% of the meme coin’s supply is set to unlock on the 18th of April. On April 18, 40 million tokens will unlock for $TRUMP (currently worth $330M) Let’s see if they’ll sell or hold pic.twitter.com/xxfnutGJaG — LANGERIUS (@langeriuseth) April 14, 2025 Given that only 20% of the supply is currently in circulation, this means an increase to circulating supply of 20%. Bearish technicals combined with bearish supply dynamics mean that TRUMP coin could soon dump to fresh lows under $7 per token. And with sentiment in the broader crypto market still downbeat thanks to ongoing macro uncertainties and poor altcoin performance, the outlook for a major bullish reversal anytime soon is week. Was TRUMP Coin a Scam? TRUMP Coin isn’t a scam; its launch was fair and the team behind the coin have not deceived investors in anyway. It was simply launched as a collectable meme coin, with no promise of returns, or anything for that matter. That said, questions have been raised about the ethics surrounding the meme coin’s launch. Firstly, while early buyers made millions, and while the Trump organization has earned over $100 million in trading fees, the vast majority of TRUMP buyers have been left out of pocket. Indeed, a Chainalysis study conducted in conjunction with the New York Times revealed that, three weeks on from the meme coin’s launch, over 800,000 wallets had lost money buying the coin. Indeed, just looking at the TRUMP coin chart since its launch – it paints a perfect picture of a classic “pump-and-dump”. Trump’s meme coin has to be the biggest scam of the season. pic.twitter.com/nCvNWgyVP1 — VolgaLad (@cym27s) April 13, 2025 The fact that the Trump organization gifted itself 80% of the supply to be vested over the course of Trump’s presidential term has also been strongly criticized. $TRUMP coin is a scam and embarrassing for all US citizens. Essentially, it allowed insiders to snipe the entire supply at launch. We should hope for better from our leaders. Just because the other side is corrupt doesn’t give you a license to do the same. I hope people on… pic.twitter.com/yHgfdQhZqz — Dr. Danish (@operationdanish) January 18, 2025 Is It a Good Time to Buy TRUMP? Its possible that when broader crypto market conditions take a substantial turn for the better, TRUMP coin could see a major resurgence. Perhaps when sentiment regarding the economy is better, and when the Fed is pumping the market with liquidity. That said, these times have not arrived yet. Yes, TRUMP coin buyers getting into the market are buying the dip, a 90% dip in fact. However, there could still be a lot lower to go. Its not unheard of for meme coins to drop 99% from prior record highs. Investors should not risk more than they can afford to lose in buying TRUMP coin. Investing in major coins like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana would be much safer.

In a Tuesday evening announcement, newly-appointed CEO Roshan Robert said the expansion was “a commitment to responsible growth.” Robert was most recently an executive at institutional crypto lending platform CLST, and was a founding team member of crypto prime broker Hidden Road, which was recently acquired by Ripple for $1.25 billion . “As regulations evolve, OKX is working closely with US regulators and policymakers to ensure we operate transparently and compliantly,” Robert wrote. “We’ve built a comprehensive, risk-based global compliance program that includes enhanced due diligence, a robust KYC process, customer risk rating systems, advanced fraud detection, AML tools, geo-blocking, and market surveillance technologies. These are all part of our commitment to a secure, compliant trading environment.” Two months ago, a subsidiary of OKX settled charges that it had operated in the U.S. without a money transmitting license, agreeing to pay the Department of Justice (DOJ) over $500 million in penalties and forfeited fees. The DOJ alleged that, despite having an official policy prohibiting U.S.-based users from accessing its platform, OKX “sought out customers in the United States, including in the Southern District of New York.” Read more: After Binance’s $4.3B Lesson, Do Rival Exchanges Risk Running Afoul of U.S. Rules?
