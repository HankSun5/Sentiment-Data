This alarming omission raises questions about AI transparency and the tech giant’s commitment to responsible AI development. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-watchers alike, this development in the AI space is crucial, as AI’s increasing influence can have far-reaching implications across various sectors, including blockchain and digital currencies. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s causing ripples. Unpacking the GPT-4.1 Launch and the Missing Safety Report Omission On Monday, OpenAI unveiled GPT-4.1, boasting enhanced performance over its predecessors, particularly in programming benchmarks. While the performance upgrades are noteworthy, the conspicuous absence of a safety report – traditionally a standard accompaniment to OpenAI’s model releases – has become the focal point. These reports, often termed ‘system cards,’ detail the rigorous safety evaluations conducted on AI models, offering insights into potential risks and mitigation strategies. However, for GPT-4.1, this crucial piece of documentation is nowhere to be found. When questioned by Bitcoin World, an OpenAI spokesperson stated that GPT-4.1 is not considered a ‘frontier model,’ hence justifying the lack of a dedicated system card. This explanation, however, hasn’t quelled concerns, especially given the industry norm of prioritizing AI safety and transparency. Why AI Transparency Matters: The Industry Standard Safety reports serve as a vital tool for AI transparency . They typically include: Internal Testing Details: Outlining the types of tests conducted by the AI lab itself to assess the model’s safety. Third-Party Evaluations: Incorporating assessments from external partners, adding an independent layer of scrutiny. Potential Risks: Openly acknowledging and detailing potential downsides, such as the model’s propensity for deception or harmful persuasiveness. Good Faith Effort: These reports are generally viewed by the AI community as genuine attempts to foster independent research and red teaming efforts, crucial for identifying and mitigating risks. In essence, these reports are the AI industry’s benchmark for demonstrating accountability and a commitment to AI safety . The absence of such a report for GPT-4.1 is a deviation from this established norm, prompting unease among safety researchers and industry observers. Lowered Reporting Standards: A Growing Trend? Unfortunately, OpenAI isn’t alone in facing criticism over reporting standards. Several leading AI labs have seemingly been scaling back their transparency efforts in recent months, leading to backlash from the AI safety research community. Google’s Delays: Some tech giants have been slow in releasing safety reports, raising questions about their commitment to timely transparency. Lack of Detail: Even when reports are published, they sometimes lack the comprehensive detail that was once standard, making thorough evaluation challenging. OpenAI’s Past Issues: OpenAI itself has faced scrutiny. A previous safety report in December was criticized for presenting benchmark results from a different model version than the one actually deployed. Furthermore, the system card for their ‘deep research’ model was released weeks after the model itself launched. This apparent trend towards reduced transparency is concerning, particularly as AI models become more powerful and integrated into various aspects of our lives. AI Model Release and Voluntary Transparency: A Double-Edged Sword Steven Adler, a former OpenAI safety researcher, points out a critical aspect: safety reports are not legally mandated. They are voluntary commitments made by AI companies. While this allows for flexibility, it also creates a potential loophole. OpenAI has publicly committed to transparency, even highlighting system cards as a ‘key part’ of their accountability approach in a blog post preceding the UK AI Safety Summit in 2023. They further emphasized the value of system cards in providing insights into model risks leading up to the Paris AI Action Summit in 2025. Adler aptly summarizes, “System cards are the AI industry’s main tool for transparency and for describing what safety testing was done. Today’s transparency norms and commitments are ultimately voluntary, so it is up to each AI company to decide whether or when to release a system card for a given model.” This voluntary nature places the onus on companies like OpenAI to uphold their self-imposed standards of AI transparency . Concerns Mount Amidst Safety Practice Scrutiny The decision to ship GPT-4.1 without a system card comes at a sensitive time. Current and former OpenAI employees are increasingly voicing concerns about the company’s AI safety practices. Just last week, Adler and eleven other ex-OpenAI employees filed an amicus brief in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, arguing that a for-profit OpenAI might be incentivized to compromise on safety measures. Recent reports in the Financial Times further suggest that competitive pressures are pushing OpenAI to reduce the time and resources allocated to safety testing. This alleged shift in priorities amplifies the significance of the missing safety report for GPT-4.1. Performance Gains and Heightened Risk: A Critical Juncture for AI Safety While GPT-4.1 may not be OpenAI’s most powerful model overall, it boasts substantial improvements in efficiency and latency. Thomas Woodside, co-founder and policy analyst at Secure AI Project, highlights that these performance enhancements actually make a safety report even more critical. His reasoning is straightforward: greater sophistication in a model often translates to higher potential risks. The increasing capabilities of AI models necessitate robust AI safety measures and transparent reporting. However, many AI labs, including OpenAI, have resisted legislative efforts to codify safety reporting requirements. OpenAI, for instance, opposed California’s SB 1047, which would have mandated safety evaluations and public reporting for many AI developers. Conclusion: The Path Forward for AI Transparency OpenAI’s launch of GPT-4.1 without a safety report marks a concerning deviation from established industry norms. While the company justifies this decision by categorizing GPT-4.1 as non-frontier, the absence of a system card raises valid questions about AI transparency and commitment to AI safety . As AI models become more integrated into our world, especially in sectors like cryptocurrency and finance, the need for robust safety evaluations and open reporting becomes paramount. The industry stands at a crucial juncture, where voluntary commitments to transparency must be reinforced by consistent action and perhaps, eventually, by more formalized standards to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.

The stablecoin market, already a vibrant space, is about to get even more dynamic. Industry experts at Fireblocks are signaling a major escalation in stablecoin competition , with traditional financial powerhouses like banks and payment firms gearing up to launch their own digital currencies. What does this mean for the future of finance and the crypto landscape? Let’s dive in and explore this exciting development. Why is Stablecoin Competition Heating Up? According to Ran Goldi, SVP of payments at Fireblocks, we’re on the cusp of a new era in the stablecoin market. Several factors are converging to fuel this stablecoin competition : Regulatory Tailwinds: The regulatory landscape is becoming clearer, especially in regions like the EU with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Pending legislation in the U.S. is also providing a framework for banks and financial institutions to operate within the crypto space. This clarity is giving institutions the confidence to move forward with their stablecoin strategies. Growing Demand for Digital Payments: The need for efficient and cost-effective cross-border payments is rising. Stablecoins offer a compelling solution, providing faster transaction times and lower fees compared to traditional systems. Technological Maturity: Blockchain technology and stablecoin infrastructure have matured significantly, making it easier and safer for banks and payment firms to launch and manage digital currencies. Goldi predicts a surge in stablecoin offerings, estimating as many as 50 new stablecoins could emerge by the end of the year. This influx of new players will undoubtedly intensify the stablecoin competition and reshape the market. Bank Stablecoins: A New Era of Digital Currency? The entry of banks into the stablecoin arena is a game-changer. For years, the crypto market has been largely dominated by decentralized players. Now, traditional financial institutions are stepping in, bringing with them trust, regulatory compliance, and vast customer networks. But what exactly are bank stablecoins , and what advantages do they offer? Bank stablecoins are digital currencies issued by regulated banks and pegged to a fiat currency, typically the US dollar or Euro. This backing by traditional banks provides a level of security and stability that some perceive as lacking in purely crypto-native stablecoins. Here’s a breakdown of the potential benefits: Benefit Description Enhanced Trust and Security Backed by regulated banks, offering greater assurance and consumer protection. Regulatory Compliance Designed to meet stringent regulatory requirements, reducing compliance burdens for users. Integration with Traditional Finance Seamless integration with existing banking infrastructure and payment systems. Wider Adoption Potential Banks’ established customer base and brand recognition can accelerate stablecoin adoption. However, the rise of bank stablecoins also presents challenges. Interoperability between different stablecoin platforms and ensuring robust security protocols will be crucial for widespread adoption. Moreover, the regulatory landscape is still evolving, and banks will need to navigate complex compliance requirements across different jurisdictions. Stablecoin Regulation: MiCA and Beyond Regulation is playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of stablecoins. The EU’s MiCA regulation is a landmark piece of legislation that provides a comprehensive framework for crypto-assets, including stablecoins. MiCA aims to foster innovation while mitigating risks, and it’s already influencing how stablecoin issuers operate in Europe and beyond. Key aspects of stablecoin regulation under MiCA include: Licensing Requirements: Issuers of significant stablecoins will need to obtain licenses and adhere to strict operational and capital requirements. Reserve Requirements: Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves to back their tokens, ensuring they can meet redemption requests. Consumer Protection: MiCA includes measures to protect consumers, such as transparency requirements and mechanisms for dispute resolution. In the United States, while there isn’t a single, comprehensive federal framework yet, various agencies are actively working on stablecoin regulation. Pending legislation is expected to bring more clarity and potentially pave the way for broader adoption of digital currency and stablecoins within the U.S. financial system. The Power of Crypto Payments: Cross-Border Transactions and Beyond One of the most compelling use cases for stablecoins is in crypto payments , particularly for cross-border transactions. Traditional cross-border payments can be slow, expensive, and involve multiple intermediaries. Stablecoins offer a faster, cheaper, and more efficient alternative. Goldi highlighted the increasing use of stablecoins in cross-border payments, noting that banks in Brazil and Singapore are already actively utilizing them. This real-world adoption underscores the practical benefits of crypto payments for businesses and individuals engaged in international trade and remittances. While USDT (Tether) currently dominates the global stablecoin market, USDC (USD Coin) is positioning itself to gain ground, particularly in Europe, due to its licensing under MiCA. The regulatory clarity provided by MiCA could give USDC a competitive edge in the European market and beyond. Navigating the Digital Currency Landscape: What’s Next? The digital currency landscape is evolving rapidly, and the intensifying stablecoin competition is a key driver of this change. Banks and payment firms are not just dipping their toes in the water; many are actively developing strategies for stablecoin adoption and implementation. CoinDesk reports that numerous banks are currently drafting stablecoin strategies, with actual implementations expected to begin as early as 2026. This timeline suggests that we are still in the early stages of this transformation, but the momentum is building. Key Takeaways for Navigating this Evolving Landscape: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, particularly in regions relevant to your business or interests. Explore Stablecoin Options: Evaluate different stablecoins and their suitability for your payment needs, considering factors like regulation, security, and interoperability. Prepare for Change: The financial landscape is shifting. Businesses and individuals should prepare for increased adoption of digital currencies and explore how stablecoins can enhance their operations. Engage with the Ecosystem: Participate in industry discussions, attend conferences, and network with experts to gain deeper insights into the evolving stablecoin market. The stablecoin market is poised for explosive growth and innovation. As banks and payment firms enter the fray, stablecoin competition will intensify, driving further development and adoption of digital currency solutions. This is a space to watch closely, as it promises to reshape the future of finance and payments.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-massive-xrp-price-breakout-incoming-heres-why/,"XRP may be on the verge of a dramatic price breakout, according to crypto market analyst Amonyx, who predicted a “massive” upward move in the coming sessions. As technical signals and on-chain metrics begin to align, the digital asset appears to be approaching a critical inflection point—one that could redefine its short-term trajectory and possibly send shockwaves through the broader altcoin market. MASSIVE $XRP BREAKOUT INCOMING!!! pic.twitter.com/GfL6kLjzdY — Amonyx (@amonbuy) April 15, 2025 Technical Indicators Signal Imminent Breakout Amonyx’s analysis is underpinned by classic technical breakout principles. XRP has recently been consolidating within a narrowing range, forming what many chartists identify as a bullish continuation pattern, such as a symmetrical triangle or ascending triangle—both of which historically precede upward breakouts when supported by volume and momentum indicators. Price action is tightening, volatility is compressing, and XRP is hovering just below resistance levels that have previously capped its rallies. These conditions often serve as the prelude to explosive price movements, especially when investor sentiment starts leaning bullish. Momentum Building Across Key Market Metrics In tandem with the technical picture, there is growing evidence of heightened interest in XRP across various market layers. Trading volume has begun to swell, suggesting increasing participation. Derivatives markets have also seen rising open interest and bullish bias , indicating that institutional and high-leverage traders are anticipating movement. Moreover, on-chain data reveals renewed activity among whale addresses and long-dormant holders—an encouraging signal that large players may be positioning ahead of what they expect to be a significant shift in price action. Macro and Fundamental Tailwinds While technical and on-chain signals point to near-term momentum, macro-fundamental factors could provide the necessary fuel for a sustained rally. XRP continues to benefit from positive developments within the Ripple ecosystem, particularly its expanding global partnerships and potential future involvement in regulated digital payment infrastructure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, as discussions around tokenization, stablecoins, and CBDCs gain traction among central banks and financial institutions, XRP’s use case as a bridge currency positions it strategically at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain. The Sentiment Factor: Cautious Optimism or Euphoria? Despite the building pressure, traders and investors remain divided on whether this is the breakout that finally propels XRP back toward previous all-time highs—or just another false start in a long consolidation. Amonyx, however, remains confident that the current setup is unlike past attempts, emphasizing the strength of supporting signals and the broader market’s readiness to rotate into large-cap altcoins. If the breakout materializes, it could trigger a wave of FOMO (fear of missing out), drawing in sidelined capital and amplifying the rally further. As always, volume confirmation and the ability to flip resistance into support will be critical in validating the move. With technicals coiling, sentiment shifting, and macro narratives aligning, XRP is entering a pivotal phase that could result in substantial price action. While caution is always warranted in volatile markets, Amonyx’s forecast is backed by a confluence of data points that suggest XRP is not just knocking on the door of a breakout—it’s about to kick it open. For now, all eyes remain on the charts. The next move could be historic. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Musk’s dual role as a business magnate and government official is reigniting debates over where ethical lines should be drawn when private-sector leaders step into public power. Lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren are pushing for tighter oversight of special government employees. Over 50% of Americans believe Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk and tech companies overall have too much influence on U.S. government, according to a new poll this week from UMass Amherst. New Poll Finds Majority Believe Musk Influences Federal Government Too Much Conducted from April 4 through to April 9 , the poll found that over half of the U.S. believes Musk, tech companies, and Wall Street at large wield too much influence over the federal government under U.S. President Donald Trump. Majority of Americans Distrust Elon Musk’s Efforts to Cut Federal Spending, New National UMass Amherst Poll Finds : UMass Amherst https://t.co/0pLkdRWC5o — UMass Poll (@UMassPoll) April 15, 2025 Meanwhile, 59% of surveyed participants said that they had little to no trust that Musk would not use his position of power to benefit his own business interests. “Only three months into his tenure at DOGE, questions concerning Musk’s conflict of interests, his legal authority to cut federal programs, and the actual budgetary savings that DOGE has elicited continue to swirl,” says the poll’s director, Professor Tatishe Nteta. “Given the unpopularity of Musk’s efforts to rein in federal spending, it is no surprise that many expect Musk to return to his businesses and to put Washington, D.C., in his rearview mirror,” he added. Democratic U.S. Lawmakers Push Back Musk, who has been a proponent of cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin in the past, has faced widespread backlash for his new position in Trump’s administration. The SpaceX founder has largely spearheaded a campaign directed at cutting government regulations in a bid to curb America’s excess spending, though critics argue his role goes too far. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who recently urged the Department of Justice to reverse its decision to disband its crypto enforcement, co-sponsored a bill on Monday that would order ethics checks on special government employees like Musk. Trump, meanwhile, has also faced criticism for his business affiliations while in the Oval Office, with Fortune reporting Tuesday that he will launch his own crypto-infused, Monopoly style real estate game.

Coyne now faces nearly a decade behind bars which shows the growing stakes for cybercriminals. The continued rise of phishing—now infiltrating even government officials’ accounts—shows that cybercriminal networks remain highly active and dangerously effective. According to a press release on April 14 from England and Wales top prosecution agency, the Crown Prosecution Service, British citizen Zak Coyne has been sentenced to almost a decade prison for operating a phishing service intended to generate scams for fraudsters. Labhost’s Zak Coyne Profited Off Of Laundered Crypto The press release stated that Coyne played an “integral role in the creation, operation and administration” of Labhost, a one-stop phishing as a service site for scammers. Zak Coyne, 24, facilitated extensive fraudulent conduct worldwide by creating and running a 'one-stop shop for phishing' online. Today he has been sentenced. https://t.co/YLfp6rGVGs pic.twitter.com/nEM2A2IeDH — Crown Prosecution Service (@CPSUK) April 14, 2025 Coyne, who received $230,000 worth of laundered cryptocurrency for “designing and administering” Labhost’s website, was apprehended at Manchester Airport on Monday. Users of Labhost would pay a monthly service and in turn garner access to websites that appeared to be legitimate government, commercial and banking URLs they could then use to defraud unsuspecting victims. The massive scheme saw over one million victims in 91 countries defrauded, with losses of victims in the U.K. accounting for £32 million ($42 million USD). Coyne pleaded guilty to one count of making or supplying articles for use in fraud, one count of encouraging or assisting the commission of an offense and one count of transferring criminal property at Manchester Crown Court. “This was a sophisticated worldwide criminal enterprise which enabled others to perpetrate fraud on a massive scale, resulting in losses totalling more than £100 million,” Thomas Short, Specialist Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said. “Fraud is far from a victimless crime and the harm caused by Coyne’s offending are measured not just in monetary terms, but also in the distress inflicted on countless victims who fell prey to these scams,” he added. Phishing Scams Continue To Pervade Society News of Coyne’s arrest and subsequent guilty plea comes amid the concerning continuation of phishing attacks at large, with 48% all emails in 2022 found to be spam. On Tuesday, the BBC reported that Government Minister Lucy Powell’s X accunt had been hacked to promote a cryptocurrency scam . Overall, Coyne’s conviction shows the growing international efforts to crack down on cyber-enabled fraud, as authorities grapple with the rising tide of phishing scams that continue to exploit millions of victims worldwide.

Bitcoin has been known for its high volatility and sharp price swings, but data from Nasdaq composites volatility over the past 30 days shows that it surpassed Bitcoin for the first time last week after President Trump reportedly put a hold on tariffs for most countries apart from China for 90 days. For China, Trump increased the tariffs targeting the country. High volatility in the cryptocurrency space has been a constant feature and it’s one of the few things that set’s it apart from the equities market. However, recent trends show that it’s gradually changing as pointed out by industry observers. The volatility landscape is changing For the first time in a long time, Nasdaq’s 21-day realized volatility overtook Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility, reaching 59.8% compared to Bitcoin’s 46.4% on April 10, according to data from Dow Jones Market Data. It’s important to note that Bitcoin trades around the clock, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, while U.S. equities only trade on weekdays from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. ET. This wider trading window can sometimes smooth out extreme fluctuations in crypto as pointed out by analysts. However, the market experienced some resurgence on Monday, ending on a high note after the Trump administration announced that it would exempt smartphones, electronic integrated circuits, and some consumer-electronics products as well as machines used in making semiconductors from the tariffs. Although the White House has added that these exemptions were temporary. Analysts have also pointed out that tariffs affect the stock market directly as they impact the actual companies listed there and their profit margins, which in turn impacts consumer and investors’ confidence. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is relatively insulated or not as impacted by the effects of tariffs. Greg Magadini, the director of derivatives at crypto-data platform Amberdata, has also highlighted another guardrail for Bitcoin’s volatility. Magadini noted that Bitcoin’s volatility has been on a decline in part due to institutional involvement, especially after the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year. Policy stability and regulatory shift may be the answer The Donald Trump administration is known to have a pro-crypto regulatory stance, which stakeholders also see as influential in relatively stabilizing Bitcoin. The president signed executive orders to create a federal framework for digital asset regulation and even proposed the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve . Trump’s stance on crypto marks a major shift from the Biden administration. Under the new administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dismissed lawsuits against several crypto companies, and the President has pardoned some players in the crypto space convicted for crypto-related crimes, such as former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. The reduction of speculative volatility may be attributed to these moves boosting institutional confidence in Bitcoin. While it remains to be seen whether this trend continues, the recent convergence in volatility between equities and Bitcoin suggests a changing narrative.

His message, though unconventional, taps into a long-standing tradition in the XRP community, where speculation often dances with mythology and pattern recognition in pursuit of the truth. Ok here is the real moon date joking around aside! Can I tell the world Pee? APRIL 19: The XRP Phoenix Rises — A Master Decode Alright Riddlers, XRP Army, and anyone still paying attention… the clues have been in plain sight. Here’s why I believe April 19, 2025, is the XRP… pic.twitter.com/hocS5MbPjV — David Rule (@XRPFREEE) April 14, 2025 The Resurrection Framework and Biblical Parallels Rule begins his argument by anchoring his timeline in biblical resurrection imagery. Referring to John 11:39, where Lazarus had been dead for four days before being resurrected, he draws a symbolic parallel to April 15 as the “death” point, representing systemic collapse or symbolic transformation. Four days after this, April 19 becomes the date of rebirth, or in XRP terms, the day the “Phoenix rises.” This motif, recurrent in XRP lore, aligns with the idea of rebirth after destruction—echoing Ripple’s ongoing battle for regulatory clarity and its hoped-for transformation into the financial standard. Mr. Pool and the Cryptic Timestamp A key anchor in David’s decode is a Mr. Pool post from April 3, 2022, which displayed the reversed phrase “NATIONAL YCNEGREME” (National Emergency). Posted at 5:46 PM, Rule uses riddler logic to flip and reduce the timestamp, ultimately calculating the number 18—a suggested nod to April 18 as the date of a global emergency broadcast or financial event. Following that, April 19 becomes the logical “aftershock,” the moment of emergence from chaos. David suggests this aligns with the archetypal “Order out of Chaos” narrative, frequently cited in esoteric and occult traditions. The Numerological Argument and the 36 Code Using a combination of number flips and summations, David decodes April 19 (4/19) into the number 36—a number repeatedly referenced in XRP riddler circles. The number is derived through symbolic inversions (e.g., flipping 9 to 6, subtracting and adding digits) that reflect a common theme in this subculture: hidden meanings beneath the surface. Notably, David draws attention to how XRP itself is numerologically encoded with 36, further reinforcing his thesis that April 19 is more than a date—it is a symbolic cipher. Astrological and Esoteric Timelines Astrology also plays a central role in David’s code. April 19 marks the final anaretic degree of Aries—considered one of the most potent and karmically charged degrees in the zodiac. It represents a threshold moment, when fire gives way to earth as Taurus begins—a sign historically linked to finance, stability, and material wealth. Combined with the shifting moon into Taurus, Rule suggests the cosmic alignment points toward massive movement in assets like XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He also ties the date to the occult calendar, specifically the “blood sacrifice to the beast” window from April 19 to May 1, known in esoteric circles as a time of both chaos and ritual rebirth. Rule argues that Mr. Pool’s apocalyptic imagery—cities burning, phoenix symbolism, digital resets—all mirror this arc of destruction leading to renewal. Riddler Visuals and BG123’s Confirmation No XRP moon date decode would be complete without mentioning BearableGuy123 (BG123), the mysterious figure behind many of the XRP community’s most famous riddles. David Rule points to one of BG123’s visuals showing a rocket passing a star—interpreted as April—before shooting into space. Combined with consistent references to 19s, 36s, and mirrored clocks, Rule believes BG123 visually endorsed this exact timeline for XRP’s ascension. A Convergence of Codes and Culture For seasoned XRP followers, this decode by David Rule is more than numerology or internet riddles—it’s a cultural narrative, woven with deep symbolism and a sense of prophetic destiny. While critics might brush off such theories as speculative fiction, the XRP community has long embraced this unique blend of logic, pattern recognition, and metaphorical language to navigate a market that often defies conventional analysis. In sum, Rule’s breakdown presents April 19, 2025, as the culmination of hidden signals, time-tested symbolism, and spiritual metaphor. It’s the day the phoenix rises, the financial reset begins, and XRP fulfills its long-awaited potential. Whether one believes in riddler logic or not, one thing is certain: the date is now etched in XRP folklore. Bookmark it. Watch it. April 19.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has hinted at future integrations between Gemini AI models and Veo, aiming to enhance Gemini’s “understanding of the physical world.” This suggests that Veo 2 is just the first step in a more ambitious roadmap for Google’s AI video capabilities. Current Limitations of Veo 2: Video Length: Limited to 8-second clips. Resolution: 720p resolution may not be sufficient for all professional applications. Access Restrictions: Currently limited to Gemini Advanced subscribers and personal accounts. Monthly Limits: Users are subject to monthly video creation limits. Despite these limitations, Veo 2 provides a powerful entry point into AI video generation for Gemini Advanced users. The ease of use, direct integration, and sharing capabilities make it a valuable tool for experimenting with and understanding the potential of this technology. Ethical Implications and the Future of AI Video Generation The rise of AI video generation technologies like Veo 2 also brings forth important ethical considerations and potential disruptions to creative industries. Concerns about job displacement, misinformation, and the authenticity of digital content are increasingly relevant. A recent study by the Animation Guild highlights these worries, estimating that over 100,000 jobs in the US film, television, and animation sectors could be disrupted by AI by 2026. These concerns are valid and warrant careful consideration as AI video technology evolves. Watermarking technologies like Google’s SynthID are a step in the right direction to address authenticity, but broader discussions around ethical guidelines, responsible use, and workforce adaptation are crucial to navigate the impact of AI video generation on society and the creative economy. Key Ethical and Future Considerations: Job Displacement: Impact on creative professions and the need for workforce adaptation. Misinformation: Potential for misuse in creating fake or misleading video content. Authenticity: Ensuring the provenance and authenticity of AI-generated videos. Ethical Guidelines: Developing industry standards and ethical frameworks for AI video generation . Future Enhancements: Continued development towards higher resolution, longer videos, and more sophisticated creative controls. Google AI ’s move to bring Veo 2 to Gemini Advanced is a significant milestone in the evolution of video generation . While still in its early stages, Veo 2 offers a glimpse into a future where creating compelling video content becomes more accessible and democratized. As competition intensifies and technology advances, the world of AI video is poised for rapid transformation, presenting both exciting opportunities and critical challenges for creators, industries, and society as a whole.

This sudden liquidation has put the asset in a bearish condition, plunging under $1. After reestablishing support above the $5.6 level to form a new bullish pattern last week, OM bounced back and increased well. The buying was short-lived under $7 due to a rejection, and the price dropped briefly into a calm phase for days. Unfortunately, that week ended in pain following a sudden massive crash below $1 within an hour, sparking roughly 100% loss in a single day. According to JP Mullin, the co-founder and the CEO of Mantra protocol, the crash came as a result of “forced closures of positions”, citing timing and depth of the crash came as a result of insufficient warning or notice. While this scenario looks similar to that of the Luna and FTT collapse saga in 2021, history might be repeating itself with a similar pattern, as this could be an indication of a full-scale crypto bearish season as few altcoins might follow the trend in the next few days. Additionally, being one of the first tokens to kickstart bull run, with over 50x increase in a year, OM is among the best-performed altcoins with massive returns on investment during the bull cycle. But considering the latest crash to a year low, the bulls are trapped in a big loss, and from a technical standpoint, they may not recover from it. OM’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the bears are technically in control, reclaiming $0.465 and the recent yearly $0.37 low would be their next target. Breaking it could plunge the price to $0.2 and $0.1 in the near term. In case of a major recovery, the key level to keep in mind for a retest is $1. Right above this resistance lies the $2 and $3 levels.

The Finance Minister is expected to respond to this request soon. This is an AI-generated article powered by DeepNewz, curated by The Defiant.

What if you could directly spend your crypto, seamlessly and globally? Well, get ready to ditch those conversion hassles because Solayer, the innovative Solana (SOL) re-staking protocol, is changing the game with their brand-new crypto debit card , the “Emerald Card”! Unveiling the Emerald Card: Your Gateway to Seamless Cryptocurrency Payments Solayer, known for its pioneering InfiniSVM infrastructure, has just announced the launch of the Emerald Card, a game-changing crypto debit card designed to simplify how you use your digital assets in the real world. According to reports from The Block, this card allows users to make purchases using cryptocurrencies without the need for immediate fiat conversion. This is a significant leap forward, bridging the gap between the crypto world and traditional commerce. Imagine paying for your morning coffee or your online shopping spree directly with your Solana or other supported cryptocurrencies – that’s the power the Emerald Card puts in your hands. Why is the Emerald Card a Game Changer for Cryptocurrency Payments? Let’s dive into what makes the Emerald Card stand out in the increasingly crowded crypto landscape: Direct Cryptocurrency Spending: The core benefit is clear – spend your cryptocurrency payments directly without the intermediary step of converting to fiat. This saves time, reduces potential fees, and simplifies the entire purchasing process. Global Reach: Availability in 100 countries, including the United States, is a massive win. This widespread accessibility ensures that a large global audience can benefit from this innovative crypto debit card . Seamless Integration: Compatibility with Apple Pay and Android Pay, along with tap-and-pay functionality, means the Emerald Card fits effortlessly into your existing payment habits. It’s designed for convenience and ease of use. InfiniSVM Infrastructure: Built on Solayer’s robust InfiniSVM infrastructure, the card benefits from a secure and efficient backbone, ensuring reliable transactions. Benefits of Using a Crypto Debit Card Like the Emerald Card The advantages of using a crypto debit card extend beyond mere convenience. Let’s explore some key benefits: Enhanced Financial Flexibility: Access and spend your crypto holdings just like traditional funds, providing greater control and flexibility over your assets. Reduced Conversion Fees: Bypass exchange fees associated with converting crypto to fiat for everyday spending. Wider Crypto Adoption: The Emerald Card promotes wider adoption of cryptocurrency payments by making them more accessible and user-friendly for daily transactions. Potential Rewards and Incentives: While not explicitly mentioned in the initial announcement, crypto debit cards often come with rewards programs, cashback, or other incentives, potentially adding extra value for users. (Further details on Emerald Card rewards are awaited). Potential Challenges and Considerations While the Emerald Card presents an exciting opportunity, it’s important to consider potential challenges and factors that users should be aware of: Challenge Consideration Regulatory Landscape: Cryptocurrency regulations vary significantly across countries. Users should be aware of the legal and tax implications of using a crypto debit card in their jurisdiction. Volatility of Cryptocurrencies: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate. Spending crypto directly means the purchasing power might change between the time of purchase and the actual transaction settlement. Adoption by Merchants: While the Emerald Card integrates with existing payment systems, widespread merchant adoption of cryptocurrency payments , in general, is still evolving. Security and Custody: Users need to understand how the card handles security and custody of their cryptocurrencies. It’s crucial to use reputable and secure platforms. Solana’s Expanding Ecosystem and the Role of Solayer Solayer’s launch of the Emerald Card further strengthens the Solana ecosystem. Solana has been gaining significant traction in the crypto space due to its high transaction speeds and lower fees compared to some other blockchains. Protocols like Solayer, built on Solana, are contributing to its growth by developing innovative applications and services. The Emerald Card is a prime example of how Solana’s infrastructure can be leveraged to create practical and user-centric cryptocurrency payments solutions. How to Get Your Hands on the Emerald Card? (Actionable Insights) While specific details on how to apply for the Emerald Card are yet to be fully released, here’s what you can do to stay informed and potentially be among the first users: Follow Solayer’s Official Channels: Keep an eye on Solayer’s official website, Twitter, and other social media channels for announcements regarding the Emerald Card launch, application process, and availability. Join the Solayer Community: Engage with the Solayer community on platforms like Telegram or Discord to get updates and insights from other users and the team. Sign Up for Notifications: Look for options to sign up for email newsletters or notifications on Solayer’s website to receive direct updates about the Emerald Card. The Future of Cryptocurrency Payments is Here Solayer’s Emerald Card is more than just another crypto debit card ; it’s a symbol of the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency payments . It represents a move towards greater accessibility, usability, and real-world application of digital assets. By eliminating the friction of fiat conversion and leveraging the speed and efficiency of the Solana blockchain, the Emerald Card paves the way for a future where spending crypto is as seamless and convenient as using traditional currencies.

Last month, Semler Scientific disclosed that it had received a civil investigative demand, or CID — essentially, a subpoena from a federal agency that typically precedes a lawsuit — from the DOJ back in 2017. The company at that time said it had complied with several subsequent subpoenas over the following years and began initial settlement discussions with the DOJ in February. That news, along with the decline in the price of bitcoin, had helped crater SMLR shares, which were lower by 37% year-to-date as of the close of trading on Tuesday. In today's disclosure, Semler said that it had inked an agreement with crypto exchange Coinbase allowing it to borrow both cash and digital assets, using its bitcoin holdings as collateral. If the company’s settlement agreement with the DOJ is approved, Semler “intends to borrow under the Coinbase master loan agreement and use such proceeds (along with its cash on hand) to pay the proposed settlement with DOJ.” Semler Scientific’s settlement agreement with the DOJ is in principle, meaning that it is not yet set in stone. Ready to restart bitcoin purchases With the DOJ cloud hanging over it, Semler had not added to its 3,192 bitcoin stack for more than two months, but that appears as if it will soon change. ""Excited to buy more bitcoin,"" tweeted company Chairman Eric Semler as the settlement (in principle) was announced.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors watching the tech landscape, the synergy between AI and cloud computing is undeniable. In a strategic move signaling deeper integration, AI startup Anthropic, backed by Amazon, has announced the formation of a dedicated team to accelerate the adoption of its AI products within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. This development underscores the exploding growth in the AI cloud sector and the intensifying competition among tech giants. Unveiling the Anthropic AWS Partnership Team: What’s the Big Deal? Anthropic’s creation of this new team isn’t just another corporate reshuffle; it’s a clear indicator of the escalating importance of their relationship with Amazon. Here’s a breakdown of why this news is significant: Dedicated Focus: This team is solely dedicated to growing Anthropic’s business within AWS. This concentrated effort suggests a serious commitment to leveraging AWS’s massive customer base. Revenue Driven: Job listings explicitly mention “multi-billion dollar revenue opportunities,” highlighting the immense financial stakes and expectations tied to this partnership. Strategic Alignment: The team will work closely with senior leadership from both Anthropic and Amazon, indicating a deeply integrated and strategically aligned approach. Global Scale: The initiative aims to build programs that scale across global markets, showcasing the ambition to establish Anthropic’s AI as a leading solution worldwide through the AWS infrastructure. This dedicated team is designed to be a growth engine, specifically targeting AWS customers to integrate Anthropic’s cutting-edge AI models, like the Claude family, into their operations. For those in the crypto space tracking technological advancements, this move exemplifies how AI infrastructure is being built on cloud platforms, mirroring the foundations of many blockchain projects. How Does This Impact AI Cloud Growth and the Competitive Landscape? The Anthropic AWS Partnership is a powerful combination with significant implications for the broader AI and cloud computing sectors. Consider these key impacts: Impact Area Description Accelerated AI Adoption By making Anthropic’s AI more readily accessible to AWS customers, this partnership will likely accelerate the overall adoption of advanced AI technologies across various industries. AWS Competitive Edge Exclusivity and optimized performance of Anthropic’s models on AWS Bedrock give Amazon a competitive advantage in attracting businesses seeking robust AI solutions. Anthropic Revenue Surge Leveraging AWS’s vast reach can propel Anthropic towards its ambitious revenue targets, aiming for $12 billion by 2027. Market Consolidation Concerns Regulatory bodies are scrutinizing these deep tech partnerships, raising questions about potential market dominance and reduced competition in the AI landscape. For crypto investors, the growth of the AI cloud growth sector is relevant as it represents a significant area of technological advancement and investment. Just as cloud infrastructure underpins much of the current internet, it is becoming the bedrock for the AI revolution. The success of companies like Anthropic and their partnerships with cloud giants like AWS will shape the future of AI accessibility and deployment. AWS AI Adoption : Why are Customers Turning to Anthropic? What makes Anthropic’s AI so appealing to AWS customers? Several factors are at play: Cutting-Edge Models: Anthropic’s Claude models are recognized for their advanced capabilities in natural language processing and understanding, attracting businesses needing sophisticated AI. AWS Bedrock Optimization: Anthropic has specifically optimized its models to run efficiently on AWS Bedrock, offering performance advantages and exclusive features. Seamless Integration: Collaborations with AWS partners like Accenture and Palantir streamline the integration of Anthropic’s AI into existing enterprise workflows via the AWS ecosystem. Proven Track Record: The fact that “tens of thousands” of Bedrock customers are already using Claude models speaks to the technology’s proven value and reliability. The ease of AWS AI adoption through platforms like Bedrock is a key driver for businesses. For the crypto community, this ease of access mirrors the ongoing efforts to simplify blockchain technology and cryptocurrency adoption for mainstream users. The Regulatory Gaze on Anthropic Revenue and Big Tech Partnerships While the Anthropic AWS Partnership promises growth and innovation, it’s also attracting regulatory scrutiny. Here’s what you need to know about the oversight: FTC Investigation: The Federal Trade Commission is examining the impacts of Big Tech investments in AI startups like Anthropic, concerned about competitive balance. CMA Scrutiny: The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority investigated whether Amazon’s partnership gives it undue influence over Anthropic. Focus on Lock-in and Data: Regulators are concerned that these partnerships could lead to vendor lock-in and the sharing of sensitive data, potentially undermining fair competition. No Enforcement (Yet): While concerns are present, neither the FTC nor CMA has initiated enforcement action against the Anthropic-Amazon deal so far. The regulatory landscape is crucial for the long-term trajectory of the AI industry. For crypto markets familiar with regulatory uncertainties, the scrutiny of Anthropic revenue streams and Big Tech influence is a familiar narrative. The balance between fostering innovation and ensuring fair competition remains a key challenge. Cloud AI Strategy : What Does This Mean for the Future? The Anthropic AWS Partnership is a microcosm of the broader cloud AI strategy being adopted by major tech players. Key takeaways for the future include: Cloud as the AI Platform: Cloud infrastructure is solidifying its position as the primary platform for developing, deploying, and scaling AI solutions. Strategic Alliances: Deep partnerships between AI specialists and cloud providers will become increasingly common to drive innovation and market reach. Focus on Enterprise Adoption: The focus is shifting towards making AI accessible and practical for enterprise applications, driving real-world business value. Continued Regulatory Scrutiny: Expect ongoing regulatory attention to ensure a competitive and fair AI market as these partnerships evolve. In conclusion, Anthropic’s dedicated AWS team signifies a major push to capitalize on the exploding AI cloud growth . This partnership is not just about two companies; it’s a bellwether for the direction of the AI industry, highlighting the crucial role of cloud platforms and strategic alliances in shaping the future of artificial intelligence. For those in the cryptocurrency world, understanding these technological shifts is vital as AI and blockchain technologies potentially converge and reshape industries in the years to come.

But despite its recent rally, a jump to $20 — a figure often thrown around by ultra-bullish holders — would require historic levels of market cap expansion and investor inflows. While XRP fights for every dollar of growth, a new contender is making waves with a much lower barrier to upside: MAGACOIN FINANCE , a fast-growing altcoin project catching the attention of traders and analysts alike. Here’s a quick look at where XRP stands right now: Current Price: $2.13 Intraday High: $2.21 Intraday Low: $2.08 24-Hour Change: +0.019% Despite solid price action, even the most optimistic analysts agree — reaching $20 would require XRP to become the second-largest asset in all of crypto. That’s a tall order. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering something far simpler: massive upside from a micro price. FROM $0.0002908 TO $0.007 — A STRAIGHTFORWARD 25X OPPORTUNITY MAGACOIN FINANCE recently SOLD OUT Stage 6 of its presale and is now gaining steam with Stage 7 LIVE . Its current presale price sits at $0.0002908 , with a confirmed listing target of $0.007 — translating to a direct 25x ROI , or 2,300% gain for early investors. That kind of return doesn’t require a billion-dollar market cap shift — it just takes continued presale momentum and strong post-listing demand. So far, the project is delivering both. Already trending in crypto news outlets , MAGACOIN FINANCE is now featured by major crypto publishers , with over 12,500 holders joining the movement in just a few weeks. WHY ANALYSTS CALL IT A NEXT 100X ALTCoin JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW The appeal isn’t just in the numbers. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as a textbook early-stage opportunity , with the kind of viral community traction and presale structure that helped previous breakout projects gain liftoff. Many experts believe a CMC listing is around the corner , further elevating visibility just as demand spikes heading into the final presale stages. XRP may or may not hit $20 — but MAGACOIN FINANCE doesn’t need to go anywhere near that to make millionaires. The path to 25x is already in place,” said one analyst in a recent April watchlist update. FINAL THOUGHT: DIFFERENT GAME, DIFFERENT TIMELINE 🔥 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER — ENDS SOON! USE MAGA50X XRP still holds long-term potential — but it’s a slow grind to the top. MAGACOIN FINANCE , on the other hand, is built for momentum now. With its low price point, massive upside potential, and strong pre-launch interest, it’s become one of the most talked-about tokens heading into Q2. With Stage 7 now LIVE , a presale price of just $0.0002908 , and a listing target of $0.007 , the setup is clear. You don’t need a $20 token when a 25x return is sitting right in front of you.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 149,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s weekly logarithmic moving average convergence divergence (LMACD) histogram indicator is starting to strengthen, signaling a possible rally. The LMACD histogram indicator is designed to signal changes in an asset’s trend, strength and momentum. Shrinking bars on the histogram suggest that an asset’s trend momentum is weakening. In Bitcoin’s case, the histogram’s declining red bars may indicate that a market reversal is in sight. Says Dave the Wave, “Bull markets climb a wall of worry. First strengthening histogram on the weekly BTC chart in 18 weeks/4.5 months. Weekly MACD itself has not been below the zero-line, in bear territory, since Feb 2023, i.e.; an ongoing bull market.

43387832,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=731865,1744761655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43387832.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Fails To Launch With $751 Million In Outflows, Are Institutions Cashing Out?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-sees-massive-outflows/,"The Bitcoin price continues to face headwinds, as the latest report on Digital Asset Fund Flows shows a staggering $751 million in outflows from the digital asset. The sheer volume of this withdrawal raises alarm bells about whether institutions may be cashing out from the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price Faces Pressure Amid Massive Outflows CoinShares’ weekly report on Digital Asset Fund Flows has disclosed a massive $795 million in outflows from the crypto market—shockingly, $751 million of which came from Bitcoin alone. This mass exodus marks one of the largest single-week outflows of the year, and it comes at a time when the price of Bitcoin has hit a wall. Related Reading: $9.41 Billion In Shorts At Risk Of Liquidation If Bitcoin Price Hits This Level James Butterfill, the Head of Research at CoinShares, revealed that since early February 2025, digital asset investment products have suffered cumulative outflows of approximately $7.2 billion, effectively erasing almost all the year-to-date inflows. Notably, this week marks the third consecutive week of declines, with Bitcoin leading the downturn and recording the most significant losses among major digital assets. As of this report, net flows for 2025 have dwindled to a modest $165 million, a sharp drop from a multi-billion dollar peak just two months ago. This steep decline underscores a cooling sentiment among institutional investors and highlights a growing sense of caution amid ongoing market volatility. Currently, the Bitcoin price is struggling to regain past all-time highs, with recent outflows serving as one of the many barriers hindering the cryptocurrency’s breakout potential. Until these outflows reverse and the market stabilizes, Bitcoin’s path to setting new all-time highs remains challenged. Despite losing $751 million in outflows, Bitcoin still maintains a moderately positive position with $545 million in net year-to-date inflows. However, the sheer scale and speed of the latest outflows raise concern. The fact that Bitcoin suffered such a massive withdrawal signals a potential shift in sentiment among institutions. Whether it’s due to profit-taking or macroeconomic uncertainty, this move suggests that big players are beginning to pull out — at least in the short term. In addition to Bitcoin, Ethereum saw $37 million in outflows, while Solana, Aave, and SUI also posted losses of $5.1 million, $0.78 million, and $0.58 million, respectively. Surprisingly, even short Bitcoin products, designed to benefit from market downturns, weren’t spared, recording $4.6 million in outflows. Tariffs And Political Volatility Drive Outflows One of the key drivers behind the pullback across digital assets is the rising economic uncertainty sparked by tariff policies that have adversely influenced investor sentiment. The wave of negative sentiment began in February after United States (US) President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on all imports coming into the country from Canada, Mexico, and China. Related Reading: Trump’s Tariff Pause Could Push Bitcoin Price Above $100,000, Pundit Reveals Exit Point However, a late-week rebound in crypto prices was seen after Trump’s temporary reversal of the controversial tariffs, providing a brief respite for the market. This policy shift helped boost total Asset Under Management (AUM) across digital assets from a low of $120 billion on April 8 to $130 billion, marking an 8% recovery.

While both coins remain in focus, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing broader attention after raising $214 million and posting a 2,380% rise in price. Now, its newly launched 600% Golden Ticket offer is drawing waves of new participants. With special airdrop access and a major global convention on the horizon, interest continues to climb. The highly anticipated 7th AMA, scheduled for April 17, has further added to the momentum surrounding what many now view as one of 2025’s most promising blockchain stories. Solana’s 16.7% Recovery Strengthens Confidence Among Big Players Solana’s price trend is beginning to shift in a positive direction. After retreating close to the $100 mark, it has climbed back by 16.7%, now holding steady above $120. Analysts link this upward move to renewed accumulation from major entities, highlighted by a recent $3.72 million SOL acquisition by a large whale—a strong show of faith in Solana’s future growth. Chart indicators back this optimism. Solana has established firm support above $100 and has moved past a key downward trendline at $107. The next notable zones to watch are $130 and $140, which may trigger further upside action. With its fast, low-cost framework still favored by developers, Solana continues to stand out as a key Layer-1 altcoin heading into the second quarter. Dogecoin Gears Up for Potential Breakout Toward $0.40 Dogecoin is showing early signs of building momentum. Currently trading near $0.14, it’s been consolidating tightly, with forecasts now pointing toward a jump to $0.21 or even a possible test of $0.40 if the trend holds. Technical markers like the RSI suggest bullish behavior is gaining ground, indicating an upward breakout could be forming. Excitement around Dogecoin has been revived by ETF rumors and rising usage across payment platforms. These developments are reigniting interest from retail buyers, especially as it nears key resistance levels. If these barriers are crossed, Dogecoin could reenter the spotlight with strong price action in the coming sessions. BlockDAG’s 600% Golden Ticket Pushes Presale Success Higher Beyond what’s happening with Solana and Dogecoin, BlockDAG’s achievements continue to set it apart. In just ten months, the project has generated $214 million in crypto presale funds while climbing 2,380% in price. But the latest move—the launch of its 600% Golden Ticket bonus—is taking things to a new level. Anyone joining the ecosystem with code BDAG1200 will receive 600% more coins, setting a new benchmark for presale incentives. Alongside this, participants will also receive early access to an exclusive coin airdrop, adding further appeal. These features, backed by strong project fundamentals, have pushed BlockDAG to the top of the Layer-1 conversations heading into 2025. The campaign is being actively highlighted ahead of the April 17 AMA, where the team plans to reveal fresh roadmap updates and strategic initiatives. There’s also strong excitement around the first BlockDAG Global Convention, which will move the discussion from digital platforms to live events in multiple cities. While the full schedule remains under wraps, those attending are expected to gain early exposure to various elements of the BlockDAG network. CEO Antony Turner, speaking during the third keynote, described the current phase by saying: “We’re not simply dreaming about the future—we’re shaping it, building it, and defining it with purpose and commitment.” The platform’s hybrid model—blending Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with Proof-of-Work (PoW)—delivers both scalability and security. This architecture enables parallel transaction handling without compromising on decentralization. With large-scale miner preparation already underway, BlockDAG is delivering the kind of performance many protocols only claim to provide. Final Words! Solana’s recent price growth and Dogecoin’s move toward key levels are both worth watching, but BlockDAG’s numbers already show strong traction. A 600% Golden Ticket bonus, $214 million raised, exclusive airdrops, and a fast-approaching AMA give this project real presence. People joining the platform are doing so for its performance, community rewards, and its practical use potential. From mining to long-term engagement and network activity, BlockDAG offers a wide range of features. As the Global Convention nears, the project continues to shift expectations for what a presale success can look like in 2025.

Its inclusion in the exchange’s second “Vote to Delist” program triggered strong community backlash and renewed discussion about privacy’s role in crypto. While voting remains open until April 16, 2025, but Binance’s final decision rests on internal checks like liquidity and development activity. Including Zcash for vote raised concerns, voiced by figures like Gemini Co-Founder Tyler Winklevoss, about exchanges sidelining privacy tech. Crypto advocate Zooko tagged Binance CEO Richard Teng, arguing Zcash’s inclusion is unjustified. Zcash is privacy technology that protects human rights. I hope @binance does not delist it.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell to $83,600, extending the retreat from the two-week high of $86,440 reached earlier in the day, CoinDesk data showed. Payments-focused XRP followed a similar trajectory, falling over 2% to $2.08, while Cardano's ADA token slipped 4% to $0.61. The CoinDesk 20 Index , a broader market gauge, weakened over 2%. Meanwhile, coins supposedly associated with artificial intelligence (AI) continued to fare worse as shares in NVDA tanked 8% to $89.10 after the company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it expects to write down $5.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter due to the new restrictions on exports of its H20 chip to China. The news came a day after unusual activity in NVDA put options pointing to an impending market swoon. The futures tied to the Nasdaq index fell over 1% as well, offering negative cues to risk assets in general. The next catalyst awaiting release Wednesday morning Eastern time is the U.S. retail sales report for March. Per economists polled by Dow Jones, the data is expected to show a 1.2% increase in consumer spending on the month, up from a 0.2% climb in February. A better-than-expected report will likely help assuage recession fears triggered by President Donald Trump's trade war with China and other trading partners. However, there is a risk that markets will dismiss it as backward-looking, failing to account for the major escalation in trade tensions seen this month. Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell is also scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago on his outlook for the U.S. economy. ""All eyes are on Powell. Markets are holding their breath for Powell on Wednesday. Between the trade war and rising recession chatter, traders are watching for any hint the Fed might be forced to cut sooner than expected,"" Secure Digital Markets said in Tuesday's research note. The forward-looking market-based measures like the inflation breakevens have dropped amid trade tensions, pointing to the disinflationary impact of Trump's tariffs. That could provide the Fed with a leeway to cut rates. Early this week, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the bank would be forced to quickly make a series of ""bad news"" rate cuts if the U.S. president reimposes the levies unveiled on April 2. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations on April 2 but quickly suspended the same for most nations, excluding China, for 90 days.

Mantra set aside 300 million OM, 16.88% of the token’s nearly 1.78 billion total supply, for its team and core contributors. They are currently locked and were scheduled to be released in stages between April 2027 and October 2029, according to an April 8 blog post. The team’s tokens are worth around $236 million, with OM currently trading around 78 cents but were worth around $1.89 billion before the token sank on April 13, going from around $6.30 to a low of 52 cents and wiping over $5.5 billion in value, according to CoinGecko. Source: JP Mullin Many community members welcomed Mullin’s pledge, but others saw the token burn as a potential blow to the team’s long-term commitment to building the real-world asset tokenization platform. “This would be a mistake. We want teams that are highly incentivized. Burning the incentive may seem like a good gesture but it will hurt the team motivation long term,” said Crypto Banter founder Ran Neuner. Mullin suggested a decentralized vote could determine whether to burn the 300 million team tokens. Mantra recovery process already underway Mullin promised a post-mortem statement explaining what went wrong to be transparent with the community. Speaking to Cointelegraph on April 14, Mullin outlined plans to leverage the $109 million Mantra Ecosystem Fund for potential token buybacks and burns to stabilize OM’s price, which had fallen from $6.30 to as low as $0.52. Related: Red flag? Mantra's TVL jumped 500% as OM price collapsed Mullin’s firm has strongly refuted rumors that it controls 90% of OM’s token supply and engaged in insider trading and market manipulation. Mantra claims the OM price implosion was triggered by “reckless liquidations,"" adding that it wasn’t related to any actions undertaken by the team. OKX and Binance were among the crypto exchanges that saw significant OM activity right before the token collapse. Both exchanges denied any wrongdoing, attributing the collapse to changes made to OM’s tokenomics in October and unusual volatility that ultimately triggered high-volume cross-exchange liquidations on April 13.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) together with Dogecoin (DOGE) benefit from whale accumulation and technical breakouts yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart as a presale project which combines DeFi utility and explosive growth dynamics. The Phase 4 presale of MUTM has drawn $6.8 million from 8,300 holders as the project aims for a 67% increase while DOGE seeks triple-digit gains and SHIB prepares for a similar climb. This demonstrates an investor movement toward operational financial crypto projects. Shiba Inu Nears Critical Resistance Shiba Inu (SHIB) challenges the crucial resistance point of $0.00001201 while awaiting a breakthrough to determine its forthcoming movement. Experts predict that breakout levels above the current barrier at $0.00001201 could spark a 67% price surge toward $0.00002 because of daily trading at $194 million. SHIB faces a challenge given that its $7.08 billion market value exists in spite of meme-based speculation when compared to new crypto systems offering defined infrastructure. The SHIB price moves with market sentiments combined with retail public opinion at present yet future investors in the MUTM presale can avoid volatility by using stepwise increasing price point tiers. Dogecoin Whales Fuel Optimism Dogecoin brought the price back to $0.16 which indicates that whales may create a 3x price rise to $0.50 as they buy 1.83 billion tokens worth $640.5 million. Dogecoin shows possible upward movement based on the falling wedge pattern combined with bullish RSI divergence but its price action remains controlled by macroeconomic trends and social media trending effects. Derivatives market open interest has risen 5.62 percent to $1.5 billion while this derivative lacks fundamental value which exposes it to intense market sentiment changes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a lending solution by using its mtTokens to drive organic demand and implementing revenue-dependent buyback strategies which mitigate market instabilities. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) established new presale standards through the sale of 405 million tokens at $0.025 during Phase 4. The start of Phase 5 sees Mutuum Finance increasing their token price from $0.03 which would give all current investors an instant 20% return before the platform goes live. The planned tokenomics will enable a 140% ROI at the $0.06 listing price followed by projected market developments that anticipate a price surge to $3.50 which represents a 13,900% increase from current market value. MUTM provides unique value as a decentralized lending protocol that generates interest through mtToken and stake rewards which builds continuous buying momentum unlike the absence in meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a Certik smart contract audit which will receive its official release soon. The investment community gains more confidence through this measure at the same time its pre-sales become increasingly popular thanks to new tracking tools monitoring the top 50 holders. Participants who hold their positions receive bonus items that encourage holding time through additional tokens while promoting price stability following the project launch. Getting In Fast In the Market Changes While SHIB and DOGE hinge on speculative rallies, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) merges DeFi innovation with presale urgency. Phase 4 offers a $0.025 entry point that is quickly disappearing which will significantly reduce possible profits for those who join during Phase 5. The initial positions taken by early supporters in the present moment give them the opportunity to enjoy a 140% upward movement at MUTM’s launch and onward exponential expansion when its lending system activates. The declining reputation of Cardano contrasts with these alternative cryptocurrencies which choose different directions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives investors a calculated DeFi entry ticket during Phase 5 while SHIB and DOGE represent a high-risk hype-centered opportunity. The time remains short for prospective investors who want to achieve first-mover advantage because Phase 4 has started and audits are approaching. Secure your position in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 4 today—before prices rise and tokens sell out.

ETFs will include staking via TD pic.twitter.com/FSw149Xkm4 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 14, 2025 Staking Features Could Boost Returns For Investors One of the main features distinguishing these Solana ETFs is their capacity for staking the underlying SOL positions. The OSC has allowed the issuers of ETFs to stake some portion of their Solana, and this could unlock extra returns for investors in excess of price appreciation alone. TD Bank reported that returns from staking SOL can be higher than those from Ethereum staking, and thus these products could be more appealing to yield-starved investors. The bank also referred to them as “the world’s first spot Solana ETFs,” emphasizing the innovative character of these financial products. US Solana ETF Market Experiences Mixed Results The US market so far has only futures-based Solana ETFs, with limited success. Balchunas noted that two SOL futures ETFs in the United States, Volatility Shares 2x SOL ETF and Volatility Shares SOL ETF, have failed to gain investor attention since their launch in March 2025. Both of these products have only accumulated a combined assets under management of nearly $14 million. For comparison, the Teucrium 2x XRP ETF performed better even though it came out later after the SOL products, implying unequal investor interest in disparate cryptocurrency ETFs.

He advised followers not to engage with the account until prominent attorney John Deaton could verify whether it had been compromised. “This post looks wrong in many ways. Please do not trust this until you see confirmation he hasn’t been hacked,” David Schwartz wrote . The warning followed a post by John Deaton on X touting Arch Public , a crypto-related website. To long-time followers, the post (tagging big names, including crypto exchange Gemini) came across as an endorsement and raised eyebrows. Recognized for his vocal, energetic defense of XRP holders and calls for regulatory clarity, including recent lobbying for the Hinman documents to see the light of day, Deaton usually sticks with legal skirmishes, policy wonkery, and the rights of crypto investors. By contrast, the Arch Public post came across as strange, with some market watchers finding its lack of background, explanation, or context that usually makes its way into his updates suspicious. Deaton breaks silence to reaffirm intentions, vows to address concerns in live session Ripple CTO urged the lawyer’s 354,000 followers to remain cautious following the suspicious post. His concern sparked reactions from other users. Many began questioning whether Deaton’s account had been taken over, especially with the unusually long silence. Others shared screenshots of the post, highlighting the red flags in its writing. Deaton later issued a clarification in response. He reiterated his devotion to democratizing investing for everyday people , a cause he argued has informed why he has backed projects like XRP, Bitcoin, SpendTheBits, and the free algorithm from ArchPublic. These projects, he said, were intended to give everyday investors access to opportunities that have traditionally been available only to the financial elite. Deaton acknowledged past criticism, including accusations of being a Ripple plant and being targeted by Bitcoin maximalists. However, he maintained that if a tool can help people build wealth without requiring payment or risk, he’s willing to stand behind it—regardless of skepticism. He continued to say that he was traveling and hoped to go live on April 16, 2025, on X at 3 PM EST to address concerns or questions. He noted that he was grateful for genuine concern and misinformation or misperception. Deaton also addressed some of his criticism, including allegations that he was a “Ripple plant” and backlash from Bitcoin maximalists. Still, he continues to stand by his belief that if a platform can help people build wealth without needing to put money on the line or risk anything, it’s worth his support. Deaton noted that he would go live on X at 3 PM EST on April 16, 2025, since he was traveling. He noted that he intended to clear up “any question that anyone was confused about. He was grateful for the legitimate concern and acknowledged the mix of misinformation surrounding the incident.

Additionally, on April 15, h ackers targeting Ethereum scaling protocol ZKsync stole about $5 million of its native ZK crypto because of “a compromised” administrative account that allowed them to take control of unclaimed tokens from a recent airdrop. The crypto industry has suffered a series of thefts, prompting questions about the security of customer funds, with hacking hauls totaling more than $2 billion in 2024 – the fourth straight year where proceeds have topped more than $1 billion.

BlockDAG’s New Testnet Launch Shakes Up HBAR & XLM Holders,https://thecoinrise.com/is-1-bdag-closer-than-you-think-blockdags-new-testnet-launch-shakes-up-hbar-xlm-holders/,"Investors are watching closely as three major altcoins make headlines—Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), and BlockDAG (BDAG). While all three coins show signs of potential growth, only one is pairing that potential with hard, measurable progress. Stellar (XLM) is recovering from a steep 65% drop, with analysts pointing to a descending wedge—a bullish technical pattern. If confirmed, this could signal a short-term rally toward $0.42 or even $0.47. Similarly, Hedera (HBAR) has spiked 10% after announcing integration with Chainlink’s cross-chain protocol (CCIP), broadening its access to over 46 networks. Momentum indicators show short-term promise, though a decisive break above $0.20 is needed for confidence in long-term gains. But while XLM and HBAR offer “if-this-then-that” scenarios, BlockDAG is already executing. A live Beta Testnet with over 170,000 active wallets, 10,000 custom ASIC miners en route before the mainnet, and a $214 million presale without any institutional capital? That’s not speculation. That’s traction. BDAG has jumped 2,380% since Batch 1, now priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27—and that growth is rooted in delivery, not hype. Stellar (XLM) Eyes Breakout After 65% Crash – Is This the Start of a Big Rebound? Stellar (XLM) might be gearing up for a strong comeback after dropping over 65% since its November 2024 high of $0.636. The coin is now trading inside a descending wedge—a pattern that often signals a bullish breakout. On April 7, XLM bounced off a key support area near $0.21, backed by a bullish candlestick and key Fibonacci level. While the RSI remains below 50, showing lingering bearish momentum, the MACD hints at a trend shift. Chart analysts also spot a completed five-wave downtrend, suggesting a potential rally could be next, targeting $0.37 to $0.42. With Stellar sponsoring the 2025 Paris Blockchain Week, momentum could build fast. If the breakout confirms, XLM might push even higher toward $0.47. For buyers eyeing a high-upside play after a major correction, Stellar could be a solid bet in the coming weeks. HBAR Surges After Chainlink Deal — Is This Just the Beginning? Hedera’s (HBAR) recent 10% spike comes after big news: it’s now integrated with Chainlink’s cross-chain protocol (CCIP), connecting it to over 46 blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB, and Polygon. This move boosts Hedera’s DeFi potential, especially with its current low $70 million total value locked. HBAR is now testing a key resistance after bouncing from $0.126. While momentum indicators show strength, short-term charts hint at exhaustion. Still, long-term buyers might see an opportunity if HBAR breaks past $0.1675 and targets the $0.20 mark. Hedera’s edge lies in its speed—processing up to 10,000 transactions per second—far ahead of Ethereum and Bitcoin. If this Chainlink deal gains traction, HBAR could rally further. With trading volumes surging and market attention shifting, HBAR is warming up. For those eyeing a strong project with real-world use, now might be the time to watch HBAR closely. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Goes Live as $1 Price Target Draws Closer BlockDAG has officially launched its live Beta Testnet, marking a major step forward for the project. Over 170,000 users are already exploring the network, each receiving 10,000 BDAG testnet coins through a structured vesting model that mirrors how the mainnet will function. This isn’t just for show—the testnet provides real usage data, helping shape the final version of the network. Unlike many other crypto projects, BlockDAG is using the testnet as a practical onboarding tool, not just a promotional stunt. At the same time, BlockDAG’s custom mining hardware is being prepared for rollout. Around 10,000 X30 and X100 ASIC miners are set to ship before the 2025 mainnet launch. The presale results speak volumes: $214 million raised and 19.3 billion BDAG coins sold without support from big-name buyers. Since Batch 1, BDAG has climbed an impressive 2,380%, now priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27. With this kind of momentum, a move past the $1 mark isn’t just possible—it’s starting to look likely. BlockDAG isn’t just making promises—it’s delivering real progress. BlockDAG’s Going Viral In April — Here’s Why It Matters XLM and HBAR may eventually confirm bullish patterns or unlock new utility through integrations. But so far, these developments remain early-stage catalysts—ideas still needing validation in the open market. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is already operating like a post-mainnet project. Its Beta Testnet is live and growing. Real data is being collected. Real users are engaging with the ecosystem. The hardware layer is readying for deployment, creating a full-stack approach—rare even among top-tier layer-1 chains. The presale’s $214M raise and sale of 19.3 billion coins without VC or institutional support speaks to one thing: community belief built on delivery. As the $1 price target draws closer, BDAG isn’t chasing trends—it’s setting them. For serious crypto buyers looking for a project that’s past promises and into proof, BDAG offers the clearest signal in a crowded altcoin market.

BlockDAG Presale Hits $214M In April — Can Pi Coin or MANTRA Catch Up?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/over-2380-roi-blockdag-presale-hits-214m-in-april-can-pi-coin-or-mantra-catch-up/,"In a market driven by hype cycles and social sentiment, clarity comes not from the loudest project but from the one that’s delivering under the radar. Right now, three names are making noise for very different reasons. Pi Coin is attracting attention with its ambitious $3 price target, driven by controlled coin unlocks, strong community backing, and speculation around a potential coin burn. While still unlisted on major exchanges, it’s managed to build an active ecosystem that has early believers hopeful for a breakout—if execution follows promise. MANTRA (OM) is taking a bolder route, positioning itself as a serious contender in the Real-World Asset (RWA) and DeFi infrastructure space. With strategic backing from names like Google Cloud and partnerships with entities such as DAMAC and ZAND Bank, its momentum is real. Then there’s BlockDAG (BDAG)—a project less dependent on what might happen and more rooted in what already has. A presale raising over $214 million, third-party security audits from Halborn and CertiK, and a staggering 2,380% ROI since Batch 1—all point to one thing: buyer confidence backed by real fundamentals. While others sell potential, BlockDAG is quietly delivering results. Pi Coin Eyes $3? Here’s Why buyers Are Buzzing Over the Latest Price Jump Pi Coin surged over 9% recently, sparking excitement that it could hit $3 by June. Trading around $0.58, the rebound comes amid low coin unlocks and growing market confidence. Analysts say a possible coin burn by the Pi Core Team could balance supply, boosting chances for a rally. Despite recent dips, the Pi Network is gaining traction. With nearly $94 million worth of coins set to unlock in the next month, supply pressure remains, but optimism is high. If positive news drops and momentum holds, Pi could break resistance at $0.6133 and head higher. For early buyers, this could be a golden window. If Pi delivers on development promises, returns could multiply. Still, crypto markets are unpredictable—so watch key levels closely and don’t miss what might be Pi’s next big breakout. MANTRA (OM) Set for a Big 2025? Here’s Why Smart buyers Are Watching Closely MANTRA (OM) is quickly becoming a major player in the real-world asset (RWA) coinization and DeFi space. With the upcoming launch of Mantra Chain and partnerships with names like DAMAC, ZAND Bank, and Google Cloud, the project is gaining serious momentum. The $108 million MANTRA Ecosystem Fund aims to supercharge growth, backed by key players like Laser Digital and Amber Group. Whale activity also shows strong confidence—recent large buys followed earlier sell-offs, hinting at a bullish long-term outlook. OM is now trading around $6.34, holding strong above key moving averages. A push past $6.50 could trigger a run to $8 or even $10. For buyers looking to enter the RWA sector early, buying OM on dips near $5.60 with a stop loss at $4 could be a smart move ahead of 2025 gains. BlockDAG’s Secure Approach Wins Buyer Trust as Presale Crosses $210M BlockDAG is turning heads in the crypto space—not with flashy promises, but with real progress and solid foundations. Unlike many projects that rush to launch, BlockDAG has focused on building a secure, scalable ecosystem from the ground up. Its recent Keynote 3 update emphasized the project’s commitment to transparency and long-term reliability. Backed by thorough audits from top security firms Halborn and CertiK, BlockDAG has implemented advanced multi-layer protection. These independent checks aren’t just for show—they prove the platform is built to last. The presale numbers are just as impressive. BlockDAG has already raised over $214 million, selling more than 19.1 billion coins. Now in Batch 27, each BDAG coin is priced at $0.0248. Early participants, who bought in at just $0.001 during Batch 1, have seen returns of up to 2,380%. With this kind of growth and a strong security backbone, BlockDAG is quickly becoming a top pick for buyers looking for more than just hype. It’s not just a coin—it’s a carefully built ecosystem designed for real, lasting impact. What’s Next? Pi Coin is speculative, driven by timing and tokenomics. It has potential—but relies on future decisions from the core team to meet its $3 ambition. MANTRA is better structured, with visible industry partnerships and a growing footprint in RWA tokenization. It’s a serious contender, especially if adoption increases and Mantra Chain delivers. But BlockDAG is in another league—already proving its model works, both technically and financially. Its security-first approach, validated by top-tier audits, instills rare confidence in a market known for rug pulls and broken roadmaps. Add to that a transparent presale strategy, a massive fundraising milestone, and a product focus beyond hype—and it’s clear who’s playing the long game.

You get a digital ecosystem that doesn’t just survive—it dominates. From decentralized finance integrations to enterprise tools disrupting inefficient systems, these three names stand out. Qubetics , Avalanche, and Chainlink are not riding trends; they’re writing the blueprint for what’s next. Avalanche is gearing up for a game-changing upgrade that slashes transaction costs and boosts scalability. Chainlink is quietly locking arms with major players like PayPal and Ripple. These aren’t casual updates—they signal serious momentum. Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping in where traditional networks stalled—overcoming compatibility roadblocks, simplifying smart contract development, and future-proofing finance for the real world. With the QubeQode IDE, Qubetics enables seamless app deployment across chains, fixes cross-network fragmentation, and puts control directly into the hands of devs and digital natives. It’s precisely what blockchain needed to grow up. Qubetics ($TICS): Developer Freedom Meets Scalable Real-World Tools Qubetics isn’t built for hype. It’s engineered for function. The project offers a powerful mix of real-world utility and developer-first design that makes it one of the top cryptos to join this week. The QubeQode IDE is at the center of this evolution—a next-gen integrated development environment that simplifies multi-chain application building. Whether a fintech platform needs cross-border transaction tools or a logistics company demands transparent supply chain data, QubeQode can deliver, with speed and precision. More than 24,800 token holders have already joined the Qubetics network, with over 508 million $TICS tokens sold. The best crypto presale is in its 30 stage and has raised over $16.1 million, with $TICS currently priced at $0.1729. For early buyers seeking strong fundamentals and explosive potential, Qubetics isn’t just one of the top cryptos to join this week — it’s the platform that answers critical market needs. A $200 Play Could Flip into Life-Changing Value A $200 contribution fetches roughly 1,156 $TICS tokens. If the token’s value reaches $10, you’re sitting on $11,560—from just a couple of hundred dollars. It’s the type of move that gets overlooked until it’s too late. That’s how early-stage wealth begins—quietly, before it gets loud. This level of entry is already proving popular among freelancers, remote workers, and everyday professionals looking to escape unstable local currencies. It’s not about throwing big money—it’s about planting it in the right soil. Qubetics is proving fertile for those who act early. Avalanche (AVAX) Surges 16% as DeFi Rebounds and Real-World Adoption Gains Traction Avalanche (AVAX) has posted an impressive 16% weekly gain, trading around $19.90. This growth reflects renewed momentum in its DeFi ecosystem, with Total Value Locked (TVL) surging to $1.63 billion across more than 430 protocols. Platforms like Benqi, Trader Joe, and Aave are driving this revival, with Benqi reporting a 19% increase in lending and borrowing operations. Analysts note that if AVAX breaks through the $24–$26 resistance zone, it could make a strong push toward the $30 mark—territory last reached in early February. Meanwhile, institutional inflows into AVAX-based DeFi solutions have jumped 28% quarter-over-quarter, signaling deeper trust and interest from professional market participants. Looking ahead, Avalanche is preparing for a massive infrastructure leap with its Avalanche9000 upgrade, expected in December 2025. This update is set to reduce deployment costs for layer-1 networks by a staggering 99.9%, signaling a structural change rather than a simple performance improvement. Developers, enterprises, and institutions alike are eyeing this upgrade as a game-changer for scalability and cost-efficiency. On top of that, transaction fees on the C-Chain are expected to drop by 25%, making DeFi and cross-chain operations more accessible for the average user. Beyond the technical breakthroughs, Avalanche is driving adoption in the real world. The newly introduced Avalanche Card allows users to spend AVAX, USDT, and USDC anywhere Visa is accepted—merging digital assets with everyday commerce. This real-world payment utility, combined with upcoming scalability advancements, places Avalanche among the top cryptos to join this week. While many chains promise performance, Avalanche is delivering measurable utility, bringing blockchain from code to checkout in a way few projects can match. Pi Network Integrates Chainlink, LINK Boosts Utility Across Web3 Chainlink has officially integrated Pi Network into its decentralized oracle services, enabling real-time Pi token pricing through 22 new data feeds. This move enhances Pi’s ability to support smart contracts, DeFi, and blockchain gaming with secure external data. Since the announcement, Pi Coin surged over 30%, with bullish forecasts predicting a climb toward $2.5. The integration marks a key milestone in Chainlink’s expansion into broader ecosystems. Chainlink is the infrastructure giant most community members don’t see—until they use an app powered by its oracles. It’s had a bumpy road price-wise, hitting a recent low of $11.87, but don’t mistake that for weakness. LINK has found solid ground at a 644-day trendline. Technically, that sets the stage for stronger moves. What’s more interesting, though, is what’s happening off-chain. Chainlink has integrated with PayPal and Venmo as of April 2025, making its tech accessible to a wider consumer base. It’s also partnered with Ripple to enhance RLUSD’s pricing accuracy and reliability. Even Aave has adopted Chainlink’s Smart Value Recapture (SVR) to tighten DeFi efficiency. For those focused on protocol strength and cross-industry integration, Chainlink remains one of the top cryptos to join this week. It doesn’t aim for the spotlight—it builds the infrastructure that others rely on. Why These Three Projects Stand Out This Week While many tokens chase trends, Qubetics, Avalanche, and Chainlink are solving hard problems with precision. Qubetics leads by arming developers with the tools they actually need—like QubeQode—and it’s already raised over $16.1 million from enthusiastic early buyers. Avalanche is preparing to crush high-fee barriers with its December upgrade and is now helping digital assets behave like fiat in real-world transactions. Meanwhile, Chainlink keeps building the backbone of DeFi and real-world finance, partnering with global names and refining protocols under the hood. Whether you’re looking to build, scale, or secure your digital future, these are the top cryptos to join this week . For those ready to make bold moves, Qubetics stands out with unique utility and unmatched presale traction. Avalanche and Chainlink add depth and reach, making this trio hard to overlook.

Qubetics offers real-world utility through its QubeQode IDE, supports multi-chain app deployment, and has already raised over $16.1M in its presale. How will Avalanche9000 upgrade impact AVAX users? Avalanche9000 will reduce layer-1 deployment costs by 99.9% and lower C-Chain transaction fees by 25%, significantly improving network efficiency. Why is Chainlink’s integration with PayPal and Ripple important? These integrations expand Chainlink’s utility in both centralized finance (PayPal, Ripple) and DeFi (Aave), enhancing its real-world value and adoption.

Cole said in an April 14 open letter to Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi that Intuit’s growth is admirable, but Bitcoin ( BTC ) is the best way to ensure the company’s long-term success and hedge against any potential disruption caused by artificial intelligence. Intuit’s flagship products are its tax preparation app TurboTax and the small business accounting software Quickbooks. The company laid off 10% of its staff in July to pursue its AI endeavors, but Cole said the firm needs an additional hedge because TurboTax is at risk of being automated away by AI. “While we appreciate Intuit’s own investments and internal implementation of AI, we believe an additional hedge is warranted, and that a Bitcoin war chest is the best option available,” Cole said. An excerpt from Matt Cole’s letter urging Intuit to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheets, among other suggestions. Source: Strive Asset Management That Bitcoin war chest , he added, will ensure Intuit has “enough strategic capital to weather the AI storm and act from a position of strength through the turbulence of the AI revolution.” Cole sent a similar letter to GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen in February to advise the gaming retailer to use its $4.6 billion in cash to buy Bitcoin. GameStop’s Cohen acknowledged the letter in an April 1 regulatory filing and revealed his company had finished a convertible debt offering that raised $1.5 billion, with some proceeds earmarked for buying Bitcoin. Strive urges Intuit change crypto policy In his letter to Intuit, Cole said the firm should reconsider the acceptable use policy for its marketing platform Mailchimp, which he claims has continued to suspend crypto-related accounts over policy violations. Source: Strive Asset Management Cole said he “remains concerned that Intuit’s censorship and de-platforming policies discriminate against Bitcoin enthusiasts, which may harm long-term shareholder value.” Mailchimp has said that crypto-related content isn’t necessarily banned under its policy, and crypto content can be sent provided the sender isn’t involved in the sale, exchange, or marketing of crypto. Related: Saylor signals Strategy is buying the dip amid macroeconomic turmoil Its current acceptable use policy states that the platform might not allow accounts that offer “cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies, and any digital assets related to an initial coin offering.” According to Cole, Mailchimp likely adopted its policies when the legal status of crypto and related businesses was uncertain, but said with the crypto-friendly Trump administration , it’s time to “amend the acceptable use policy to end the blanket ban on crypto-related businesses.” Intuit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

33767162,[object Object],1744770633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Risk Stays High Despite Recent Drop – Correction Or Warning Sign?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-market-risk-stays-high-despite-recent-drop-correction-or-warning-sign/,"Bitcoin is facing a critical test as global markets remain volatile and macroeconomic tensions escalate. After weeks of price swings and uncertainty, BTC is trading above the $85,000 level — a psychological and technical threshold that bulls have managed to defend. Momentum appears to be building, but the real test lies ahead: reclaiming the $90,000 mark to confirm a recovery and shift broader sentiment. Despite the recent bounce, the market environment remains fragile. CryptoQuant insights reveal that market risk is still elevated, even as Bitcoin’s price attempts to stabilize. According to their latest data, only 24% of the circulating supply is currently in an unrealized loss — a relatively low figure when compared to previous major corrections. Historically, such a level is often associated with early-stage pullbacks rather than full-scale capitulation. This suggests that while bulls are stepping in, the broader market hasn’t fully flushed out excess risk, leaving room for additional downside if sentiment turns again. As the geopolitical climate remains tense and the macroeconomic outlook uncertain, Bitcoin’s next move will be crucial in determining whether this is the start of a sustained recovery or simply a temporary relief rally within a larger correction. Bitcoin Price Steadies But Market Risk Remains Elevated Global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty continue to drive Bitcoin price behavior, with recent action hinting at a potential shift in momentum. As inflation begins to trend lower and the U.S. stock market shows signs of fragility, many analysts expect the Federal Reserve may eventually be forced to lower interest rates to prevent a deeper economic crisis. However, with trade negotiations between the U.S. and China evolving quickly, the timeline for any monetary easing remains unclear. Despite Bitcoin’s recent bounce above $85,000, on-chain data from CryptoQuant highlights that market risk is far from resolved. While BTC has undergone a notable correction—dropping over 30% from its all-time highs—only 24% of the circulating supply is currently in an unrealized loss. This is historically a low level, often seen during early-stage corrections, not during deep capitulation phases. The unrealized loss component is currently concentrated within the historical bottom zone, meaning that long-term holders are the ones absorbing the downside. This pattern typically reflects resilience but also signals caution: such phases tend to precede extended periods of sideways consolidation or further volatility rather than an immediate rally. In summary, while bullish momentum is building, the market remains vulnerable. A sustained move higher will likely require improved macro clarity and confirmation of policy shifts before Bitcoin can fully break into a renewed uptrend. Technical Details: Price Holds Above Key Indicators Bitcoin is currently trading at $85,500 after successfully pushing above the 4-hour 200 MA and EMA, both positioned around the $84,000 level. This technical breakout is a positive sign for bulls, who now need to maintain price action above these indicators to confirm a shift in short-term momentum and initiate a broader recovery phase. Holding above the $84K zone is crucial, as it signals strength and buyer commitment at this level. If bulls can continue to defend this range and reclaim the psychological $90,000 level, Bitcoin could quickly move into higher supply zones, potentially targeting a new local high and breaking the current consolidation pattern. However, despite this positive momentum, risks remain. If BTC fails to maintain support above the $84K zone and dips below $81,000, it could trigger renewed selling pressure. Such a breakdown would likely result in a sharp drop toward the $75,000 support region, a level closely watched by analysts for its historical significance. For now, Bitcoin’s price structure remains cautiously optimistic. Sustained buying interest and favorable macro conditions will be required to support further gains and confirm the beginning of a lasting recovery.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated the hit in 2025 from reduced travel and boycotts could total 0.3% of gross domestic product, totaling around $90 million. Data from the International Trade Administration showed that the number of non-citizens who had entered the U.S. by plane plummeted almost 10% in March compared to a year earlier. The report also noted that foreign tourism has been a blow for the U.S. recently after the pandemic-era restrictions sparked a resurgence of international travel. U.S. travel declines amid geopolitical frictions US Economy Is Set to Lose Billions as Foreign Tourists Stay Away https://t.co/DXWMIS1rbZ pic.twitter.com/wOpY5OiHwg — Ray Wang (@rwang07) April 15, 2025 Potential U.S. visitors are now rethinking traveling to the U.S. amid increased hostility at the border, rising geopolitical frictions, and global economic uncertainty. Curtis Allen, a Canadian videographer, canceled an upcoming U.S. vacation after President Trump imposed tariffs on his home country and suggested it should become the 51st U.S. state. Allen said, “We’re not just staying home; we’re going to go spend the same money somewhere else.” “Given what we know about how much Canadian travel has fallen off, that’s potentially a bit worrying for that region.” -Omar Sharif, president of Inflation Insights. According to ITA data , foreign travelers spent approximately $254 billion in the U.S. in 2024. The analytics firm also estimated in early March that the country would receive 77 million visitors in 2025. The data came out just before news of detentions at U.S. airports made headlines, where travelers from countries like France and Germany were ensnared. Canadians, who contribute the largest number of foreign travelers in the U.S., are choosing to stay put as Trump heightens attacks on the country’s economy and sovereignty. Bloomberg Intelligence analysis revealed that roughly $20 billion in retail spending from international tourists in the U.S. may be compromised. A monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report on consumer prices published on April 10 indicated that early signs of a sharp pullback are already showing up as airfares, hotel rates, and car rental costs fell in March. Sharif also highlighted that the decline in hotel rates was driven by an almost 11% drop in the Northeast in particular, possibly a result of fewer Canadians traveling there. Canada remains resilient despite challenging U.S. traveling conditions Patrick Keyes, sales and marketing manager at Rainbow Air Helicopter Tours in Niagara Falls, said that the timing is “very interesting” for the firm, which just invested $25 million in a new building, an enhanced fleet, and a virtual reality attraction ahead of the busy summer season. Keyes also added that “we are waiting to see the fallout.” A report by OAG Aviation Worldwide also reported that Canadian flight reservations to the U.S. have plummeted by 70% through September versus the same period last year. U.S. summer bookings have also dropped by 25% among European tourists at Accor SA hotels. The firm’s Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Bazin maintained the drop could be attributed to border detentions creating a “bad buzz” and diverting tourists to other destinations. Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Megan Peters mentioned in a March 31 report that U.S. tariff announcements and a more aggressive stance towards historical allies hurt global opinions about the state. The duo also believe that tariffs will lead to U.S. gross domestic product growth to underperform consensus expectations in 2025. Todd Davidson, CEO of Travel Oregon, Oregon’s tourism commission, said the company was continuing efforts to attract foreign travelers. Davidson noted his team was on a trip to pitch the state at an adventure tourism conference in Vancouver. He also acknowledged that his team will host sales and marketing partners from the UK, India, and Brazil in the coming weeks. The company’s senior executive maintained that his team was also contemplating whether the commission will need to tweak its strategy more toward domestic visitors as the situation unfolds. He added, “Oregon is not and will not take its eye off those international markets.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

TRUMP was last trading just under $8 per coin, up a modest 10% from the lows it hit around $7 last week, but still very much stuck in a long-term downtrend. The meme coin has continually found resistance at its 21DMA over the last three months. TRUMP has now dropped around 90% from its post-launch highs above $70. But things could be about to go from bad to worse. 4% of the meme coin’s supply is set to unlock on the 18th of April. On April 18, 40 million tokens will unlock for $TRUMP (currently worth $330M) Let’s see if they’ll sell or hold pic.twitter.com/xxfnutGJaG — LANGERIUS (@langeriuseth) April 14, 2025 Given that only 20% of the supply is currently in circulation, this means an increase to circulating supply of 20%. Bearish technicals combined with bearish supply dynamics mean that TRUMP coin could soon dump to fresh lows under $7 per token. And with sentiment in the broader crypto market still downbeat thanks to ongoing macro uncertainties and poor altcoin performance, the outlook for a major bullish reversal anytime soon is week. Was TRUMP Coin a Scam? TRUMP Coin isn’t a scam; its launch was fair and the team behind the coin have not deceived investors in anyway. It was simply launched as a collectable meme coin, with no promise of returns, or anything for that matter. That said, questions have been raised about the ethics surrounding the meme coin’s launch. Firstly, while early buyers made millions, and while the Trump organization has earned over $100 million in trading fees, the vast majority of TRUMP buyers have been left out of pocket. Indeed, a Chainalysis study conducted in conjunction with the New York Times revealed that, three weeks on from the meme coin’s launch, over 800,000 wallets had lost money buying the coin. Indeed, just looking at the TRUMP coin chart since its launch – it paints a perfect picture of a classic “pump-and-dump”. Trump’s meme coin has to be the biggest scam of the season. pic.twitter.com/nCvNWgyVP1 — VolgaLad (@cym27s) April 13, 2025 The fact that the Trump organization gifted itself 80% of the supply to be vested over the course of Trump’s presidential term has also been strongly criticized. $TRUMP coin is a scam and embarrassing for all US citizens. Essentially, it allowed insiders to snipe the entire supply at launch. We should hope for better from our leaders. Just because the other side is corrupt doesn’t give you a license to do the same. I hope people on… pic.twitter.com/yHgfdQhZqz — Dr. Danish (@operationdanish) January 18, 2025 Is It a Good Time to Buy TRUMP? Its possible that when broader crypto market conditions take a substantial turn for the better, TRUMP coin could see a major resurgence. Perhaps when sentiment regarding the economy is better, and when the Fed is pumping the market with liquidity. That said, these times have not arrived yet. Yes, TRUMP coin buyers getting into the market are buying the dip, a 90% dip in fact. However, there could still be a lot lower to go. Its not unheard of for meme coins to drop 99% from prior record highs. Investors should not risk more than they can afford to lose in buying TRUMP coin. Investing in major coins like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana would be much safer.

The company recently disclosed the purchase of 80,567 Solana (SOL) tokens worth approximately $10.5 million. This marks Janover’s third major SOL acquisition as part of its growing digital treasury initiative. Massive Price Surge Fuels Strategic Investment The announcement followed a significant stock rally, with Janover shares hitting an all-time high of nearly $66. Although share prices slightly dipped in early trading the next day, the company has still enjoyed a staggering 1,200% surge this year. With this new buy, Janover’s total Solana holdings now stand at around 163,651 tokens—currently valued at approximately $21 million. The purchase was financed through a recent $42 million capital raise. Staking and Validator Plans in Motion Janover doesn’t plan to let its crypto assets sit idle. The firm intends to stake the newly acquired SOL, a move that will generate passive income and strengthen the Solana network. It also aims to operate one or more validators to enhance its participation in network security and receive staking rewards. The staking revenues will be reinvested into acquiring even more Solana, in line with the company’s long-term accumulation strategy. “Speed and clarity of execution are central to our model,” said Parker White, COO and CIO at Janover. “We plan to continue building our SOL position as we scale our strategy — and we believe today’s market conditions offered a compelling opportunity to take our first step.” Leadership Shift and Rebranding Ahead These developments come in the wake of a major leadership shake-up, as a group of former Kraken executives acquired majority control of Janover. The company is now focused on bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Earlier this month, the board approved a new treasury strategy focused on long-term crypto holdings. The plan starts with Solana but could potentially expand to other digital assets over time. Janover is also preparing to rebrand itself as DeFi Development Corporation and plans to change its stock ticker symbol to reflect this new direction. Growing Trend Among Corporates Janover’s aggressive crypto positioning echoes a broader trend among companies diversifying into digital assets. Worksport, for example, announced last year that it had added XRP to its treasury alongside Bitcoin. Solana, currently trading at about $132, has surged nearly 24% in the past week despite being down 30% year-to-date. The downturn has been attributed in part to wider market volatility triggered by changes in U.S. tariff policy.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-16 02:41:30

In a Tuesday evening announcement, newly-appointed CEO Roshan Robert said the expansion was “a commitment to responsible growth.” Robert was most recently an executive at institutional crypto lending platform CLST, and was a founding team member of crypto prime broker Hidden Road, which was recently acquired by Ripple for $1.25 billion . “As regulations evolve, OKX is working closely with US regulators and policymakers to ensure we operate transparently and compliantly,” Robert wrote. “We’ve built a comprehensive, risk-based global compliance program that includes enhanced due diligence, a robust KYC process, customer risk rating systems, advanced fraud detection, AML tools, geo-blocking, and market surveillance technologies. These are all part of our commitment to a secure, compliant trading environment.” Two months ago, a subsidiary of OKX settled charges that it had operated in the U.S. without a money transmitting license, agreeing to pay the Department of Justice (DOJ) over $500 million in penalties and forfeited fees. The DOJ alleged that, despite having an official policy prohibiting U.S.-based users from accessing its platform, OKX “sought out customers in the United States, including in the Southern District of New York.” Read more: After Binance’s $4.3B Lesson, Do Rival Exchanges Risk Running Afoul of U.S. Rules? OKX is not the first crypto company to eye an expansion or a return to the U.S., which has grown considerably friendlier to the crypto industry under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Earlier this month, token launch platform CoinList announced a return to the U.S. after five years away, and bigger names — including Binance , the world’s largest crypto exchange — are reportedly considering returning to the U.S. Existing customers of OKCoin, the U.S.-accessible sister company of OKX, will be “seamlessly migrated” to the OKX platform, which will offer customers “deeper liquidity, lower fees and advanced trading tools,” according to the company’s launch announcement.",Policy|OKX|OKCoin|DOJ,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-16 02:55:52

Noble’s AppLayer aims to let developers build new financial tools optimized for real-world assets like stablecoins — digital assets whose value is pegged to another asset, like the U.S. dollar. AppLayer will leverage Celestia, a data availability blockchain that aims to bring down storage costs for data-intensive blockchain networks. Celestia, like Noble, is plugged into the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning it can read smart contracts from other Ethereum-based chains. The Noble team stated in a press release viewed by CoinDesk that it will launch its Ethereum-compatible AppLayer rollup in the third quarter of 2025. “Noble plans to unlock its cross-ecosystem potential as EVM applications continue to seek reliable and seamless access to native stablecoin liquidity,” the team wrote. “Noble’s AppLayer will be seamlessly integrated with a number of blue chip DeFi projects born in the Ethereum ecosystem.” Stablecoins have received considerable attention in recent weeks, with the U.S. Congress preparing significant stablecoin legislation later this year. Entities including President Trump’s World-Liberty Financial , banking giant Fidelity, and the U.S. state of Wyoming have also expressed plans to create their own stablecoins. Noble launched in March 2023 as an application-specific blockchain , or ""appchain,"" purpose-built for stablecoin issuance within the Cosmos ecosystem . Initially, it aimed to expand liquidity Cosmos by enabling native asset issuance through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which is the technology used by Cosmos-based blockchains to transfer assets and other data. Over time, Noble has extended its reach beyond Cosmos, integrating with Ethereum and other ecosystems to facilitate quick stablecoin transfers. Additionally, in March, Noble introduced USDN , a yield-bearing stablecoin backed by U.S. Treasury bills. “Building stablecoin issuance infrastructure over the past two years has given us a deep appreciation for the transformative potential of stablecoins to onboard the world to crypto,” said Jelena Djuric, co-founder and CEO at Noble, in the press release. “The Noble AppLayer, built with Celestia's technology underneath, finally gives builders the freedom to build highly scalable and performant stablecoin-native applications.” Read more: How a Ph.D. Student's Research Paper Turned Celestia Into $345M Blockchain Project Overnight",Tech|Stablecoins|Rollups|Celestia,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-16 03:00:00
43392454,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=732160,1744772449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43392454.jpeg,"‘Bitcoin Wants To Go Higher,’ Says Bitwise CIO—But There’s A Catch",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-wants-to-go-higher-bitwise-cio/,"In an investor note dated April 15, 2025, Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Bitwise, shared an examination of Bitcoin’s recent trading patterns that may surprise both critics and supporters. “Bitcoin is acting like an asset that wants to go higher, if only macro obstacles would get out of the way,” he wrote. According to Hougan, Bitcoin’s price on April 14 hovered around $84,379, compared to $84,317 a month earlier—a minuscule change of 0.07% during a 30-day window. This flat performance emerged against the backdrop of two significant geopolitical events: the United States announcing the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and President Donald Trump imposing sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. The resilience that Bitcoin has shown during this period stands in stark contrast to the broader downward trend in traditional financial markets. Hougan pointed out that the S&P 500, which peaked on February 19, has lost 12.0% of its value, with Bitcoin down a comparable 12.4% since that date. He found this alignment astonishing, particularly because it departs from Bitcoin’s behavior during past market downturns. In the 2022 correction, for example, the S&P 500 slid 24.5% while Bitcoin plunged 58.3%. Similarly, at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in early 2020, stocks fell 33.8% but Bitcoin sank 38.1%, and in late 2018, when escalating trade tensions between the United States and China dragged equities down 19.36%, Bitcoin declined 37.22%. This track record had historically reinforced the notion that, when stocks took a hit, Bitcoin would invariably suffer a far steeper pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lags Gold As Wall Street Doubts Persist, Claims Expert In his latest note, Hougan emphasized how different the present situation feels. Instead of being battered well beyond the equity market’s turbulence, Bitcoin is now mirroring stock losses closely. He acknowledged that this alone does not make Bitcoin an unequivocal hedge asset, adding, “Critics will point out that matching stocks’ performance during a downturn is not the same as acting as a hedge asset, and that gold has been a better performer than Bitcoin during this pullback. That’s true.” Nonetheless, he argued that Bitcoin’s ability to stay around the $80,000 mark while global markets churn is a testament to its robust staying power in the face of multiple macroeconomic shocks. “If that doesn’t give you confidence in its staying power, I don’t know what will,” he remarked. Hougan’s view is that we are witnessing a transitional phase in Bitcoin’s evolution. He explained that the cryptocurrency has historically been driven by two competing forces: it has served as a risk asset, associated with significant upside potential and high volatility, yet it has also occasionally taken on the role of a hedge similar to gold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Pullback Mirrors 2017’s Path To Parabolic Highs, Says Analyst In Bitcoin’s early days, the risk-asset angle tended to dominate; in major equity sell-offs, investors often shed Bitcoin faster and more aggressively than they exited stocks. Now, with more corporations integrating Bitcoin into their balance sheets, institutional investors exploring it as part of diversified portfolios, and governments—like the United States—incorporating it into strategic reserves, there appears to be a gradual tilt toward Bitcoin being treated more like “digital gold.” . Still, Hougan warned that investors should not overlook the inherent unpredictability in the current macro environment. He noted that equity markets may not yet have found a bottom, raising the possibility that deeper slides could re-expose Bitcoin’s vulnerability if broader panic sets in. He also conceded that gold’s performance remains a more classic example of a safe-haven behavior during systemic shocks, meaning Bitcoin has not conclusively demonstrated that it can replace traditional hedges during intense economic strain. Even so, in his words, “The world is unraveling, and Bitcoin is trading above $80,000.” Hougan underscored that there is no guarantee this dynamic will endure, particularly given the unpredictable repercussions that could stem from sudden tariff escalations or shifts in monetary policy. As he concluded in his note, “Our baby is growing up as a macro asset. And that’s a beautiful thing to see.” At press time, BTC traded at $85,200.

In the latest trade policy twist, President Donald Trump ordered a probe into possible tariffs on all U.S. critical mineral imports, many of which are sourced from China. The move added to investor anxiety, further weighing on the dollar. Traders grew cautious ahead of both Powell’s comments and ongoing trade developments with key U.S. partners. Gold climbed toward $2,630 per ounce on Wednesday, setting a new record, as ongoing uncertainty around US trade policy continued to support safe-haven demand, alongside a broadly weaker dollar. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.61% to below 34,200 on Wednesday, halting a two-day winning streak. The Japanese yen strengthened past143 per dollar on Wednesday, recovering from the previous session’s losses, as broad-based weakness in the U.S. dollar persisted. The Bank of Japan may take policy action if U.S. tariffs harm its economy, Governor Kazuo Ueda said in an interview with the Sankei newspaper. The central bank is considering a response as risks from Trump's trade measures are closer to the expected bad scenario. Ueda emphasizes the need to assess the economic impact of tariffs without preconceptions. Meanwhile, attention is shifting to upcoming trade talks between Japan and the U.S., with Tokyo pushing for the full removal of Trump's tariffs. On the domestic front, traders digested data showing an eight-month high in Japanese manufacturing sentiment for April that jumped to +9 from -1 in March. However, the outlook remains cautious as fears around U.S. trade policy persist. Japan’s core machinery orders rebounded sharply in February 2025, rising 4.3% month-on-month to ¥894.7 billion, well above market expectations for a 0.8% increase. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.76% to around 3,250 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 1% to 9,755 on Wednesday, halting a six-day winning streak as trade war concerns overshadowed upbeat economic data, and the offshore yuan steadied around 7.32 per dollar on Wednesday, following the release of stronger-than-expected economic data from China. The pullback came after President Donald Trump ordered a probe into potential new tariffs on critical mineral imports—many of which are sourced from China—raising fears of further deterioration in U.S.-China relations. On the data front, China’s economy posted better-than-expected growth in Q1 , supported by robust policy stimulus. Key indicators including retail sales, industrial production, and fixed asset investment all exceeded forecasts in March . China’s surveyed unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in March 2025, easing from a two-year high of 5.4% in the previous month and coming in below market expectations of 5.3%. China's industrial capacity utilization rate increased to 74.1 percent in Q1 of 2025 from 73.6 percent in the same period a year earlier. China’s new home prices in 70 cities fell by 4.5% year-on-year in March 2025, easing slightly from a 4.8% decline in February. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 2.06% Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.26% to 7,760 on Wednesday. The Australian dollar held above $0.63 on Wednesday, eyeing a sixth consecutive session of gains. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Economic Index for Australia edged down 0.1% month-over-month in March 2025, reversing the 0.1% increases in the previous two months. Investors turned their focus to Thursday’s employment data, which could offer fresh insights into the labor market and influence the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy direction. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended in red as investors weighed a new round of corporate earnings and ongoing concerns over tariffs and trade policy uncertainty. U.S. stock futures fell early Wednesday, pressured by a sharp drop in Nvidia shares during after-hours trading: Dow -0.32% ; S&P 500 -0.90% ; Nasdaq -1.44% . Investors are also bracing for a wave of corporate earnings set to be released later in the day, including reports from Abbott, U.S. Bancorp, and Travelers.

The company has filed a new S-3 registration with the SEC, signaling plans to raise to $500 million. This capital raise would come through a variety of securities like common stock, debt, and warrants. While the funds will be used for general corporate purposes, the company clearly stated that a portion will go toward buying more Bitcoin.

Back in February, the company added 871 BTC for $88.5 million, paying an average of over $101,000 per coin. That followed a separate $30 million purchase late last year. Despite Bitcoin’s recent dip below $99,000, Semler appears committed to its long-term crypto strategy. Semler Scientific CEO Eric Semler claims he’s “excited to buy more BTC.” We have reached a settlement in principle, EXCITED TO BUY MORE BTC! — Eric Semler (@SemlerEric) April 15, 2025 Bitcoin as a Corporate Lifeline Notably, this shift is more than the investment strategy, it’s part of a larger turnaround story. Before adopting its Bitcoin treasury strategy in May 2024, Semler was viewed as a stagnant rich public company with solid cash reserves but poor stock performance. Now, with one of the largest BTC holdings among public companies, it’s reinventing itself. The firm believes Bitcoin is not just a hedge against inflation but a safe haven during times of global uncertainty. Dealing DOJ Settlement At the same time, the company is navigating a major legal hurdle. Semler recently reached a tentative $29.75 million settlement with the Department of Justice over allegations tied to how it marketed its QuantaFlo product. To pay off this settlement, the company plans to borrow from Coinbase and use its Bitcoin holdings as collateral. It will also tap into its existing cash on hand to cover part of the cost. Still a High-Risk Strategy Even with its bold Bitcoin stance, Semler’s stock hasn’t seen the boost you’d expect. The share price has fallen 37% so far this year. Still, the company is standing firm on its belief that Bitcoin is a long-term asset worth holding.

ETH is now consolidating and might decline further below the $1,580 support zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline after it failed to clear $1,700 and $1,720. The price is trading below $1,620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a new connecting bullish trend line with support at $1,625 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,640 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Faces Rejection Ethereum price formed a base above $1,550 and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin . ETH gained pace for a move above the $1,600 and $1,620 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price above the $1,650 zone. A high was formed at $1,690 and the price recently corrected gains. There was a move below the $1,640 support zone. Besides, there was a break below a new connecting bullish trend line with support at $1,625 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,472 swing low to the $1,690 high. Ethereum price is now trading below $1,625 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,620 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,640 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,650 level. A clear move above the $1,650 resistance might send the price toward the $1,690 resistance. An upside break above the $1,690 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,750 resistance zone or even $1,800 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,640 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,580 level. The first major support sits near the $1,555 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,472 swing low to the $1,690 high. A clear move below the $1,555 support might push the price toward the $1,525 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,450 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,420. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

In a series of now-deleted posts on April 15, Powell’s X account shared links to a token called the House of Commons Coin (HOC), describing it as “a community driven digital currency.” Source: Daniel Green A member of Powell’s staff confirmed to the BBC that the account had been hacked and that “steps were taken quickly to secure the account and remove misleading posts.” DEX Screener shows the HOC token saw limited interest from would-be investors, achieving a peak market cap of just over $24,000 shortly after the posts from Powell’s account. The token has seen a total of 736 transactions and a trading volume of just $71,000. While Powell hasn’t promoted a cryptocurrency before, it isn’t unheard of for political figures to back real crypto tokens. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump both launched and promoted memecoins days before they entered the White House, sparking criticism from the president’s political rivals and even some supporters. Argentine President Javier Melei also promoted a token called LIBRA, which quickly crashed in value and has caused a political scandal in Argentina and calls for a probe into Melei’s involvement with the token. Powell’s account hack follows similar attack on Ghana’s president In March, the X account of Ghana’s President John Mahama saw a similar breach, with attackers taking over his account for 48 hours to promote a scam cryptocurrency called Solanafrica. The Ghanaian president’s X account was hacked in March 2025. Source: CrediRates Related: UK trade bodies ask government to make crypto a ‘strategic priority’ The scammers made similar crypto-promoting posts to Mahama’s 2.4 million followers, claiming that the scam project was “making payments fast and free across the continent with support from Solana and the Bank of Ghana.” The president’s team regained control of Mahama’s X account two days later. His spokesman, Kwakye Ofosu, told the AFP that the account “has now been fully restored, and we urge the public to disregard any suspicious cryptocurrency-related posts from the handle.” Magazine: Memecoin degeneracy is funding groundbreaking anti-aging research",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-16 03:30:52

The Binance Taker Buy Sell Ratio, which calculates the ratio of buyers to sellers of Bitcoin ( BTC ) in Binance, “has returned to neutral territory,” CryptoQuant contributor DarkFost said in an April 15 note. Bitcoin’s bullish momentum is “picking up again” The ratio currently stands at 1.008. When the ratio is higher than 1, buyers — usually a bullish sentiment indicator — dominate volumes, conversely, a ratio below 1 indicates that sellers, or bearish sentiment, are dominating. Bitcoin is trading at $83,810 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin is trading at $83,810 at the time of publication, down 1.47% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. “Over the past few days, the ratio has been mostly positive, suggesting that bullish sentiment is picking up again on Binance’s derivatives market,” Darkfost said. On April 14, when Bitcoin was above $86,000, the ratio was above 1.1. CoinGlass data shows that if Bitcoin reclaims $85,000, almost $637 million in short positions will be at risk of liquidation. Several key market indicators suggest that investors continue to favor Bitcoin over altcoins. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is currently at 15 out of 100, signalling it is still very much “Bitcoin Season.” TradingView’s Bitcoin Dominance Chart shows the asset’s market share is sitting at 63.81%, up 9.82% so far this year.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows the overall market sentiment on April 16 is in “Fear” with a score of 29 out of 100. Some analysts, including DeFiDaniel, commented that Bitcoin’s recent price action is “so boring.” However, Cointelegraph earlier reported that Bitcoin apparent demand is on a recovery path, but it is not net positive yet . Historically, 30-day apparent demand can move sideways for a prolonged period after Bitcoin reaches a local bottom, leading to its price chopping sideways. Related: Bitcoin price recovery could be capped at $90K — Here’s why Analysts have differing views over where Bitcoin is going to go next. Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts told Cointelegraph in late March that “the market may be underestimating how quickly Bitcoin could surge — potentially hitting new all-time highs before Q2 is out.” AnchorWatch CEO Rob Hamilton said in an April 15 X post that Bitcoin’s price “is flat for the day because we are in an epic tug of war between people who are selling Bitcoin to pay their taxes and people using their refunds to buy Bitcoin.” The tax deadline in the US was April 15.

The news was announced in an Apr. 15 press release, in which Securitize said its subsidiary, Securitize Fund Services, will now oversee $38 billion in assets across 715 funds following the acquisition. MG Stover, established in 2007, was one of the first companies to specialize in fund administration for digital assets and cryptocurrency. Its integration with Securitize expands the platform’s fund servicing capabilities, which already include trading infrastructure, brokerage, tokenization, and transfer agents. The deal significantly enhances SFS’s ability to serve institutional investors with a full-stack solution, combining traditional fund servicing with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain rails. Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said the acquisition “cements our role as the most comprehensive platform for institutional grade real-world asset tokenization and fund administration.” He added that it reinforces the company’s commitment to supporting a growing base of asset issuers and investors.

That includes BUIDL, a $2.45 billion tokenized U.S. Treasury fund managed with BlackRock; Exodus, a $400 million tokenized equity; BCAP, a $150 million institutional fund; and ACRED, a $65 million private credit fund. Fund administration, primary issuance, tokenization, and secondary trading via its SEC-regulated alternative trading system are all part of the company’s integrated stack. It is also a registered transfer agent and broker-dealer. The acquisition reflects a wider trend of consolidation in the real-world asset space as institutions seek end-to-end solutions for digital finance. As reported by crypto.news on Apr. 10, according to BCG and Ripple ( XRP ), the global tokenized asset market could grow to $18.9 trillion by 2033. Securitize appears to be building for this future. Additionally, in March, Securitize announced the launch of Converge, a new blockchain built together with Ethena ( ENA ) Labs. The chain serves as a compliant foundation for the expanding RWA ecosystem by supporting tokenized asset infrastructure and institutional-grade decentralized finance.

His statement follows an intense three days of scrutiny after the Mantra ( OM ) token plunged over 90% from its recent high, wiping out $5 billion in value. Mullin made the declaration via X on Apr. 15. He was replying to a community member who had suggested the Mantra team should delay its upcoming token unlocks, originally set to begin in April, as a show of long-term commitment. Mullin responded by clarifying that team tokens don’t begin vesting until 2027, 30 months after Mantra Chain’s October 2024 mainnet launch. He added that he intends to burn his entire team allocation and would leave it up to the community to decide if he has earned it back in the future. The teams token allocation are actually vesting only starting in 2027, which is 30 months from mainnet launch (Oct. 24). I’m planning to burn all of my team tokens and when we turn it around the community and investors can decide if I have earned it back. 🫡🕉️ https://t.co/ZQR1H5xAqF — JP Mullin (🕉, 🏘️) (@jp_mullin888) April 15, 2025 The assertion sparked debate. Crypto Banter founder Ran Neuner said this approach “would be a mistake.” In his view, strong incentives are important to keep project teams motivated. Mullin responded that he was only referring to his personal allocation, and that the goal was to rebuild trust after the crash. He also floated the idea of placing the tokens into a community-controlled mechanism instead of burning them outright. You might also like: Mantra price soars 50%: beware of a dead cat bounce Mullin had previously shared a screenshot showing his 772,081 OM staked on Fluxtra, noting that he was “100% staked” on the platform. The team’s total 300 million OM allocation is locked until April 2027. According to Mullin, restoring the OM token’s value is the project’s top priority, with strategies like buybacks and token burns on the table. The situation further escalated after popular online scam investigator Coffeezilla posted a summary of his YouTube interview with Mullin. He claimed that the Mantra team sold $25–$45 million worth of tokens in over-the-counter deals, at a 30–50% discount, and later used $5–$10 million to buy back OM.

Market depth on OM dropped from $290 million to just $473,000. Around $21 million in long positions were liquidated on OKX alone. OM token remains under heavy pressure, trading at $0.7479 at press time, down 88% in the past 7 days.

Despite price appreciation, the level of excitement and retail participation remains muted. CryptoQuant believes that an important on-chain metric underlines this shift – the percentage of BTC held for one week to one month is significantly lower than in past cycles. This suggests that the explosive influx of new participants, which once fueled rapid price rallies, is largely absent. Bitcoin’s Slow Burn According to the latest analysis shared by CryptoQuant, two main factors are contributing to this change. First, the macroeconomic backdrop has shifted dramatically. Unlike the 2020-2021 cycle, which was powered by near-zero interest rates and aggressive monetary easing, today’s market operates under tight liquidity conditions and sustained high interest rates. Capital is less willing to flow freely, which has made large, euphoric price movements harder to achieve. Second, the market’s leadership has shifted from retail investors to institutions, particularly following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional flows are more measured, which has contributed to a structured, gradual uptrend rather than the chaotic volatility of earlier cycles. This evolving structure has created a more cautious market atmosphere. Some analysts misinterpret this slower pace as a sign that the cycle has peaked. CryptoQuant, on the other hand, suggests that it would be premature. Instead of a traditional boom-and-bust pattern, this cycle may play out as a longer, more complex progression. ETF inflows remain steady, and if macro conditions ease, further upside is still possible. “In times like this, what matters most isn’t chasing quick pumps – It’s understanding the slower structure and having the patience to stay with it.” ‘Wait and See’ Approach in Short Term In its latest market update , QCP Capital reported that Bitcoin risk reversals remain skewed in favor of puts through June, which indicates that traders are still adopting a mildly cautious stance in the near term. This positioning reflects broader market hesitation as the crypto asset continues to consolidate within the $80,000 to $90,000 range, with participants largely adopting a “wait and see” approach amid uncertainty surrounding the global tariff landscape. However, QCP also notes a shift in sentiment further out on the curve. Over the weekend, the firm observed aggressive buying of 800 contracts of the BTC-27MAR26-100K call option – an indication of growing long-term bullish positioning. This suggests that while short-term caution persists, institutional appetite for upside exposure is building.

Although crypto trading is banned in China and digital assets are neither legal tender nor recognized property, local courts and governments have quietly continued to seize Bitcoin and other tokens linked to crimes ranging from internet fraud to illegal gambling. Lawyers, judges and law enforcement officials are now urging regulatory reform to bring transparency and structure to this grey area, Reuters reported Wednesday. Without established guidelines, some fear the current ad hoc handling could embolden criminal networks or create opportunities for abuse within the system. China debates how to handle criminal crypto cache https://t.co/skImimgOWd pic.twitter.com/SGV9rXtuga — Reuters World (@ReutersWorld) April 15, 2025 China’s Crackdown on Crypto Crimes Boosts Government Confiscation Revenues Local governments are under fiscal pressure from China’s slowing economy. In several cases, they have enlisted private firms to liquidate seized cryptocurrencies. Court documents and transaction records reviewed by Reuters show how this works. Authorities convert digital coins into cash and use the proceeds to supplement government funds. These debates come amid a rapid rise in crypto-linked criminal prosecutions . In 2023 alone, Chinese authorities filed charges against over 3,000 individuals for crypto-related money laundering, with total funds involved in such crimes surging tenfold to 430.7 billion yuan ($59b), according to blockchain security firm SAFEIS. The financial stakes are rising alongside enforcement. Penalty and confiscation revenues collected by local governments reached 378 billion yuan ($51.8b) last year, a 65% increase from 2018. Chinese Citizens Evade Ban as Government Quietly Accumulates Crypto A report from Bitcoin investment firm River estimated that China’s local governments held around 15,000 Bitcoin at the end of 2023. At current prices, the stash is worth about $1.4b. This places China among the top holders of the cryptocurrency globally. Despite Beijing’s sweeping ban on cryptocurrency trading and mining in recent years, many Chinese citizens have continued to use offshore exchanges and peer-to-peer methods to access digital assets, often routing transactions through VPNs or overseas platforms. This has complicated enforcement and blurred the line between personal use and criminal conduct. Debates over seized crypto are escalating. Policymakers may now be forced to draft new national-level guidelines. Legal observers believe a formal regulatory response could follow soon. This may reshape how China handles digital assets caught in its legal net.

The lack of rules around how authorities should handle seized crypto has spawned “inconsistent and opaque approaches” that some fear could foster corruption, lawyers told Reuters for an April 16 report. Chinese local governments are using private companies to sell seized cryptocurrencies in offshore markets in exchange for cash to replenish public coffers, Reuters reported, citing transaction and court documents. The local governments reportedly held approximately 15,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth $1.4 billion at the end of 2023, and the sales have been a significant source of income. China holds an estimated 194,000 BTC worth approximately $16 billion and is the second largest nation Bitcoin holder behind the US, according to Bitbo. Zhongnan University of Economics and Law professor Chen Shi told Reuters that these sales are a “makeshift solution that, strictly speaking, is not fully in line with China’s current ban on crypto trading.” Countries and governments that hold BTC. Source: Bitbo The issue has been exacerbated by a rise in crypto-related crime in China, ranging from online fraud to money laundering to illegal gambling. Additionally, the state sued more than 3,000 people involved in crypto-related money laundering in 2024. China crypto reserve floated as solution Shenzhen-based lawyer Guo Zhihao opined that the central bank is better positioned to deal with seized digital assets and should either sell them overseas or build a crypto reserve. Ru Haiyang, co-CEO at Hong Kong crypto exchange HashKey, echoed the suggestion saying that China may want to keep forfeited Bitcoin as a strategic reserve as US President Donald Trump is doing. Related: Bitcoin rebounds as traders spot China ‘weaker yuan’ chart, but US trade war caps $80K BTC rally Creating a crypto sovereign fund in Hong Kong, where crypto trading is legal, has also been proposed.

A rising wedge comprises two converging trendlines that connect higher lows and higher highs. This convergence suggests that upward momentum is weakening. When the price moves below the lower trendline, it signals a shift to a bearish trend. XRP dived out of its rising wedge pattern during Wednesday's early Asian hours, suggesting that the attempted recovery from the April 7 lows near $1.60 has likely lost momentum, allowing sellers to regain control. According to technical analysis theory , analysts should identify the starting point of the rising wedge as the initial support level following the breakdown, which means XRP can now fall back to $1.60. The cryptocurrency has also fallen below the Ichimoku Cloud, a momentum indicator, on the hourly chart, reinforcing the bearish outlook indicated by the rising wedge breakdown.

The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.640 resistance zone. Cardano Price Faces Resistance In the past few sessions, Cardano saw a fresh decline from the $0.680 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $0.650 and $0.640 support levels. A low was formed at $0.6040 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.6120 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.6481 swing high to the $0.6040 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.640 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.6260 zone and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.6481 swing high to the $0.6040 low. The first resistance is near $0.6350. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.6350 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The next key resistance might be $0.6480. If there is a close above the $0.6480 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.680 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.70 in the near term. Another Drop in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.6350 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.6040 level. The next major support is near the $0.60 level. A downside break below the $0.60 level could open the doors for a test of $0.580. The next major support is near the $0.5550 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.

Meliuz, which provides cashback and financial technology services, is taking the plan to make Bitcoin ( BTC ) the primary strategic asset in the firm’s treasury to shareholders in a meeting slated for May 6, according to a translated April 14 statement. The company said its core business will remain unchanged, but “the generation of cash from operations is fundamental to the strategy of acquiring more Bitcoin over time.” If shareholders approve the measure, Bitcoin will be adopted as the firm’s main strategic treasury asset, but it will also look to foster “the incremental generation of Bitcoin for its shareholders, whether through the generation of operating cash or through possible financial transactions and strategic initiatives.” Shareholders who disagree with the new direction and held their shares before April 14 can request reimbursement. Meliuz shares jump on Bitcoin plan In the trading session after its new Bitcoin plan was announced, Meliuz (CASH3) jumped over 14% from 3.28 Brazilian reals ($0.56) to 3.76 Brazilian reals ($0.64) on the Brazilian Stock Exchange, according to Google Finance. In total, Meliuz’s share price has spiked up over 27% in the last five days to 3.85 Brazilian reals ($0.65). Meliuz’s share price has risen over 27% in the last five days, including a 14% spike after its new Bitcoin plan was revealed. Source: Google Finance Meliuz purchased Bitcoin for the first time in March after its board of directors approved using up to 10% of the company’s cash for Bitcoin, purchasing 45 BTC for about $4.1 million. Related: Corporate Bitcoin treasuries drop more than $4B on US tariff hike impact The amount of Bitcoin held on the books of publicly traded companies rose by 16.1% in the first quarter of 2025 , according to Bitwise. Public companies bought around 95,431 Bitcoin over the quarter, increasing the total holdings across all company’s balance sheets to around 688,000. Meliuz was among 12 firms that added Bitcoin to their balance sheets for the first time in Q1 20025, joining the likes of video-sharing platform Rumble . Michael Saylor’s digital asset firm, Strategy, has also continued its long-term strategy of acquiring more Bitcoin with its most recent April 14 purchase consisting of 3,459 Bitcoin bought for $285.5 million.

CyberKongz described the decision as a landmark moment, ending what it called years of “unjust allegations, crippling legal fees, and the biggest hurdle we could possibly encounter.” The project, known for its pixelated primate avatars and immersive metaverse-style gaming experiences, had become a symbol of regulatory uncertainty in the Web3 space. In December, CyberKongz received a Wells notice from the SEC , which the project said reflected a confusing stance on how smart contracts function. One of the main issues raised by the regulator was the alleged sale of Genesis Kongz in April 2021. However, the team clarified this was not a token sale but a contract migration. They argued that if the SEC cannot tell the difference between a primary sale and a technical update, it raises serious concerns about the clarity of current crypto regulations. The SEC has officially closed its investigation into CyberKongz. After years of litigation, unjust allegations, crippling legal fees, and the biggest hurdle we could possibly encounter – we are free. This is an extremely proud moment for CyberKongz. We are a small, passionate,… pic.twitter.com/kU1QOnp4wN — CyberKongz (@CyberKongz) April 15, 2025 SEC’s Enforcement Eases Following Trump’s Return The announcement comes as the SEC begins to ease its posture toward crypto companies. In line with this shift, the agency has recently paused or dropped several high-profile investigations. These include cases involving Coinbase , Kraken , Robinhood , Immutable and Consensys. At the same time, some probes, like those into Binance and OpenSea, remain open. However, the overall trend points to a softer enforcement approach than in previous years. This shift in approach coincides with a political transition in Washington. The second Trump administration took office in January, followed by the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Days later, the agency launched a new Crypto Task Force to develop clearer rules for the industry, marking a turn toward regulatory clarity and collaboration. CyberKongz Says Victory Signals Hope for Builders Across Web3 CyberKongz was founded by a group of artists and developers. It first gained traction in 2021 during the NFT boom. The project featured uniquely generated gorilla avatars that attracted a cult following. It later expanded into a larger gaming and metaverse ecosystem. The team described its legal battle as a stand for the entire Web3 space, not just itself. “We are a small, passionate, and creative Web3 team that elected to fight this battle for the betterment of Web3,” the project said. A full rebrand and new direction will be announced soon, it added. The case is now closed. CyberKongz said it hopes the outcome will inspire other blockchain projects to keep building with confidence. “It should be celebrated by all that our space is here to stay,” the team said.

This shift, as explained by CEO Simon Gerovich in his X post , is a deliberate move to sidestep the high and often unreasonable exchange fees imposed by Japanese banks when converting yen to dollars for Bitcoin purchases. However, by securing capital in USD from the outset, the company avoids those conversion costs and gains access to cheaper Bitcoin prices available in international markets. This results in a lower average cost of acquisition, allowing Metaplanet to stretch its investment further and boost overall shareholder value. Notably, from January to March 2025, Metaplanet reported a BTC Yield of 95.6%. Between April 1 and April 14, the yield was 6.5%, showing continued growth even in a shorter time frame. Bitcoin Buying Spree Continues Metaplanet’s aggressive strategy hasn’t slowed down. Just days before this announcement, the company increased its Bitcoin stash by 319 BTC, taking its total to 4,525. Earlier this month, it added 150 BTC, followed by another 156 BTC, chipping away at its ambitious goal of holding 21,000 BTC by 2026. These purchases come as Bitcoin trades around $83,000 and is down 25% from its all-time high of over $109,000. This is also seen as the best time to buy the dip and stack Bitcoin at lower prices. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Semler Scientific Files for $500 Million Raise to Fuel Bitcoin Investment Strategy , Following Strategy-Inspired Blueprints Often called “Asia’s Strategy,” Metaplanet’s roadmap reflects the US firm’s Bitcoin-heavy model. While Strategy holds over 500,000 BTC , Metaplanet is catching up and already ranks 10th globally among public Bitcoin holders, according to BitcoinTreasuries data. With its stock reacting positively to Bitcoin buys, such as a 19% jump after a $44 million acquisition in March, the company appears to be gaining traction both financially and strategically. Looking Beyond Japan Metaplanet isn’t just growing its Bitcoin wallet; it’s also expanding its reach. Earlier this year, the company began exploring a US stock market listing to attract international investors. At the same time, it welcomed Eric Trump to its newly formed strategic advisory board, aiming to amplify its global presence and influence in the Bitcoin economy. With bold moves, growing credibility, and an expanding network, Metaplanet is quickly becoming a major player in the corporate crypto race. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In its monthly report published on Apr. 15, Coinbase noted that the total crypto market cap, excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), has fallen 41% from its $1.6 trillion peak in December 2024 to about $950 billion. At the same time, venture capital investment in crypto remains 50–60% below the highs seen during the 2021–2022 cycle. These developments, along with global tariffs and ongoing economic uncertainty, have added pressure to the market, particularly for altcoins. Many investors usually define a bear market as a 20% price drop, but Coinbase believes this rule no longer works well for crypto. It instead advocates the use of risk-adjusted returns and the 200-day moving average to better understand longer-term market shifts. For example, while Bitcoin is down less than 20% since December, it has fallen below its 200-day moving average, indicating a bigger shift in the market. You might also like: Markets drift lower as trade uncertainty lingers, crypto markets slump The report also mentions that Coinbase’s COIN50 index, which tracks the top 50 non-Bitcoin tokens, has also slipped below this level. This often signals that weakness in the market could continue for a longer time. Although Bitcoin’s decline has been modest, altcoins have experienced much steeper losses. Coinbase points out that this gap shows the increased volatility in newer sectors of crypto, such as memecoins, DePIN projects, and artificial intelligence-related tokens. As a result, relying solely on Bitcoin to judge market conditions may no longer be enough. Broader indicators like the COIN50 provide a more complete view of investor sentiment. Coinbase remains cautiously optimistic despite recent struggles. It sees a chance for the market to reach a bottom by mid-to-late Q2 2025, with a possible recovery in Q3 if global conditions improve. Until then, the firm recommends a cautious and flexible approach, as investors face weaker liquidity and a lower appetite for risk.

The transaction inflated the amount of tokens in circulation by around 0.45% of the total supply and caused a brief dip in spot prices. “This incident is contained to the airdrop distribution contracts only and all the funds that could be minted have been minted. No further exploits via this method are possible.” They noted that the hacker still held funds in an account that contained 44 million ZK tokens worth $2.1 million and around 2,200 ETH worth $3.4 million. When asked why the unclaimed airdrop tokens were left in the contract, co-founder and CEO of ZKsync, Alex Gluchowski, said, “The unminted supply was supposed to go back to the Token Assembly,” before adding, “We’re investigating why this didn’t happen.” “The attacker is facing criminal liability. It’s in their best interest to investigate the funds return ASAP,” he said.

There are speculations that the incoming SEC Chair Paul Atkins could drop the case altogether. In a court filing on April 10th, both the parties said they want to save time and resources while trying to reach a settlement. Hence, Ripple will no longer need to respond to the SEC’s brief that was due on April 16.

He believes that Ripple and the SEC’s joint move to pause their appeals is not just a routine step but a strategic move. All of this combined with unusual whale activity and renewed institutional wallet moves, indicates that high-level negotiations are place behind closed doors. He believes that this is a quiet buildup before major structural shifts in high stakes cases like this one. He is confident that if a settlement is reached today, April 16th, it may not only end the legal battle but also open the door for a potential XRP ETF. He notes that this day could mark a turning point in XRP’s history. He also highlighted that the settlement would bring XRP out of regulatory ‘limbo’ which would spark renewed institutional interest and investment, removing the limits that have held back XRP’s growth for years. He also clarified that this is not just speculation, but a logical analysis based on observable moves. “When institutions start positioning ahead of time, it’s because they know what’s coming. And what’s coming might be one of the most important validations the crypto space has seen in a long time, ” he remarked. This day could kickstart huge XRP rally, fueled by strong fundamentals. And the multiple XRP ETF filings that already exist could get the momentum they need to succeed. Ripple CEO, Attorney Hint To Big Shifts Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had also hinted previously in March that the XRP case close to ending. The latest move to pause the case indicates that the SEC might be changing its stance especially with Atkins set to take over as the SEC Chair after the Senate confirmed his appointment on April 9. Besides, Attorney Fred Rispoli had recently shared that something big is expected to happen on or before April 16th, which is the due date for Ripple’s appellate brief. He said that Ripple cannot delay their next court move, hence by April 16, they will either file their appeal which is unlikely with a 10% chance, or announce a settlement or withdrawal with a probability of 90%. On SEC v. Ripple, expect to see something happen on or before next Wednesday, 4/16, the due date for @ripple 's appellate brief.

This week, six altcoins have emerged that show significant potential. These cryptocurrencies offer unique features that might appeal to those considering a shift. Exploring these options could unveil fresh prospects. Discover how these altcoins could become promising additions to an investment portfolio. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges XRP: The Digital Currency Bridging Global Payments with Speed and Security XRP is a cryptocurrency designed to make global payments faster and more affordable. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it operates without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. You can send money anywhere quickly, without hefty fees or needing a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP began with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company behind its development, was gifted 80 billion XRP to improve the network and ecosystem, aiming to facilitate seamless transfers across different currencies. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its focus on fast, low-cost transactions, which is important as digital payments grow. Unlike Bitcoin, which can be slow and costly, XRP offers quicker settlements. Ripple’s efforts to increase liquidity and support the ecosystem could make XRP an attractive option in the current market cycle. As more people seek efficient ways to move money globally, XRP’s features position it well against other cryptocurrencies. Its technology and potential to revolutionize cross-border payments make it a coin worth watching. TRON (TRX): Empowering Creators in the Decentralized Digital Age Imagine a world where content creators have full control over their work and earn fair rewards without middlemen taking a cut. That’s the vision behind TRON (TRX), a blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. Originally built on Ethereum, TRX moved to its own network a year later. TRON aims to revolutionize the internet by putting the power back into the hands of those who create digital content. By allowing consumers to reward creators directly, it cuts out platforms like YouTube and Facebook, ensuring artists receive the full value of their efforts. But TRON doesn’t stop at content sharing. It supports smart contracts and decentralized apps, making it a strong alternative to Ethereum. Transactions on TRON are fast and transparent, and users can track them on a public ledger. With low fees and high scalability, it’s attractive to developers and users alike. In today’s market, as more people seek decentralized solutions and fair compensation models, TRON’s potential shines. Its focus on empowering creators and building a decentralized internet positions it well in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology. BNB: Binance’s Native Coin That’s More Than Just a Crypto Token BNB, launched in June 2017, is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem. It started as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum but now operates across the Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. BNB is used for paying fees, issuing new tokens, and transferring assets within the network. Unlike many other coins, BNB supports smart contracts through a system called Proof-of-Staked Authority. This means users can stake their BNB to help secure the network and earn rewards. Beyond the Binance platform, BNB offers discounts on fees when trading on Binance.com and is accepted by various third-party services. What makes BNB stand out is its quarterly coin burns. Binance reduces BNB’s supply every three months, aiming to cut the initial 200 million coins in half. This process can increase the coin’s value over time by making it scarcer. In the current market cycle, BNB’s strong utility and deflationary model make it an attractive option. While other coins may rely heavily on hype, BNB has practical uses that support its value. As the crypto market evolves, coins like BNB with real-world applications and strong networks may have an edge. Polkadot: Bridging the Blockchain Gap for a Connected Future Polkadot is reshaping the blockchain landscape by enabling different networks to talk to each other seamlessly. Imagine Bitcoin and Ethereum sharing data and value without any middlemen—that’s what Polkadot makes possible. It uses a technology called parachains to boost speed and handle more transactions at once, leaving older networks in the dust. The DOT token isn’t just for trading; it’s a ticket to participate in how the network grows and stays secure. Holders can stake their DOT to help verify transactions and have a say in decisions that shape Polkadot’s direction. In a world where blockchain networks often operate like isolated islands, Polkadot stands out by building bridges. Created by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and supported by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot launched with a mission to create a more connected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. As issues like slow transactions and high fees plague some cryptocurrencies, Polkadot’s scalable and interoperable approach offers a fresh solution. With its strong technology and vision, Polkadot is catching the eye of many in the crypto community who are excited about the possibilities of a more linked and efficient future. Chainlink (LINK): Connecting Smart Contracts to the Real World Chainlink is changing the blockchain world. It bridges the gap between blockchains and real-life data. Think of it as a messenger that brings information from outside sources to smart contracts. Now, smart contracts can interact with real-world data like weather reports or stock prices. Chainlink uses oracles to fetch this data and checks accuracy by comparing multiple sources. This makes smart contracts more useful and reliable. In today’s market, Chainlink stands out. Its technology adds real-world use to blockchains. The LINK token is vital. It rewards those who provide accurate data and helps secure the network. Holding LINK can be attractive because it supports a system essential for many blockchain applications. Compared to other coins, LINK has a clear purpose. As the demand for smart contracts grows, so does Chainlink’s potential. It’s a promising project in the current market cycle.

Europe has found itself on thin ice as China makes progress in negotiations, while the U.S. side stalls. Earlier on Tuesday, April 15, during the mid-Western financial markets, EU’s Trade Chief Maroš Šefčovič ended a two-hour meeting with Howard Lutnick, U.S. Commerce Secretary, with little clarity on the deal. The Euro slightly gained over the U.S. dollar. Market Concerns The prolonged trade negotiations have shaken confidence in major stock markets, led by the U.S. and Europe. On Tuesday, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, urged the United States to engage China. “I don’t think decoupling from China should be objective,” Dinom said. The interrupted global supply chain is anticipated to cause inflation, particularly in the United States. Furthermore, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has continued to weaken amid poor performance from major stock indexes led by the Dow and S&P 500. JPMORGAN: VOLATILITY TO PERSIST AMID TRADE UNCERTAINTY JPMorgan cut its year-end S&P 500 target to 5200 from 6500, assuming tariffs stay. (S&P 500 was near 5413.)

On CNBC, he said… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) April 15, 2025 Crypto’s Place in Global Trade War The crypto market’s long-term narrative has gained more traction amid the global trade wars and negotiations. As Coinpedia reported, the ongoing Gold rush, catalyzed by capital flight by institutional investors, has helped Bitcoin price gain bullish sentiment in the past week. According to market data from IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin whales have accelerated accumulation pace akin to the pre-2024 March rally. In the past 24 hours, more than $467 million worth of BTC was withdrawn from crypto exchanges. However, the crypto market has yet to experience ‘crazy speculation’ as fear remains palpable. Furthermore, renowned trader Peter Brandt is not convinced a BTC price reversal in the daily time frame is valid yet. A potential consolidation may form a reversal pattern, which may lead to bullish sentiment possibly in the second half of 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After dropping below $80,000 amid the tariff turmoil, the asset has regained its losses and is now trading above $85,000. This recovery marks a nearly 10% surge over the last seven days and comes as investors reassess macroeconomic cues and on-chain signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: What Experts Anticipate Following The Jump Toward $85,000 Bitcoin On-Chain Trends Indicate Continued Uptrend The market’s resilience appears to be underpinned by several important metrics. According to a recent post by CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest, various on-chain indicators continue to suggest that Bitcoin remains undervalued in the current cycle. The analysis points to declining exchange reserves, a stablecoin supply ratio that suggests available liquidity for new purchases, and normalized funding rates that may indicate a reduced risk of overheated market conditions. One of the striking observations in BorisVest’s analysis is the ongoing reduction in exchange-held Bitcoin reserves, which have now returned to levels not seen since 2018. The total number of BTC on exchanges stands at around 2.43 million, significantly down from the 3.4 million observed during the 2021 bull market peak. This reduction implies a shift toward long-term holding behavior among investors, limiting available supply for immediate sale and potentially contributing to upward price pressure. In addition, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) currently stands at 14.3. The SSR is a metric used to gauge the purchasing power available in the market via stablecoins. A lower SSR indicates higher purchasing power and potential for further buying activity. Since the SSR has not reached the elevated levels seen during the last cycle’s peak, the data implies that capital remains on the sidelines and could be deployed as prices stabilize or rise. Normalized Funding Rates and Bullish Implications Another significant factor highlighted in the report is the normalization of funding rates. During Bitcoin’s recent all-time highs, funding rates spiked as long positions accumulated rapidly, suggesting an overheated market and increased short-term risk. However, since the correction, these rates have returned to neutral territory, now hovering between 0.00% and 0.01%. This return to balance is interpreted as a reset of market sentiment, reducing the likelihood of immediate downside caused by over-leveraged longs. The report concludes that the combination of declining exchange reserves, a stable SSR, and subdued funding rates supports a constructive outlook for Bitcoin in the near term. Related Reading: Strategy’s Bitcoin Portfolio Grows To Nearly 600,000 BTC After Recent Purchase While broader macroeconomic factors, such as the global tariff environment and monetary policy, will continue to influence sentiment, current on-chain dynamics suggest that investor confidence remains intact. The focus now shifts to whether these conditions will translate into sustained upward momentum or if a period of consolidation will take hold before the next major move.

Dogecoin (DOGE) just hit $0.149, its lowest since November, triggering high trading volume and fresh whale accumulation. Futures data shows 71.5% of traders going long, hoping for a mean-reversion bounce. Ethereum (ETH), meanwhile, is flashing historic bullish signals. Its RSI just hit a three-year low—levels that previously preceded 5,600% and 322% rallies. With ETH near $1,500 and its BTC pairing at a macro low, analysts now project a breakout to $5K–$7K. But the real momentum may belong to BlockDAG (BDAG). After launching Keynote 3, BDAG has surged 2,380% in its presale, raised $214 million, and deployed a working testnet, all before its token hits exchanges. In a space full of speculation, BDAG is quietly becoming the most prepared—and potentially most profitable—project of 2025. Dogecoin Hits New Lows—Is This the Calm Before a Big Rebound? Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped below the $0.16 support level, touching $0.149 in the latest market pullback. This marked its lowest point since November, wiping out recent gains. Despite the dip, rising trading volume, peaking at $3.51 billion, and a Relative Strength Index near oversold territory suggest a potential turnaround. Futures data adds to the optimism: DOGE open interest rose 4.68% to $1.35 billion, with over 50% of traders going long. On Binance, long positions surged to 71.5%, reflecting a risk-on shift among leveraged traders. Adding fuel, major DOGE whales have re-entered the market, accumulating around 300 million tokens—their first big move since March. If DOGE can hold above $0.14 and demand continues to rise, a mean-reversion rally could follow. Ethereum’s RSI Hits 3-Year Low—Is a 4x Rally Coming? Ethereum’s RSI has dropped to levels last seen before its past major rallies—one leading to a 5,600% surge, another to 322%. Now near $1,500, ETH could be gearing up for a breakout that some analysts believe may take it to $5K–$7K. Its ETH/BTC ratio is also at a macro low, a signal that often precedes Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin. Ethereum is currently hovering near a descending trendline that has acted as resistance since March 25. A failure to break above could trigger a fresh wave of sell pressure, pushing ETH back toward the $1,522 support area, which has held firm in recent dips. Coinglass data shows $77.86 million in liquidations for ETH futures over the past 24 hours, split between $43.16 million in long positions and $34.69 million in shorts. This reflects continued volatility as traders react to resistance levels and regulatory developments. With a possible SEC green light for staking later in the year and technical signals at a critical juncture, Ethereum’s price could go either way in the short term—but the stakes are rising. BlockDAG Explodes 2,380%—Is This the Last Chance to Get In Before $1? BlockDAG (BDAG) is turning heads after the release of Keynote 3, and its $1 price target suddenly looks realistic. Starting at just $0.001, BDAG has surged to $0.0248 in Batch 27—a massive 2,380% gain. With 19.1 billion tokens sold and $214 million raised, all without VC backing, the growth is entirely community-driven. But BlockDAG isn’t just riding hype. The Beta Testnet is already live, running smart contracts and a redesigned explorer. Over 110,000 users are receiving weekly airdrops, while the no-code Token and NFT Creator lets anyone launch digital assets instantly. Add in live dApps and the BlockDAG Academy, and it’s clear this project is building before most have even launched. BDAG is quietly building momentum with real tools and adoption. With listings on centralized exchanges coming soon, this presale could be the last low-price window. A $1 BDAG would mean a $150B market cap—putting it in the same league as crypto’s biggest players. With utility, adoption, and timing all lining up, BlockDAG might just be the breakout of 2025. What’s Next While Dogecoin’s volatility attracts high-risk traders and Ethereum’s setup suggests a macro-level breakout, BlockDAG is positioning itself as the strongest all-around play. DOGE might bounce, but it remains driven by sentiment and speculative volume. ETH has long-term potential, but it now shares the spotlight with rising altcoins built for scalability and utility. That’s where BlockDAG stands apart.

The surge showcases a newfound demand for easy liquid staking solutions—the kind that lets a Bitcoin holder earn a staking reward without locking up their tokens. These “LSTs” are a potential path for Bitcoin to bridge the staking gap. They now stand as a tempting, flexible, liquid service in an illiquid staking world. That feature has acquired extra luster as the decentralized finance (DeFi) world has continued to evolve. This market keeps on expanding, and a few major players have started emerging within it. They each offer something a little different, and together they seem to be providing a set of workable conditions under which Bitcoin holders can stake assets. And liquidity—that is, the ability to easily convert your Bitcoin to cash or cash-like equivalents—seems to be a major part of those working conditions. Let’s consider a few of the more prominent protocols that are pushing this rapidly growing segment of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Key Players in the Bitcoin LST Market A handful of prominent protocols hold sway over the Bitcoin liquid staking space, with a firmly established position capturing a largely significant share of the TVL. This only goes to show the variety of products and platforms available for Bitcoin holders looking to participate in staking activities. – Lombard Finance: Beating all the rest with 21,011.23 LBTC, Lombard Finance occupies a top spot in the liquid staking market. Their platform offers the chance to stake Bitcoin with a pin-drop-level of liquidity, far better than what you’d get with any other synthetic asset or even a Diversified Liability Management Strategy. Solv Protocol: Solv has made substantial strides in the Bitcoin LST market, with 7,891.48 SolvBTC.BBN presently staked on its platform. Solv offers a diverse array of staking options, and its contributions to the liquid staking ecosystem have positioned it as one of the dominant forces in this space. Its offerings—ranging from single-staking to complex opportunities involving yield farming or other decentralized finance (DeFi) primitives—put it in a leading position. Bitcoin LST landscape: 6,601.24 pumpBTC. This platform has carved out a niche for itself in the Bitcoin LST landscape and is now attracting users who are seeking innovative mechanisms for staking Bitcoin. pumpbtcxyz is gaining traction in the DeFi space due to its unique offerings and the user-centric design of its platform. – Bedrock DeFi: Bedrock DeFi has marked its territory with 4,579.26 uniBTC in total value locked. It is #2 for total value locked on the Bitcoin blockchain. Known for its emphasis on DeFi (i.e., decentralized finance) protocols, Bedrock DeFi provides users with flexible staking options, allowing them to earn rewards while still accessing their Bitcoin holdings (i.e., the Bitcoin they use to stake). – Lorenzo Protocol: With 1,263.55 stBTC, Lorenzo Protocol is a protocol that has entered the liquid staking sphere with a penchant for the user experience and, more specifically, for accessibility. By offering a simple and straightforward staking solution, this protocol has quickly grown in adoption, particularly among retail investors who are new to the liquid staking space. stBTC stands for the Bitcoin staking token. In the world of cryptocurrency, when people talk about Bitcoin, they are almost always referring to the Bitcoin network’s native currency. For Bitcoin, this currency is the stBTC. It is a tokenized form of BTC that allows holders to stake and earn rewards while still using their Bitcoin. stBTC is a non-redeemable token that gets you staked in the ecosystem. You cannot use stBTC in the same way that you might expect to use a Bitcoin token. You are using a token that represents staked Bitcoin. – Acorn Network: Holding 1,197.09 aBTC, Acorn Network has been gaining momentum, providing users a chance to stake without worry. It is all about decentralized governance at Acorn; there is no way for those in charge to be in charge unless the network allows them to. Transparency is a real value at Acorn, and it is a network just begging to be understood. Acorn and aBTC are not household names. When Acorn is mentioned, some online commentators respond with a confused, “Huh?” This is exactly why Acorn deserves our attention. – Added Contributions: Other remarkable protocols that are helping to generate and develop the Bitcoin LST sector are Solv Protocol, with many offerings like 1,090.96 SolvBTC.ENA and 882.79 SolvBTC.CORE; and allo.xyz, which has 544.13 alloBTC staked. Then we have pStake Finance, too, adding to the pot with 200.01 YBTC. These protocols, while certainly smaller in terms of TVL, are adding quite a diversification flavor to the Bitcoin LST offering. Bitcoin Liquid Staking Token Outlook Recording the current landscape of the Bitcoin LST market with more than $4B in total value locked. @Lombard_Finance – 21,011.23 LBTC @SolvProtocol – 7,891.48 SolvBTC.BBN @Pumpbtcxyz – 6,601.24 pumpBTC @Bedrock_DeFi – 4,579.26… pic.twitter.com/6peM95qPJE — Bitcoin Ecosystem (@BitcoinEcoTK) April 14, 2025 The Future of Bitcoin Liquid Staking As additional protocols move into the Bitcoin liquid staking space, the market is expected to grow and offer even more options with even more features for Bitcoin holders. There is a clear demand tap, then, for not just liquid staking but for flexible solutions that allow users to earn rewards while maintaining the liquidity of their assets. That demand is no doubt a driver of the current Bitcoin liquid staking solutions market, which has over $4 billion currently locked in these on-chain contracts. Widespread fascination with liquid staking demonstrates the sophistication of the DeFi space. Liquid staking is the middle ground between the traditional, unyielding, long-term locked Bitcoin staking that many institutional and retail investors first encounter and the era of true liquidity that we live in now. As much of a stepping stone as it is for converging on the era of liquidity, it represents a moment in that broader transition. Upcoming months will bring more changes and additions to the Bitcoin LST market, as the space around it continues to mature. We can look forward to some yield optimization innovations, for example. More will be said about governance, and the kind of structures that are better or worse for this new setup. One kind of innovation most likely to affect you directly is around liquidity.

Overall crypto market capitalization fell 3.3% in the past 24 hours, with BTC sliding to nearly $83,500 from a high above $84,200 a day earlier. Ether (ETH) and Cardano’s ADA fell as much as 5% to lead losses among majors. XRP showed steady declines, with price action suggesting a plunge in the coming days. Fundamentals showed a positive bump, however, with exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider ProShares amending its spot XRP ETF (to be offered in the U.S.) filing on Tuesday — targeting a launch date of April 30. Bitcoin selling by large investors has eased as they realize losses, on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant shared in a note to CoinDesk. Daily bitcoin selling from large investors has declined from a high of 800,000 BTC in late February to a daily rate of about 300,000 BTC. “The slowdown in selling has come as these investors have been realizing losses since late February amid low prices,” analysts wrote. “However, accumulation by large investors remains weak. Their holdings declined by approximately 30K BTC over the past week, and their monthly accumulation rate dropped from 2.7% at the end of March to just 0.5%—its slowest pace since February 20.” A slump in majors came as Chinese stocks in Hong Kong extended their losses to as much as 2.9% after Wednesday’s open despite the Chinese economy growing 5.4% in the first quarter. The extent of tariff impact remains a concern among traders, whose risk-off moves eventually weigh down crypto markets. ""There can be no doubt that fears of a U.S. recession are intensifying, with major institutions revising their forecasts sharply upwards,” James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, told CoinDesk in an email. “Economic growth is forecast to stall at anywhere between 0.1% and 1%, and many believe these risks are already priced into equities, but I am not so sure that we’ve even seen the bottom.” “It does however feel that Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized asset grows, especially as traditional markets face volatility. While Trump’s policies have introduced significant macroeconomic uncertainty, they may paradoxically be fueling Bitcoin’s recent rise—though the risks remain elevated for all markets, crypto included,” Toledano added.",Markets|Bitcoin|Cardano|XRP,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-16 06:03:42

Nvidia stated in an April 15 regulatory filing that it is expecting around $5.5 billion in charges associated with its AI chip inventory due to significant export restrictions imposed by the US government affecting the company’s business with China. Nvidia said that the US government informed it on April 9 that export licenses are now required for its popular H20 integrated circuits and any chips with similar bandwidth capacity. “First quarter results are expected to include up to approximately $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.” The restrictions specifically mention China, Hong Kong and Macau, and the government indicated that the license requirement “addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.” The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can export to China under previous export rules. Government officials have been calling for stronger export controls on the chip, which was reportedly used to train models from China-based AI startup DeepSeek. The Trump administration initially put the restrictions on hold following President Donald Trump’s meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this month, NPR reported . Related: Nvidia's stock price forms ’death cross’ — Will AI crypto tokens follow? On April 14, Nvidia announced that it would spend hundreds of millions of dollars over the next four years manufacturing some AI chips in the US. However, that has not prevented the stock slump in light of the latest filing and predicted impact on its upcoming revenue report . “Truly no company is safe from tariffs,” commented the Kobeissi Letter. Nvidia’s first quarter of fiscal year 2026 ends on April 27. Nvidia, AMD stocks slump after hours Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) fell 6% in after-hours trading on April 15 to $105, according to Google Finance.

43396897,https://nulltx.com/?p=148016,1744783521,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Avalon Labs and Bybit Launch Institutional Yield Layer, Transforming Bitcoin Lending for the CeFi Ecosystem",https://nulltx.com/avalon-labs-and-bybit-launch-institutional-yield-layer-transforming-bitcoin-lending-for-the-cefi-ecosystem/,"Avalon Labs has formally introduced the institutional yield layer on Bybit Earn; it’s a new model for lending Bitcoin and generating yield that combines centralized finance efficiency with decentralized finance innovation. Bybit Earn is a yield product offered by Bybit, a centralized exchange (CEX) for trading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Bybit Earn, as an offering, is more like a savings account than a fixed-income product in terms of how one would expect it to work, and that’s intrinsic to the new model Avalon Labs has built. The new initiative centers on using Avalon’s fixed-rate institutional borrowing infrastructure and integrating FunctionBTC ($FBTC), a version of Bitcoin fully compatible with DeFi protocols and pegged to Bitcoin. This combination allows Bitcoin to become a productive, yield-generating asset without exposing users to the direct dynamics of DeFi, which can be both complex and volatile. Unlocking Yield Through CeFi-to-DeFi Bridging At the core of this system is $FBTC, a pegged Bitcoin asset that holds a 1:1 value with Bitcoin. Holding over $1.25 billion in total value locked (TVL), $FBTC forms a solid bridge, bringing Bitcoin into DeFi across Ethereum and other compatible blockchains. It lets users access DeFi protocols and yield strategies while keeping the economic exposure of Bitcoin. In this innovative structure, Avalon serves as the intermediary that transforms passive Bitcoin into an active yield-generating instrument. It all starts with $FBTC deposited as collateral on Avalon’s institutional platform. Next, Avalon lends against the $FBTC at fixed interest rates. This setup offers predictability and transparency to both borrowers and lenders. The capital that is borrowed—denominated in USDT—gets put to work in high-yield strategies, using yield-bearing synthetic assets like $USDe and $sUSDE, which Ethena Labs issues. These DeFi-native assets are designed to hold their value and pay off consistently, making them ideal for Avalon to construct strategies around. The here is not just in the technology but in the structure of the ecosystem. The entire yield cycle—from collateralization to deployment and eventual yield distribution—is automated and optimized. This means that users can access the benefits of institutional-grade yield farming without the complexities or risks typically associated with DeFi involvement. Making Bitcoin Work Harder This new layer is more than just a new application of blockchain technology; it’s a move toward reinventing Bitcoin’s role in the financial system. Traditionally regarded as a secure way to hold wealth, Bitcoin has until now mostly sat still, with holders hoping for it just to get more valuable. Avalon isn’t just offering a new way to earn that kind of passive income; its model is even more radical because it reinterprets the underlying financial instrument. Avalon enables retail users to access institutional-grade strategies when they integrate with Bybit Earn. This was something only within the reach of the privileged few before. But now, the vast majority can access these kinds of strategies. And there are two things in particular about the way that Avalon works that I want to highlight. One is that the yield is fixed. This is really important because more and more in the crypto space, we are seeing products that have variable yields. Yielding a variable amount is a really good way of saying we might not be able to service our debt. But when you see a product with a fixed yield, it is very clear that particular product is hitting some sort of threshold for servicing its debts. Avalon’s multilayered model also stresses security and simplicity. The whole process is set up to bypass the kinds of overleveraging and murky risk-taking that some DeFi lending platforms have previously dragged us into. By using overcollateralized positions and directing capital only into kinds of high-grade, yield-bearing assets, Avalon guarantees that the yield mechanism remains intact. This partnership has established a bridge between CeFi and DeFi, and it has created a way for users of a Bitcoin-native platform to generate yield on their digital assets. As soon as next month (March 2023), users on BlockFi’s platform will be able to stake their Bitcoin and earn Bitcoin yields, all while the assets remain in a fully collateralized state. This clean structure—a wall between Bitcoin and Ethereum and between BlockFi and the Staking Ethereum-using platform—could make the BlockFi-to-Ethereum staking operation a possible model for CeFi-to-DeFi collaborations in the future. Avalon’s institutional layer on Bybit Earn is now launched, and it is a watershed moment for crypto finance. This system is using the best of both centralized and decentralized worlds, and it is yielding something that looks quite nice for Bitcoin holders. The basic premise—layered on top of Bybit’s existing centralized finance (CeFi) structure—is that there are now two main ways for these holders to earn yields: either by putting their BTC in a custodial solution where it’s safe and sound (but with the risk of it being too accessible to hackers), or by allowing their BTC to be used in a revolutionary new way that more closely aligns with the Bitcoin ethos.

Several high-profile Solana memecoins have recently racked up significant new smart money activity. In this post, we’re going to outline some key trends from this on-chain data. Momentum Picks Up for Select Memecoins Of the 25 memecoins looked at, four have emerged with particularly strong momentum: GIGA, MTN, MUMU, and ALON. These tokens are showing serious inflows from wallets that look a lot like (highly informed) institutional investor wallets. This is behavior very commonly associated with projects that are about to undergo significant price increases. When these tokens are being bought up by wallets associated with mysterious “smart money,” it is very often a sign that the price of those tokens is about to increase. Smart Money Activity on the Top 25 Memecoins on Solana Today Strong Momentum: $GIGA $MTN $MUMU and $ALON are showing strong inflows with clear Smart Money confidence — these are currently hot and worth watching closely. Held, But Quiet: Smart Money is still holding JOBCOIN,… pic.twitter.com/XoErOuhL9P — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 15, 2025 More and more capital is flowing into these projects, and that is indicating a growing belief in their viability—or in the narrative strength of the memecoin space. Whether that belief is being fueled by actual community growth and token utility, by viral marketing or by a speculative mania, these tokens are now way too hot to not trade as short-term opportunities. These tokens are the most alluring in the Solana memecoin space right now, for both retail investors and speculators. But as with all fast-moving, meme-fueled markets, one can’t become complacent. Stay vigilant. What seems to have all the momentum today can very easily run out of gas tomorrow. Quiet Confidence: Tokens Being Held Without Much Activity Conversely, a second bucket of tokens seems to be in a holding pattern. Smart money wallets still hold JOBCOIN, BUCKAZOIDS, SCS, AVA, and RETARDIO, but none of these tokens is seeing inflows or even engagement at this hour. This signals a level of confidence you don’t really get to see in the public markets very often. Smart money is not pulling the fire alarm and exiting these positions. Instead, it’s at worst passively confident and maybe even tentatively bullish on these products. Such behavior can indicate several things. For one, these tokens might be considered long-term holds, with future catalysts expected. For another, the initial hype might have cooled, but there’s no strong reason to exit yet. It’s also possible that liquidity is thin, markets are waiting for the next big move, or just re-engaging. All these possibilities raise a question: Is crypto lull truly a lull, or just a formless, directionless period that will end when something—probably a regulatory event, return of bull market conditions, or both—happens? This set of tokens may be of interest to traders, but they should not take any action yet. These could be positions that explode if sentiment shifts suddenly, but for now, they are dormant. Distribution in Progress: Smart Money Exits Signal Cooling Sentiment The most telling category is where knowledgable money has actively started to move out. Today’s data shows that institutional and seasoned investors have offloaded their positions in CLAUDIUS, GOAT, KAFKA, TITCOIN, and wPOND. This sell-off behavior typically points to a distribution phase, where earlier investors are taking profits and reducing exposure. This movement frequently denotes the commencement of a downtrend or diminishing market interest. If smart money investors are divesting from these tokens, retail investors may be left holding the bag if the broader market sentiment follows the lead of the smart money. It’s a sobering reminder of the meager memecoin market. When confidence appears to be on the upswing, these assets seem to appreciate in value. When confidence slopes downward, so does the value of these assets. Remarkably, tokens that are in the distribution phase rarely experience rapid rebounds without the push of external catalysts or a fresh marketing effort. Traders, be warned: The price action in these tokens now may reflect near-term exit liquidity rather than long-term, serious investment. The projects themselves don’t seem to be healthy. Conclusion: Smart Money as a Compass in Memecoin Chaos A current look at smart money actions in Solana’s top 25 memecoins provides insight into the market’s state. Even as the memecoin scene remains the speculative breeding ground it has always been, the moves of well-informed investors stick out as reliable early indicators of when and where the market might be up to something. For individuals traversing this unstable area, the essential lesson is obvious: track the cash, but grasp the context. Right now, the entities to keep your eye on are GIGA, MTN, MUMU, and ALON, while CLAUDIUS and GOAT look to be on a downward trajectory.

43396988,https://nulltx.com/?p=148014,1744783779,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Trends in Memecoins: Inflows Outpace Outflows on April 14, 2025",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-trends-in-memecoins-inflows-outpace-outflows-on-april-14-2025/,"The memecoin market saw a clear increase in smart money activity. With net inflows indicating the increasing interest of experienced crypto investors, it took on a decidedly optimistic tone. Even with the inherent volatility and high risk associated with tokens built around memes, it seems as if some institutional wallets and high-volume traders, who we often refer to as “smart money,” are making calculated decisions to allocate capital into certain assets. Those seem to include some from the Solana ecosystem. On-chain data indicates that memecoins saw inflows of around $3.62 million yesterday. Meanwhile, outflows were estimated at about $2.15 million. This results in a net amount of $1.46 million, with a total transaction volume of $5.77 million. The appearance that market participants are accumulating rather than exiting memecoins indicates a shift in momentum that could have them rallying again. When entering positions like these, it’s smart to consider any potential for price moves. Focused Accumulation: Smart Money Bets on Select Memecoins A detailed look at the incoming flow data identifies several specific tokens that prefer capital inflow from discerning investors. The largest single-token inflow was observed in JLP, which attracted $310,000. This is a punchy amount and may indicate growing confidence in the project. Community sentiment around JLP seems to be robust, the tech seems to be shaping up well, and the traders in this space are starting to talk it up more. These are all good signs for JLP. Whether it will make a mind-blowing return in the next couple of months is anyone’s guess. Another notable arrival of capital was in FARTCOIN, which secured $205,000 from smart wallets. This level of inflow, despite the giggle factor that brands like FARTCOIN tend to evoke, does speak to the willingness of certain types of investors to place bets on the very viral and sentiment-driven space that asset classes like FARTCOIN inhabit. Other tokens experiencing considerable capital influxes include MPLX (with a substantial $85,000), ARC ($90,000), and RFC ($61,000). While these figures seem paltry next to those for JLP and FARTCOIN, they are still significant amounts in a niche segment of the market where relatively small sum changes might lead to outsized price reactions. Furthermore, the apparent spreading of smart money across these various tokens could indicate a diversification strategy by investors. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 14/04/25 Yesterday, there was more inflow than outflow Inflow: $3.62M Outflow: $2.15M Volume: $5.77M Net Volume: $1.46M There was inflow into: $RFC ($61K) $MPLX ($85K) $JLP ($310K) #FARTCOIN ($205K) $ARC … pic.twitter.com/00uCOJqx75 — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 15, 2025 Light Outflows Suggest Mild Profit-Taking Although the general sentiment seems to be bullish, a few memecoins experienced outflows. However, these outflows were modest in comparison to the overall inflows and could just be a blip in the trend. HONEY was the leading memecoin in this regard, with $61,000 being withdrawn from it by smart wallets. Of course, this could just be a manner of speaking in describing what is really just a few smart wallets cashing out, but it’s a narrative we’ve seen before. XBG experienced $31,000 in outflows, FWOG saw a decrease of $20,000, and POPCAT registered a $19,000 drop in capital. These figures do not indicate a large-scale withdrawal of funds from these positions, but they may point to a trend where money is moving from these slightly older avenues of investment into either newer or more promising opportunities. It is also important to highlight that such movements are often part of a routine set of actions that occur within the rapidly moving memecoin ecosystem. These outflows, which were relatively mild, suggest that some profit-taking took place but that the overall sentiment is still positive. The outflows were not enough to affect the market narrative, and in fact, they were far outpaced by the inflows into other tokens. Even though some folks were taking profits and there were some outflows from Bitcoin, this is a very bullish kind of signal for Bitcoin. Conclusion: Net Inflows Signal Renewed Confidence in Memecoin Market Smart money activity on April 14 shows revived interest and careful accumulation in the memecoin sector. The inflows topped the outflows by a healthy $1.46 million. That signals a pretty good-sized section of the market memeing itself up in preparations for a potential upswing. Of course, memecoins are still not-wise investments fueled mainly by the enthusiasm of people who have lost all sense of what “money” is. However, tracking sector rotation and what smart money is doing can offer some appearance of illumination in a pretty dark and pretty dumb-space. In the coming days, broader market behavior could be set by sophisticated players paying attention to the tokens JLP and FARTCOIN. These tokens have attracted the interest of some truly serious players. They have caught the attention of sophisticated market participants, for which reason I believe they could be a driver of broader market behavior. Traders should always be careful, but at the moment, signs from smart money movements indicate that the market is preparing, in an unhurried way, for its next big shift.

While many crypto analysts predict new Bitcoin ( BTC ) all-time highs by June, Markus Thielen said in an April 14 markets report that he is skeptical, pointing out that onchain data signals “more of a bear market environment than a bullish one.” Short-term indicators signal potential market top Thielen said the Bitcoin stochastic oscillator — which compares a particular closing price to a range of prices over a specific period to determine momentum — shows patterns “more typical of a market top or late-cycle phase rather than the early stages of a new bull run.” Bitcoin is trading at $83,810 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap “As a result, short-term signals are not aligning with longer-term indicators, highlighting the disconnect in the market outlook,” Thielen said. “Bitcoin is no longer a parabolic ‘Long-Only’ retail-driven market,” he added, explaining it now “demands a more sophisticated, finance-oriented approach.” “Bitcoin’s rally over the past year hasn’t been driven by typical ‘crypto-bro’ speculation but by long-term holders seeking diversification and adopting a buy-and-hold strategy,” Thielen said. Over the past 12 months, Bitcoin is up 32.80% and is trading at around $83,810 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin price action may repeat 2024 pattern Thielen reiterated his stance that Bitcoin may consolidate for an extended period, much like it did in 2024. “Despite our cautious optimism, we view Bitcoin as trading within a broad range of $73,000 to $94,000, with a slight upward bias,” he said. In March 2024, Bitcoin reached its then-all-time high of $73,679 before entering a consolidation phase, swinging within a range of around $20,000 until Donald Trump won the US elections in November. Related: Bitcoin price recovery could be capped at $90K — Here’s why Many crypto analysts are eyeing June as the month when Bitcoin could surpass its current all-time high of $109,000, which it reached in January just before Trump’s inauguration. Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten told Cointelegraph in early March that “there’s more than 50% chance we will see all-time highs before the end of June this year.” Sharing a similar view, Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson and Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts have also marked June as when Bitcoin could reach a new high. “It is entirely possible Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high before June,” Peterson said. Meanwhile, Coutts said, “The market may be underestimating how quickly Bitcoin could surge – potentially hitting new all-time highs before Q2 is out.” Magazine: Riskiest, most ‘addictive’ crypto game of 2025, PIXEL goes multi-game: Web3 Gamer This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This concerning trend only strengthens the narrative that the SEC lawsuit closure was a typical sell-the-news event. Ripple Whales Are Selling As with all other cryptocurrencies, Ripple whales’ behavior is typically a solid sign of overall market conditions, sentiment, and short-term price directions, at least to some extent. They can impact price moves with massive purchases or sales. After the US elections, whales went on a substantial accumulation spree as their holdings reached a six-year high. A few months down the road, XRP peaked at $3.4. That’s where the landscape started to change and Ripple whales began offloading significant portions of their XRP fortune. This, alongside the overall worsening market conditions and political uncertainty, pushed the asset south to under $2 on several occasions. These market participants have continued to dispose of their XRP tokens since the start of April, thus confirming the ongoing trend. According to Ali Martínez, they have sold more than 370 million tokens in the past few weeks, which equals roughly $800 million given XRP’s price. Whales have sold over 370 million $XRP since the start of the month! pic.twitter.com/KXiCjGHmBM — Ali (@ali_charts) April 15, 2025 Peculiar Timing Whales’ sell-offs began in late March and have continued until today, with a few exceptions. This is so worrisome because they began shortly after Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced on X that the lawsuit between his company and the US securities watchdog had effectively ended after both parties dropped their latest appeals. Although the SEC has yet to publish an official confirmation, industry experts believe this is just a matter of time and has already been priced in. As such, the recent behavior by whales reaffirms a previous narrative that the real gains for XRP came on hype that the lawsuit would be concluded instead of the actual ending—or, as they say in the financial world, a typical ‘buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news’ event. Looking ahead for Ripple, there are still some hype-worthy developments to anticipate, such as a potential approval of an XRP ETF in the States. Such products could restart another hype-driven rally, like Bitcoin last year, but they can also lead to the opposite long-term effects, like Ethereum.

This is not just a new record for Axiom , set on April 14, 2025; it’s also a new record for the meme trading space on Solana. It’s growth like this that makes Axiom the clear frontrunner in the mean trading space on Solana, with a whopping share of something close to 50 percent of the total overall meme trading volume that’s now part of this Solana ecosystem. Axiom is not just the platform on which the most meme trading is happening on Solana; it’s the platform where the most meme trading is happening, period. Meme trading platform Axiom's daily trading volume exceeded $100 million for the first time on April 14, accounting for about 50% of the market share of Solana Meme trading platform; the number of trading users reached 26,800, a record high. Axiom's advantages include the support… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 15, 2025 With this trading volume surge, Axiom also hit another notable benchmark: a record number of daily active traders. On April 14, the platform saw 26,800 individual users participating in trades—its highest user count to date. This dual milestone underscores the platform’s rapidly expanding influence in the highly speculative, yet increasingly strategic, trading world of meme tokens. Strategic Advantages Powering Growth Axiom has not purely risen by itself—it is supported by well-structured strategic and technical advantages that appeal to both casual and seasoned traders. One of the basic building blocks of its growth is that it is backed by Y Combinator, the world-renowned startup incubator. This affiliation gives Axiom early-stage credibility, access to early-stage capital, and a platform that allows it to be more widely exposed. One more reason Axiom appeals to investors is a suite of advanced analytical tools that come with the platform, such as Wallet Tracer and Twitter Tracker. These tools enable Axiom members to keep tabs on not just their own trades, but on significant movements (in both directions) of some of the most important wallets in the ecosystem. With direct access to this data, Axiom members can spot potential price moves before they happen. Axiom has pulled ahead of its rivals by including derivatives trading and basic financial management features in its platform. These are almost nonexistent in the meme coin trading sector and enable traders to flesh out their strategies with a couple of not-so-basic options. If you’re looking to diversify your way out of a spot trading bind, or leverage your way into a new volatility moment, well, that’s what these tools are for. The platform’s growth has also been speeded up by a well-implemented points and referral system. Users earn points based on their trading activity, which can be redeemed for platform benefits or incentives that we plan to offer in the future. Axiom also offers rebates through our invitation program; the users whom you see on this invitation leaderboard have brought in new traders, for whom we now reward them with cash. This gamified approach has not only encouraged higher engagement but has also helped drive user acquisition at scale. Engaging Western communities has significantly contributed to Axiom’s success as well. Axiom has gone live, holding video trading sessions in real time for the Western audience. It has formed partnerships with influencers whose bases of fandom run deep in the Western community. And it has realm (as in the next cosmos) leads to its promotional campaigns, which are now helping it capture the attention—not to mention the imaginations—of English-speaking audiences in the U.S. and Europe. Concerns Linger Over Trading Integrity Even with its solid figures and seeming forward motion, the trading activity on Axiom remains to be seen as legitimate. Some in the crypto community raise eyebrows over the possibility of wash trading or, at the very least, transaction volumes that appear to be artificially inflated. No smoking gun has been found, of course, but the whole situation is a reminder of just how much is still at stake—and still up for grabs—in high-growth crypto platforms. Axiom isn’t the only one with these problems (newer exchanges and platforms across fast-moving market segments seem to be afflicted by them), so this isn’t just an Axiom problem. If Axiom wants to keep up its good reputation and stay in the lead, it seems to me that it needs to be proactive in dealing with these matters—either through audits, improved transparency, or community communication. For now, the figures convey a lot. Axiom has stepped into a commanding position within the meme trading ecosystem of Solana. How did it get there? Through a combination of solid infrastructure, smart strategy, and aggressive outreach. If it keeps addressing concerns about trading behavior and maintains this momentum, we could be looking at the Axiom blueprint for how to meme trade, both in terms of platform design and the way you scale a platform. Not just a personal milestone for Axiom, April 14 may be remembered as a marker in the evolution of meme trading itself—a space once considered a joke, now growing into a complex, data-driven market in its own right.

Analyst Explains Two Reasons,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-bitcoin-btc-price-isnt-making-the-big-explosive-spikes-of-old-times-analyst-explains-two-reasons/,"Despite Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rally in the current cycle, the market is exhibiting unusually calm behavior compared to previous bull runs, according to CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan. In a recent analysis, Dan cited both macroeconomic conditions and changing market dynamics as the primary reasons for this divergence, citing a lack of “explosive new funds and participants.” “In past cycles, the market usually heats up quickly with strong upsides and a large influx of short-term holders,” Dan said. “But this time, the percentage of Bitcoin held from one week to one month is significantly lower than before. This points to a notable absence of speculative capital and new retail participants.” Dan attributes this change to two key factors: Changing Liquidity Environment: “The 2020-2021 bull run occurred in an environment of near-zero interest rates and aggressive quantitative easing,” Dan explained. “Now we are in a phase of high interest rates and tight liquidity. Capital flows are no longer free, and large-scale swings have become more difficult to achieve.” Institutional Dominance: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has structurally changed the market, according to Dan. “Individual investors used to drive the momentum. Now, with institutional capital leading the way, we are seeing a more controlled, ladder-like rise in Bitcoin price, rather than the rapid, emotional rallies of the past,” he said. Related News: Here are the Altcoins Developers Focused on the Most in the Last 30 Days, There Are Surprises - Here's the List This cautious institutional behavior is also reflected in on-chain data, which some analysts suggest may already be signaling a cycle peak. However, Dan believes that the current phase does not imply a traditional boom-and-bust trajectory. Instead, he envisions a longer and more complex market structure ahead. “ETF inflows are still ongoing and if the macro environment gradually eases, we could see meaningful trends emerge in 2025,” Dan said. *This is not investment advice.

43397134,https://nulltx.com/?p=148012,1744784117,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Volatility Strikes: STORY (IP) and ACT Tokens Suffer Sharp Drops Amid Heavy Liquidations,https://nulltx.com/volatility-strikes-story-ip-and-act-tokens-suffer-sharp-drops-amid-heavy-liquidations/,"The latest storm to hit the crypto world came on April 14, when the prices of two big tokens—STORY (IP) and ACT—took a nosedive. This was a day for large-scale liquidations and for expressing concerns about the market’s stability and sentiment. STORY (IP), a token tied to an ever-expanding narrative-driven decentralized ecosystem, took a blunt noontime hit of about 21.5 percent. The token went from $3.90 to a low of $2.90 before it staged a bit of a recovery to close the day around the $4.00 level. While brief, the steep correction sent ripples of activity across the major exchanges, with Binance Futures and the spot markets of OKX appearing to be the centers of that trading volume. $IP dropped over 20% from $3.9 to $2.9 yesterday, before bouncing back to around $4. In the past 24h, $2.07M in positions were liquidated: $1.17M in longs and $902K in shorts. pic.twitter.com/RUh16lwRdz — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) April 15, 2025 Based on data from on-chain and exchange sources, the plunge in IP’s price caused liquidated positions exceeding $2.07 million to vanish within a mere 24 hours. Of these positions, around $1.17 million belonged to long traders, while $902,000 was held by shorters. The almost equally shared load of long and short liquidations between these two trading groups points to a very unstable environment, with rapid price changes stopping both kinds of traders in their tracks. The steep drop, which was almost immediately followed by a recovery, suggests that the token’s price action was influenced by some combination of aggressive leverage trading, stop-hunting behavior, and maybe a touch of automated liquidation. That dynamic—if that’s what was going on—certainly isn’t uncommon in the crypto derivatives space, where rapid price moves tend to be amplified by excessive leverage and market inefficiencies. ACT Token Joins the Slide with Steeper Losses As the market concentrated on the IP token’s sharp decrease, the ACT token experienced a similar, if not more intense, selling on the centralized exchanges. The result of this was a sudden drop of roughly 27 percent in the price of ACT in just a few hours. There are both narrative and infrastructure reasons that make ACT an increasingly attractive token. Despite these reasons to be bullish on the price of ACT, however, the token dropped sharply—much like the IP token. Even though ACT’s trading data lacks some of the granular liquidation figures seen with IP, the drop likely triggered the cascade of automated trades and selling by panicked humans that we associate with downward momentum. Earlier in the week, ACT had shown signs of strength, but its sharp reversal underscores just how unpredictable it is to trade sentiment-driven tokens in a market that is so very speculative. Both IP and ACT falling in sync could signal an even broader decline in the altcoin market—a sign of market fragility. Bitcoin and Ethereum are in somewhat of a range, consolidating at the recent highs. That means the smaller-cap tokens, in comparison to BTC and ETH, are acting somewhat as wildcats—unexpectedly shifting much lower, or, in some cases, much higher (in the direction of the recent highs). Market Context and Caution Ahead Both tokens’ sharp price swings are a stark reminder of the crypto market’s volatility, particularly for sectors driven by the hype of good narratives, potential use cases, or speculation. And yet, even volatility can’t explain why an event on April 14 sent the prices of both swinging in the same direction. Especially traders who use high leverage are advised to stay careful and watchful in these kinds of environments. This is because trading in futures and on margin can yield vast amounts of gains but also expose traders to very large and very quick losses when volatility kicks up. At present, both IP and ACT seem to have slightly stabilized after their sharp declines, but a lot of uncertainty still prevails. Market watchers will be closely observing in the next few days for any signs that renewed volatility may be just around the corner. If that does happen, one can bet that derivatives-heavy platforms like Binance Futures will once again be playing an oversized role in any price action we see across the broader crypto market. In summary, the happenings associated with IP and ACT provide yet another lesson about the market’s behavior, risk management, and the often-unpredictable course of digital assets. Whether or not these tokens make an even more robust recovery or face an ongoing deluge of sell orders will depend, in a very large way, on what happens next in the minds of investors, in the crypto sector’s overall market conditions, and in the digital asset space’s broader bubble or not trajectory.

Multiple major asset managers, including ProShares and Bitwise, have now filed to launch XRP ETF, signaling a wave of institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. The most talked-about filing is from ProShares , which applied for a futures-based “Short XRP ETF,” aiming for a launch as early as April 30, 2025. This would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP through regular brokerage accounts, without buying or holding the asset directly. Kaiko research says XRP leads all altcoins with 10 active ETF filings, more than Solana, Litecoin, or Dogecoin. It also has the strongest liquidity, meaning there’s a lot of buy and sell activity near its market price. This kind of depth is a key factor the SEC looks at when considering ETF approvals. Is XRP the Next Big ETF Bet? Crypto analyst John Squire expressed his excitement after a big development around XRP. Shortly after he shared his thoughts about a possible settlement in the Ripple and SEC case unlocking a major move for XRP, ProShares submitted an official filing to launch an XRP ETF. The target date for this ETF is April 30, 2025. Squire believes this moment signals real momentum, not just speculation. According to him, XRP is no longer sitting on the sidelines waiting for approval. Instead, it is stepping confidently into the spotlight and moving toward broader market recognition. He further highlights that the SEC now holds the key to what happens next. Under the new leadership SEC’s actions will likely shape how far and fast XRP can grow from here. More Players Join the XRP ETF Race Moreover, the ProShares application is part of a larger trend. Other companies like Bitwise, 21 Shares, and CoinShares have also stepped in, looking to offer XRP-based products. These filings reflect rising demand from investors who want exposure to XRP in a regulated and more accessible way. If these ETFs are approved, it could significantly boost XRP’s visibility and credibility within traditional finance circles. The SEC Factor and BlackRock’s Silence One reason for the growing optimism is the shift in the SEC’s leadership. There’s speculation that the agency might drop its appeal in the ongoing Ripple case, which could open the door for a spot XRP ETF. A move like that would be a massive milestone. However, one major player is still missing from the list is BlackRock. Known for its influence in the ETF world, BlackRock’s entry could reshape the entire XRP ETF landscape if it chooses to get involved. For now, XRP’s path to mainstream adoption seems to be gaining traction faster than ever. With strong filings, shifting regulations, and analysts calling attention to the trend, the stage is being set for XRP to finally shine in traditional finance.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-16 06:15:22
43397175,https://nulltx.com/?p=148011,1744784270,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,CeFi Lending Shrinks to $11.2B as DeFi Surpasses 60% Share of Crypto Credit Market,https://nulltx.com/cefi-lending-shrinks-to-11-2b-as-defi-surpasses-60-share-of-crypto-credit-market/,"The lending landscape in crypto has changed drastically over the past two years. Once a prominent sector in the crypto space, centralized finance (CeFi) lenders have seen their presence dramatically reduced, mainly due to the turbulence in the overall crypto market and rising regulatory scrutiny from lawmakers and government agencies. According to a comprehensive review of public filings, bankruptcy proceedings, and voluntary disclosures from active CeFi lending platforms, the combined outstanding loan book size of the CeFi sector stands at just $11.2 billion, as of the end of last year—an incredible 68% drop from its all-time high of $34.8 billion just a year prior. This downturn signifies a key transition in the architecture of crypto finance. Meanwhile, decentralized finance, or DeFi, keeps growing and has emerged as the principal driver of lending in this sector. CeFi’s Downfall and DeFi’s Rise As of year-end 2024, the installment of the mix of old titans and new contenders among the top ten centralized finance (CeFi) lenders reveals a few incumbents. At the top is Tether, the stablecoin (and everything else) issuer that retains a sizable role in the lending space through its affiliated operation, Tether Lending. One spot behind is Galaxy Digital, another player with one foot in the traditional finance world and one foot in the crypto world. Following these two behemoths are two still-relevant crypto exchanges, Ledn and Coinbase. The latter pair even amounts to somewhat of a return to exchange territory among these top ten. Still, both Ledn and Coinbase have shrunk their loan books from 2024’s previous peaks. Most elements of the lending space continue to be very much under the radar. In spite of their efforts, the most recent numbers reveal exactly how much the CeFi lending model has been pulled back. This was a part of the crypto industry that was really quite vivacious, and it was a part that was growing quite rapidly if you looked at it from any angle, whether it was revenue, profit, or just the number of people they were serving. But then we had a bunch of these big high-profile collapses that happened in 2022 and 2023. how big is the crypto lending market? no one has ever really known now we do based on reviews of public filings, bankruptcy documents, and voluntary disclosures from active lenders, the combined CeFi loan book size at YE 2024 was $11.2bn, down 68% from the 2022 ATH of $34.8bn pic.twitter.com/SDceeHxfom — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) April 14, 2025 This retrenchment has opened the door for DeFi to assert itself as the new foundation of crypto lending. The DeFi lending market, by contrast, has grown steadily and now holds a commanding lead. When combined, the total outstanding crypto loans across both CeFi and DeFi platforms are estimated to be around $30 billion. However, over 60% of that amount—more than $18 billion—is now accounted for by DeFi protocols, according to data compiled from on-chain analytics and lending dashboards. Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, and similar decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms have profited from something very basic: their transparency. By virtue of being built on top of public blockchains, these lending protocols are simultaneously open to everyone, in real time, to see what is happening inside them. Unlike traditional banks and even many central business models in crypto, DeFi lending protocols don’t operate in a black box. That’s a pro. (Some would argue it’s a fundamental necessity for any business calling itself decentralized.) Decentralization isn’t a magic wand that protects you from dumb decisions. At the same time, it’s not totally obvious that letting everyone see exactly what’s happening in a lending protocol at any given moment is a good business model. Additionally, when the collateralized debt positions (CDPs) from stablecoin protocols like MakerDAO’s DAI are included, the total amount of credit provided on-chain by decentralized systems grows to over $35 billion. This in turn strengthens and further confirms the appearance of decentralized systems as the source of on-chain credit. CDP-backed stablecoins represent a growing demand for on-chain leverage and debt tools that do not rely on centralized intermediary institutions. These tools are especially popular among advanced users of DeFi (decentralized finance) and requesters of liquidity, such as DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations). They favor them because they offer ways of obtaining liquid assets without the risk of having a counterparty who might become illiquid or insolvent. Transparency vs. Opacity: A Defining Divide One of the most stubborn differences between DeFi and CeFi is transparency. DeFi is inherently open, with data and smart contracts visible to all. CeFi, by contrast, is largely opaque. Much of the data available on CeFi lending is from voluntary disclosures, public filings, and court-supervised bankruptcy proceedings. Because of this, it’s very hard for anyone to get an accurate and up-to-date picture of risk and exposure. The crypto community has been asking for more transparency and better auditing standards from centralized platforms. The implosion of firms like Celsius, BlockFi, and Voyager this past year has only intensified this demand. Meanwhile, DeFi platforms are seen as much more resilient because their operations are open and transparent. If a DeFi platform is operating “under stress,” the community will likely know about it and be able to respond quickly. DeFi is fundamentally community-based and user-stabilized. The future of crypto lending is becoming more and more about decentralization. Risk transparency, programmatic enforcement, and composability have made DeFi the go-to architecture for retail and institutional users who want to access the crypto credit markets. These three elements are not just ideals within the DeFi space; they’re largely what render DeFi usable and reliable. By the end of 2025, CeFi will be an expired concept—it will be gone, while DeFi will exist, possibly with more users than now, and the number of crypto users in general will have grown as well. CeFi’s shriveling has been so rapid that it seems to be possibly history’s first business model that has been put into a coffin by a federal regulatory agency.

In a note published Tuesday, David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, said several key indicators are flashing red. Both Bitcoin and the Coinbase COIN50 index have fallen below their 200-day moving averages, a level many traders view as a dividing line between bullish and bearish trends. Altcoin Market Shrinks Sharply, While Venture Capital Fails to Rebound The broader crypto market is already showing signs of strain. Excluding Bitcoin, the total crypto market cap has fallen to $950b, down 41% from a peak of $1.6 trillion in Dec. 2024. That valuation is lower than levels seen during most of the August 2021 to April 2022 period. How Do You Define a Crypto Bear Market? Several converging signals may be pointing to the start of a new “crypto winter” as some extreme negative sentiment has set in due to the onset of global tariffs and the potential for further escalations. Here's one methodology to track… pic.twitter.com/hXEJwJ2sWx — David Duong (@Dav1dDuong) April 15, 2025 At the same time, venture capital investment, while slightly improved from late 2024, remains 50 to 60 percent below the highs seen during the 2021-2022 bull cycle. Coinbase Cites Tariffs and Tightening as Key Drivers of Market Paralysis According to Coinbase, these declines are being compounded by macroeconomic headwinds. Global tariff escalation and prolonged fiscal tightening have curbed investor appetite for risk, freezing capital flows into altcoins and early-stage blockchain projects. Duong said this has made the investment environment “paralysed,” with traditional and digital assets alike under pressure. Image Source: Coinbase Research “We think this warrants taking a defensive stance on risk for the time being,” Duong wrote, adding that the market may find its floor between mid-to-late Q2 of 2025, potentially setting the stage for a recovery in the second half of the year. Crypto Slump Resembles 2022 Crash, Yet Rebound May Follow Soon While the report did not use the term “crypto winter” lightly, the signals mirror conditions seen during the last major market contraction, which followed the collapse of several large crypto firms and wiped out nearly $2 trillion in value over 18 months. The current market, though less chaotic, shows similar signs of liquidity stress and investor fatigue. Still, Coinbase remains cautiously optimistic. The research team believes a tactical approach will be essential, as sentiment could shift quickly once external pressures ease. “When the sentiment finally resets, it’s likely to happen rather quickly,” Duong noted, pointing to the potential for a more constructive second half of 2025.

43397224,https://nulltx.com/?p=148010,1744784404,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Signals: Key Narratives and Tokens Accumulated Over the Past 24 Hours,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-signals-key-narratives-and-tokens-accumulated-over-the-past-24-hours/,"In the rapidly changing business of crypto trading, smart money wallets—that is, those belonging to well-informed, data-driven investors—are proving an increasingly reliable indicator of what kinds of narratives are bubbling up and what sorts of market trends are on the verge of emerging. In just the past 24 hours, several smart money wallets have been seen amassing all sorts of tokens across all kinds of sectors—from gold-backed tokens and artificial intelligence infrastructure to the latest meme tokens and various RWA (real-world asset) tokenization schemes. The movements offer a glimpse into what sorts of themes are resonating most with investors in the current market. Strategic Accumulation Across Narratives Recent on-chain data shows that smart money has been focusing on four main narratives: gold-backed tokens, AI agents, meme coins, and real-world assets. There were 26 different smart money wallets that participated in accumulation across these thematic sectors. The AI agent account seems to be taking the lead, with 10 wallets involved in the purchase of decentralized AIs. The meme token movement is almost neck and neck with the AI account, as 7 wallets make their way toward meme tokens. Meanwhile, 5 wallets have taken a liking to gold-backed tokens, and 4 wallets are probing the RWA accumulation narrative. These changes imply not just speculative activity but also a more comprehensive strategic vision on the part of experienced market players. It seems they are repositioning in anticipation of shifts in narrative momentum or in response to forthcoming catalysts. Paxos Gold ($PAXG): A Flight to Stability One of the most exciting developments was the purchase of $PAXG, the gold-backed token issued by Paxos. One smart wallet bought over $100,000 worth of the asset, signaling renewed interest in crypto tied to traditional stores of value. With a market cap of $739 million, $PAXG is one of the most established and trusted gold-backed digital assets available. The surge may be linked to its recent addition to Bithumb, a major South Korean exchange, according to @CobakOfficial. This could be seen as a sign that global demand is rising for real-world commodities in tokenized form—especially since investors appear to be looking for hedging instruments in the face of economic tinder that could ignite a downturn. Heurist ($HEU): Betting on AI Infrastructure Artificial intelligence remains a captivating and swiftly expanding sector in the crypto ecosystem, and this has appeared in the behavior of smart money. Two wallets were noticed gathering $HEU, the native token of Heurist—a platform dedicated to constructing infrastructure for autonomous AI agents. Heurist has a market cap of just $4.8 million, meaning it is very early in its growth cycle. Yet the project has been getting some attention lately, mainly through its Twitter account, @heurist_ai. Several wallets notorious for identifying early-stage projects have recently accumulated roughly $18,000 worth of HEUR. While that may seem like a drop in the bucket, especially when you consider that there are some 190,000 HEUR in circulation as of this writing, even a modest buy can have a marked impact on liquidity and price, given that HEUR faces both headwinds (low liquidity) and tailwinds (high volatility) that are typical of small-cap tokens. Memecoin ($MEME): Community-Driven Hype Continues The resilient memecoin narrative is ever alive and well, with $memecoin seeing active accumulation by four smart money wallets to the tune of $92,000. With a market cap of $8.3 million, $memecoin is emerging as a community darling in the new generation of meme tokens. Memecoins may be connected to the @gmonadofficial community’s ongoing initiatives, such as giveaways and engagement campaigns, which appear to be quite effective in driving sentiment and loyalty. The memecoin community may be the most niche in crypto, but it is intensely loyal—three times as many people on Twitter hold a memecoin compared to the average Twitter user. This is their way of giving back to a community that has given them so much. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: Gold-backed tokens (5 wallets) AI agents (10 wallets) MEME (7 wallets) Real-world assets (RWA) (4 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $PAXG -> Paxos Gold is… pic.twitter.com/xCMYSqjloh — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) April 15, 2025 Zodor ($ZOD): Quiet Confidence in Real-World Asset Tokenization A less audible but equally significant development stemmed from the RWA sphere, where $ZOD, the native token of Zodor, witnessed $7,600 in accumulations across three smart money wallets. Even though this sum is modest, the interest it represents is starting to gain some notice, and it signals something that’s been building for a while now: the RWA-to-token trend is starting to pick up some serious steam. Zodor, with a market cap of only $289,000, is one of the micro-cap players in this field. Yet its focus on real-world growth, coupled with its co-ownership models, makes it seem like a viable candidate for getting early believers. The company’s strategy, as outlined by @ZodorRWA, includes building a comprehensive RWA ecosystem that stands a good chance of benefitting from the future institutional push towards tokenized, physical assets. Conclusion: Where Smart Capital Is Moving Though the figures for each individual accumulation may differ in magnitude, the basic patterns grant us the kind of clear insight that we private citizens—sheltered from the omnipresent gaze of state surveillance—enjoy. And what does all this tell us? From the safety of gold-backed tokens to the innovation of AI and the speculative frenzy of meme culture, smart money is clearly courting multiple narratives with long-term potential. For traders and investors observing the markets, these actions may act as early indicators of sectors that are picking up steam. As is always the case, trades driven by narrative can be quite unstable, but tracking the consistently outperforming wallets can lead to identifying opportunities before the wider market takes notice.

On the daily chart, price action hovers between the middle and upper Bollinger Bands, suggesting a slight bullish tilt within a range-bound market. The MACD has turned positive, with green histogram bars and a bullish crossover—indicating possible upward momentum. Yet, Bitcoin’s inability to close above $87,000 following a bounce from $77,900 signals hesitation as volatility begins to compress. Rounded Bottom Pattern Signals Slow Accumulation BTC continues forming a rounded bottom structure on the daily timeframe—an accumulation pattern with bullish implications if confirmed. A breakout above $87,100, the current neckline, would suggest strength and open targets toward $92,000–$95,000. However, repeated upper wicks hint at lingering sell pressure. Unless the price secures a decisive close above resistance, downside risk toward the $80,000 zone still looms. Horizontal Channel Defines Four-Hour Price Action The 4-hour chart shows BTC consolidating within a narrow range between $81,200 and $87,100. This tight structure follows March’s strong recovery from sub-$70,000 levels. Although the price is closer to mid-range, the narrowing Bollinger Bands suggest an imminent breakout. The MACD remains slightly bullish but lacks strong conviction—reflecting weak momentum and a market waiting for a catalyst. Ascending Triangle Suggests Potential Bullish Continuation A classic ascending triangle has emerged on the 4-hour chart, defined by higher lows converging beneath resistance at $87,100. This pattern implies accumulation and brewing breakout energy. If bulls maintain higher lows and volume increases, a breakout could be swift and decisive. Conversely, a breakdown below the $82,500–$81,200 support zone would invalidate the pattern and expose BTC to $78,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bearish Flag Forms on the Lower Timeframe On the 15-minute chart, BTC is forming a bearish flag just below the $84,200 local peak. Price action hugs the lower Bollinger Band, and the MACD is flat with weak red histogram bars—suggesting fading momentum. Short-term traders should stay cautious as intraday dips remain likely before any renewed attempt to move higher. Key Levels: $87K Resistance, $81K Support Immediate resistance is seen at $84,200, with major resistance at $87,100. A confirmed breakout above this level could spark a push toward $90,000 or higher. Meanwhile, support sits at $82,500 and $81,200. A drop below these could lead to a further decline toward $78,000. Tight Bollinger Bands across timeframes highlight growing breakout pressure. Prediction For Today Bitcoin remains range-bound but coiled for movement. Daily and 4-hour charts reflect mild bullish momentum , while the 15-minute chart leans neutral to slightly bearish. The expected trading range is $81,200 to $87,100. A breakout from this band will likely dictate the market tone heading into the rest of the week.

Pseudonymous crypto strategist Dave the Wave tells his 149,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart. An inverse head-and-shoulders structure is traditionally viewed as a bullish reversal pattern, as it suggests that buyers are no longer waiting for the price to revisit recent lows before accumulating the asset. Dave the Wave sees Bitcoin rallying close to $89,000 before dropping to support at $77,000 and rallying to a new all-time high above $110,000. “With a push through the first line of resistance, the neckline of a possible BTC reverse [head and shoulders] would be formed… a great basing pattern.” Source: Dave the Wave/X He also believes that Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend is intact, even though market sentiment for BTC has flipped bearish. He highlights that BTC’s price action suggests that the correction is almost over. “The year rolls on, and so does the chart. Any objective observer of the chart, unfamiliar with the market and not being caught up in it, will no doubt wonder what the panic is regarding price [yes, people can be emotionally detached toward Bitcoin]. Their initial impression of the chart would be a visual one, seeing a regular series of moves and corrections, and they would most likely incline toward seeing the price currently at the end of yet another correction. And yet most of those more closely tied to the market, watching its every daily move in price, are currently in a state of near panic. The explanation of this phenomenon, in my opinion, is collective/crowd sentiment on the one hand, and ‘money illusion’ on the other.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $83,500.

Expert Clears the Air,https://timestabloid.com/will-rlusd-take-some-of-xrps-use-away-expert-clears-the-air/,"WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman), a recognized voice in the crypto space, recently addressed the evolving conversation around Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin RLUSD and its relationship to XRP on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). In a post on X, he explained that while stablecoins like RLUSD may handle direct transfers more efficiently due to their price stability and guaranteed backing, they do not replace XRP’s essential role in the XRPL ecosystem. The discussions of #RLUSD and #XRP are too flat. Will stablecoins take some of #XRP 's use away? Maybe, for direct transfers. Stables are less volatile and guaranteed. And no, XRPL burn fees aren't significant, but XRP always plays a key role via autobridging. If you don't… — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) April 14, 2025 He emphasized that XRP is critical through the ledger’s built-in auto-bridging functionality. According to his explanation, XRP is automatically used when two tokens lack a direct trading pair. This allows the system to bridge transactions using XRP to maintain liquidity and ensure execution. Auto-bridging on the XRPL Auto-bridging is more than an interesting theoretical feature. It operates behind the scenes when pathfinding mechanisms determine that using XRP as an intermediary yields better exchange rates than direct trading. This means that even when users transact with RLUSD or other tokens, XRP can still serve as a liquidity intermediary without the user explicitly holding it. WrathofKahneman highlighted that while RLUSD may become a trusted, low-cost stablecoin issued by Ripple, XRP underpins broader system efficiency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Perspectives and Functional Reality In response to the post, Daniel Keller, CEO of Eminence, challenged the notion that auto-bridging holds practical value, stating, “There is no need for auto bridging. I can onramp 1 to 1 if I want to.” He acknowledged the theoretical value of XRP bridging illiquid tokens but questioned its utility in practice, arguing that real-world usage remains limited unless the assets involved gain meaningful market traction. WrathofKahneman invited further clarification, and Keller elaborated by giving an example of two obscure tokens lacking a direct pair. In that case, XRP could bridge the gap, allowing each party to transact in their chosen asset. While he admitted this mechanism was “a genius idea,” he doubted its relevance until such tokens achieved significant value. He added that if markets existed for those pairs, there would be no need for XRP to step in. While experts have revealed that RLUSD will not limit XRP , Keller strongly argues for the asset’s reduced role in the ecosystem. However, the XRPL documentation confirms that auto-bridging is an active feature. Offers submitted to the decentralized exchange can utilize synthetic order books created through XRP. Suppose no sufficient direct path exists between two tokens. In that case, the system may convert one into XRP and then into the desired asset to optimize rates, making XRP’s position integral to the working of the XRPL .

On-chain data shows $4.6M in USDC were taken out and bridged to Ethereum. The developer behind Official Trump (TRUMP) drained some of the token’s liquidity. A wallet linked to the project launch took 4.6M USDC after removing liquidity in the past day. The selling came just a day before the first unlock for TRUMP, which will release another 20% of the supply. The developer’s wallet still holds over 15.3M TRUMP. Despite this, the developer’s involvement renewed expectations that the upcoming unlocks may increase selling pressure. In addition to whale trades, the DEX liquidity pool is facing ongoing selling pressure, with 706 on-chain wallets selling and only 456 buying. Based on volumes, however, most of the sellers are smaller wallets, while buying comes from whales with slightly bigger orders. TRUMP is seen as a risky trade, which may lead to unexpected rallies. In the past day, the top TRUMP seller whale continued to take profits, locking a total of $28M in net earnings. TRUMP developer drain liquidity from Solana to Ethereum After taking $4.6M from the liquidity pool, the developer immediately bridged the funds to Ethereum. The USDC stablecoins were then moved to an address identified as Coinbase Prime. The move coincides with the Trump family dedication to the Ethereum ecosystem, through their World Liberty Fi fund. The TRUMP token developer bridged the USDC from Solana and sent them to an address linked to Coinbase Prime. | Source: Etherscan USDC is the preferred store of value for World Liberty Fi, though it is unknown if the profits from TRUMP are lumped with the earnings from the DeFi project. Currently, the Trump family holds at least 25.43M USDC as its main storage, based on wallets identified by Arkham Intelligence. TRUMP still carries over $327.6M in liquidity for its main decentralized pair, remaining one of the most funded meme tokens. This would also allow the team and early investors to continue extracting value without causing major panic. After the sale, the token traded at $7.95, with minor slippage for the past day. The TRUMP meme token does not react to timely news or social media trends. The asset mostly moves based on the influence of trader whales, who are often taking profits. In the past day, two prominent whales bought TRUMP for $5M USDC. Both of the identified wallets later sold the tokens for a small profit, as the token bounced from lows of $7.80. Celebrity memes lag behind overall market recovery The recent liquidity removal is similar to the behavior of Melania (MELANIA) team wallets. The token was used to extract value by creating, then draining liquidity pools. After the recent liquidity operations, MELANIA lost more ground, sinking to $0.42. The presence of insiders for celebrity tokens has made investors more wary. The TRUMP rally in the past week is much weaker compared to the overall recovery of Solana meme assets. TRUMP only recovered by 6%, while other Solana tokens easily gained over 22%. TRUMP is still bundled with Solana memes, remaining the token with the biggest market capitalization. However, the asset is not backed by a community or a cult, despite riffing off Trump’s personality. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Sự bật dậy này được thúc đẩy bởi làn sóng lạc quan vĩ mô sau khi Tổng thống Mỹ Donald Trump tuyên bố tạm ngừng áp thuế mới trong 90 ngày, giúp giảm căng thẳng thương mại và khơi dậy khẩu vị rủi ro của nhà đầu tư. Đặc biệt, sự phục hồi này không dựa vào các vị thế đòn bẩy phái sinh mà đến từ nhu cầu thực tế trên thị trường giao ngay—chứng tỏ niềm tin mạnh mẽ của người mua. Kết thúc tuần, Bitcoin tăng 6,67%, kéo dài đà tăng 15% từ đáy và cho thấy đợt điều chỉnh hiện tại—kéo dài 83 ngày với mức giảm 31%—vẫn nằm trong phạm vi bình thường của các đợt thoái lui giữa chu kỳ trong các thị trường bò trước đây. Giá Bitcoin và Các Đợt Điều Chỉnh Hàng Năm (Nguồn: CryptoQuant) Dữ liệu về khối lượng tích lũy trên các sàn giao dịch lớn cho thấy lực mua mạnh mẽ liên tục, nhưng giá vẫn bị kẹt trong khoảng 75,000 − 85,000. Sự phân kỳ này gợi ý về khả năng bứt phá tăng nếu nguồn cung tiếp tục suy giảm. Tuy nhiên, một đợt điều chỉnh ngắn hạn vào đầu tuần này là điều được dự đoán , chủ yếu do chốt lời. Phản ứng với đợt giảm này — liệu người mua có tiếp tục hấp thụ nguồn cung hay không — sẽ quyết định xem Bitcoin có tiến tới mốc $90,000 hay không. Dữ liệu on-chain cũng ủng hộ xu hướng tích cực , khi lượng tích lũy của các nhà đầu tư dài hạn lần đầu tiên chuyển sang trạng thái tích cực kể từ tháng 12. Dù tín hiệu ban đầu khá khả quan, sức mạnh của xu hướng vẫn phụ thuộc vào cách nhu cầu giữ vững trong bất kỳ đợt suy yếu ngắn hạn nào. Tháng 3 mang lại một chút thở phào khi chỉ số giá tiêu dùng (CPI) giảm nhẹ nhờ giá năng lượng và vận tải sụt giảm. Tuy nhiên, dưới lớp vỏ bình yên tạm thời này là cơn bão đang âm thầm hình thành: các mức thuế quan mới, đặc biệt là những chính sách gần đây của Mỹ, đang chuẩn bị đẩy giá cả tăng cao trong những tháng tới. Lạm phát cốt lõi, đặc biệt trong lĩnh vực dịch vụ và nhà ở, vẫn cao ngất ngưởng , củng cố lo ngại rằng áp lực lạm phát chưa hề nguội. Bối cảnh lạm phát bất ổn này trùng hợp với sự hỗn loạn ngày càng tăng trên thị trường tài chính. Chính sách thương mại thay đổi chóng mặt—ban đầu tăng thuế, sau đó vội vàng rút lại—đã làm lung lay niềm tin toàn cầu vào định hướng kinh tế Mỹ, gây ra dòng vốn chảy khỏi tài sản Mỹ . Chỉ số Đồng Đô La Mỹ (DXY) (Nguồn: Tradingview) Đồng đô la suy yếu mạnh, lợi suất trái phiếu kho bạc tăng vọt , và biến động thị trường tăng cao , cho thấy một môi trường ngày càng căng thẳng. Ngay cả đợt tăng ngắn hạn của S&P 500 cũng không đủ để xoa dịu nỗi sợ hãi, khi các nhà đầu tư vẫn vật lộn với hậu quả của các chính sách thất thường. Trong khi đó, tâm lý người tiêu dùng đang lao dốc. Khảo sát mới nhất từ Đại học Michigan cho thấy sự sụt giảm nghiêm trọng về niềm tin và kỳ vọng lạm phát tăng vọt lên mức cao nhất kể từ đầu thập niên 1980. Các hộ gia đình đang chuẩn bị tinh thần cho lạm phát dai dẳng và thất nghiệp tăng cao, cắt giảm chi tiêu và đề phòng khó khăn kinh tế. Sự suy giảm niềm tin tài chính và tiêu dùng này cho thấy nền kinh tế Mỹ đang đứng trước bước ngoặt quan trọng. Khi nỗi lo lạm phát đối đầu với tăng trưởng chậm lại, Fed rơi vào thế khó : có thể phải trì hoãn việc cắt giảm lãi suất trong khi cố gắng cân bằng giữa kiểm soát lạm phát và tránh suy thoái toàn diện. Sự kết hợp giữa lạm phát do thuế quan, biến động thị trường do chính sách và niềm tin tiêu dùng sụp đổ vẽ nên một bức tranh u ám: trừ khi sự rõ ràng và ổn định sớm quay lại, nền kinh tế Mỹ có thể đang bước vào giai đoạn khó khăn nhất kể từ đại dịch. Trong tuần qua, Galaxy Digital đã nhận được sự chấp thuận từ SEC để tái cơ cấu tại Delaware và niêm yết trên Nasdaq với mã cổ phiếu GLXY. Đây là một động thái chiến lược, đánh dấu sự chấp nhận ngày càng tăng của thị trường vốn truyền thống Mỹ đối với các khoản đầu tư tài sản kỹ thuật số. Tuy nhiên, mặt tối của sự cường điệu không kiểm soát cũng được phơi bày. Tại Argentina, một cuộc điều tra quốc hội đã được khởi động về Libra token—một memecoin trên Solana mà Tổng thống Javier Milei từng công khai ủng hộ trước khi giá trị của nó sụp đổ hơn 90%, xóa sổ hàng tỷ USD vốn hóa thị trường. Ban đầu là biểu tượng ủng hộ đổi mới, nhưng nhanh chóng biến thành bê bối, với các nghị sĩ yêu cầu giải trình và thậm chí kêu gọi luận tội Milei. Ở Mỹ, Bắc Carolina đang đi theo hướng thận trọng nhưng lạc quan bằng cách giới thiệu dự luật Digital Asset Freedom Act , cho phép một số loại tiền mã hóa được sử dụng để nộp thuế và giao dịch—với điều kiện chúng đáp ứng các tiêu chuẩn nghiêm ngặt về thanh khoản, phi tập trung và tính toàn vẹn thị trường dài hạn. Với những diễn biến đa chiều—từ sự chấp nhận thể chế đến bê bối chính trị—bức tranh crypto tiếp tục phát triển như một công cụ chuyển đổi và cũng là tấm gương phản chiếu những thách thức của sự gián đoạn. Với những diễn biến đa chiều—từ việc chấp nhận tổ chức đến những hệ quả chính trị—thế giới crypto tiếp tục phát triển như một công cụ chuyển đổi đồng thời phản ánh những thách thức của sự phá cách. Bitcoin đang chứng kiến sự phục hồi mạnh mẽ với niềm tin từ người mua thực tế, nhưng thị trường vẫn cần vượt qua các đợt điều chỉnh ngắn hạn để xác nhận xu hướng tăng. Trong khi đó, tình hình kinh tế vĩ mô toàn cầu đang đầy biến động, đặt ra nhiều thách thức cho cả thị trường truyền thống và crypto. Thế giới tiền mã hóa tiếp tục là điểm sáng chuyển đổi, nhưng cũng là tấm gương phản chiếu những rủi ro và bài học từ sự đổi mới.

Profit-Taking and Recession Fears Hit Prices appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin and other major cryptos like Ether, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin and Cardano also dropped over 3% early Wednesday as traders booked profits after Tuesday’s price rally. The total crypto market cap fell over 4% in the past 24 hours to $2.73 trillion as per data from Coingecko . Bitcoin was down to $83,600 from $84,200 while Ether and Cardano fell as much as 5%. XRP continued to drop and it may further face more downturns. However, the XRP ETF filing by ProShares was some positive news as it plans to launch it on April 30. BNB is also down around 2%, currently trading at $578. Investors Still Cautious The movements in crypto market shows that investors are still cautious and avoiding risk due to global economic issues and upcoming regulatory changes. According to data from CryptoQuant, daily sales by large Bitcoin investors have now dropped from 800,000 BTC in late February to about 300,000 BTC now, as they have already sold most of their coins at loss. Analyst Ali Martinez highlighted in a recent post that whales have been taking profits during the recent rally, offloading over 29,000 BTC since April 9. In a recent X post he also shared that over $600 million in short positions could get liquidated if Bitcoin bounces back to $86,900. There has been a drop in accumulation by large investors and their holdings have declined by about 30K BTC over the past week. Meanwhile, major cryptocurrencies slumped as Hong Kong stocks fell 2.9% despite strong growth in China’s economy. The ongoing tariff troubles continue to push traders to avoid risk assets, impacting crypto markets. Amid market uncertainty, stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) have held their ground. Tether is currently trading at $0.9999, with a market cap of $144.56 billion. While USDC is currently trading at $1. Stablecoins are becoming essential for liquidity and security during volatile times in crypto like now. Nvidia Drop Impacts Crypto Prices Markets saw a downturn on Tuesday evening after Nvidia Stock dropped, which was triggered due to a $5.5 billion charge as a result of US government’s decision to ban the company from selling H20 chip sales to China. As a result, Bitcoin fell to $83,600 while XRP and Cardano followed suit falling over 2% and 4% respectively. Besides, AI coins also struggled as Nvidia’s stock dropped 8% to $89.10. The company revealed that it expects to loose $5.5 billion in Q1 due to restrictions on its H20 chip exports to China. Markets Await Powell’s Speech Amid Rate Cut Speculation Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to speak today about the US economy as the markets watch closely for any signs of a potential rate cut sooner than expected due to the ongoing tariff concerns and the rising concerns about a recession. Research suggests that the trade war and Trump tariffs might lead to lower inflation which may give opportunity to Fed to cut rates. There are rising fears of recession. Although some think that markets have already priced in the risks, the worst may still not be over, claim analysts. Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralised asset is rising amid traditional volatility. However, Trump’s policies could help drive Bitcoin gains although market risks remain high. Coinbase’s recent report shows that the crypto markets excluding Bitcoin have seen a drop of 41% from its December peak. Besides, VC investment in crypto is also down by 50-60% from 2021-22 highs. However, it predics that the crypto market will recover in Q3 after hitting its lowest point by mid-to-late Q2 2025.

MUTM token pre-sale has become successful by attracting 409 million dollar purchases and expending $6.8 million to earn 8,300 token holders. Current MUTM presale phase at $0.025 attracts strong investor interest as the price will rise to $0.03 during Phase 5. Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself from Solana network through decentralized lending features that provide useful application value thus anticipating future market performance. Numerous market predictions exist in the crypto sector because this particular token attracts intense market discussion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Ignites Demand The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 4 presale maintains its fast sales velocity at its present market price of $0.025. During its current presale phase people who buy MUTM can expect their investment to rise 20% in value until phase 5 reaches $0.03. Tokenomics show buyers an attractive opportunity because the initial launching price will be $0.06 allowing them to earn 140% profit. The market presages MUTM token to achieve $2.50 value following launch and suggests a profit potential exceeding 9900 percent for incoming investors. The team works to update security measures at the same time as Certik performs smart contract verification tests that will be made available on social networks soon. Buyers rush to obtain tokens because their low supply continues to reduce their number in the market. Transitioning to community perks, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rolling out a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders. Those securing a spot earn bonus tokens, a clever nudge to hold tight. Unlike Solana’s broader ecosystem play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) focuses on lending precision, making it a magnet for yield-seekers. Phase 4’s low entry price is a fleeting chance, and the crypto market is alive with FOMO as investors scramble. Solana’s 2021 Run Fades in Comparison The SOL token from Solana experienced explosive growth in 2021 because developers and fast-processing became prevalent in its ecosystem. The massive 12,000% price increase of the asset occurred without the benefits that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings to the Solana ecosystem at present. The sharp price increase of Solana caused early investors to experience fluctuating value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) builds its market ascendancy through pre-sale phases along with loan incentives to maintain stability. The $0.025 current price of Solana seems like a solid deal when you compare its values to previous Solana prices. Investors now choose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) above other cryptocurrencies because its strategy of reaching gains is straightforward. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Sparks Urgency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes new expectations in the crypto world. The early adopters of Mutuum Finance benefit most from the presale format because phase 4 sells at $0.025 until the next price increase to $0.03 takes effect. The 140% initial stake within a $0.06 entry point has solidified but a forecasted ending price of $2.50 will energize the entire crypto marketplace. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) focuses exclusively on lending effectiveness since it already attracted 8,400 investors while Solana’s platform remains expansive. Leaderboard rewards play a motivational function by creating a competitive dynamic for buyers to secure allocations in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Investors are circling. The upcoming phase 5 of MUTM stands as an imminent release after the current phase 4 period.

But the signs were there—tiny price, growing community, unexplored utility, and an early group of believers. Now in 2025, some investors are looking for that moment again. And while no two projects are ever the same, the energy building behind MAGACOINFINANCE feels familiar. While large-cap assets like XRP , ETH , Chainlink (LINK) , and SUI continue to deliver utility and long-term value, the traders seeking exponential growth are looking beneath the surface. That’s where MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious traction. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! MAGACOINFINANCE – The Pre-Discovery Stage Investors Love Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE trades at just $0.0002908 —and the project has already locked in a listing target of $0.007 , offering early investors a clean 25x ROI potential. But numbers only tell part of the story. What’s capturing attention is the pattern: a growing retail base, daily wallet inflow, rising social activity—and a price level that still lets investors go big from a small base. This is the early calm that often precedes the storm. It’s where conviction is formed—well before headlines catch on. Projects like these don’t knock twice.

Bitcoin Binance Net Taker Volume Is Currently At A Notable Positive Level As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, Bitcoin taker buyers have dominated the Binance platform during the last few days. The indicator of relevance here is the “Net Taker Volume,” which measures the difference between the taker buyer and taker seller volume on any given centralized exchange. When the indicator has a positive value, it means the taker buyers are outweighing the taker sellers on the platform. This kind of trend implies a bullish sentiment is shared by the majority of the users. Related Reading: Behind The Mantra (OM) Collapse: Glassnode Reveals The On-Chain Side Of Things On the other hand, the metric being under the zero mark suggests a bearish mentality is dominant on the exchange as the short volume is larger than the long volume. Now, below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 7-hour moving average (MA) Bitcoin Net Taker Volume for the largest exchange in the cryptocurrency sector: Binance. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume has mostly remained inside the positive territory since April 11th. The metric’s green values haven’t been small, either, which suggests the futures users have been placing some aggressive bullish bets on the platform. The shift toward the positive sentiment on the exchange has come as BTC has been making recovery following the news of the 90-day pause on the tariffs for most countries. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to move in the direction that the crowd least expects, so this bullish mood may actually prove to be a bad sign for the recovery rally. It only remains to be seen, though, whether a top would now be hit or if the bet of these investors would pay off. In some other news, the 30-day of the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio has hit the lowest level in six months, as an analyst has pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that basically tells us about the profit-loss status of the Bitcoin investors. From the chart, it’s apparent that the 30-day value of this metric has plunged recently, suggesting holder profitability has declined.

As such, it’s possible that this trend could once again prove to be bullish for the cryptocurrency. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $85,800, up more than 8% in the last seven days.

Dubbed “Liberation Day,” the policy set a baseline 10% tariff on all foreign goods, with a massive 145% rate on products from China. The move was framed as a way to fix long-standing trade imbalances and protect national industries. China responded almost immediately. Tariffs on US imports jumped to 125% , and restrictions were introduced on the export of rare earth elements, materials essential to global manufacturing. Within days, trade between the world’s two largest economies had slowed dramatically. The markets didn’t take it well. The S&P 500 dropped 15% in under a week. The Nasdaq was down nearly 20% for the year by April 7. Investors were rattled by the scale of the escalation and the potential knock-on effects on global growth. Crypto didn’t stay quiet either. As stocks fell and uncertainty spread, Bitcoin ( BTC ) saw a surge in trading volumes, with many turning to digital assets as a hedge. What follows is a closer look at how these trade tensions hit financial markets, starting with traditional stocks and then crypto. Trade wars' impact on stocks Markets don’t like surprises – and they really don’t like trade wars. When the US announced its 145% tariff on Chinese imports in April 2025, the response from Wall Street was swift and brutal. The S&P 500 tanked more than 10% in just two days. Tech stocks took it even harder, with the Nasdaq shedding nearly 20% since the start of the year. Still, if you’ve watched the markets through past trade fights, this was all pretty familiar. In 2018–19, during the first round of US-China tariff battles , every tweet about negotiations or new duties sent stocks whipsawing. And if you zoom way out, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 is one of the earliest and most notorious examples as tariffs piled up, global trade shrank and the Great Depression got worse. So why do stocks get hit so hard? A few reasons. Tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, which squeezes profit margins for companies that rely on international supply chains. When a carmaker or electronics brand has to pay more for components, that cost either eats into profits or gets passed on to customers. Either way, it’s bad news for earnings, and earnings are what drive stock valuations . There’s also the fear factor. Trade wars inject a lot of uncertainty into the economy. Will more tariffs follow? Will other countries retaliate? That kind of unpredictability causes companies to delay investments and hiring, while consumers may start pulling back on spending. This shows up as increased market volatility, often tracked by the VIX , Wall Street’s so-called “fear index,” which tends to spike in times like this. Central banks sometimes try to cushion the blow by tweaking interest rates or injecting liquidity. But there’s only so much they can do when the root of the problem is political. Did you know? On April 9, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on new tariffs for most countries. He explained the pause by saying people were getting ""a little bit yippy,"" his way of describing nervousness in the markets. When tariffs hit, crypto takes a punch, then bounces back The tariffs hit crypto, too, but the market recovered just days later, reflecting crypto’s volatile yet responsive nature during global uncertainty. After Trump’s new tariffs were announced, Bitcoin slid to around $76,000. Ethereum and other major tokens followed suit, and around $200 billion was wiped off the total crypto market cap in a few days. Again, this kind of sell-off isn’t unusual. When uncertainty spikes – like during a sudden escalation in global trade tensions – investors tend to play it safe. That means pulling out of more volatile assets, including crypto, and moving into what’s seen as safer ground, like cash or bonds. It’s a classic “risk-off” move. But as you've seen before, crypto doesn’t stay down for long . By mid-April, Bitcoin had bounced back and was trading at just under $85,000. Ether ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ) and other major altcoins also recovered some ground. For many investors, this rebound was a reminder that while crypto is volatile, it’s also increasingly viewed as a valuable hedge, something outside the reach of any government or policy decision. In 2018–19, during an earlier round of US-China tensions, Bitcoin showed similar patterns: short-term drops followed by fast recoveries. And earlier in 2025, new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports triggered a dip that quickly reversed. Stocks, meanwhile, tend to have a tougher time recovering. As of April, the S&P 500 is down nearly 9% for 2025, and the Nasdaq is off more than 13%. There was a brief lift after the US paused some tariffs for 90 days, but overall, the mood in equity markets remains shaky. What trade wars mean for supply chains and consumers The ripple effects of the 2025 trade war are grinding through global supply chains, one industry at a time. From electronics to autos to medicine, the cost of moving goods worldwide is rising. Let’s talk about a few industries in particular. Trade wars' impact on electronics and semiconductors Electronics are at the heart of it. In 2024, the US imported $146 billion of electronics from China. With tariffs on those goods jumping, companies could be looking at an added $182 billion in annual costs if these rates stick around. This is also a problem for consumers. Take Apple, for example. With no lasting exemption for phones, an iPhone 16 Pro Max could climb from $1,199 to over $1,800. Add in uncertainty about future duties on laptops, chips and smart devices, and the entire sector is on edge. Trade wars’ impact on the automotive industry Carmakers are in a similar bind. The US has raised tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles from 25% to more than 100%. And it’s not just the finished cars — batteries, chips, and other parts sourced from China are also caught in the crossfire. For electric vehicle manufacturers, in particular, this is a serious hit. Chinese battery components are essential for many US and European EV brands. With supply chains suddenly tangled in red tape and higher costs, some automakers are pausing production or switching suppliers. Trade wars’ impact on pharmaceuticals Even the healthcare system is feeling it. The US depends heavily on China for key medical supplies and pharmaceutical ingredients. With new tariffs, prices are climbing, and existing shortages are worsening. Industry experts are warning of major disruptions. Everything from common medications to hospital-grade equipment is likely to get more expensive. And in a healthcare system already under pressure, even a small bottleneck can cause big problems down the line. Did you know? European markets are already seeing signs of a spillover. Chinese exporters, locked out of the US by tariffs, are redirecting goods to Europe, especially in tech and consumer goods. Rising tariffs, shaky markets, what’s next? The big picture regarding the 2025 US-China trade war still looks hazy amid real implications for investors, business leaders and policymakers worldwide. Let’s examine the short-, medium- and long-term outlooks. Short-term There’s been a bit of short-term relief . When the US announced exemptions on some tech products – like smartphones and laptops – from the harshest tariffs, markets breathed a sigh of relief. The S&P 500 saw an uptick, and global markets followed suit. Tech-heavy Asian indexes rallied, and European markets, including Germany’s DAX and the UK’s FTSE 100, climbed. Even US bank earnings helped push optimism a bit further. Still, it’s probably temporary. These exemptions are under review, and the bigger trade policy feels like shifting sand. Medium-term Looking ahead a bit further, the risks start to grow. If the trade conflict drags on, it could seriously slow down global growth. JPMorgan recently raised its global recession risk to 60%, and that’s no small thing. Central banks are already weighing their next moves; interest rate adjustments, coordinated actions, and contingency planning are all back on the table. Some voices, like former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, call for a global response similar to what we saw during the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile, businesses are rethinking their supply chains and scrambling to find alternatives, something that’s easier said than done. Long-term You’re seeing a pivot with nations exploring new trade deals and trying to reduce reliance on traditional powerhouses. China, for example, is pushing harder to internationalize the yuan and accelerate its Belt and Road Initiative. Conversely, the US is leaning into domestic manufacturing and trying to reduce its dependence on imports. And the consequences could be massive. The WTO has warned that trade between the US and China could shrink by as much as 80%. That’s a huge shift, considering these two countries account for about 3% of global trade. If that drop materializes, it could rattle the global economy.",trade war,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-16 07:40:00

In a recent post , on-chat data analysis from LookOnChain revealed that developers of the presidential meme coin previously extracted a large chunk of USD Coins ( USDC ) from its liquidity pool, worth $4.6 million. The USDC pile is later bridged to Ethereum ( ETH ) before they were deposited into Coinbase Prime. Coinbase Prime is a brokerage platform that is mainly used for institutional investors. It offers institutional traders a variety of on-chain services including trading, financing, and custody of digital assets. Many traders in the comments section responded to this news by speculating that a big sell-off may be on the way as the team appears to cash out on the token’s liquidity. While it does not indicate a full exit, traders have begun raising concerns about a potential rug pull . “When the dev moves like that, it’s usually one of two things.. exit or reposition. Either way, eyes on the next move,” said one trader. “Trump and dump move,” said another trader.

The bill aimed to authorize the State Treasurer to invest funds from the State General Fund, Revenue Stabilization Fund, and Constitutional Reserve Fund in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other major digital assets (with market caps over $500 billion), including stablecoins. Investments would have been capped at 10% of funds per account, and assets would be held with regulated custodians. The bill also included provisions for using digital asset staking and integrating crypto investment options into state retirement funds. It specified that taxes or fees paid in BTC in must be converted into dollars before being transferred to the state treasury. source: @Bitcoin_Laws You might also like: Oklahoma’s Bitcoin reserve bill passes State House vote amidst BTC price crash The bill was initially introduced to the Oklahoma House of Representatives on Jan. 15 by representative Cody Maynard, who voiced strong support for BTC as a hedge against government overreach and inflation., stating : “Bitcoin represents freedom from bureaucrats printing away our purchasing power. As a decentralized form of money, Bitcoin cannot be manipulated or created by government entities. It is the ultimate store of value for those who believe in financial freedom and sound money principles.” The bill then passed the Government Oversight Committee with a 12–2 vote on Feb. 25 and then the full House with a 77–15 vote on March 24. However, HB1203 faced bipartisan opposition in the latest committee vote on April 14. The six “No” votes came from Senators Todd Gollihare (R), Chuck Hall (R), Brent Howard (R), Julia Kirt (D), Mark Mann (D), and Dave Rader (R). With this vote, Oklahoma exits the Bitcoin Reserve Race, leaving Arizona, New Hampshire , and Texas as leading contenders in the state-level adoption of crypto investment strategies. The bill, originally slated to take effect on Nov. 1 this year, will not move forward.

According to an April 15 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , the firm recorded an unrealized loss of approximately $41.8 million due to changes in the fair value of its Bitcoin portfolio since December 31. As of March 31, Semler held 3,182 BTC valued at around $263.5 million. Bitcoin Drops 12% in Q1, Falls from $93.5K to $82.3K Over the three-month period, Bitcoin’s price declined roughly 12%, falling from $93,500 at the start of January to $82,350 by the end of March. The broader correction from Bitcoin’s all-time high to its recent low below $75,000 on April 7 marks a 32% drop. In addition to its Bitcoin exposure, Semler reported expected revenues of $8.8 to $8.9 million for the quarter, alongside operating losses estimated between $1.3 and $1.5 million. The company also held about $10 million in cash and cash equivalents at the quarter’s close. Despite recent market volatility, Semler remains committed to its Bitcoin strategy. In a statement from November, CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian emphasized the firm’s dual focus on healthcare innovation and Bitcoin acquisition. According to Bitbo data, Semler is currently the twelfth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, surpassing companies like Hong Kong’s Boyaa Interactive. Semler also disclosed it had reached a preliminary agreement to pay nearly $30 million to settle a Department of Justice civil investigation. In a separate SEC filing, the company outlined plans to offer and sell up to $500 million in securities, with a portion of the proceeds intended to fund further Bitcoin purchases. “We may offer and sell securities from time to time… up to an aggregate value of $500,000,000,” the firm stated.

Bitwise reported the combined value of these holdings reached $56.7 billion, based on a Q1 closing price of $82,445 per Bitcoin—representing a 2.2% increase in value. The adoption of Bitcoin has also found momentum statewide in the U.S. According to data from Bitcoin Law, 47 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced across 26 states, with 41 currently active.

Figma, the design software giant, has thrown down the legal gauntlet, sending a cease-and-desist letter to Lovable, a rising star in the AI startup world. And guess what’s at the heart of this clash? The term ‘Dev Mode’. Yes, you heard that right. Figma’s Trademark Claim on ‘Dev Mode’: What’s the Fuss? Figma confirmed to Bitcoin World that they indeed sent the letter to Lovable, urging them to stop using ‘Dev Mode’ for their new feature. Why? Because Figma trademarked ‘Dev Mode’ last year. Now, you might be thinking, ‘Dev Mode’? Isn’t that, like, a super common term? You’d be spot on. ‘Dev mode’ or ‘developer mode’ is practically industry jargon for a setting that unlocks advanced features for programmers. Think of it as an edit mode for code. Consider this: Tech Giants Use It: Apple’s iOS, Google’s Chrome, and Microsoft’s Xbox all have features officially called ‘developer mode’, often shortened to ‘dev mode’. Open Source Staple: Countless open-source projects use ‘dev mode’ as a feature name. Atlassian’s History: Even Atlassian, a major software company, used ‘dev mode’ in their products long before Figma got its trademark. So, it’s a bit like claiming ownership of the word ‘edit’ in the context of software. Figma, however, clarifies that their trademark is specifically for the shortcut ‘Dev Mode’, not the full ‘developer mode’. Still, as some online commentators pointed out, it feels a little like trademarking ‘bug’ to refer to ‘debugging’. Why the Cease and Desist ? Protecting the Brand Why is Figma going after Lovable with a cease and desist letter? Well, trademark law is all about protecting brand identity. If Figma doesn’t defend its ‘Dev Mode’ trademark, the term could become generic, weakening their legal claim. It’s a case of ‘use it or lose it’ in the trademark world. The internet is buzzing with opinions. Some argue that ‘dev mode’ is already generic and shouldn’t have been trademarked in the first place. They suggest Lovable should fight back. But here’s the catch: Legal Battles are Pricey: Taking on a legal fight, especially an international one, is expensive. Lovable, as a young Swedish startup, might find this a daunting prospect. Easier Alternatives Exist: For Lovable, changing the feature name to ‘developer mode’ or something else entirely is a much cheaper and less risky option. Lovable: The AI Startup Challenging Figma with ‘Vibe Coding’ This isn’t just about a trademark squabble; it’s also about competition. Lovable is making waves in the tech world with its ‘vibe coding’ approach. What’s ‘vibe coding’? Imagine describing what you want in a text prompt, and AI builds it – code and all! Lovable’s ‘Dev Mode’ feature, launched recently, allows users to tweak that AI-generated code. Lovable is positioning itself as a direct competitor to Figma, even stating on their homepage that designers can use Lovable to bypass ‘tedious prototyping work in tools like Figma.’ Ouch! Many new startups are embracing this approach, seeing Lovable as a fresh alternative. David vs. Goliath? Figma Cracks Knuckles at Upstart Competitor Figma, valued at a massive $12.5 billion, seems to be flexing its muscles at a smaller, but increasingly noticed competitor. A Figma spokesperson hinted at this competitive aspect, telling Bitcoin World that they haven’t sent similar letters to giants like Microsoft because their products are in ‘a different category of goods and services.’ Essentially, Lovable is seen as a more direct threat. But is ‘vibe coding’ truly a threat to established design tools like Figma? Figma CEO Dylan Field downplayed the idea in a recent conversation with Y Combinator’s Garry Tan. While acknowledging the speed of vibe coding, Field questioned its ability to deliver polished, finished products, not just rapid prototypes. He sees a ‘disconnect’ in vibe coding’s current capabilities, for both design and code. Lovable’s Unfazed Response to the Trademark Threat Interestingly, Lovable co-founder Anton Osika seems unfazed by the legal threat . He shared a copy of the cease-and-desist letter on X with a grinning emoji. Does this signal a willingness to fight, or simply a calm acceptance of the situation? Only time will tell how this tech industry drama unfolds.

Media Network (MEDIA) sank to as low as $1.68 on April 16, cutting its market cap from over $1 million to around $430,000. Trading volume also plunged nearly 85% in the last 24 hours as users rushed to exit. Coinbase pulled the plug on MEDIA on April 15, 2025, at around 2:00 PM ET, halting trading across multiple services, including Coinbase.com (both Simple and Advanced Trade), Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. While users can no longer trade MEDIA on Coinbase, they can still withdraw their tokens to external wallets. According to Coinbase, the delisting followed a routine asset review meant to ensure all tokens met its listing standards. While no specific reason was given, projects often get delisted due to low trading activity, slowed development, or possible regulatory concerns. Coinbase first announced plans to drop MEDIA on April 1, and since then, the token has dropped by 84.5%. From its all-time high of $312.25, MEDIA has lost more than 99% of its value per CoinGecko.

Its official X account, @Media_FDN, has been inactive since August 2024, and there have been no meaningful updates about the Media Network mainnet launch for nearly a year. MEDIA went live on Base in March 2024, but developers have since failed to share any developments or engage with the community. Frustrated users have criticized the team for disappearing post-launch, with many blaming the prolonged silence for the token’s downfall. a whole year and zero updates on anything…im about to dump this trash scam — Neighborhood Crypto Watch (@BlakeH47189) January 28, 2025 Meanwhile, MEDIA isn’t the only token affected by a recent delisting, as Coinbase also suspended trading for Floki, GIGA, and Turbo a day earlier, specifically for New York State residents, all memecoins that saw massive gains following Donald Trump’s election win last year. These delistings come during a shaky time in the market. Trump’s new tariff policies against major trade partners have raised fears of a global trade war, leading to cautious investor behavior and shrinking liquidity across both crypto and traditional markets. What is Media Network? Launched in 2021, Media Network was a blockchain-based project that aimed to decentralize how online content is delivered. It lets users share their internet bandwidth in exchange for MEDIA tokens, creating an open, peer-to-peer system for content delivery. The project was reportedly backed by now-defunct Alameda Research , the crypto trading firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, according to crypto fundraising tracker platform ChainBroker. Alameda was the only listed investor and supported a $1 million public token sale on Raydium’s AcceleRaytor platform at $10 per token. All public sale tokens were unlocked at launch, while tokens for the team and advisors had an 18-month lockup with gradual release after that.

Overall crypto market capitalization fell 3.3% in the past 24 hours, with BTC sliding to nearly $83,500 from a high above $84,200 a day earlier. Ether (ETH) and Cardano’s ADA fell as much as 5% to lead losses among majors. The cryptocurrency market added 8% over 7 days, stabilising at the $2.7 trillion level since Saturday. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich says a move higher could bolster hopes for further gains, but these expectations will “only be confirmed after a solid consolidation above the 200-day moving average, which is now near $2.97 trillion.“ ""Bitcoin continues its cautious rise, trading above its 50-day moving average and reaching $85,700. This is an important technical attempt to reverse the downtrend. Interestingly, the 200-day average is quite close, so a second confirmation of a trend change could come quite quickly,” Kuptsikevich said, adding that bitcoin had entered a resistance accumulation zone where the “strength of the initial rebound may fade.” Solana’s SOL is showing strength in a downtrodden market, making it ripe for a move higher if overall conditions improve. “Solana is recovering faster than many of the major altcoins, trading at its 50-day moving average near $130. A consolidation above this level will open the way to $145, the area of previous peaks. A sustained move above them will signal a break of the downtrend and could lead to a move towards $180,” Kuptsikevich noted. On a more pessimistic approach, prominent market chartist Peter Brandt is not optimistic about bitcoin setting new highs in the current cycle. “A trendline violation does NOT signify a transition of trend BTC Sorry,” the trader noted said in an X post in response to sentiment for a bullish rebound. Trendlines are a subjective price-action analyst method and less dependable than moving averages or key levels. A break, used in tandem with technical analysis, could hint at a change in movement. Here’s what AI-driven market insights for some majors look like on Wednesday. Dogecoin Price Analysis as Whales Accumulate 800M DOGE Dogecoin whales have accumulated over 800 million DOGE in the last 48 hours, signaling potential confidence in the asset's short-term prospects, data shows . DOGE is currently trading at a critical juncture around $0.154-$0.155, with immediate resistance at $0.157 and crucial support at $0.153 that must hold to prevent further decline. DOGE experienced significant volatility, reaching a peak of $0.169 before entering a pronounced downtrend with lower highs and lower lows since April 14th. Support levels established around $0.155 have been repeatedly tested, with volume spikes coinciding with major price movements. The 48-hour Fibonacci retracement shows price currently hovering near the 0.618 level, suggesting potential consolidation before the next directional move. A sharp selloff occurred between 05:19-05:24, with price plummeting 1.1% in just five minutes on exceptionally high volume (15.3M in a single minute). The subsequent bounce formed a potential double bottom at $0.153, with price currently consolidating around $0.154. Volume analysis shows clear distribution before the drop and accumulation during the recovery attempt. Solana Shows Consolidation Recent price action shows SOL navigating volatility as geopolitical factors create market uncertainty. Solana (SOL) experiences significant price volatility, consolidating between $125-$132 after a 13.7% surge from $119.59 to $136.01. Solana leads decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, outpacing Ethereum for three consecutive days with $2.43 billion in trading activity. Recent trading shows SOL consolidating between $125-$132, with key support established at $125.25. Volume analysis reveals diminishing buying interest after the initial rally, suggesting market indecision. The 50-hour moving average at $129.80 now serves as a critical pivot point. Fibonacci retracement levels indicate potential support at $127.40 (38.2%) if current levels fail to hold. Cardano Sees 8% Bellyflop in Volatile Session ADA experienced significant volatility, surging from $0.618 to a peak of $0.667 (8.0% range) before undergoing a substantial correction. Recent trading shows ADA consolidating between $0.605-$0.615, with increased volume during downward movements suggesting continued bearish pressure. Trading data reveals increasing volume during downward price movements, suggesting persistent selling pressure despite oversold conditions on 48-hour momentum indicators. While some accumulation appears to be occurring at lower levels, potentially forming a base for recovery, ADA now faces significant overhead resistance from the 200-hour moving average. The 200-hour moving average now acts as overhead resistance, reinforcing the bearish trend. 48-hour momentum indicators reveal oversold conditions, potentially offering short-term relief.

The decline follows a tug-of-war in sentiment—on one end, growing institutional adoption; on the other, discreet sell-offs from a major government holder. Brazilian fintech firm Meliuz made headlines after confirming its intention to add Bitcoin to its corporate treasury strategy. The company already holds 45 BTC—worth around $4.1 million—and plans to expand its exposure using operating income and future partnerships. A shareholder vote on May 6 will determine whether BTC will officially become a long-term reserve asset.

Currently trading near $83,460, BTC is testing short-term support zones. RSI: 38.5 – bearish momentum building Key Support: $82,488 and $81,354 Immediate Resistance: $84,020 Trade Setup: Entry: Short below $83,300 (after confirmation) Target: $82,500 → $81,350 Stop Loss: $84,300 Pro Tip: Wait for a candle close below $83,300 with strong volume before entering. Premature shorts can get trapped in false breakdowns. Final Thoughts Bitcoin’s price action reflects a battle of opposing forces: bullish tailwinds from institutional adoption, and bearish headwinds from state-level sell-offs and regulatory uncertainty. With Ripple’s settlement strategy and Meliuz’s treasury move in play, the long-term trend remains constructive—but traders should stay cautious until the dust settles around $83K support.

The core message is that if a rival AI lab releases a ‘high-risk’ AI model without adhering to comparable safety measures, OpenAI may ‘adjust’ its own requirements. This isn’t a decision they claim to take lightly, but it highlights the intense AI development competition that is driving the industry. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors at play: Competitive Pressure: The race to deploy advanced AI models is fierce. Companies are vying for market share and recognition, pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities at an unprecedented pace. Balancing Innovation and Safety: OpenAI is trying to navigate the delicate balance between rapid innovation and ensuring the responsible development and deployment of AI. The pressure to release cutting-edge models quickly can sometimes clash with thorough safety testing. Maintaining a ‘Protective’ Stance: Despite the potential adjustments, OpenAI insists that it will maintain AI safety standards at ‘a level more protective.’ They emphasize that any changes will be carefully considered and transparently communicated. Concerns and Criticisms Surrounding AI Safety Standards OpenAI’s announcement comes amidst existing criticisms regarding its commitment to safety. The company has faced accusations of: Lowering Safety Standards: Critics argue that OpenAI might be prioritizing faster releases over rigorous safety checks to stay ahead in the AI development competition . Compressed Timelines: Reports suggest that safety testing timelines for major model releases have been significantly shortened, raising concerns about the thoroughness of these evaluations. Testing on Older Models: Allegations have surfaced indicating that safety tests are sometimes conducted on earlier versions of models, rather than the final versions released to the public. Lack of Transparency: Concerns have been raised about the timeliness and detail in OpenAI’s safety testing reports, impacting transparency and accountability. While OpenAI disputes these claims and asserts its commitment to safety, the updated framework introduces a layer of complexity and raises questions about the future of AI preparedness framework in a highly competitive environment. Automated Evaluations: A Double-Edged Sword? To accelerate product development and keep pace with the rapid release cadence, OpenAI is increasingly relying on automated evaluations. While automation offers speed and efficiency, it also brings potential challenges: Advantages of Automated Evaluations Potential Disadvantages Speed and Scalability: Automated systems can process vast amounts of data and conduct evaluations much faster than human-led testing. Limited Nuance: Automated systems may struggle to detect subtle or complex safety issues that require human judgment and contextual understanding. Consistency: Automated evaluations can provide consistent and objective assessments, reducing variability associated with human testers. Over-reliance: Excessive reliance on automated systems could lead to neglecting crucial qualitative aspects of safety testing that humans are better equipped to assess. Cost-Effectiveness: Automation can reduce the costs associated with extensive human-led testing, making the process more economically viable. Bias in Design: If the automated evaluation systems are not designed and validated carefully, they could inadvertently introduce biases into the safety assessment process. OpenAI maintains that it hasn’t completely abandoned human-led testing, but the shift towards automation signifies a strategic adjustment in their AI preparedness framework . Categorizing Risk: ‘High Capability’ vs. ‘Critical Capability’ Another significant change in OpenAI’s framework is the refined categorization of AI models based on risk. They are now focusing on two key thresholds: ‘High Capability’: Models that can ‘amplify existing pathways to severe harm.’ These models require safeguards to minimize associated risks before deployment. ‘Critical Capability’: Models that ‘introduce unprecedented new pathways to severe harm.’ These systems necessitate safeguards to minimize risks even during development. This refined categorization reflects a more nuanced approach to risk assessment, acknowledging that different levels of AI capability pose distinct types of threats and require tailored AI safeguards . What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? The developments at OpenAI have broader implications beyond just the AI industry. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into various sectors, including cryptocurrency and blockchain, the approach to AI safety standards and high-risk AI models will be crucial. Here’s why this is relevant to the crypto world: AI-Driven Crypto Tools: AI is being used to develop sophisticated trading algorithms, security systems, and analytical tools within the crypto space. The safety and reliability of these AI systems are paramount. Smart Contracts and AI: The intersection of AI and smart contracts could lead to more complex and autonomous decentralized applications. Ensuring the safety and security of AI-integrated smart contracts is vital. Ethical Considerations: As AI’s influence grows in finance and technology, ethical considerations around bias, fairness, and transparency become increasingly important, both in AI and crypto development. Conclusion: Navigating the Complex Landscape of AI Safety OpenAI’s updated Preparedness Framework reflects the complex realities of developing advanced AI in a competitive landscape. The potential adjustments to AI safeguards , driven by external pressures and internal strategies like automated evaluations, highlight the ongoing tension between rapid innovation and responsible AI development. For the cryptocurrency community and the broader tech world, staying informed about these shifts in AI safety standards is crucial. The future of AI depends on a balanced approach that fosters innovation while prioritizing safety and ethical considerations. Only time will tell how these adjustments will play out and shape the trajectory of AI development and its integration with other transformative technologies.

43400068,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149798,1744790744,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Trump Crypto Ventures Trigger Political Risk for US Regulations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-crypto-ventures-political-risk/,"Is the crypto world about to face a political storm? A recent warning from U.S. investment bank TD Cowen suggests that the foray of the Trump family into cryptocurrency ventures could stir up significant political risk , potentially throwing a wrench into the gears of much-needed U.S. cryptocurrency regulation . Let’s dive into what this means for the future of digital assets in America. Why is Political Risk Surging in the Crypto Space? TD Cowen’s alert shines a spotlight on the intersection of politics and crypto, specifically highlighting ventures linked to the Trump family. These ventures, notably including a planned stablecoin , are raising eyebrows and sparking concerns about potential political backlash. But why is this happening, and what are the specific worries? Political Backlash: The core concern is that associating crypto ventures with politically charged figures, like the Trump family, can inject partisan politics into the already complex regulatory landscape of digital assets. This could lead to increased scrutiny and opposition, not necessarily based on the merits of crypto itself, but on political affiliations. Stalling Crypto Legislation: Just as the U.S. seemed to be making headway in establishing clear cryptocurrency regulation , this new layer of political complexity could slow things down, or even halt progress altogether. Imagine lawmakers becoming more hesitant to support crypto-friendly legislation if it’s perceived as benefiting politically divisive figures. Specific Ventures Under Scrutiny: Reports, as highlighted by The Block, mention discussions between Trump-linked entities and major crypto players like Binance and World Liberty Financial. These connections, while not inherently problematic, amplify the political risk because they involve established industry giants operating within a politically charged environment. How Could Trump Crypto Ventures Impact Cryptocurrency Regulation? The timing of this political risk couldn’t be more delicate. The crypto industry has been eagerly awaiting clearer guidelines and a more defined regulatory framework in the U.S. Progress has been made, but TD Cowen suggests this could be jeopardized. Let’s break down the potential impacts: Potential Impact Description Delayed Legislation Political gridlock or increased opposition could push back timelines for passing comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation . Stricter Regulations Instead of balanced rules, political pressure might lead to overly strict or punitive regulations, hindering innovation. Focus Shift in AML Policy Concerns over money laundering (AML) could be amplified due to political sensitivities, leading to more stringent, potentially stifling AML policies for the crypto sector. Uncertainty and Volatility Increased political risk injects uncertainty into the market, potentially leading to price volatility and investor hesitancy. It’s a precarious situation. On one hand, regulatory clarity is crucial for the long-term health and growth of the crypto industry. On the other hand, politically charged ventures could inadvertently undermine these efforts. Stablecoin and Political Scrutiny: What’s the Connection? The mention of a Trump-linked stablecoin is particularly noteworthy. Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value (often pegged to the US dollar), are already under intense regulatory scrutiny globally. Why does this matter in the context of political risk ? Regulatory Focus on Stablecoins: Regulators worldwide are actively examining stablecoins due to their potential systemic importance and risks related to reserves, issuance, and overall financial stability. Any stablecoin project, especially one with high-profile political connections, will likely face even greater scrutiny. Trust and Transparency: For a stablecoin to succeed, trust is paramount. Political controversy surrounding its backers could erode public trust and make adoption more challenging. Transparency regarding reserves and operations becomes even more critical in such scenarios. Amplified Political Attention: A Trump-linked stablecoin is bound to attract significant political attention, both positive and negative. This attention could either accelerate regulatory frameworks for stablecoins or lead to a more cautious, restrictive approach depending on the prevailing political winds. Navigating the Political Risks in Cryptocurrency: What Should Investors Know? So, what does all this mean for crypto investors and enthusiasts? Here are some actionable insights to consider as we navigate this evolving landscape of political risk and cryptocurrency regulation : Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on regulatory developments and political discussions surrounding crypto. News sources, industry publications, and regulatory body announcements are crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Political risk is just one factor influencing the crypto market. Diversification remains a sound strategy to mitigate risks from various sources. Understand Project Backing: Be aware of the entities and individuals behind crypto projects you invest in. Political affiliations and potential sensitivities can impact a project’s trajectory. Focus on Fundamentals: While political risk adds complexity, the fundamental value proposition of different cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies remains important. Assess projects based on their technology, use cases, and adoption potential. Prepare for Volatility: Increased political risk can contribute to market volatility. Be prepared for potential price swings and manage your risk tolerance accordingly. The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly significant. TD Cowen’s warning serves as a timely reminder that the path to mainstream crypto adoption isn’t just about technological advancements and market trends; it’s also deeply intertwined with the complex web of political dynamics and regulatory landscapes. The coming months could be pivotal in determining how Trump crypto ventures and the broader political risk landscape will shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-16 08:10:00

43400303,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149799,1744791349,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Victory for CyberKongz: SEC Investigation Ends, Paving Way for Web3 Gaming",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-closes-cyberkongz-investigation/,"In a landmark moment for the Web3 gaming space, CyberKongz , the popular Ethereum-based NFT project, has announced the successful closure of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation. The probe, which had cast a shadow of uncertainty over the project and the broader sector, concluded without any enforcement action. This development marks a significant win for CyberKongz and is being hailed as a beacon of hope for regulatory clarity in the burgeoning world of Web3 gaming and NFT projects. What Sparked the SEC Investigation into CyberKongz? The SEC’s scrutiny of CyberKongz primarily stemmed from concerns surrounding its BANANA token and a contract migration that occurred back in 2021. These actions placed CyberKongz under the regulatory microscope, prompting the agency to delve into whether these aspects of the project fell under securities laws. The situation intensified in December when CyberKongz received a Wells notice, a formal communication indicating that the SEC staff intended to recommend an enforcement action against the company. A Wells notice is a serious matter, acting as a precursor to potential legal battles and significant penalties. It essentially gives the recipient a chance to argue why enforcement action should not be taken. For CyberKongz, this notice triggered a period of intense uncertainty and required them to engage legal counsel and cooperate fully with the SEC’s inquiries. The fact that the investigation has now been closed without any action speaks volumes about CyberKongz’s compliance and the arguments they presented to the regulatory body. Relief and Jubilation: CyberKongz Reacts to SEC Closure Unsurprisingly, the CyberKongz team has expressed immense relief and satisfaction at the outcome. They view this conclusion as not only a personal victory but also a positive sign for the entire Web3 gaming ecosystem. In a statement released shortly after the announcement, the team highlighted that this development brings much-needed regulatory clarity to a space often plagued by ambiguity and uncertainty. This sentiment was echoed across the Web3 community, with many seeing it as a crucial step forward in legitimizing and fostering innovation in the sector. CyberKongz Joins Growing List of Cleared NFT Projects CyberKongz is not alone in experiencing SEC scrutiny and subsequently emerging unscathed. This positive outcome places them alongside other prominent NFT projects like Yuga Labs (the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club) and the leading NFT marketplace OpenSea , all of whom have recently navigated similar investigations and been cleared without enforcement action. This trend suggests a potential shift in the SEC’s approach, or perhaps a clearer understanding of the nuances within the NFT and NFT project space. Key Projects Navigating SEC Scrutiny: Project Type Outcome of SEC Investigation CyberKongz NFT Gaming Project Investigation Closed – No Action Yuga Labs NFT Collection & Metaverse Investigation Closed – No Action OpenSea NFT Marketplace Investigation Closed – No Action This pattern of investigations concluding without enforcement raises important questions. Is the SEC refining its approach to regulating digital assets? Are these projects demonstrating sufficient compliance to satisfy regulatory concerns? Or is this a signal that the initial wave of intense scrutiny is giving way to a more nuanced and practical regulatory landscape for the NFT project and Web3 industries? The Significance of Regulatory Clarity for Web3 Gaming The closure of the SEC investigation into CyberKongz is particularly meaningful for the Web3 gaming sector. Gaming, with its inherent digital nature and vibrant virtual economies, is seen as a prime use case for blockchain technology and NFTs. However, the regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets has been a significant impediment to growth and innovation in this area. Benefits of Regulatory Clarity for Web3 Gaming: Increased Investor Confidence: Clearer rules attract institutional and retail investors, injecting capital into Web3 gaming projects. Reduced Legal Risks: Developers can build and operate with greater certainty, minimizing the fear of unexpected regulatory action. Faster Innovation: Focus shifts from compliance concerns to creative development, accelerating the evolution of Web3 games. Mainstream Adoption: As the space becomes more regulated and secure, mainstream gamers are more likely to embrace Web3 gaming experiences. The CyberKongz case, along with the outcomes for Yuga Labs and OpenSea, could represent a turning point. It suggests that projects operating responsibly and engaging constructively with regulators can navigate the complex legal landscape and achieve positive outcomes. This is a crucial message for the entire Web3 space, encouraging proactive compliance and open dialogue with regulatory bodies. What’s Next for CyberKongz and Web3 Gaming? For CyberKongz, this SEC closure allows them to fully focus on their core mission: building and expanding their NFT gaming ecosystem. Freed from the shadow of the investigation, they can now confidently pursue their roadmap, innovate further, and continue to engage their community. For the broader Web3 gaming industry, this development offers a renewed sense of optimism and encourages continued development and investment. However, it’s crucial to remember that the regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. While this is a positive signal, it does not mean the Web3 space is entirely free from regulatory oversight. Projects must remain vigilant, prioritize compliance, and stay informed about ongoing regulatory developments. Engaging with legal experts and adopting best practices will be essential for navigating this dynamic environment and ensuring long-term success. A Powerful Signal for the Future of Web3 The SEC’s decision to close the CyberKongz investigation without enforcement action is more than just a win for one NFT project; it’s a potentially transformative moment for the entire Web3 ecosystem. It provides a tangible example of how projects can successfully navigate regulatory scrutiny and emerge stronger. This victory offers a powerful signal of hope and regulatory clarity , encouraging innovation and growth in the exciting and rapidly evolving world of Web3 gaming and beyond. The message is clear: responsible innovation and proactive compliance can pave the way for a thriving and sustainable future for decentralized technologies.
