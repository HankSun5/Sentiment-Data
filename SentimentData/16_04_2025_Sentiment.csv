This alarming omission raises questions about AI transparency and the tech giant’s commitment to responsible AI development. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-watchers alike, this development in the AI space is crucial, as AI’s increasing influence can have far-reaching implications across various sectors, including blockchain and digital currencies. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s causing ripples. Unpacking the GPT-4.1 Launch and the Missing Safety Report Omission On Monday, OpenAI unveiled GPT-4.1, boasting enhanced performance over its predecessors, particularly in programming benchmarks. While the performance upgrades are noteworthy, the conspicuous absence of a safety report – traditionally a standard accompaniment to OpenAI’s model releases – has become the focal point. These reports, often termed ‘system cards,’ detail the rigorous safety evaluations conducted on AI models, offering insights into potential risks and mitigation strategies. However, for GPT-4.1, this crucial piece of documentation is nowhere to be found. When questioned by Bitcoin World, an OpenAI spokesperson stated that GPT-4.1 is not considered a ‘frontier model,’ hence justifying the lack of a dedicated system card. This explanation, however, hasn’t quelled concerns, especially given the industry norm of prioritizing AI safety and transparency. Why AI Transparency Matters: The Industry Standard Safety reports serve as a vital tool for AI transparency . They typically include: Internal Testing Details: Outlining the types of tests conducted by the AI lab itself to assess the model’s safety. Third-Party Evaluations: Incorporating assessments from external partners, adding an independent layer of scrutiny. Potential Risks: Openly acknowledging and detailing potential downsides, such as the model’s propensity for deception or harmful persuasiveness. Good Faith Effort: These reports are generally viewed by the AI community as genuine attempts to foster independent research and red teaming efforts, crucial for identifying and mitigating risks. In essence, these reports are the AI industry’s benchmark for demonstrating accountability and a commitment to AI safety . The absence of such a report for GPT-4.1 is a deviation from this established norm, prompting unease among safety researchers and industry observers. Lowered Reporting Standards: A Growing Trend? Unfortunately, OpenAI isn’t alone in facing criticism over reporting standards. Several leading AI labs have seemingly been scaling back their transparency efforts in recent months, leading to backlash from the AI safety research community. Google’s Delays: Some tech giants have been slow in releasing safety reports, raising questions about their commitment to timely transparency. Lack of Detail: Even when reports are published, they sometimes lack the comprehensive detail that was once standard, making thorough evaluation challenging. OpenAI’s Past Issues: OpenAI itself has faced scrutiny. A previous safety report in December was criticized for presenting benchmark results from a different model version than the one actually deployed. Furthermore, the system card for their ‘deep research’ model was released weeks after the model itself launched. This apparent trend towards reduced transparency is concerning, particularly as AI models become more powerful and integrated into various aspects of our lives. AI Model Release and Voluntary Transparency: A Double-Edged Sword Steven Adler, a former OpenAI safety researcher, points out a critical aspect: safety reports are not legally mandated. They are voluntary commitments made by AI companies. While this allows for flexibility, it also creates a potential loophole. OpenAI has publicly committed to transparency, even highlighting system cards as a ‘key part’ of their accountability approach in a blog post preceding the UK AI Safety Summit in 2023. They further emphasized the value of system cards in providing insights into model risks leading up to the Paris AI Action Summit in 2025. Adler aptly summarizes, “System cards are the AI industry’s main tool for transparency and for describing what safety testing was done. Today’s transparency norms and commitments are ultimately voluntary, so it is up to each AI company to decide whether or when to release a system card for a given model.” This voluntary nature places the onus on companies like OpenAI to uphold their self-imposed standards of AI transparency . Concerns Mount Amidst Safety Practice Scrutiny The decision to ship GPT-4.1 without a system card comes at a sensitive time. Current and former OpenAI employees are increasingly voicing concerns about the company’s AI safety practices. Just last week, Adler and eleven other ex-OpenAI employees filed an amicus brief in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, arguing that a for-profit OpenAI might be incentivized to compromise on safety measures. Recent reports in the Financial Times further suggest that competitive pressures are pushing OpenAI to reduce the time and resources allocated to safety testing. This alleged shift in priorities amplifies the significance of the missing safety report for GPT-4.1. Performance Gains and Heightened Risk: A Critical Juncture for AI Safety While GPT-4.1 may not be OpenAI’s most powerful model overall, it boasts substantial improvements in efficiency and latency. Thomas Woodside, co-founder and policy analyst at Secure AI Project, highlights that these performance enhancements actually make a safety report even more critical. His reasoning is straightforward: greater sophistication in a model often translates to higher potential risks. The increasing capabilities of AI models necessitate robust AI safety measures and transparent reporting. However, many AI labs, including OpenAI, have resisted legislative efforts to codify safety reporting requirements. OpenAI, for instance, opposed California’s SB 1047, which would have mandated safety evaluations and public reporting for many AI developers. Conclusion: The Path Forward for AI Transparency OpenAI’s launch of GPT-4.1 without a safety report marks a concerning deviation from established industry norms. While the company justifies this decision by categorizing GPT-4.1 as non-frontier, the absence of a system card raises valid questions about AI transparency and commitment to AI safety . As AI models become more integrated into our world, especially in sectors like cryptocurrency and finance, the need for robust safety evaluations and open reporting becomes paramount. The industry stands at a crucial juncture, where voluntary commitments to transparency must be reinforced by consistent action and perhaps, eventually, by more formalized standards to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.

The stablecoin market, already a vibrant space, is about to get even more dynamic. Industry experts at Fireblocks are signaling a major escalation in stablecoin competition , with traditional financial powerhouses like banks and payment firms gearing up to launch their own digital currencies. What does this mean for the future of finance and the crypto landscape? Let’s dive in and explore this exciting development. Why is Stablecoin Competition Heating Up? According to Ran Goldi, SVP of payments at Fireblocks, we’re on the cusp of a new era in the stablecoin market. Several factors are converging to fuel this stablecoin competition : Regulatory Tailwinds: The regulatory landscape is becoming clearer, especially in regions like the EU with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Pending legislation in the U.S. is also providing a framework for banks and financial institutions to operate within the crypto space. This clarity is giving institutions the confidence to move forward with their stablecoin strategies. Growing Demand for Digital Payments: The need for efficient and cost-effective cross-border payments is rising. Stablecoins offer a compelling solution, providing faster transaction times and lower fees compared to traditional systems. Technological Maturity: Blockchain technology and stablecoin infrastructure have matured significantly, making it easier and safer for banks and payment firms to launch and manage digital currencies. Goldi predicts a surge in stablecoin offerings, estimating as many as 50 new stablecoins could emerge by the end of the year. This influx of new players will undoubtedly intensify the stablecoin competition and reshape the market. Bank Stablecoins: A New Era of Digital Currency? The entry of banks into the stablecoin arena is a game-changer. For years, the crypto market has been largely dominated by decentralized players. Now, traditional financial institutions are stepping in, bringing with them trust, regulatory compliance, and vast customer networks. But what exactly are bank stablecoins , and what advantages do they offer? Bank stablecoins are digital currencies issued by regulated banks and pegged to a fiat currency, typically the US dollar or Euro. This backing by traditional banks provides a level of security and stability that some perceive as lacking in purely crypto-native stablecoins. Here’s a breakdown of the potential benefits: Benefit Description Enhanced Trust and Security Backed by regulated banks, offering greater assurance and consumer protection. Regulatory Compliance Designed to meet stringent regulatory requirements, reducing compliance burdens for users. Integration with Traditional Finance Seamless integration with existing banking infrastructure and payment systems. Wider Adoption Potential Banks’ established customer base and brand recognition can accelerate stablecoin adoption. However, the rise of bank stablecoins also presents challenges. Interoperability between different stablecoin platforms and ensuring robust security protocols will be crucial for widespread adoption. Moreover, the regulatory landscape is still evolving, and banks will need to navigate complex compliance requirements across different jurisdictions. Stablecoin Regulation: MiCA and Beyond Regulation is playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of stablecoins. The EU’s MiCA regulation is a landmark piece of legislation that provides a comprehensive framework for crypto-assets, including stablecoins. MiCA aims to foster innovation while mitigating risks, and it’s already influencing how stablecoin issuers operate in Europe and beyond. Key aspects of stablecoin regulation under MiCA include: Licensing Requirements: Issuers of significant stablecoins will need to obtain licenses and adhere to strict operational and capital requirements. Reserve Requirements: Stablecoin issuers must maintain adequate reserves to back their tokens, ensuring they can meet redemption requests. Consumer Protection: MiCA includes measures to protect consumers, such as transparency requirements and mechanisms for dispute resolution. In the United States, while there isn’t a single, comprehensive federal framework yet, various agencies are actively working on stablecoin regulation. Pending legislation is expected to bring more clarity and potentially pave the way for broader adoption of digital currency and stablecoins within the U.S. financial system. The Power of Crypto Payments: Cross-Border Transactions and Beyond One of the most compelling use cases for stablecoins is in crypto payments , particularly for cross-border transactions. Traditional cross-border payments can be slow, expensive, and involve multiple intermediaries. Stablecoins offer a faster, cheaper, and more efficient alternative. Goldi highlighted the increasing use of stablecoins in cross-border payments, noting that banks in Brazil and Singapore are already actively utilizing them. This real-world adoption underscores the practical benefits of crypto payments for businesses and individuals engaged in international trade and remittances. While USDT (Tether) currently dominates the global stablecoin market, USDC (USD Coin) is positioning itself to gain ground, particularly in Europe, due to its licensing under MiCA. The regulatory clarity provided by MiCA could give USDC a competitive edge in the European market and beyond. Navigating the Digital Currency Landscape: What’s Next? The digital currency landscape is evolving rapidly, and the intensifying stablecoin competition is a key driver of this change. Banks and payment firms are not just dipping their toes in the water; many are actively developing strategies for stablecoin adoption and implementation. CoinDesk reports that numerous banks are currently drafting stablecoin strategies, with actual implementations expected to begin as early as 2026. This timeline suggests that we are still in the early stages of this transformation, but the momentum is building. Key Takeaways for Navigating this Evolving Landscape: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, particularly in regions relevant to your business or interests. Explore Stablecoin Options: Evaluate different stablecoins and their suitability for your payment needs, considering factors like regulation, security, and interoperability. Prepare for Change: The financial landscape is shifting. Businesses and individuals should prepare for increased adoption of digital currencies and explore how stablecoins can enhance their operations. Engage with the Ecosystem: Participate in industry discussions, attend conferences, and network with experts to gain deeper insights into the evolving stablecoin market. The stablecoin market is poised for explosive growth and innovation. As banks and payment firms enter the fray, stablecoin competition will intensify, driving further development and adoption of digital currency solutions. This is a space to watch closely, as it promises to reshape the future of finance and payments.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-massive-xrp-price-breakout-incoming-heres-why/,"XRP may be on the verge of a dramatic price breakout, according to crypto market analyst Amonyx, who predicted a “massive” upward move in the coming sessions. As technical signals and on-chain metrics begin to align, the digital asset appears to be approaching a critical inflection point—one that could redefine its short-term trajectory and possibly send shockwaves through the broader altcoin market. MASSIVE $XRP BREAKOUT INCOMING!!! pic.twitter.com/GfL6kLjzdY — Amonyx (@amonbuy) April 15, 2025 Technical Indicators Signal Imminent Breakout Amonyx’s analysis is underpinned by classic technical breakout principles. XRP has recently been consolidating within a narrowing range, forming what many chartists identify as a bullish continuation pattern, such as a symmetrical triangle or ascending triangle—both of which historically precede upward breakouts when supported by volume and momentum indicators. Price action is tightening, volatility is compressing, and XRP is hovering just below resistance levels that have previously capped its rallies. These conditions often serve as the prelude to explosive price movements, especially when investor sentiment starts leaning bullish. Momentum Building Across Key Market Metrics In tandem with the technical picture, there is growing evidence of heightened interest in XRP across various market layers. Trading volume has begun to swell, suggesting increasing participation. Derivatives markets have also seen rising open interest and bullish bias , indicating that institutional and high-leverage traders are anticipating movement. Moreover, on-chain data reveals renewed activity among whale addresses and long-dormant holders—an encouraging signal that large players may be positioning ahead of what they expect to be a significant shift in price action. Macro and Fundamental Tailwinds While technical and on-chain signals point to near-term momentum, macro-fundamental factors could provide the necessary fuel for a sustained rally. XRP continues to benefit from positive developments within the Ripple ecosystem, particularly its expanding global partnerships and potential future involvement in regulated digital payment infrastructure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, as discussions around tokenization, stablecoins, and CBDCs gain traction among central banks and financial institutions, XRP’s use case as a bridge currency positions it strategically at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain. The Sentiment Factor: Cautious Optimism or Euphoria? Despite the building pressure, traders and investors remain divided on whether this is the breakout that finally propels XRP back toward previous all-time highs—or just another false start in a long consolidation. Amonyx, however, remains confident that the current setup is unlike past attempts, emphasizing the strength of supporting signals and the broader market’s readiness to rotate into large-cap altcoins. If the breakout materializes, it could trigger a wave of FOMO (fear of missing out), drawing in sidelined capital and amplifying the rally further. As always, volume confirmation and the ability to flip resistance into support will be critical in validating the move. With technicals coiling, sentiment shifting, and macro narratives aligning, XRP is entering a pivotal phase that could result in substantial price action. While caution is always warranted in volatile markets, Amonyx’s forecast is backed by a confluence of data points that suggest XRP is not just knocking on the door of a breakout—it’s about to kick it open. For now, all eyes remain on the charts. The next move could be historic. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Musk’s dual role as a business magnate and government official is reigniting debates over where ethical lines should be drawn when private-sector leaders step into public power. Lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren are pushing for tighter oversight of special government employees. Over 50% of Americans believe Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk and tech companies overall have too much influence on U.S. government, according to a new poll this week from UMass Amherst. New Poll Finds Majority Believe Musk Influences Federal Government Too Much Conducted from April 4 through to April 9 , the poll found that over half of the U.S. believes Musk, tech companies, and Wall Street at large wield too much influence over the federal government under U.S. President Donald Trump. Majority of Americans Distrust Elon Musk’s Efforts to Cut Federal Spending, New National UMass Amherst Poll Finds : UMass Amherst https://t.co/0pLkdRWC5o — UMass Poll (@UMassPoll) April 15, 2025 Meanwhile, 59% of surveyed participants said that they had little to no trust that Musk would not use his position of power to benefit his own business interests. “Only three months into his tenure at DOGE, questions concerning Musk’s conflict of interests, his legal authority to cut federal programs, and the actual budgetary savings that DOGE has elicited continue to swirl,” says the poll’s director, Professor Tatishe Nteta. “Given the unpopularity of Musk’s efforts to rein in federal spending, it is no surprise that many expect Musk to return to his businesses and to put Washington, D.C., in his rearview mirror,” he added. Democratic U.S. Lawmakers Push Back Musk, who has been a proponent of cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin in the past, has faced widespread backlash for his new position in Trump’s administration. The SpaceX founder has largely spearheaded a campaign directed at cutting government regulations in a bid to curb America’s excess spending, though critics argue his role goes too far. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who recently urged the Department of Justice to reverse its decision to disband its crypto enforcement, co-sponsored a bill on Monday that would order ethics checks on special government employees like Musk. Trump, meanwhile, has also faced criticism for his business affiliations while in the Oval Office, with Fortune reporting Tuesday that he will launch his own crypto-infused, Monopoly style real estate game.

Coyne now faces nearly a decade behind bars which shows the growing stakes for cybercriminals. The continued rise of phishing—now infiltrating even government officials’ accounts—shows that cybercriminal networks remain highly active and dangerously effective. According to a press release on April 14 from England and Wales top prosecution agency, the Crown Prosecution Service, British citizen Zak Coyne has been sentenced to almost a decade prison for operating a phishing service intended to generate scams for fraudsters. Labhost’s Zak Coyne Profited Off Of Laundered Crypto The press release stated that Coyne played an “integral role in the creation, operation and administration” of Labhost, a one-stop phishing as a service site for scammers. Zak Coyne, 24, facilitated extensive fraudulent conduct worldwide by creating and running a 'one-stop shop for phishing' online. Today he has been sentenced. https://t.co/YLfp6rGVGs pic.twitter.com/nEM2A2IeDH — Crown Prosecution Service (@CPSUK) April 14, 2025 Coyne, who received $230,000 worth of laundered cryptocurrency for “designing and administering” Labhost’s website, was apprehended at Manchester Airport on Monday. Users of Labhost would pay a monthly service and in turn garner access to websites that appeared to be legitimate government, commercial and banking URLs they could then use to defraud unsuspecting victims. The massive scheme saw over one million victims in 91 countries defrauded, with losses of victims in the U.K. accounting for £32 million ($42 million USD). Coyne pleaded guilty to one count of making or supplying articles for use in fraud, one count of encouraging or assisting the commission of an offense and one count of transferring criminal property at Manchester Crown Court. “This was a sophisticated worldwide criminal enterprise which enabled others to perpetrate fraud on a massive scale, resulting in losses totalling more than £100 million,” Thomas Short, Specialist Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said. “Fraud is far from a victimless crime and the harm caused by Coyne’s offending are measured not just in monetary terms, but also in the distress inflicted on countless victims who fell prey to these scams,” he added. Phishing Scams Continue To Pervade Society News of Coyne’s arrest and subsequent guilty plea comes amid the concerning continuation of phishing attacks at large, with 48% all emails in 2022 found to be spam. On Tuesday, the BBC reported that Government Minister Lucy Powell’s X accunt had been hacked to promote a cryptocurrency scam . Overall, Coyne’s conviction shows the growing international efforts to crack down on cyber-enabled fraud, as authorities grapple with the rising tide of phishing scams that continue to exploit millions of victims worldwide.

Bitcoin has been known for its high volatility and sharp price swings, but data from Nasdaq composites volatility over the past 30 days shows that it surpassed Bitcoin for the first time last week after President Trump reportedly put a hold on tariffs for most countries apart from China for 90 days. For China, Trump increased the tariffs targeting the country. High volatility in the cryptocurrency space has been a constant feature and it’s one of the few things that set’s it apart from the equities market. However, recent trends show that it’s gradually changing as pointed out by industry observers. The volatility landscape is changing For the first time in a long time, Nasdaq’s 21-day realized volatility overtook Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility, reaching 59.8% compared to Bitcoin’s 46.4% on April 10, according to data from Dow Jones Market Data. It’s important to note that Bitcoin trades around the clock, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, while U.S. equities only trade on weekdays from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. ET. This wider trading window can sometimes smooth out extreme fluctuations in crypto as pointed out by analysts. However, the market experienced some resurgence on Monday, ending on a high note after the Trump administration announced that it would exempt smartphones, electronic integrated circuits, and some consumer-electronics products as well as machines used in making semiconductors from the tariffs. Although the White House has added that these exemptions were temporary. Analysts have also pointed out that tariffs affect the stock market directly as they impact the actual companies listed there and their profit margins, which in turn impacts consumer and investors’ confidence. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is relatively insulated or not as impacted by the effects of tariffs. Greg Magadini, the director of derivatives at crypto-data platform Amberdata, has also highlighted another guardrail for Bitcoin’s volatility. Magadini noted that Bitcoin’s volatility has been on a decline in part due to institutional involvement, especially after the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year. Policy stability and regulatory shift may be the answer The Donald Trump administration is known to have a pro-crypto regulatory stance, which stakeholders also see as influential in relatively stabilizing Bitcoin. The president signed executive orders to create a federal framework for digital asset regulation and even proposed the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve . Trump’s stance on crypto marks a major shift from the Biden administration. Under the new administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dismissed lawsuits against several crypto companies, and the President has pardoned some players in the crypto space convicted for crypto-related crimes, such as former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. The reduction of speculative volatility may be attributed to these moves boosting institutional confidence in Bitcoin. While it remains to be seen whether this trend continues, the recent convergence in volatility between equities and Bitcoin suggests a changing narrative.

His message, though unconventional, taps into a long-standing tradition in the XRP community, where speculation often dances with mythology and pattern recognition in pursuit of the truth. Ok here is the real moon date joking around aside! Can I tell the world Pee? APRIL 19: The XRP Phoenix Rises — A Master Decode Alright Riddlers, XRP Army, and anyone still paying attention… the clues have been in plain sight. Here’s why I believe April 19, 2025, is the XRP… pic.twitter.com/hocS5MbPjV — David Rule (@XRPFREEE) April 14, 2025 The Resurrection Framework and Biblical Parallels Rule begins his argument by anchoring his timeline in biblical resurrection imagery. Referring to John 11:39, where Lazarus had been dead for four days before being resurrected, he draws a symbolic parallel to April 15 as the “death” point, representing systemic collapse or symbolic transformation. Four days after this, April 19 becomes the date of rebirth, or in XRP terms, the day the “Phoenix rises.” This motif, recurrent in XRP lore, aligns with the idea of rebirth after destruction—echoing Ripple’s ongoing battle for regulatory clarity and its hoped-for transformation into the financial standard. Mr. Pool and the Cryptic Timestamp A key anchor in David’s decode is a Mr. Pool post from April 3, 2022, which displayed the reversed phrase “NATIONAL YCNEGREME” (National Emergency). Posted at 5:46 PM, Rule uses riddler logic to flip and reduce the timestamp, ultimately calculating the number 18—a suggested nod to April 18 as the date of a global emergency broadcast or financial event. Following that, April 19 becomes the logical “aftershock,” the moment of emergence from chaos. David suggests this aligns with the archetypal “Order out of Chaos” narrative, frequently cited in esoteric and occult traditions. The Numerological Argument and the 36 Code Using a combination of number flips and summations, David decodes April 19 (4/19) into the number 36—a number repeatedly referenced in XRP riddler circles. The number is derived through symbolic inversions (e.g., flipping 9 to 6, subtracting and adding digits) that reflect a common theme in this subculture: hidden meanings beneath the surface. Notably, David draws attention to how XRP itself is numerologically encoded with 36, further reinforcing his thesis that April 19 is more than a date—it is a symbolic cipher. Astrological and Esoteric Timelines Astrology also plays a central role in David’s code. April 19 marks the final anaretic degree of Aries—considered one of the most potent and karmically charged degrees in the zodiac. It represents a threshold moment, when fire gives way to earth as Taurus begins—a sign historically linked to finance, stability, and material wealth. Combined with the shifting moon into Taurus, Rule suggests the cosmic alignment points toward massive movement in assets like XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He also ties the date to the occult calendar, specifically the “blood sacrifice to the beast” window from April 19 to May 1, known in esoteric circles as a time of both chaos and ritual rebirth. Rule argues that Mr. Pool’s apocalyptic imagery—cities burning, phoenix symbolism, digital resets—all mirror this arc of destruction leading to renewal. Riddler Visuals and BG123’s Confirmation No XRP moon date decode would be complete without mentioning BearableGuy123 (BG123), the mysterious figure behind many of the XRP community’s most famous riddles. David Rule points to one of BG123’s visuals showing a rocket passing a star—interpreted as April—before shooting into space. Combined with consistent references to 19s, 36s, and mirrored clocks, Rule believes BG123 visually endorsed this exact timeline for XRP’s ascension. A Convergence of Codes and Culture For seasoned XRP followers, this decode by David Rule is more than numerology or internet riddles—it’s a cultural narrative, woven with deep symbolism and a sense of prophetic destiny. While critics might brush off such theories as speculative fiction, the XRP community has long embraced this unique blend of logic, pattern recognition, and metaphorical language to navigate a market that often defies conventional analysis. In sum, Rule’s breakdown presents April 19, 2025, as the culmination of hidden signals, time-tested symbolism, and spiritual metaphor. It’s the day the phoenix rises, the financial reset begins, and XRP fulfills its long-awaited potential. Whether one believes in riddler logic or not, one thing is certain: the date is now etched in XRP folklore. Bookmark it. Watch it. April 19.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has hinted at future integrations between Gemini AI models and Veo, aiming to enhance Gemini’s “understanding of the physical world.” This suggests that Veo 2 is just the first step in a more ambitious roadmap for Google’s AI video capabilities. Current Limitations of Veo 2: Video Length: Limited to 8-second clips. Resolution: 720p resolution may not be sufficient for all professional applications. Access Restrictions: Currently limited to Gemini Advanced subscribers and personal accounts. Monthly Limits: Users are subject to monthly video creation limits. Despite these limitations, Veo 2 provides a powerful entry point into AI video generation for Gemini Advanced users. The ease of use, direct integration, and sharing capabilities make it a valuable tool for experimenting with and understanding the potential of this technology. Ethical Implications and the Future of AI Video Generation The rise of AI video generation technologies like Veo 2 also brings forth important ethical considerations and potential disruptions to creative industries. Concerns about job displacement, misinformation, and the authenticity of digital content are increasingly relevant. A recent study by the Animation Guild highlights these worries, estimating that over 100,000 jobs in the US film, television, and animation sectors could be disrupted by AI by 2026. These concerns are valid and warrant careful consideration as AI video technology evolves. Watermarking technologies like Google’s SynthID are a step in the right direction to address authenticity, but broader discussions around ethical guidelines, responsible use, and workforce adaptation are crucial to navigate the impact of AI video generation on society and the creative economy. Key Ethical and Future Considerations: Job Displacement: Impact on creative professions and the need for workforce adaptation. Misinformation: Potential for misuse in creating fake or misleading video content. Authenticity: Ensuring the provenance and authenticity of AI-generated videos. Ethical Guidelines: Developing industry standards and ethical frameworks for AI video generation . Future Enhancements: Continued development towards higher resolution, longer videos, and more sophisticated creative controls. Google AI ’s move to bring Veo 2 to Gemini Advanced is a significant milestone in the evolution of video generation . While still in its early stages, Veo 2 offers a glimpse into a future where creating compelling video content becomes more accessible and democratized. As competition intensifies and technology advances, the world of AI video is poised for rapid transformation, presenting both exciting opportunities and critical challenges for creators, industries, and society as a whole.

This sudden liquidation has put the asset in a bearish condition, plunging under $1. After reestablishing support above the $5.6 level to form a new bullish pattern last week, OM bounced back and increased well. The buying was short-lived under $7 due to a rejection, and the price dropped briefly into a calm phase for days. Unfortunately, that week ended in pain following a sudden massive crash below $1 within an hour, sparking roughly 100% loss in a single day. According to JP Mullin, the co-founder and the CEO of Mantra protocol, the crash came as a result of “forced closures of positions”, citing timing and depth of the crash came as a result of insufficient warning or notice. While this scenario looks similar to that of the Luna and FTT collapse saga in 2021, history might be repeating itself with a similar pattern, as this could be an indication of a full-scale crypto bearish season as few altcoins might follow the trend in the next few days. Additionally, being one of the first tokens to kickstart bull run, with over 50x increase in a year, OM is among the best-performed altcoins with massive returns on investment during the bull cycle. But considering the latest crash to a year low, the bulls are trapped in a big loss, and from a technical standpoint, they may not recover from it. OM’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the bears are technically in control, reclaiming $0.465 and the recent yearly $0.37 low would be their next target. Breaking it could plunge the price to $0.2 and $0.1 in the near term. In case of a major recovery, the key level to keep in mind for a retest is $1. Right above this resistance lies the $2 and $3 levels.

The Finance Minister is expected to respond to this request soon. This is an AI-generated article powered by DeepNewz, curated by The Defiant.

What if you could directly spend your crypto, seamlessly and globally? Well, get ready to ditch those conversion hassles because Solayer, the innovative Solana (SOL) re-staking protocol, is changing the game with their brand-new crypto debit card , the “Emerald Card”! Unveiling the Emerald Card: Your Gateway to Seamless Cryptocurrency Payments Solayer, known for its pioneering InfiniSVM infrastructure, has just announced the launch of the Emerald Card, a game-changing crypto debit card designed to simplify how you use your digital assets in the real world. According to reports from The Block, this card allows users to make purchases using cryptocurrencies without the need for immediate fiat conversion. This is a significant leap forward, bridging the gap between the crypto world and traditional commerce. Imagine paying for your morning coffee or your online shopping spree directly with your Solana or other supported cryptocurrencies – that’s the power the Emerald Card puts in your hands. Why is the Emerald Card a Game Changer for Cryptocurrency Payments? Let’s dive into what makes the Emerald Card stand out in the increasingly crowded crypto landscape: Direct Cryptocurrency Spending: The core benefit is clear – spend your cryptocurrency payments directly without the intermediary step of converting to fiat. This saves time, reduces potential fees, and simplifies the entire purchasing process. Global Reach: Availability in 100 countries, including the United States, is a massive win. This widespread accessibility ensures that a large global audience can benefit from this innovative crypto debit card . Seamless Integration: Compatibility with Apple Pay and Android Pay, along with tap-and-pay functionality, means the Emerald Card fits effortlessly into your existing payment habits. It’s designed for convenience and ease of use. InfiniSVM Infrastructure: Built on Solayer’s robust InfiniSVM infrastructure, the card benefits from a secure and efficient backbone, ensuring reliable transactions. Benefits of Using a Crypto Debit Card Like the Emerald Card The advantages of using a crypto debit card extend beyond mere convenience. Let’s explore some key benefits: Enhanced Financial Flexibility: Access and spend your crypto holdings just like traditional funds, providing greater control and flexibility over your assets. Reduced Conversion Fees: Bypass exchange fees associated with converting crypto to fiat for everyday spending. Wider Crypto Adoption: The Emerald Card promotes wider adoption of cryptocurrency payments by making them more accessible and user-friendly for daily transactions. Potential Rewards and Incentives: While not explicitly mentioned in the initial announcement, crypto debit cards often come with rewards programs, cashback, or other incentives, potentially adding extra value for users. (Further details on Emerald Card rewards are awaited). Potential Challenges and Considerations While the Emerald Card presents an exciting opportunity, it’s important to consider potential challenges and factors that users should be aware of: Challenge Consideration Regulatory Landscape: Cryptocurrency regulations vary significantly across countries. Users should be aware of the legal and tax implications of using a crypto debit card in their jurisdiction. Volatility of Cryptocurrencies: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate. Spending crypto directly means the purchasing power might change between the time of purchase and the actual transaction settlement. Adoption by Merchants: While the Emerald Card integrates with existing payment systems, widespread merchant adoption of cryptocurrency payments , in general, is still evolving. Security and Custody: Users need to understand how the card handles security and custody of their cryptocurrencies. It’s crucial to use reputable and secure platforms. Solana’s Expanding Ecosystem and the Role of Solayer Solayer’s launch of the Emerald Card further strengthens the Solana ecosystem. Solana has been gaining significant traction in the crypto space due to its high transaction speeds and lower fees compared to some other blockchains. Protocols like Solayer, built on Solana, are contributing to its growth by developing innovative applications and services. The Emerald Card is a prime example of how Solana’s infrastructure can be leveraged to create practical and user-centric cryptocurrency payments solutions. How to Get Your Hands on the Emerald Card? (Actionable Insights) While specific details on how to apply for the Emerald Card are yet to be fully released, here’s what you can do to stay informed and potentially be among the first users: Follow Solayer’s Official Channels: Keep an eye on Solayer’s official website, Twitter, and other social media channels for announcements regarding the Emerald Card launch, application process, and availability. Join the Solayer Community: Engage with the Solayer community on platforms like Telegram or Discord to get updates and insights from other users and the team. Sign Up for Notifications: Look for options to sign up for email newsletters or notifications on Solayer’s website to receive direct updates about the Emerald Card. The Future of Cryptocurrency Payments is Here Solayer’s Emerald Card is more than just another crypto debit card ; it’s a symbol of the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency payments . It represents a move towards greater accessibility, usability, and real-world application of digital assets. By eliminating the friction of fiat conversion and leveraging the speed and efficiency of the Solana blockchain, the Emerald Card paves the way for a future where spending crypto is as seamless and convenient as using traditional currencies.

Last month, Semler Scientific disclosed that it had received a civil investigative demand, or CID — essentially, a subpoena from a federal agency that typically precedes a lawsuit — from the DOJ back in 2017. The company at that time said it had complied with several subsequent subpoenas over the following years and began initial settlement discussions with the DOJ in February. That news, along with the decline in the price of bitcoin, had helped crater SMLR shares, which were lower by 37% year-to-date as of the close of trading on Tuesday. In today's disclosure, Semler said that it had inked an agreement with crypto exchange Coinbase allowing it to borrow both cash and digital assets, using its bitcoin holdings as collateral. If the company’s settlement agreement with the DOJ is approved, Semler “intends to borrow under the Coinbase master loan agreement and use such proceeds (along with its cash on hand) to pay the proposed settlement with DOJ.” Semler Scientific’s settlement agreement with the DOJ is in principle, meaning that it is not yet set in stone. Ready to restart bitcoin purchases With the DOJ cloud hanging over it, Semler had not added to its 3,192 bitcoin stack for more than two months, but that appears as if it will soon change. ""Excited to buy more bitcoin,"" tweeted company Chairman Eric Semler as the settlement (in principle) was announced.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors watching the tech landscape, the synergy between AI and cloud computing is undeniable. In a strategic move signaling deeper integration, AI startup Anthropic, backed by Amazon, has announced the formation of a dedicated team to accelerate the adoption of its AI products within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. This development underscores the exploding growth in the AI cloud sector and the intensifying competition among tech giants. Unveiling the Anthropic AWS Partnership Team: What’s the Big Deal? Anthropic’s creation of this new team isn’t just another corporate reshuffle; it’s a clear indicator of the escalating importance of their relationship with Amazon. Here’s a breakdown of why this news is significant: Dedicated Focus: This team is solely dedicated to growing Anthropic’s business within AWS. This concentrated effort suggests a serious commitment to leveraging AWS’s massive customer base. Revenue Driven: Job listings explicitly mention “multi-billion dollar revenue opportunities,” highlighting the immense financial stakes and expectations tied to this partnership. Strategic Alignment: The team will work closely with senior leadership from both Anthropic and Amazon, indicating a deeply integrated and strategically aligned approach. Global Scale: The initiative aims to build programs that scale across global markets, showcasing the ambition to establish Anthropic’s AI as a leading solution worldwide through the AWS infrastructure. This dedicated team is designed to be a growth engine, specifically targeting AWS customers to integrate Anthropic’s cutting-edge AI models, like the Claude family, into their operations. For those in the crypto space tracking technological advancements, this move exemplifies how AI infrastructure is being built on cloud platforms, mirroring the foundations of many blockchain projects. How Does This Impact AI Cloud Growth and the Competitive Landscape? The Anthropic AWS Partnership is a powerful combination with significant implications for the broader AI and cloud computing sectors. Consider these key impacts: Impact Area Description Accelerated AI Adoption By making Anthropic’s AI more readily accessible to AWS customers, this partnership will likely accelerate the overall adoption of advanced AI technologies across various industries. AWS Competitive Edge Exclusivity and optimized performance of Anthropic’s models on AWS Bedrock give Amazon a competitive advantage in attracting businesses seeking robust AI solutions. Anthropic Revenue Surge Leveraging AWS’s vast reach can propel Anthropic towards its ambitious revenue targets, aiming for $12 billion by 2027. Market Consolidation Concerns Regulatory bodies are scrutinizing these deep tech partnerships, raising questions about potential market dominance and reduced competition in the AI landscape. For crypto investors, the growth of the AI cloud growth sector is relevant as it represents a significant area of technological advancement and investment. Just as cloud infrastructure underpins much of the current internet, it is becoming the bedrock for the AI revolution. The success of companies like Anthropic and their partnerships with cloud giants like AWS will shape the future of AI accessibility and deployment. AWS AI Adoption : Why are Customers Turning to Anthropic? What makes Anthropic’s AI so appealing to AWS customers? Several factors are at play: Cutting-Edge Models: Anthropic’s Claude models are recognized for their advanced capabilities in natural language processing and understanding, attracting businesses needing sophisticated AI. AWS Bedrock Optimization: Anthropic has specifically optimized its models to run efficiently on AWS Bedrock, offering performance advantages and exclusive features. Seamless Integration: Collaborations with AWS partners like Accenture and Palantir streamline the integration of Anthropic’s AI into existing enterprise workflows via the AWS ecosystem. Proven Track Record: The fact that “tens of thousands” of Bedrock customers are already using Claude models speaks to the technology’s proven value and reliability. The ease of AWS AI adoption through platforms like Bedrock is a key driver for businesses. For the crypto community, this ease of access mirrors the ongoing efforts to simplify blockchain technology and cryptocurrency adoption for mainstream users. The Regulatory Gaze on Anthropic Revenue and Big Tech Partnerships While the Anthropic AWS Partnership promises growth and innovation, it’s also attracting regulatory scrutiny. Here’s what you need to know about the oversight: FTC Investigation: The Federal Trade Commission is examining the impacts of Big Tech investments in AI startups like Anthropic, concerned about competitive balance. CMA Scrutiny: The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority investigated whether Amazon’s partnership gives it undue influence over Anthropic. Focus on Lock-in and Data: Regulators are concerned that these partnerships could lead to vendor lock-in and the sharing of sensitive data, potentially undermining fair competition. No Enforcement (Yet): While concerns are present, neither the FTC nor CMA has initiated enforcement action against the Anthropic-Amazon deal so far. The regulatory landscape is crucial for the long-term trajectory of the AI industry. For crypto markets familiar with regulatory uncertainties, the scrutiny of Anthropic revenue streams and Big Tech influence is a familiar narrative. The balance between fostering innovation and ensuring fair competition remains a key challenge. Cloud AI Strategy : What Does This Mean for the Future? The Anthropic AWS Partnership is a microcosm of the broader cloud AI strategy being adopted by major tech players. Key takeaways for the future include: Cloud as the AI Platform: Cloud infrastructure is solidifying its position as the primary platform for developing, deploying, and scaling AI solutions. Strategic Alliances: Deep partnerships between AI specialists and cloud providers will become increasingly common to drive innovation and market reach. Focus on Enterprise Adoption: The focus is shifting towards making AI accessible and practical for enterprise applications, driving real-world business value. Continued Regulatory Scrutiny: Expect ongoing regulatory attention to ensure a competitive and fair AI market as these partnerships evolve. In conclusion, Anthropic’s dedicated AWS team signifies a major push to capitalize on the exploding AI cloud growth . This partnership is not just about two companies; it’s a bellwether for the direction of the AI industry, highlighting the crucial role of cloud platforms and strategic alliances in shaping the future of artificial intelligence. For those in the cryptocurrency world, understanding these technological shifts is vital as AI and blockchain technologies potentially converge and reshape industries in the years to come.

But despite its recent rally, a jump to $20 — a figure often thrown around by ultra-bullish holders — would require historic levels of market cap expansion and investor inflows. While XRP fights for every dollar of growth, a new contender is making waves with a much lower barrier to upside: MAGACOIN FINANCE , a fast-growing altcoin project catching the attention of traders and analysts alike. Here’s a quick look at where XRP stands right now: Current Price: $2.13 Intraday High: $2.21 Intraday Low: $2.08 24-Hour Change: +0.019% Despite solid price action, even the most optimistic analysts agree — reaching $20 would require XRP to become the second-largest asset in all of crypto. That’s a tall order. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering something far simpler: massive upside from a micro price. FROM $0.0002908 TO $0.007 — A STRAIGHTFORWARD 25X OPPORTUNITY MAGACOIN FINANCE recently SOLD OUT Stage 6 of its presale and is now gaining steam with Stage 7 LIVE . Its current presale price sits at $0.0002908 , with a confirmed listing target of $0.007 — translating to a direct 25x ROI , or 2,300% gain for early investors. That kind of return doesn’t require a billion-dollar market cap shift — it just takes continued presale momentum and strong post-listing demand. So far, the project is delivering both. Already trending in crypto news outlets , MAGACOIN FINANCE is now featured by major crypto publishers , with over 12,500 holders joining the movement in just a few weeks. WHY ANALYSTS CALL IT A NEXT 100X ALTCoin JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW The appeal isn’t just in the numbers. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as a textbook early-stage opportunity , with the kind of viral community traction and presale structure that helped previous breakout projects gain liftoff. Many experts believe a CMC listing is around the corner , further elevating visibility just as demand spikes heading into the final presale stages. XRP may or may not hit $20 — but MAGACOIN FINANCE doesn’t need to go anywhere near that to make millionaires. The path to 25x is already in place,” said one analyst in a recent April watchlist update. FINAL THOUGHT: DIFFERENT GAME, DIFFERENT TIMELINE 🔥 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER — ENDS SOON! USE MAGA50X XRP still holds long-term potential — but it’s a slow grind to the top. MAGACOIN FINANCE , on the other hand, is built for momentum now. With its low price point, massive upside potential, and strong pre-launch interest, it’s become one of the most talked-about tokens heading into Q2. With Stage 7 now LIVE , a presale price of just $0.0002908 , and a listing target of $0.007 , the setup is clear. You don’t need a $20 token when a 25x return is sitting right in front of you.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 149,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s weekly logarithmic moving average convergence divergence (LMACD) histogram indicator is starting to strengthen, signaling a possible rally. The LMACD histogram indicator is designed to signal changes in an asset’s trend, strength and momentum. Shrinking bars on the histogram suggest that an asset’s trend momentum is weakening. In Bitcoin’s case, the histogram’s declining red bars may indicate that a market reversal is in sight. Says Dave the Wave, “Bull markets climb a wall of worry. First strengthening histogram on the weekly BTC chart in 18 weeks/4.5 months. Weekly MACD itself has not been below the zero-line, in bear territory, since Feb 2023, i.e.; an ongoing bull market.

43387832,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=731865,1744761655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43387832.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Fails To Launch With $751 Million In Outflows, Are Institutions Cashing Out?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-sees-massive-outflows/,"The Bitcoin price continues to face headwinds, as the latest report on Digital Asset Fund Flows shows a staggering $751 million in outflows from the digital asset. The sheer volume of this withdrawal raises alarm bells about whether institutions may be cashing out from the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price Faces Pressure Amid Massive Outflows CoinShares’ weekly report on Digital Asset Fund Flows has disclosed a massive $795 million in outflows from the crypto market—shockingly, $751 million of which came from Bitcoin alone. This mass exodus marks one of the largest single-week outflows of the year, and it comes at a time when the price of Bitcoin has hit a wall. Related Reading: $9.41 Billion In Shorts At Risk Of Liquidation If Bitcoin Price Hits This Level James Butterfill, the Head of Research at CoinShares, revealed that since early February 2025, digital asset investment products have suffered cumulative outflows of approximately $7.2 billion, effectively erasing almost all the year-to-date inflows. Notably, this week marks the third consecutive week of declines, with Bitcoin leading the downturn and recording the most significant losses among major digital assets. As of this report, net flows for 2025 have dwindled to a modest $165 million, a sharp drop from a multi-billion dollar peak just two months ago. This steep decline underscores a cooling sentiment among institutional investors and highlights a growing sense of caution amid ongoing market volatility. Currently, the Bitcoin price is struggling to regain past all-time highs, with recent outflows serving as one of the many barriers hindering the cryptocurrency’s breakout potential. Until these outflows reverse and the market stabilizes, Bitcoin’s path to setting new all-time highs remains challenged. Despite losing $751 million in outflows, Bitcoin still maintains a moderately positive position with $545 million in net year-to-date inflows. However, the sheer scale and speed of the latest outflows raise concern. The fact that Bitcoin suffered such a massive withdrawal signals a potential shift in sentiment among institutions. Whether it’s due to profit-taking or macroeconomic uncertainty, this move suggests that big players are beginning to pull out — at least in the short term. In addition to Bitcoin, Ethereum saw $37 million in outflows, while Solana, Aave, and SUI also posted losses of $5.1 million, $0.78 million, and $0.58 million, respectively. Surprisingly, even short Bitcoin products, designed to benefit from market downturns, weren’t spared, recording $4.6 million in outflows. Tariffs And Political Volatility Drive Outflows One of the key drivers behind the pullback across digital assets is the rising economic uncertainty sparked by tariff policies that have adversely influenced investor sentiment. The wave of negative sentiment began in February after United States (US) President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on all imports coming into the country from Canada, Mexico, and China. Related Reading: Trump’s Tariff Pause Could Push Bitcoin Price Above $100,000, Pundit Reveals Exit Point However, a late-week rebound in crypto prices was seen after Trump’s temporary reversal of the controversial tariffs, providing a brief respite for the market. This policy shift helped boost total Asset Under Management (AUM) across digital assets from a low of $120 billion on April 8 to $130 billion, marking an 8% recovery.

While both coins remain in focus, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing broader attention after raising $214 million and posting a 2,380% rise in price. Now, its newly launched 600% Golden Ticket offer is drawing waves of new participants. With special airdrop access and a major global convention on the horizon, interest continues to climb. The highly anticipated 7th AMA, scheduled for April 17, has further added to the momentum surrounding what many now view as one of 2025’s most promising blockchain stories. Solana’s 16.7% Recovery Strengthens Confidence Among Big Players Solana’s price trend is beginning to shift in a positive direction. After retreating close to the $100 mark, it has climbed back by 16.7%, now holding steady above $120. Analysts link this upward move to renewed accumulation from major entities, highlighted by a recent $3.72 million SOL acquisition by a large whale—a strong show of faith in Solana’s future growth. Chart indicators back this optimism. Solana has established firm support above $100 and has moved past a key downward trendline at $107. The next notable zones to watch are $130 and $140, which may trigger further upside action. With its fast, low-cost framework still favored by developers, Solana continues to stand out as a key Layer-1 altcoin heading into the second quarter. Dogecoin Gears Up for Potential Breakout Toward $0.40 Dogecoin is showing early signs of building momentum. Currently trading near $0.14, it’s been consolidating tightly, with forecasts now pointing toward a jump to $0.21 or even a possible test of $0.40 if the trend holds. Technical markers like the RSI suggest bullish behavior is gaining ground, indicating an upward breakout could be forming. Excitement around Dogecoin has been revived by ETF rumors and rising usage across payment platforms. These developments are reigniting interest from retail buyers, especially as it nears key resistance levels. If these barriers are crossed, Dogecoin could reenter the spotlight with strong price action in the coming sessions. BlockDAG’s 600% Golden Ticket Pushes Presale Success Higher Beyond what’s happening with Solana and Dogecoin, BlockDAG’s achievements continue to set it apart. In just ten months, the project has generated $214 million in crypto presale funds while climbing 2,380% in price. But the latest move—the launch of its 600% Golden Ticket bonus—is taking things to a new level. Anyone joining the ecosystem with code BDAG1200 will receive 600% more coins, setting a new benchmark for presale incentives. Alongside this, participants will also receive early access to an exclusive coin airdrop, adding further appeal. These features, backed by strong project fundamentals, have pushed BlockDAG to the top of the Layer-1 conversations heading into 2025. The campaign is being actively highlighted ahead of the April 17 AMA, where the team plans to reveal fresh roadmap updates and strategic initiatives. There’s also strong excitement around the first BlockDAG Global Convention, which will move the discussion from digital platforms to live events in multiple cities. While the full schedule remains under wraps, those attending are expected to gain early exposure to various elements of the BlockDAG network. CEO Antony Turner, speaking during the third keynote, described the current phase by saying: “We’re not simply dreaming about the future—we’re shaping it, building it, and defining it with purpose and commitment.” The platform’s hybrid model—blending Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with Proof-of-Work (PoW)—delivers both scalability and security. This architecture enables parallel transaction handling without compromising on decentralization. With large-scale miner preparation already underway, BlockDAG is delivering the kind of performance many protocols only claim to provide. Final Words! Solana’s recent price growth and Dogecoin’s move toward key levels are both worth watching, but BlockDAG’s numbers already show strong traction. A 600% Golden Ticket bonus, $214 million raised, exclusive airdrops, and a fast-approaching AMA give this project real presence. People joining the platform are doing so for its performance, community rewards, and its practical use potential. From mining to long-term engagement and network activity, BlockDAG offers a wide range of features. As the Global Convention nears, the project continues to shift expectations for what a presale success can look like in 2025.

Its inclusion in the exchange’s second “Vote to Delist” program triggered strong community backlash and renewed discussion about privacy’s role in crypto. While voting remains open until April 16, 2025, but Binance’s final decision rests on internal checks like liquidity and development activity. Including Zcash for vote raised concerns, voiced by figures like Gemini Co-Founder Tyler Winklevoss, about exchanges sidelining privacy tech. Crypto advocate Zooko tagged Binance CEO Richard Teng, arguing Zcash’s inclusion is unjustified. Zcash is privacy technology that protects human rights. I hope @binance does not delist it.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell to $83,600, extending the retreat from the two-week high of $86,440 reached earlier in the day, CoinDesk data showed. Payments-focused XRP followed a similar trajectory, falling over 2% to $2.08, while Cardano's ADA token slipped 4% to $0.61. The CoinDesk 20 Index , a broader market gauge, weakened over 2%. Meanwhile, coins supposedly associated with artificial intelligence (AI) continued to fare worse as shares in NVDA tanked 8% to $89.10 after the company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it expects to write down $5.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter due to the new restrictions on exports of its H20 chip to China. The news came a day after unusual activity in NVDA put options pointing to an impending market swoon. The futures tied to the Nasdaq index fell over 1% as well, offering negative cues to risk assets in general. The next catalyst awaiting release Wednesday morning Eastern time is the U.S. retail sales report for March. Per economists polled by Dow Jones, the data is expected to show a 1.2% increase in consumer spending on the month, up from a 0.2% climb in February. A better-than-expected report will likely help assuage recession fears triggered by President Donald Trump's trade war with China and other trading partners. However, there is a risk that markets will dismiss it as backward-looking, failing to account for the major escalation in trade tensions seen this month. Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell is also scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago on his outlook for the U.S. economy. ""All eyes are on Powell. Markets are holding their breath for Powell on Wednesday. Between the trade war and rising recession chatter, traders are watching for any hint the Fed might be forced to cut sooner than expected,"" Secure Digital Markets said in Tuesday's research note. The forward-looking market-based measures like the inflation breakevens have dropped amid trade tensions, pointing to the disinflationary impact of Trump's tariffs. That could provide the Fed with a leeway to cut rates. Early this week, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the bank would be forced to quickly make a series of ""bad news"" rate cuts if the U.S. president reimposes the levies unveiled on April 2. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations on April 2 but quickly suspended the same for most nations, excluding China, for 90 days.

Mantra set aside 300 million OM, 16.88% of the token’s nearly 1.78 billion total supply, for its team and core contributors. They are currently locked and were scheduled to be released in stages between April 2027 and October 2029, according to an April 8 blog post. The team’s tokens are worth around $236 million, with OM currently trading around 78 cents but were worth around $1.89 billion before the token sank on April 13, going from around $6.30 to a low of 52 cents and wiping over $5.5 billion in value, according to CoinGecko. Source: JP Mullin Many community members welcomed Mullin’s pledge, but others saw the token burn as a potential blow to the team’s long-term commitment to building the real-world asset tokenization platform. “This would be a mistake. We want teams that are highly incentivized. Burning the incentive may seem like a good gesture but it will hurt the team motivation long term,” said Crypto Banter founder Ran Neuner. Mullin suggested a decentralized vote could determine whether to burn the 300 million team tokens. Mantra recovery process already underway Mullin promised a post-mortem statement explaining what went wrong to be transparent with the community. Speaking to Cointelegraph on April 14, Mullin outlined plans to leverage the $109 million Mantra Ecosystem Fund for potential token buybacks and burns to stabilize OM’s price, which had fallen from $6.30 to as low as $0.52. Related: Red flag? Mantra's TVL jumped 500% as OM price collapsed Mullin’s firm has strongly refuted rumors that it controls 90% of OM’s token supply and engaged in insider trading and market manipulation. Mantra claims the OM price implosion was triggered by “reckless liquidations,"" adding that it wasn’t related to any actions undertaken by the team. OKX and Binance were among the crypto exchanges that saw significant OM activity right before the token collapse. Both exchanges denied any wrongdoing, attributing the collapse to changes made to OM’s tokenomics in October and unusual volatility that ultimately triggered high-volume cross-exchange liquidations on April 13.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) together with Dogecoin (DOGE) benefit from whale accumulation and technical breakouts yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart as a presale project which combines DeFi utility and explosive growth dynamics. The Phase 4 presale of MUTM has drawn $6.8 million from 8,300 holders as the project aims for a 67% increase while DOGE seeks triple-digit gains and SHIB prepares for a similar climb. This demonstrates an investor movement toward operational financial crypto projects. Shiba Inu Nears Critical Resistance Shiba Inu (SHIB) challenges the crucial resistance point of $0.00001201 while awaiting a breakthrough to determine its forthcoming movement. Experts predict that breakout levels above the current barrier at $0.00001201 could spark a 67% price surge toward $0.00002 because of daily trading at $194 million. SHIB faces a challenge given that its $7.08 billion market value exists in spite of meme-based speculation when compared to new crypto systems offering defined infrastructure. The SHIB price moves with market sentiments combined with retail public opinion at present yet future investors in the MUTM presale can avoid volatility by using stepwise increasing price point tiers. Dogecoin Whales Fuel Optimism Dogecoin brought the price back to $0.16 which indicates that whales may create a 3x price rise to $0.50 as they buy 1.83 billion tokens worth $640.5 million. Dogecoin shows possible upward movement based on the falling wedge pattern combined with bullish RSI divergence but its price action remains controlled by macroeconomic trends and social media trending effects. Derivatives market open interest has risen 5.62 percent to $1.5 billion while this derivative lacks fundamental value which exposes it to intense market sentiment changes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a lending solution by using its mtTokens to drive organic demand and implementing revenue-dependent buyback strategies which mitigate market instabilities. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) established new presale standards through the sale of 405 million tokens at $0.025 during Phase 4. The start of Phase 5 sees Mutuum Finance increasing their token price from $0.03 which would give all current investors an instant 20% return before the platform goes live. The planned tokenomics will enable a 140% ROI at the $0.06 listing price followed by projected market developments that anticipate a price surge to $3.50 which represents a 13,900% increase from current market value. MUTM provides unique value as a decentralized lending protocol that generates interest through mtToken and stake rewards which builds continuous buying momentum unlike the absence in meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a Certik smart contract audit which will receive its official release soon. The investment community gains more confidence through this measure at the same time its pre-sales become increasingly popular thanks to new tracking tools monitoring the top 50 holders. Participants who hold their positions receive bonus items that encourage holding time through additional tokens while promoting price stability following the project launch. Getting In Fast In the Market Changes While SHIB and DOGE hinge on speculative rallies, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) merges DeFi innovation with presale urgency. Phase 4 offers a $0.025 entry point that is quickly disappearing which will significantly reduce possible profits for those who join during Phase 5. The initial positions taken by early supporters in the present moment give them the opportunity to enjoy a 140% upward movement at MUTM’s launch and onward exponential expansion when its lending system activates. The declining reputation of Cardano contrasts with these alternative cryptocurrencies which choose different directions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives investors a calculated DeFi entry ticket during Phase 5 while SHIB and DOGE represent a high-risk hype-centered opportunity. The time remains short for prospective investors who want to achieve first-mover advantage because Phase 4 has started and audits are approaching. Secure your position in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 4 today—before prices rise and tokens sell out.

ETFs will include staking via TD pic.twitter.com/FSw149Xkm4 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 14, 2025 Staking Features Could Boost Returns For Investors One of the main features distinguishing these Solana ETFs is their capacity for staking the underlying SOL positions. The OSC has allowed the issuers of ETFs to stake some portion of their Solana, and this could unlock extra returns for investors in excess of price appreciation alone. TD Bank reported that returns from staking SOL can be higher than those from Ethereum staking, and thus these products could be more appealing to yield-starved investors. The bank also referred to them as “the world’s first spot Solana ETFs,” emphasizing the innovative character of these financial products. US Solana ETF Market Experiences Mixed Results The US market so far has only futures-based Solana ETFs, with limited success. Balchunas noted that two SOL futures ETFs in the United States, Volatility Shares 2x SOL ETF and Volatility Shares SOL ETF, have failed to gain investor attention since their launch in March 2025. Both of these products have only accumulated a combined assets under management of nearly $14 million. For comparison, the Teucrium 2x XRP ETF performed better even though it came out later after the SOL products, implying unequal investor interest in disparate cryptocurrency ETFs.

He advised followers not to engage with the account until prominent attorney John Deaton could verify whether it had been compromised. “This post looks wrong in many ways. Please do not trust this until you see confirmation he hasn’t been hacked,” David Schwartz wrote . The warning followed a post by John Deaton on X touting Arch Public , a crypto-related website. To long-time followers, the post (tagging big names, including crypto exchange Gemini) came across as an endorsement and raised eyebrows. Recognized for his vocal, energetic defense of XRP holders and calls for regulatory clarity, including recent lobbying for the Hinman documents to see the light of day, Deaton usually sticks with legal skirmishes, policy wonkery, and the rights of crypto investors. By contrast, the Arch Public post came across as strange, with some market watchers finding its lack of background, explanation, or context that usually makes its way into his updates suspicious. Deaton breaks silence to reaffirm intentions, vows to address concerns in live session Ripple CTO urged the lawyer’s 354,000 followers to remain cautious following the suspicious post. His concern sparked reactions from other users. Many began questioning whether Deaton’s account had been taken over, especially with the unusually long silence. Others shared screenshots of the post, highlighting the red flags in its writing. Deaton later issued a clarification in response. He reiterated his devotion to democratizing investing for everyday people , a cause he argued has informed why he has backed projects like XRP, Bitcoin, SpendTheBits, and the free algorithm from ArchPublic. These projects, he said, were intended to give everyday investors access to opportunities that have traditionally been available only to the financial elite. Deaton acknowledged past criticism, including accusations of being a Ripple plant and being targeted by Bitcoin maximalists. However, he maintained that if a tool can help people build wealth without requiring payment or risk, he’s willing to stand behind it—regardless of skepticism. He continued to say that he was traveling and hoped to go live on April 16, 2025, on X at 3 PM EST to address concerns or questions. He noted that he was grateful for genuine concern and misinformation or misperception. Deaton also addressed some of his criticism, including allegations that he was a “Ripple plant” and backlash from Bitcoin maximalists. Still, he continues to stand by his belief that if a platform can help people build wealth without needing to put money on the line or risk anything, it’s worth his support. Deaton noted that he would go live on X at 3 PM EST on April 16, 2025, since he was traveling. He noted that he intended to clear up “any question that anyone was confused about. He was grateful for the legitimate concern and acknowledged the mix of misinformation surrounding the incident.

Additionally, on April 15, h ackers targeting Ethereum scaling protocol ZKsync stole about $5 million of its native ZK crypto because of “a compromised” administrative account that allowed them to take control of unclaimed tokens from a recent airdrop. The crypto industry has suffered a series of thefts, prompting questions about the security of customer funds, with hacking hauls totaling more than $2 billion in 2024 – the fourth straight year where proceeds have topped more than $1 billion.

BlockDAG’s New Testnet Launch Shakes Up HBAR & XLM Holders,https://thecoinrise.com/is-1-bdag-closer-than-you-think-blockdags-new-testnet-launch-shakes-up-hbar-xlm-holders/,"Investors are watching closely as three major altcoins make headlines—Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), and BlockDAG (BDAG). While all three coins show signs of potential growth, only one is pairing that potential with hard, measurable progress. Stellar (XLM) is recovering from a steep 65% drop, with analysts pointing to a descending wedge—a bullish technical pattern. If confirmed, this could signal a short-term rally toward $0.42 or even $0.47. Similarly, Hedera (HBAR) has spiked 10% after announcing integration with Chainlink’s cross-chain protocol (CCIP), broadening its access to over 46 networks. Momentum indicators show short-term promise, though a decisive break above $0.20 is needed for confidence in long-term gains. But while XLM and HBAR offer “if-this-then-that” scenarios, BlockDAG is already executing. A live Beta Testnet with over 170,000 active wallets, 10,000 custom ASIC miners en route before the mainnet, and a $214 million presale without any institutional capital? That’s not speculation. That’s traction. BDAG has jumped 2,380% since Batch 1, now priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27—and that growth is rooted in delivery, not hype. Stellar (XLM) Eyes Breakout After 65% Crash – Is This the Start of a Big Rebound? Stellar (XLM) might be gearing up for a strong comeback after dropping over 65% since its November 2024 high of $0.636. The coin is now trading inside a descending wedge—a pattern that often signals a bullish breakout. On April 7, XLM bounced off a key support area near $0.21, backed by a bullish candlestick and key Fibonacci level. While the RSI remains below 50, showing lingering bearish momentum, the MACD hints at a trend shift. Chart analysts also spot a completed five-wave downtrend, suggesting a potential rally could be next, targeting $0.37 to $0.42. With Stellar sponsoring the 2025 Paris Blockchain Week, momentum could build fast. If the breakout confirms, XLM might push even higher toward $0.47. For buyers eyeing a high-upside play after a major correction, Stellar could be a solid bet in the coming weeks. HBAR Surges After Chainlink Deal — Is This Just the Beginning? Hedera’s (HBAR) recent 10% spike comes after big news: it’s now integrated with Chainlink’s cross-chain protocol (CCIP), connecting it to over 46 blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB, and Polygon. This move boosts Hedera’s DeFi potential, especially with its current low $70 million total value locked. HBAR is now testing a key resistance after bouncing from $0.126. While momentum indicators show strength, short-term charts hint at exhaustion. Still, long-term buyers might see an opportunity if HBAR breaks past $0.1675 and targets the $0.20 mark. Hedera’s edge lies in its speed—processing up to 10,000 transactions per second—far ahead of Ethereum and Bitcoin. If this Chainlink deal gains traction, HBAR could rally further. With trading volumes surging and market attention shifting, HBAR is warming up. For those eyeing a strong project with real-world use, now might be the time to watch HBAR closely. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Goes Live as $1 Price Target Draws Closer BlockDAG has officially launched its live Beta Testnet, marking a major step forward for the project. Over 170,000 users are already exploring the network, each receiving 10,000 BDAG testnet coins through a structured vesting model that mirrors how the mainnet will function. This isn’t just for show—the testnet provides real usage data, helping shape the final version of the network. Unlike many other crypto projects, BlockDAG is using the testnet as a practical onboarding tool, not just a promotional stunt. At the same time, BlockDAG’s custom mining hardware is being prepared for rollout. Around 10,000 X30 and X100 ASIC miners are set to ship before the 2025 mainnet launch. The presale results speak volumes: $214 million raised and 19.3 billion BDAG coins sold without support from big-name buyers. Since Batch 1, BDAG has climbed an impressive 2,380%, now priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27. With this kind of momentum, a move past the $1 mark isn’t just possible—it’s starting to look likely. BlockDAG isn’t just making promises—it’s delivering real progress. BlockDAG’s Going Viral In April — Here’s Why It Matters XLM and HBAR may eventually confirm bullish patterns or unlock new utility through integrations. But so far, these developments remain early-stage catalysts—ideas still needing validation in the open market. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is already operating like a post-mainnet project. Its Beta Testnet is live and growing. Real data is being collected. Real users are engaging with the ecosystem. The hardware layer is readying for deployment, creating a full-stack approach—rare even among top-tier layer-1 chains. The presale’s $214M raise and sale of 19.3 billion coins without VC or institutional support speaks to one thing: community belief built on delivery. As the $1 price target draws closer, BDAG isn’t chasing trends—it’s setting them. For serious crypto buyers looking for a project that’s past promises and into proof, BDAG offers the clearest signal in a crowded altcoin market.

BlockDAG Presale Hits $214M In April — Can Pi Coin or MANTRA Catch Up?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/over-2380-roi-blockdag-presale-hits-214m-in-april-can-pi-coin-or-mantra-catch-up/,"In a market driven by hype cycles and social sentiment, clarity comes not from the loudest project but from the one that’s delivering under the radar. Right now, three names are making noise for very different reasons. Pi Coin is attracting attention with its ambitious $3 price target, driven by controlled coin unlocks, strong community backing, and speculation around a potential coin burn. While still unlisted on major exchanges, it’s managed to build an active ecosystem that has early believers hopeful for a breakout—if execution follows promise. MANTRA (OM) is taking a bolder route, positioning itself as a serious contender in the Real-World Asset (RWA) and DeFi infrastructure space. With strategic backing from names like Google Cloud and partnerships with entities such as DAMAC and ZAND Bank, its momentum is real. Then there’s BlockDAG (BDAG)—a project less dependent on what might happen and more rooted in what already has. A presale raising over $214 million, third-party security audits from Halborn and CertiK, and a staggering 2,380% ROI since Batch 1—all point to one thing: buyer confidence backed by real fundamentals. While others sell potential, BlockDAG is quietly delivering results. Pi Coin Eyes $3? Here’s Why buyers Are Buzzing Over the Latest Price Jump Pi Coin surged over 9% recently, sparking excitement that it could hit $3 by June. Trading around $0.58, the rebound comes amid low coin unlocks and growing market confidence. Analysts say a possible coin burn by the Pi Core Team could balance supply, boosting chances for a rally. Despite recent dips, the Pi Network is gaining traction. With nearly $94 million worth of coins set to unlock in the next month, supply pressure remains, but optimism is high. If positive news drops and momentum holds, Pi could break resistance at $0.6133 and head higher. For early buyers, this could be a golden window. If Pi delivers on development promises, returns could multiply. Still, crypto markets are unpredictable—so watch key levels closely and don’t miss what might be Pi’s next big breakout. MANTRA (OM) Set for a Big 2025? Here’s Why Smart buyers Are Watching Closely MANTRA (OM) is quickly becoming a major player in the real-world asset (RWA) coinization and DeFi space. With the upcoming launch of Mantra Chain and partnerships with names like DAMAC, ZAND Bank, and Google Cloud, the project is gaining serious momentum. The $108 million MANTRA Ecosystem Fund aims to supercharge growth, backed by key players like Laser Digital and Amber Group. Whale activity also shows strong confidence—recent large buys followed earlier sell-offs, hinting at a bullish long-term outlook. OM is now trading around $6.34, holding strong above key moving averages. A push past $6.50 could trigger a run to $8 or even $10. For buyers looking to enter the RWA sector early, buying OM on dips near $5.60 with a stop loss at $4 could be a smart move ahead of 2025 gains. BlockDAG’s Secure Approach Wins Buyer Trust as Presale Crosses $210M BlockDAG is turning heads in the crypto space—not with flashy promises, but with real progress and solid foundations. Unlike many projects that rush to launch, BlockDAG has focused on building a secure, scalable ecosystem from the ground up. Its recent Keynote 3 update emphasized the project’s commitment to transparency and long-term reliability. Backed by thorough audits from top security firms Halborn and CertiK, BlockDAG has implemented advanced multi-layer protection. These independent checks aren’t just for show—they prove the platform is built to last. The presale numbers are just as impressive. BlockDAG has already raised over $214 million, selling more than 19.1 billion coins. Now in Batch 27, each BDAG coin is priced at $0.0248. Early participants, who bought in at just $0.001 during Batch 1, have seen returns of up to 2,380%. With this kind of growth and a strong security backbone, BlockDAG is quickly becoming a top pick for buyers looking for more than just hype. It’s not just a coin—it’s a carefully built ecosystem designed for real, lasting impact. What’s Next? Pi Coin is speculative, driven by timing and tokenomics. It has potential—but relies on future decisions from the core team to meet its $3 ambition. MANTRA is better structured, with visible industry partnerships and a growing footprint in RWA tokenization. It’s a serious contender, especially if adoption increases and Mantra Chain delivers. But BlockDAG is in another league—already proving its model works, both technically and financially. Its security-first approach, validated by top-tier audits, instills rare confidence in a market known for rug pulls and broken roadmaps. Add to that a transparent presale strategy, a massive fundraising milestone, and a product focus beyond hype—and it’s clear who’s playing the long game.

You get a digital ecosystem that doesn’t just survive—it dominates. From decentralized finance integrations to enterprise tools disrupting inefficient systems, these three names stand out. Qubetics , Avalanche, and Chainlink are not riding trends; they’re writing the blueprint for what’s next. Avalanche is gearing up for a game-changing upgrade that slashes transaction costs and boosts scalability. Chainlink is quietly locking arms with major players like PayPal and Ripple. These aren’t casual updates—they signal serious momentum. Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping in where traditional networks stalled—overcoming compatibility roadblocks, simplifying smart contract development, and future-proofing finance for the real world. With the QubeQode IDE, Qubetics enables seamless app deployment across chains, fixes cross-network fragmentation, and puts control directly into the hands of devs and digital natives. It’s precisely what blockchain needed to grow up. Qubetics ($TICS): Developer Freedom Meets Scalable Real-World Tools Qubetics isn’t built for hype. It’s engineered for function. The project offers a powerful mix of real-world utility and developer-first design that makes it one of the top cryptos to join this week. The QubeQode IDE is at the center of this evolution—a next-gen integrated development environment that simplifies multi-chain application building. Whether a fintech platform needs cross-border transaction tools or a logistics company demands transparent supply chain data, QubeQode can deliver, with speed and precision. More than 24,800 token holders have already joined the Qubetics network, with over 508 million $TICS tokens sold. The best crypto presale is in its 30 stage and has raised over $16.1 million, with $TICS currently priced at $0.1729. For early buyers seeking strong fundamentals and explosive potential, Qubetics isn’t just one of the top cryptos to join this week — it’s the platform that answers critical market needs. A $200 Play Could Flip into Life-Changing Value A $200 contribution fetches roughly 1,156 $TICS tokens. If the token’s value reaches $10, you’re sitting on $11,560—from just a couple of hundred dollars. It’s the type of move that gets overlooked until it’s too late. That’s how early-stage wealth begins—quietly, before it gets loud. This level of entry is already proving popular among freelancers, remote workers, and everyday professionals looking to escape unstable local currencies. It’s not about throwing big money—it’s about planting it in the right soil. Qubetics is proving fertile for those who act early. Avalanche (AVAX) Surges 16% as DeFi Rebounds and Real-World Adoption Gains Traction Avalanche (AVAX) has posted an impressive 16% weekly gain, trading around $19.90. This growth reflects renewed momentum in its DeFi ecosystem, with Total Value Locked (TVL) surging to $1.63 billion across more than 430 protocols. Platforms like Benqi, Trader Joe, and Aave are driving this revival, with Benqi reporting a 19% increase in lending and borrowing operations. Analysts note that if AVAX breaks through the $24–$26 resistance zone, it could make a strong push toward the $30 mark—territory last reached in early February. Meanwhile, institutional inflows into AVAX-based DeFi solutions have jumped 28% quarter-over-quarter, signaling deeper trust and interest from professional market participants. Looking ahead, Avalanche is preparing for a massive infrastructure leap with its Avalanche9000 upgrade, expected in December 2025. This update is set to reduce deployment costs for layer-1 networks by a staggering 99.9%, signaling a structural change rather than a simple performance improvement. Developers, enterprises, and institutions alike are eyeing this upgrade as a game-changer for scalability and cost-efficiency. On top of that, transaction fees on the C-Chain are expected to drop by 25%, making DeFi and cross-chain operations more accessible for the average user. Beyond the technical breakthroughs, Avalanche is driving adoption in the real world. The newly introduced Avalanche Card allows users to spend AVAX, USDT, and USDC anywhere Visa is accepted—merging digital assets with everyday commerce. This real-world payment utility, combined with upcoming scalability advancements, places Avalanche among the top cryptos to join this week. While many chains promise performance, Avalanche is delivering measurable utility, bringing blockchain from code to checkout in a way few projects can match. Pi Network Integrates Chainlink, LINK Boosts Utility Across Web3 Chainlink has officially integrated Pi Network into its decentralized oracle services, enabling real-time Pi token pricing through 22 new data feeds. This move enhances Pi’s ability to support smart contracts, DeFi, and blockchain gaming with secure external data. Since the announcement, Pi Coin surged over 30%, with bullish forecasts predicting a climb toward $2.5. The integration marks a key milestone in Chainlink’s expansion into broader ecosystems. Chainlink is the infrastructure giant most community members don’t see—until they use an app powered by its oracles. It’s had a bumpy road price-wise, hitting a recent low of $11.87, but don’t mistake that for weakness. LINK has found solid ground at a 644-day trendline. Technically, that sets the stage for stronger moves. What’s more interesting, though, is what’s happening off-chain. Chainlink has integrated with PayPal and Venmo as of April 2025, making its tech accessible to a wider consumer base. It’s also partnered with Ripple to enhance RLUSD’s pricing accuracy and reliability. Even Aave has adopted Chainlink’s Smart Value Recapture (SVR) to tighten DeFi efficiency. For those focused on protocol strength and cross-industry integration, Chainlink remains one of the top cryptos to join this week. It doesn’t aim for the spotlight—it builds the infrastructure that others rely on. Why These Three Projects Stand Out This Week While many tokens chase trends, Qubetics, Avalanche, and Chainlink are solving hard problems with precision. Qubetics leads by arming developers with the tools they actually need—like QubeQode—and it’s already raised over $16.1 million from enthusiastic early buyers. Avalanche is preparing to crush high-fee barriers with its December upgrade and is now helping digital assets behave like fiat in real-world transactions. Meanwhile, Chainlink keeps building the backbone of DeFi and real-world finance, partnering with global names and refining protocols under the hood. Whether you’re looking to build, scale, or secure your digital future, these are the top cryptos to join this week . For those ready to make bold moves, Qubetics stands out with unique utility and unmatched presale traction. Avalanche and Chainlink add depth and reach, making this trio hard to overlook.

Qubetics offers real-world utility through its QubeQode IDE, supports multi-chain app deployment, and has already raised over $16.1M in its presale. How will Avalanche9000 upgrade impact AVAX users? Avalanche9000 will reduce layer-1 deployment costs by 99.9% and lower C-Chain transaction fees by 25%, significantly improving network efficiency. Why is Chainlink’s integration with PayPal and Ripple important? These integrations expand Chainlink’s utility in both centralized finance (PayPal, Ripple) and DeFi (Aave), enhancing its real-world value and adoption.

Cole said in an April 14 open letter to Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi that Intuit’s growth is admirable, but Bitcoin ( BTC ) is the best way to ensure the company’s long-term success and hedge against any potential disruption caused by artificial intelligence. Intuit’s flagship products are its tax preparation app TurboTax and the small business accounting software Quickbooks. The company laid off 10% of its staff in July to pursue its AI endeavors, but Cole said the firm needs an additional hedge because TurboTax is at risk of being automated away by AI. “While we appreciate Intuit’s own investments and internal implementation of AI, we believe an additional hedge is warranted, and that a Bitcoin war chest is the best option available,” Cole said. An excerpt from Matt Cole’s letter urging Intuit to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheets, among other suggestions. Source: Strive Asset Management That Bitcoin war chest , he added, will ensure Intuit has “enough strategic capital to weather the AI storm and act from a position of strength through the turbulence of the AI revolution.” Cole sent a similar letter to GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen in February to advise the gaming retailer to use its $4.6 billion in cash to buy Bitcoin. GameStop’s Cohen acknowledged the letter in an April 1 regulatory filing and revealed his company had finished a convertible debt offering that raised $1.5 billion, with some proceeds earmarked for buying Bitcoin. Strive urges Intuit change crypto policy In his letter to Intuit, Cole said the firm should reconsider the acceptable use policy for its marketing platform Mailchimp, which he claims has continued to suspend crypto-related accounts over policy violations. Source: Strive Asset Management Cole said he “remains concerned that Intuit’s censorship and de-platforming policies discriminate against Bitcoin enthusiasts, which may harm long-term shareholder value.” Mailchimp has said that crypto-related content isn’t necessarily banned under its policy, and crypto content can be sent provided the sender isn’t involved in the sale, exchange, or marketing of crypto. Related: Saylor signals Strategy is buying the dip amid macroeconomic turmoil Its current acceptable use policy states that the platform might not allow accounts that offer “cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies, and any digital assets related to an initial coin offering.” According to Cole, Mailchimp likely adopted its policies when the legal status of crypto and related businesses was uncertain, but said with the crypto-friendly Trump administration , it’s time to “amend the acceptable use policy to end the blanket ban on crypto-related businesses.” Intuit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated the hit in 2025 from reduced travel and boycotts could total 0.3% of gross domestic product, totaling around $90 million. Data from the International Trade Administration showed that the number of non-citizens who had entered the U.S. by plane plummeted almost 10% in March compared to a year earlier. The report also noted that foreign tourism has been a blow for the U.S. recently after the pandemic-era restrictions sparked a resurgence of international travel. U.S. travel declines amid geopolitical frictions US Economy Is Set to Lose Billions as Foreign Tourists Stay Away https://t.co/DXWMIS1rbZ pic.twitter.com/wOpY5OiHwg — Ray Wang (@rwang07) April 15, 2025 Potential U.S. visitors are now rethinking traveling to the U.S. amid increased hostility at the border, rising geopolitical frictions, and global economic uncertainty. Curtis Allen, a Canadian videographer, canceled an upcoming U.S. vacation after President Trump imposed tariffs on his home country and suggested it should become the 51st U.S. state. Allen said, “We’re not just staying home; we’re going to go spend the same money somewhere else.” “Given what we know about how much Canadian travel has fallen off, that’s potentially a bit worrying for that region.” -Omar Sharif, president of Inflation Insights. According to ITA data , foreign travelers spent approximately $254 billion in the U.S. in 2024. The analytics firm also estimated in early March that the country would receive 77 million visitors in 2025. The data came out just before news of detentions at U.S. airports made headlines, where travelers from countries like France and Germany were ensnared. Canadians, who contribute the largest number of foreign travelers in the U.S., are choosing to stay put as Trump heightens attacks on the country’s economy and sovereignty. Bloomberg Intelligence analysis revealed that roughly $20 billion in retail spending from international tourists in the U.S. may be compromised. A monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report on consumer prices published on April 10 indicated that early signs of a sharp pullback are already showing up as airfares, hotel rates, and car rental costs fell in March. Sharif also highlighted that the decline in hotel rates was driven by an almost 11% drop in the Northeast in particular, possibly a result of fewer Canadians traveling there. Canada remains resilient despite challenging U.S. traveling conditions Patrick Keyes, sales and marketing manager at Rainbow Air Helicopter Tours in Niagara Falls, said that the timing is “very interesting” for the firm, which just invested $25 million in a new building, an enhanced fleet, and a virtual reality attraction ahead of the busy summer season. Keyes also added that “we are waiting to see the fallout.” A report by OAG Aviation Worldwide also reported that Canadian flight reservations to the U.S. have plummeted by 70% through September versus the same period last year. U.S. summer bookings have also dropped by 25% among European tourists at Accor SA hotels. The firm’s Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Bazin maintained the drop could be attributed to border detentions creating a “bad buzz” and diverting tourists to other destinations. Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Megan Peters mentioned in a March 31 report that U.S. tariff announcements and a more aggressive stance towards historical allies hurt global opinions about the state. The duo also believe that tariffs will lead to U.S. gross domestic product growth to underperform consensus expectations in 2025. Todd Davidson, CEO of Travel Oregon, Oregon’s tourism commission, said the company was continuing efforts to attract foreign travelers. Davidson noted his team was on a trip to pitch the state at an adventure tourism conference in Vancouver. He also acknowledged that his team will host sales and marketing partners from the UK, India, and Brazil in the coming weeks. The company’s senior executive maintained that his team was also contemplating whether the commission will need to tweak its strategy more toward domestic visitors as the situation unfolds. He added, “Oregon is not and will not take its eye off those international markets.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

TRUMP was last trading just under $8 per coin, up a modest 10% from the lows it hit around $7 last week, but still very much stuck in a long-term downtrend. The meme coin has continually found resistance at its 21DMA over the last three months. TRUMP has now dropped around 90% from its post-launch highs above $70. But things could be about to go from bad to worse. 4% of the meme coin’s supply is set to unlock on the 18th of April. On April 18, 40 million tokens will unlock for $TRUMP (currently worth $330M) Let’s see if they’ll sell or hold pic.twitter.com/xxfnutGJaG — LANGERIUS (@langeriuseth) April 14, 2025 Given that only 20% of the supply is currently in circulation, this means an increase to circulating supply of 20%. Bearish technicals combined with bearish supply dynamics mean that TRUMP coin could soon dump to fresh lows under $7 per token. And with sentiment in the broader crypto market still downbeat thanks to ongoing macro uncertainties and poor altcoin performance, the outlook for a major bullish reversal anytime soon is week. Was TRUMP Coin a Scam? TRUMP Coin isn’t a scam; its launch was fair and the team behind the coin have not deceived investors in anyway. It was simply launched as a collectable meme coin, with no promise of returns, or anything for that matter. That said, questions have been raised about the ethics surrounding the meme coin’s launch. Firstly, while early buyers made millions, and while the Trump organization has earned over $100 million in trading fees, the vast majority of TRUMP buyers have been left out of pocket. Indeed, a Chainalysis study conducted in conjunction with the New York Times revealed that, three weeks on from the meme coin’s launch, over 800,000 wallets had lost money buying the coin. Indeed, just looking at the TRUMP coin chart since its launch – it paints a perfect picture of a classic “pump-and-dump”. Trump’s meme coin has to be the biggest scam of the season. pic.twitter.com/nCvNWgyVP1 — VolgaLad (@cym27s) April 13, 2025 The fact that the Trump organization gifted itself 80% of the supply to be vested over the course of Trump’s presidential term has also been strongly criticized. $TRUMP coin is a scam and embarrassing for all US citizens. Essentially, it allowed insiders to snipe the entire supply at launch. We should hope for better from our leaders. Just because the other side is corrupt doesn’t give you a license to do the same. I hope people on… pic.twitter.com/yHgfdQhZqz — Dr. Danish (@operationdanish) January 18, 2025 Is It a Good Time to Buy TRUMP? Its possible that when broader crypto market conditions take a substantial turn for the better, TRUMP coin could see a major resurgence. Perhaps when sentiment regarding the economy is better, and when the Fed is pumping the market with liquidity. That said, these times have not arrived yet. Yes, TRUMP coin buyers getting into the market are buying the dip, a 90% dip in fact. However, there could still be a lot lower to go. Its not unheard of for meme coins to drop 99% from prior record highs. Investors should not risk more than they can afford to lose in buying TRUMP coin. Investing in major coins like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana would be much safer.

The company recently disclosed the purchase of 80,567 Solana (SOL) tokens worth approximately $10.5 million. This marks Janover’s third major SOL acquisition as part of its growing digital treasury initiative. Massive Price Surge Fuels Strategic Investment The announcement followed a significant stock rally, with Janover shares hitting an all-time high of nearly $66. Although share prices slightly dipped in early trading the next day, the company has still enjoyed a staggering 1,200% surge this year. With this new buy, Janover’s total Solana holdings now stand at around 163,651 tokens—currently valued at approximately $21 million. The purchase was financed through a recent $42 million capital raise. Staking and Validator Plans in Motion Janover doesn’t plan to let its crypto assets sit idle. The firm intends to stake the newly acquired SOL, a move that will generate passive income and strengthen the Solana network. It also aims to operate one or more validators to enhance its participation in network security and receive staking rewards. The staking revenues will be reinvested into acquiring even more Solana, in line with the company’s long-term accumulation strategy. “Speed and clarity of execution are central to our model,” said Parker White, COO and CIO at Janover. “We plan to continue building our SOL position as we scale our strategy — and we believe today’s market conditions offered a compelling opportunity to take our first step.” Leadership Shift and Rebranding Ahead These developments come in the wake of a major leadership shake-up, as a group of former Kraken executives acquired majority control of Janover. The company is now focused on bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Earlier this month, the board approved a new treasury strategy focused on long-term crypto holdings. The plan starts with Solana but could potentially expand to other digital assets over time. Janover is also preparing to rebrand itself as DeFi Development Corporation and plans to change its stock ticker symbol to reflect this new direction. Growing Trend Among Corporates Janover’s aggressive crypto positioning echoes a broader trend among companies diversifying into digital assets. Worksport, for example, announced last year that it had added XRP to its treasury alongside Bitcoin. Solana, currently trading at about $132, has surged nearly 24% in the past week despite being down 30% year-to-date.

In a Tuesday evening announcement, newly-appointed CEO Roshan Robert said the expansion was “a commitment to responsible growth.” Robert was most recently an executive at institutional crypto lending platform CLST, and was a founding team member of crypto prime broker Hidden Road, which was recently acquired by Ripple for $1.25 billion . “As regulations evolve, OKX is working closely with US regulators and policymakers to ensure we operate transparently and compliantly,” Robert wrote. “We’ve built a comprehensive, risk-based global compliance program that includes enhanced due diligence, a robust KYC process, customer risk rating systems, advanced fraud detection, AML tools, geo-blocking, and market surveillance technologies. These are all part of our commitment to a secure, compliant trading environment.” Two months ago, a subsidiary of OKX settled charges that it had operated in the U.S. without a money transmitting license, agreeing to pay the Department of Justice (DOJ) over $500 million in penalties and forfeited fees. The DOJ alleged that, despite having an official policy prohibiting U.S.-based users from accessing its platform, OKX “sought out customers in the United States, including in the Southern District of New York.” Read more: After Binance’s $4.3B Lesson, Do Rival Exchanges Risk Running Afoul of U.S. Rules?

Noble’s AppLayer aims to let developers build new financial tools optimized for real-world assets like stablecoins — digital assets whose value is pegged to another asset, like the U.S. dollar. AppLayer will leverage Celestia, a data availability blockchain that aims to bring down storage costs for data-intensive blockchain networks. Celestia, like Noble, is plugged into the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning it can read smart contracts from other Ethereum-based chains. The Noble team stated in a press release viewed by CoinDesk that it will launch its Ethereum-compatible AppLayer rollup in the third quarter of 2025. “Noble plans to unlock its cross-ecosystem potential as EVM applications continue to seek reliable and seamless access to native stablecoin liquidity,” the team wrote. “Noble’s AppLayer will be seamlessly integrated with a number of blue chip DeFi projects born in the Ethereum ecosystem.” Stablecoins have received considerable attention in recent weeks, with the U.S. Congress preparing significant stablecoin legislation later this year. Entities including President Trump’s World-Liberty Financial , banking giant Fidelity, and the U.S. state of Wyoming have also expressed plans to create their own stablecoins. Noble launched in March 2023 as an application-specific blockchain , or ""appchain,"" purpose-built for stablecoin issuance within the Cosmos ecosystem . Initially, it aimed to expand liquidity Cosmos by enabling native asset issuance through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which is the technology used by Cosmos-based blockchains to transfer assets and other data. Over time, Noble has extended its reach beyond Cosmos, integrating with Ethereum and other ecosystems to facilitate quick stablecoin transfers. Additionally, in March, Noble introduced USDN , a yield-bearing stablecoin backed by U.S. Treasury bills. “Building stablecoin issuance infrastructure over the past two years has given us a deep appreciation for the transformative potential of stablecoins to onboard the world to crypto,” said Jelena Djuric, co-founder and CEO at Noble, in the press release. “The Noble AppLayer, built with Celestia's technology underneath, finally gives builders the freedom to build highly scalable and performant stablecoin-native applications.” Read more: How a Ph.D. Student's Research Paper Turned Celestia Into $345M Blockchain Project Overnight",Tech|Stablecoins|Rollups|Celestia,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-16 03:00:00
43392454,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=732160,1744772449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43392454.jpeg,"‘Bitcoin Wants To Go Higher,’ Says Bitwise CIO—But There’s A Catch",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-wants-to-go-higher-bitwise-cio/,"In an investor note dated April 15, 2025, Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Bitwise, shared an examination of Bitcoin’s recent trading patterns that may surprise both critics and supporters. “Bitcoin is acting like an asset that wants to go higher, if only macro obstacles would get out of the way,” he wrote. According to Hougan, Bitcoin’s price on April 14 hovered around $84,379, compared to $84,317 a month earlier—a minuscule change of 0.07% during a 30-day window. This flat performance emerged against the backdrop of two significant geopolitical events: the United States announcing the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and President Donald Trump imposing sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. The resilience that Bitcoin has shown during this period stands in stark contrast to the broader downward trend in traditional financial markets. Hougan pointed out that the S&P 500, which peaked on February 19, has lost 12.0% of its value, with Bitcoin down a comparable 12.4% since that date. He found this alignment astonishing, particularly because it departs from Bitcoin’s behavior during past market downturns. In the 2022 correction, for example, the S&P 500 slid 24.5% while Bitcoin plunged 58.3%. Similarly, at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in early 2020, stocks fell 33.8% but Bitcoin sank 38.1%, and in late 2018, when escalating trade tensions between the United States and China dragged equities down 19.36%, Bitcoin declined 37.22%. This track record had historically reinforced the notion that, when stocks took a hit, Bitcoin would invariably suffer a far steeper pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lags Gold As Wall Street Doubts Persist, Claims Expert In his latest note, Hougan emphasized how different the present situation feels. Instead of being battered well beyond the equity market’s turbulence, Bitcoin is now mirroring stock losses closely. He acknowledged that this alone does not make Bitcoin an unequivocal hedge asset, adding, “Critics will point out that matching stocks’ performance during a downturn is not the same as acting as a hedge asset, and that gold has been a better performer than Bitcoin during this pullback. That’s true.” Nonetheless, he argued that Bitcoin’s ability to stay around the $80,000 mark while global markets churn is a testament to its robust staying power in the face of multiple macroeconomic shocks. “If that doesn’t give you confidence in its staying power, I don’t know what will,” he remarked. Hougan’s view is that we are witnessing a transitional phase in Bitcoin’s evolution. He explained that the cryptocurrency has historically been driven by two competing forces: it has served as a risk asset, associated with significant upside potential and high volatility, yet it has also occasionally taken on the role of a hedge similar to gold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Pullback Mirrors 2017’s Path To Parabolic Highs, Says Analyst In Bitcoin’s early days, the risk-asset angle tended to dominate; in major equity sell-offs, investors often shed Bitcoin faster and more aggressively than they exited stocks. Now, with more corporations integrating Bitcoin into their balance sheets, institutional investors exploring it as part of diversified portfolios, and governments—like the United States—incorporating it into strategic reserves, there appears to be a gradual tilt toward Bitcoin being treated more like “digital gold.” . Still, Hougan warned that investors should not overlook the inherent unpredictability in the current macro environment. He noted that equity markets may not yet have found a bottom, raising the possibility that deeper slides could re-expose Bitcoin’s vulnerability if broader panic sets in. He also conceded that gold’s performance remains a more classic example of a safe-haven behavior during systemic shocks, meaning Bitcoin has not conclusively demonstrated that it can replace traditional hedges during intense economic strain. Even so, in his words, “The world is unraveling, and Bitcoin is trading above $80,000.” Hougan underscored that there is no guarantee this dynamic will endure, particularly given the unpredictable repercussions that could stem from sudden tariff escalations or shifts in monetary policy. As he concluded in his note, “Our baby is growing up as a macro asset. And that’s a beautiful thing to see.” At press time, BTC traded at $85,200.

In the latest trade policy twist, President Donald Trump ordered a probe into possible tariffs on all U.S. critical mineral imports, many of which are sourced from China. The move added to investor anxiety, further weighing on the dollar. Traders grew cautious ahead of both Powell’s comments and ongoing trade developments with key U.S. partners. Gold climbed toward $2,630 per ounce on Wednesday, setting a new record, as ongoing uncertainty around US trade policy continued to support safe-haven demand, alongside a broadly weaker dollar. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.61% to below 34,200 on Wednesday, halting a two-day winning streak. The Japanese yen strengthened past143 per dollar on Wednesday, recovering from the previous session’s losses, as broad-based weakness in the U.S. dollar persisted. The Bank of Japan may take policy action if U.S. tariffs harm its economy, Governor Kazuo Ueda said in an interview with the Sankei newspaper. The central bank is considering a response as risks from Trump's trade measures are closer to the expected bad scenario. Ueda emphasizes the need to assess the economic impact of tariffs without preconceptions. Meanwhile, attention is shifting to upcoming trade talks between Japan and the U.S., with Tokyo pushing for the full removal of Trump's tariffs. On the domestic front, traders digested data showing an eight-month high in Japanese manufacturing sentiment for April that jumped to +9 from -1 in March. However, the outlook remains cautious as fears around U.S. trade policy persist. Japan’s core machinery orders rebounded sharply in February 2025, rising 4.3% month-on-month to ¥894.7 billion, well above market expectations for a 0.8% increase. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.76% to around 3,250 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 1% to 9,755 on Wednesday, halting a six-day winning streak as trade war concerns overshadowed upbeat economic data, and the offshore yuan steadied around 7.32 per dollar on Wednesday, following the release of stronger-than-expected economic data from China. The pullback came after President Donald Trump ordered a probe into potential new tariffs on critical mineral imports—many of which are sourced from China—raising fears of further deterioration in U.S.-China relations. On the data front, China’s economy posted better-than-expected growth in Q1 , supported by robust policy stimulus. Key indicators including retail sales, industrial production, and fixed asset investment all exceeded forecasts in March . China’s surveyed unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in March 2025, easing from a two-year high of 5.4% in the previous month and coming in below market expectations of 5.3%. China's industrial capacity utilization rate increased to 74.1 percent in Q1 of 2025 from 73.6 percent in the same period a year earlier. China’s new home prices in 70 cities fell by 4.5% year-on-year in March 2025, easing slightly from a 4.8% decline in February. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 2.06% Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.26% to 7,760 on Wednesday. The Australian dollar held above $0.63 on Wednesday, eyeing a sixth consecutive session of gains. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Economic Index for Australia edged down 0.1% month-over-month in March 2025, reversing the 0.1% increases in the previous two months. Investors turned their focus to Thursday’s employment data, which could offer fresh insights into the labor market and influence the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy direction. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended in red as investors weighed a new round of corporate earnings and ongoing concerns over tariffs and trade policy uncertainty. U.S. stock futures fell early Wednesday, pressured by a sharp drop in Nvidia shares during after-hours trading: Dow -0.32% ; S&P 500 -0.90% ; Nasdaq -1.44% . Investors are also bracing for a wave of corporate earnings set to be released later in the day, including reports from Abbott, U.S. Bancorp, and Travelers.

The company has filed a new S-3 registration with the SEC, signaling plans to raise to $500 million. This capital raise would come through a variety of securities like common stock, debt, and warrants. While the funds will be used for general corporate purposes, the company clearly stated that a portion will go toward buying more Bitcoin.

Back in February, the company added 871 BTC for $88.5 million, paying an average of over $101,000 per coin. That followed a separate $30 million purchase late last year. Despite Bitcoin’s recent dip below $99,000, Semler appears committed to its long-term crypto strategy. Semler Scientific CEO Eric Semler claims he’s “excited to buy more BTC.” We have reached a settlement in principle, EXCITED TO BUY MORE BTC! — Eric Semler (@SemlerEric) April 15, 2025 Bitcoin as a Corporate Lifeline Notably, this shift is more than the investment strategy, it’s part of a larger turnaround story. Before adopting its Bitcoin treasury strategy in May 2024, Semler was viewed as a stagnant rich public company with solid cash reserves but poor stock performance. Now, with one of the largest BTC holdings among public companies, it’s reinventing itself. The firm believes Bitcoin is not just a hedge against inflation but a safe haven during times of global uncertainty. Dealing DOJ Settlement At the same time, the company is navigating a major legal hurdle. Semler recently reached a tentative $29.75 million settlement with the Department of Justice over allegations tied to how it marketed its QuantaFlo product. To pay off this settlement, the company plans to borrow from Coinbase and use its Bitcoin holdings as collateral. It will also tap into its existing cash on hand to cover part of the cost. Still a High-Risk Strategy Even with its bold Bitcoin stance, Semler’s stock hasn’t seen the boost you’d expect. The share price has fallen 37% so far this year. Still, the company is standing firm on its belief that Bitcoin is a long-term asset worth holding. By continuing to build its crypto portfolio and reshaping how it does business, Semler is clearly betting that this high-stakes strategy will eventually pay off.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-16 03:13:14

In a series of now-deleted posts on April 15, Powell’s X account shared links to a token called the House of Commons Coin (HOC), describing it as “a community driven digital currency.” Source: Daniel Green A member of Powell’s staff confirmed to the BBC that the account had been hacked and that “steps were taken quickly to secure the account and remove misleading posts.” DEX Screener shows the HOC token saw limited interest from would-be investors, achieving a peak market cap of just over $24,000 shortly after the posts from Powell’s account. The token has seen a total of 736 transactions and a trading volume of just $71,000. While Powell hasn’t promoted a cryptocurrency before, it isn’t unheard of for political figures to back real crypto tokens. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump both launched and promoted memecoins days before they entered the White House, sparking criticism from the president’s political rivals and even some supporters. Argentine President Javier Melei also promoted a token called LIBRA, which quickly crashed in value and has caused a political scandal in Argentina and calls for a probe into Melei’s involvement with the token. Powell’s account hack follows similar attack on Ghana’s president In March, the X account of Ghana’s President John Mahama saw a similar breach, with attackers taking over his account for 48 hours to promote a scam cryptocurrency called Solanafrica. The Ghanaian president’s X account was hacked in March 2025. Source: CrediRates Related: UK trade bodies ask government to make crypto a ‘strategic priority’ The scammers made similar crypto-promoting posts to Mahama’s 2.4 million followers, claiming that the scam project was “making payments fast and free across the continent with support from Solana and the Bank of Ghana.” The president’s team regained control of Mahama’s X account two days later. His spokesman, Kwakye Ofosu, told the AFP that the account “has now been fully restored, and we urge the public to disregard any suspicious cryptocurrency-related posts from the handle.” Magazine: Memecoin degeneracy is funding groundbreaking anti-aging research",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-16 03:30:52

The Binance Taker Buy Sell Ratio, which calculates the ratio of buyers to sellers of Bitcoin ( BTC ) in Binance, “has returned to neutral territory,” CryptoQuant contributor DarkFost said in an April 15 note. Bitcoin’s bullish momentum is “picking up again” The ratio currently stands at 1.008. When the ratio is higher than 1, buyers — usually a bullish sentiment indicator — dominate volumes, conversely, a ratio below 1 indicates that sellers, or bearish sentiment, are dominating. Bitcoin is trading at $83,810 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin is trading at $83,810 at the time of publication, down 1.47% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. “Over the past few days, the ratio has been mostly positive, suggesting that bullish sentiment is picking up again on Binance’s derivatives market,” Darkfost said. On April 14, when Bitcoin was above $86,000, the ratio was above 1.1. CoinGlass data shows that if Bitcoin reclaims $85,000, almost $637 million in short positions will be at risk of liquidation. Several key market indicators suggest that investors continue to favor Bitcoin over altcoins. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is currently at 15 out of 100, signalling it is still very much “Bitcoin Season.” TradingView’s Bitcoin Dominance Chart shows the asset’s market share is sitting at 63.81%, up 9.82% so far this year.

Some analysts, including DeFiDaniel, commented that Bitcoin’s recent price action is “so boring.” However, Cointelegraph earlier reported that Bitcoin apparent demand is on a recovery path, but it is not net positive yet . Historically, 30-day apparent demand can move sideways for a prolonged period after Bitcoin reaches a local bottom, leading to its price chopping sideways.

Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts told Cointelegraph in late March that “the market may be underestimating how quickly Bitcoin could surge — potentially hitting new all-time highs before Q2 is out.” AnchorWatch CEO Rob Hamilton said in an April 15 X post that Bitcoin’s price “is flat for the day because we are in an epic tug of war between people who are selling Bitcoin to pay their taxes and people using their refunds to buy Bitcoin.” The tax deadline in the US was April 15.

Semler declared holdings of 3,182 Bitcoin ( BTC ) valued at around $263.5 million as of March 31.

In November, Semler Scientific CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian said , “We remain laser-focused on acquiring and holding Bitcoin while supporting innovation and growth in our healthcare business.” Semler is the twelfth largest corporate holder of BTC, ahead of Hong Kong gaming firm Boyaa Interactive International Limited, according to Bitbo data.

The news was announced in an Apr. 15 press release, in which Securitize said its subsidiary, Securitize Fund Services, will now oversee $38 billion in assets across 715 funds following the acquisition. MG Stover, established in 2007, was one of the first companies to specialize in fund administration for digital assets and cryptocurrency. Its integration with Securitize expands the platform’s fund servicing capabilities, which already include trading infrastructure, brokerage, tokenization, and transfer agents. The deal significantly enhances SFS’s ability to serve institutional investors with a full-stack solution, combining traditional fund servicing with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain rails. Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said the acquisition “cements our role as the most comprehensive platform for institutional grade real-world asset tokenization and fund administration.” He added that it reinforces the company’s commitment to supporting a growing base of asset issuers and investors.

That includes BUIDL, a $2.45 billion tokenized U.S. Treasury fund managed with BlackRock; Exodus, a $400 million tokenized equity; BCAP, a $150 million institutional fund; and ACRED, a $65 million private credit fund. Fund administration, primary issuance, tokenization, and secondary trading via its SEC-regulated alternative trading system are all part of the company’s integrated stack. It is also a registered transfer agent and broker-dealer. The acquisition reflects a wider trend of consolidation in the real-world asset space as institutions seek end-to-end solutions for digital finance. As reported by crypto.news on Apr. 10, according to BCG and Ripple ( XRP ), the global tokenized asset market could grow to $18.9 trillion by 2033. Securitize appears to be building for this future. Additionally, in March, Securitize announced the launch of Converge, a new blockchain built together with Ethena ( ENA ) Labs. The chain serves as a compliant foundation for the expanding RWA ecosystem by supporting tokenized asset infrastructure and institutional-grade decentralized finance.

Mullin made the declaration via X on Apr. 15. He was replying to a community member who had suggested the Mantra team should delay its upcoming token unlocks, originally set to begin in April, as a show of long-term commitment.

Despite price appreciation, the level of excitement and retail participation remains muted. CryptoQuant believes that an important on-chain metric underlines this shift – the percentage of BTC held for one week to one month is significantly lower than in past cycles. This suggests that the explosive influx of new participants, which once fueled rapid price rallies, is largely absent. Bitcoin’s Slow Burn According to the latest analysis shared by CryptoQuant, two main factors are contributing to this change. First, the macroeconomic backdrop has shifted dramatically. Unlike the 2020-2021 cycle, which was powered by near-zero interest rates and aggressive monetary easing, today’s market operates under tight liquidity conditions and sustained high interest rates. Capital is less willing to flow freely, which has made large, euphoric price movements harder to achieve. Second, the market’s leadership has shifted from retail investors to institutions, particularly following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional flows are more measured, which has contributed to a structured, gradual uptrend rather than the chaotic volatility of earlier cycles. This evolving structure has created a more cautious market atmosphere. Some analysts misinterpret this slower pace as a sign that the cycle has peaked. CryptoQuant, on the other hand, suggests that it would be premature. Instead of a traditional boom-and-bust pattern, this cycle may play out as a longer, more complex progression. ETF inflows remain steady, and if macro conditions ease, further upside is still possible. “In times like this, what matters most isn’t chasing quick pumps – It’s understanding the slower structure and having the patience to stay with it.” ‘Wait and See’ Approach in Short Term In its latest market update , QCP Capital reported that Bitcoin risk reversals remain skewed in favor of puts through June, which indicates that traders are still adopting a mildly cautious stance in the near term. This positioning reflects broader market hesitation as the crypto asset continues to consolidate within the $80,000 to $90,000 range, with participants largely adopting a “wait and see” approach amid uncertainty surrounding the global tariff landscape. However, QCP also notes a shift in sentiment further out on the curve. Over the weekend, the firm observed aggressive buying of 800 contracts of the BTC-27MAR26-100K call option – an indication of growing long-term bullish positioning. This suggests that while short-term caution persists, institutional appetite for upside exposure is building.

Although crypto trading is banned in China and digital assets are neither legal tender nor recognized property, local courts and governments have quietly continued to seize Bitcoin and other tokens linked to crimes ranging from internet fraud to illegal gambling. Lawyers, judges and law enforcement officials are now urging regulatory reform to bring transparency and structure to this grey area, Reuters reported Wednesday. Without established guidelines, some fear the current ad hoc handling could embolden criminal networks or create opportunities for abuse within the system. China debates how to handle criminal crypto cache https://t.co/skImimgOWd pic.twitter.com/SGV9rXtuga — Reuters World (@ReutersWorld) April 15, 2025 China’s Crackdown on Crypto Crimes Boosts Government Confiscation Revenues Local governments are under fiscal pressure from China’s slowing economy. In several cases, they have enlisted private firms to liquidate seized cryptocurrencies. Court documents and transaction records reviewed by Reuters show how this works. Authorities convert digital coins into cash and use the proceeds to supplement government funds. These debates come amid a rapid rise in crypto-linked criminal prosecutions . In 2023 alone, Chinese authorities filed charges against over 3,000 individuals for crypto-related money laundering, with total funds involved in such crimes surging tenfold to 430.7 billion yuan ($59b), according to blockchain security firm SAFEIS. The financial stakes are rising alongside enforcement. Penalty and confiscation revenues collected by local governments reached 378 billion yuan ($51.8b) last year, a 65% increase from 2018. Chinese Citizens Evade Ban as Government Quietly Accumulates Crypto A report from Bitcoin investment firm River estimated that China’s local governments held around 15,000 Bitcoin at the end of 2023. At current prices, the stash is worth about $1.4b. This places China among the top holders of the cryptocurrency globally. Despite Beijing’s sweeping ban on cryptocurrency trading and mining in recent years, many Chinese citizens have continued to use offshore exchanges and peer-to-peer methods to access digital assets, often routing transactions through VPNs or overseas platforms. This has complicated enforcement and blurred the line between personal use and criminal conduct. Debates over seized crypto are escalating. Policymakers may now be forced to draft new national-level guidelines. Legal observers believe a formal regulatory response could follow soon. This may reshape how China handles digital assets caught in its legal net.

The lack of rules around how authorities should handle seized crypto has spawned “inconsistent and opaque approaches” that some fear could foster corruption, lawyers told Reuters for an April 16 report. Chinese local governments are using private companies to sell seized cryptocurrencies in offshore markets in exchange for cash to replenish public coffers, Reuters reported, citing transaction and court documents. The local governments reportedly held approximately 15,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth $1.4 billion at the end of 2023, and the sales have been a significant source of income. China holds an estimated 194,000 BTC worth approximately $16 billion and is the second largest nation Bitcoin holder behind the US, according to Bitbo. Zhongnan University of Economics and Law professor Chen Shi told Reuters that these sales are a “makeshift solution that, strictly speaking, is not fully in line with China’s current ban on crypto trading.” Countries and governments that hold BTC. Source: Bitbo The issue has been exacerbated by a rise in crypto-related crime in China, ranging from online fraud to money laundering to illegal gambling. Additionally, the state sued more than 3,000 people involved in crypto-related money laundering in 2024. China crypto reserve floated as solution Shenzhen-based lawyer Guo Zhihao opined that the central bank is better positioned to deal with seized digital assets and should either sell them overseas or build a crypto reserve. Ru Haiyang, co-CEO at Hong Kong crypto exchange HashKey, echoed the suggestion saying that China may want to keep forfeited Bitcoin as a strategic reserve as US President Donald Trump is doing.

A rising wedge comprises two converging trendlines that connect higher lows and higher highs. This convergence suggests that upward momentum is weakening. When the price moves below the lower trendline, it signals a shift to a bearish trend. XRP dived out of its rising wedge pattern during Wednesday's early Asian hours, suggesting that the attempted recovery from the April 7 lows near $1.60 has likely lost momentum, allowing sellers to regain control. According to technical analysis theory , analysts should identify the starting point of the rising wedge as the initial support level following the breakdown, which means XRP can now fall back to $1.60.

Meliuz, which provides cashback and financial technology services, is taking the plan to make Bitcoin ( BTC ) the primary strategic asset in the firm’s treasury to shareholders in a meeting slated for May 6, according to a translated April 14 statement. The company said its core business will remain unchanged, but “the generation of cash from operations is fundamental to the strategy of acquiring more Bitcoin over time.” If shareholders approve the measure, Bitcoin will be adopted as the firm’s main strategic treasury asset, but it will also look to foster “the incremental generation of Bitcoin for its shareholders, whether through the generation of operating cash or through possible financial transactions and strategic initiatives.” Shareholders who disagree with the new direction and held their shares before April 14 can request reimbursement. Meliuz shares jump on Bitcoin plan In the trading session after its new Bitcoin plan was announced, Meliuz (CASH3) jumped over 14% from 3.28 Brazilian reals ($0.56) to 3.76 Brazilian reals ($0.64) on the Brazilian Stock Exchange, according to Google Finance. In total, Meliuz’s share price has spiked up over 27% in the last five days to 3.85 Brazilian reals ($0.65).

CyberKongz described the decision as a landmark moment, ending what it called years of “unjust allegations, crippling legal fees, and the biggest hurdle we could possibly encounter.” The project, known for its pixelated primate avatars and immersive metaverse-style gaming experiences, had become a symbol of regulatory uncertainty in the Web3 space. In December, CyberKongz received a Wells notice from the SEC , which the project said reflected a confusing stance on how smart contracts function. One of the main issues raised by the regulator was the alleged sale of Genesis Kongz in April 2021. However, the team clarified this was not a token sale but a contract migration. They argued that if the SEC cannot tell the difference between a primary sale and a technical update, it raises serious concerns about the clarity of current crypto regulations.

In line with this shift, the agency has recently paused or dropped several high-profile investigations. These include cases involving Coinbase , Kraken , Robinhood , Immutable and Consensys. At the same time, some probes, like those into Binance and OpenSea, remain open. However, the overall trend points to a softer enforcement approach than in previous years. This shift in approach coincides with a political transition in Washington. The second Trump administration took office in January, followed by the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Days later, the agency launched a new Crypto Task Force to develop clearer rules for the industry, marking a turn toward regulatory clarity and collaboration. CyberKongz Says Victory Signals Hope for Builders Across Web3 CyberKongz was founded by a group of artists and developers. It first gained traction in 2021 during the NFT boom. The project featured uniquely generated gorilla avatars that attracted a cult following. It later expanded into a larger gaming and metaverse ecosystem. The team described its legal battle as a stand for the entire Web3 space, not just itself. “We are a small, passionate, and creative Web3 team that elected to fight this battle for the betterment of Web3,” the project said. A full rebrand and new direction will be announced soon, it added. The case is now closed. CyberKongz said it hopes the outcome will inspire other blockchain projects to keep building with confidence. “It should be celebrated by all that our space is here to stay,” the team said.

This time, the company has issued zero-coupon dollar-denominated bonds to EVO FUND to boost its Bitcoin holdings while strategically avoiding any financial strain.

This shift, as explained by CEO Simon Gerovich in his X post , is a deliberate move to sidestep the high and often unreasonable exchange fees imposed by Japanese banks when converting yen to dollars for Bitcoin purchases. However, by securing capital in USD from the outset, the company avoids those conversion costs and gains access to cheaper Bitcoin prices available in international markets. This results in a lower average cost of acquisition, allowing Metaplanet to stretch its investment further and boost overall shareholder value. Notably, from January to March 2025, Metaplanet reported a BTC Yield of 95.6%. Between April 1 and April 14, the yield was 6.5%, showing continued growth even in a shorter time frame. Bitcoin Buying Spree Continues Metaplanet’s aggressive strategy hasn’t slowed down. Just days before this announcement, the company increased its Bitcoin stash by 319 BTC, taking its total to 4,525. Earlier this month, it added 150 BTC, followed by another 156 BTC, chipping away at its ambitious goal of holding 21,000 BTC by 2026. These purchases come as Bitcoin trades around $83,000 and is down 25% from its all-time high of over $109,000. This is also seen as the best time to buy the dip and stack Bitcoin at lower prices. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Semler Scientific Files for $500 Million Raise to Fuel Bitcoin Investment Strategy , Following Strategy-Inspired Blueprints Often called “Asia’s Strategy,” Metaplanet’s roadmap reflects the US firm’s Bitcoin-heavy model. While Strategy holds over 500,000 BTC , Metaplanet is catching up and already ranks 10th globally among public Bitcoin holders, according to BitcoinTreasuries data. With its stock reacting positively to Bitcoin buys, such as a 19% jump after a $44 million acquisition in March, the company appears to be gaining traction both financially and strategically. Looking Beyond Japan Metaplanet isn’t just growing its Bitcoin wallet; it’s also expanding its reach. Earlier this year, the company began exploring a US stock market listing to attract international investors. At the same time, it welcomed Eric Trump to its newly formed strategic advisory board, aiming to amplify its global presence and influence in the Bitcoin economy. With bold moves, growing credibility, and an expanding network, Metaplanet is quickly becoming a major player in the corporate crypto race. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In its monthly report published on Apr. 15, Coinbase noted that the total crypto market cap, excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), has fallen 41% from its $1.6 trillion peak in December 2024 to about $950 billion. At the same time, venture capital investment in crypto remains 50–60% below the highs seen during the 2021–2022 cycle. These developments, along with global tariffs and ongoing economic uncertainty, have added pressure to the market, particularly for altcoins. Many investors usually define a bear market as a 20% price drop, but Coinbase believes this rule no longer works well for crypto. It instead advocates the use of risk-adjusted returns and the 200-day moving average to better understand longer-term market shifts. For example, while Bitcoin is down less than 20% since December, it has fallen below its 200-day moving average, indicating a bigger shift in the market. You might also like: Markets drift lower as trade uncertainty lingers, crypto markets slump The report also mentions that Coinbase’s COIN50 index, which tracks the top 50 non-Bitcoin tokens, has also slipped below this level. This often signals that weakness in the market could continue for a longer time. Although Bitcoin’s decline has been modest, altcoins have experienced much steeper losses. Coinbase points out that this gap shows the increased volatility in newer sectors of crypto, such as memecoins, DePIN projects, and artificial intelligence-related tokens. As a result, relying solely on Bitcoin to judge market conditions may no longer be enough. Broader indicators like the COIN50 provide a more complete view of investor sentiment. Coinbase remains cautiously optimistic despite recent struggles. It sees a chance for the market to reach a bottom by mid-to-late Q2 2025, with a possible recovery in Q3 if global conditions improve. Until then, the firm recommends a cautious and flexible approach, as investors face weaker liquidity and a lower appetite for risk.

The transaction inflated the amount of tokens in circulation by around 0.45% of the total supply and caused a brief dip in spot prices. “This incident is contained to the airdrop distribution contracts only and all the funds that could be minted have been minted. No further exploits via this method are possible.” They noted that the hacker still held funds in an account that contained 44 million ZK tokens worth $2.1 million and around 2,200 ETH worth $3.4 million. When asked why the unclaimed airdrop tokens were left in the contract, co-founder and CEO of ZKsync, Alex Gluchowski, said, “The unminted supply was supposed to go back to the Token Assembly,” before adding, “We’re investigating why this didn’t happen.” “The attacker is facing criminal liability. It’s in their best interest to investigate the funds return ASAP,” he said.

There are speculations that the incoming SEC Chair Paul Atkins could drop the case altogether. In a court filing on April 10th, both the parties said they want to save time and resources while trying to reach a settlement. Hence, Ripple will no longer need to respond to the SEC’s brief that was due on April 16. In a latest X post, prominent crypto influencer, John Squire shared his detailed analysis on the conclusion of Ripple XRP case and the shift in SEC’s stance.

He believes that Ripple and the SEC’s joint move to pause their appeals is not just a routine step but a strategic move. All of this combined with unusual whale activity and renewed institutional wallet moves, indicates that high-level negotiations are place behind closed doors. He believes that this is a quiet buildup before major structural shifts in high stakes cases like this one. He is confident that if a settlement is reached today, April 16th, it may not only end the legal battle but also open the door for a potential XRP ETF. He notes that this day could mark a turning point in XRP’s history. He also highlighted that the settlement would bring XRP out of regulatory ‘limbo’ which would spark renewed institutional interest and investment, removing the limits that have held back XRP’s growth for years. He also clarified that this is not just speculation, but a logical analysis based on observable moves. “When institutions start positioning ahead of time, it’s because they know what’s coming. And what’s coming might be one of the most important validations the crypto space has seen in a long time, ” he remarked. This day could kickstart huge XRP rally, fueled by strong fundamentals. And the multiple XRP ETF filings that already exist could get the momentum they need to succeed. Ripple CEO, Attorney Hint To Big Shifts Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had also hinted previously in March that the XRP case close to ending. The latest move to pause the case indicates that the SEC might be changing its stance especially with Atkins set to take over as the SEC Chair after the Senate confirmed his appointment on April 9. Besides, Attorney Fred Rispoli had recently shared that something big is expected to happen on or before April 16th, which is the due date for Ripple’s appellate brief. He said that Ripple cannot delay their next court move, hence by April 16, they will either file their appeal which is unlikely with a 10% chance, or announce a settlement or withdrawal with a probability of 90%. On SEC v. Ripple, expect to see something happen on or before next Wednesday, 4/16, the due date for @ripple 's appellate brief.

43396573,https://nulltx.com/?p=148005,1744782728,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,6 Altcoins to Consider This Week If You’re Thinking of Moving Out of ETH,https://nulltx.com/6-altcoins-to-consider-this-week-if-youre-thinking-of-moving-out-of-eth/,"As the cryptocurrency market evolves, some investors are looking beyond Ethereum for new opportunities. This week, six altcoins have emerged that show significant potential. These cryptocurrencies offer unique features that might appeal to those considering a shift. Exploring these options could unveil fresh prospects. Discover how these altcoins could become promising additions to an investment portfolio. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges XRP: The Digital Currency Bridging Global Payments with Speed and Security XRP is a cryptocurrency designed to make global payments faster and more affordable. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it operates without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. You can send money anywhere quickly, without hefty fees or needing a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP began with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company behind its development, was gifted 80 billion XRP to improve the network and ecosystem, aiming to facilitate seamless transfers across different currencies. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its focus on fast, low-cost transactions, which is important as digital payments grow. Unlike Bitcoin, which can be slow and costly, XRP offers quicker settlements. Ripple’s efforts to increase liquidity and support the ecosystem could make XRP an attractive option in the current market cycle. As more people seek efficient ways to move money globally, XRP’s features position it well against other cryptocurrencies. Its technology and potential to revolutionize cross-border payments make it a coin worth watching. TRON (TRX): Empowering Creators in the Decentralized Digital Age Imagine a world where content creators have full control over their work and earn fair rewards without middlemen taking a cut. That’s the vision behind TRON (TRX), a blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. Originally built on Ethereum, TRX moved to its own network a year later. TRON aims to revolutionize the internet by putting the power back into the hands of those who create digital content. By allowing consumers to reward creators directly, it cuts out platforms like YouTube and Facebook, ensuring artists receive the full value of their efforts. But TRON doesn’t stop at content sharing. It supports smart contracts and decentralized apps, making it a strong alternative to Ethereum. Transactions on TRON are fast and transparent, and users can track them on a public ledger. With low fees and high scalability, it’s attractive to developers and users alike. In today’s market, as more people seek decentralized solutions and fair compensation models, TRON’s potential shines. Its focus on empowering creators and building a decentralized internet positions it well in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology. BNB: Binance’s Native Coin That’s More Than Just a Crypto Token BNB, launched in June 2017, is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem. It started as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum but now operates across the Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. BNB is used for paying fees, issuing new tokens, and transferring assets within the network. Unlike many other coins, BNB supports smart contracts through a system called Proof-of-Staked Authority. This means users can stake their BNB to help secure the network and earn rewards. Beyond the Binance platform, BNB offers discounts on fees when trading on Binance.com and is accepted by various third-party services. What makes BNB stand out is its quarterly coin burns. Binance reduces BNB’s supply every three months, aiming to cut the initial 200 million coins in half. This process can increase the coin’s value over time by making it scarcer. In the current market cycle, BNB’s strong utility and deflationary model make it an attractive option. While other coins may rely heavily on hype, BNB has practical uses that support its value. As the crypto market evolves, coins like BNB with real-world applications and strong networks may have an edge. Polkadot: Bridging the Blockchain Gap for a Connected Future Polkadot is reshaping the blockchain landscape by enabling different networks to talk to each other seamlessly. Imagine Bitcoin and Ethereum sharing data and value without any middlemen—that’s what Polkadot makes possible. It uses a technology called parachains to boost speed and handle more transactions at once, leaving older networks in the dust. The DOT token isn’t just for trading; it’s a ticket to participate in how the network grows and stays secure. Holders can stake their DOT to help verify transactions and have a say in decisions that shape Polkadot’s direction. In a world where blockchain networks often operate like isolated islands, Polkadot stands out by building bridges. Created by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and supported by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot launched with a mission to create a more connected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. As issues like slow transactions and high fees plague some cryptocurrencies, Polkadot’s scalable and interoperable approach offers a fresh solution. With its strong technology and vision, Polkadot is catching the eye of many in the crypto community who are excited about the possibilities of a more linked and efficient future. Chainlink (LINK): Connecting Smart Contracts to the Real World Chainlink is changing the blockchain world. It bridges the gap between blockchains and real-life data. Think of it as a messenger that brings information from outside sources to smart contracts. Now, smart contracts can interact with real-world data like weather reports or stock prices. Chainlink uses oracles to fetch this data and checks accuracy by comparing multiple sources. This makes smart contracts more useful and reliable. In today’s market, Chainlink stands out. Its technology adds real-world use to blockchains. The LINK token is vital. It rewards those who provide accurate data and helps secure the network. Holding LINK can be attractive because it supports a system essential for many blockchain applications. Compared to other coins, LINK has a clear purpose. As the demand for smart contracts grows, so does Chainlink’s potential. It’s a promising project in the current market cycle. Conclusion XRP, TRX, BNB, and DOT are good options beyond ETH, but XYZVerse (XYZ) offers a unique sports memecoin with huge growth potential.

Europe has found itself on thin ice as China makes progress in negotiations, while the U.S. side stalls. Earlier on Tuesday, April 15, during the mid-Western financial markets, EU’s Trade Chief Maroš Šefčovič ended a two-hour meeting with Howard Lutnick, U.S. Commerce Secretary, with little clarity on the deal. The Euro slightly gained over the U.S. dollar. Market Concerns The prolonged trade negotiations have shaken confidence in major stock markets, led by the U.S. and Europe. On Tuesday, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, urged the United States to engage China. “I don’t think decoupling from China should be objective,” Dinom said. The interrupted global supply chain is anticipated to cause inflation, particularly in the United States. Furthermore, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has continued to weaken amid poor performance from major stock indexes led by the Dow and S&P 500.

As Coinpedia reported, the ongoing Gold rush, catalyzed by capital flight by institutional investors, has helped Bitcoin price gain bullish sentiment in the past week. According to market data from IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin whales have accelerated accumulation pace akin to the pre-2024 March rally. In the past 24 hours, more than $467 million worth of BTC was withdrawn from crypto exchanges. However, the crypto market has yet to experience ‘crazy speculation’ as fear remains palpable. Furthermore, renowned trader Peter Brandt is not convinced a BTC price reversal in the daily time frame is valid yet. A potential consolidation may form a reversal pattern, which may lead to bullish sentiment possibly in the second half of 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After dropping below $80,000 amid the tariff turmoil, the asset has regained its losses and is now trading above $85,000. This recovery marks a nearly 10% surge over the last seven days and comes as investors reassess macroeconomic cues and on-chain signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: What Experts Anticipate Following The Jump Toward $85,000 Bitcoin On-Chain Trends Indicate Continued Uptrend The market’s resilience appears to be underpinned by several important metrics. According to a recent post by CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest, various on-chain indicators continue to suggest that Bitcoin remains undervalued in the current cycle. The analysis points to declining exchange reserves, a stablecoin supply ratio that suggests available liquidity for new purchases, and normalized funding rates that may indicate a reduced risk of overheated market conditions. One of the striking observations in BorisVest’s analysis is the ongoing reduction in exchange-held Bitcoin reserves, which have now returned to levels not seen since 2018. The total number of BTC on exchanges stands at around 2.43 million, significantly down from the 3.4 million observed during the 2021 bull market peak. This reduction implies a shift toward long-term holding behavior among investors, limiting available supply for immediate sale and potentially contributing to upward price pressure. In addition, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) currently stands at 14.3. The SSR is a metric used to gauge the purchasing power available in the market via stablecoins. A lower SSR indicates higher purchasing power and potential for further buying activity. Since the SSR has not reached the elevated levels seen during the last cycle’s peak, the data implies that capital remains on the sidelines and could be deployed as prices stabilize or rise. Normalized Funding Rates and Bullish Implications Another significant factor highlighted in the report is the normalization of funding rates. During Bitcoin’s recent all-time highs, funding rates spiked as long positions accumulated rapidly, suggesting an overheated market and increased short-term risk. However, since the correction, these rates have returned to neutral territory, now hovering between 0.00% and 0.01%. This return to balance is interpreted as a reset of market sentiment, reducing the likelihood of immediate downside caused by over-leveraged longs. The report concludes that the combination of declining exchange reserves, a stable SSR, and subdued funding rates supports a constructive outlook for Bitcoin in the near term. Related Reading: Strategy’s Bitcoin Portfolio Grows To Nearly 600,000 BTC After Recent Purchase While broader macroeconomic factors, such as the global tariff environment and monetary policy, will continue to influence sentiment, current on-chain dynamics suggest that investor confidence remains intact. The focus now shifts to whether these conditions will translate into sustained upward momentum or if a period of consolidation will take hold before the next major move.

Dogecoin (DOGE) just hit $0.149, its lowest since November, triggering high trading volume and fresh whale accumulation. Futures data shows 71.5% of traders going long, hoping for a mean-reversion bounce. Ethereum (ETH), meanwhile, is flashing historic bullish signals. Its RSI just hit a three-year low—levels that previously preceded 5,600% and 322% rallies. With ETH near $1,500 and its BTC pairing at a macro low, analysts now project a breakout to $5K–$7K. But the real momentum may belong to BlockDAG (BDAG). After launching Keynote 3, BDAG has surged 2,380% in its presale, raised $214 million, and deployed a working testnet, all before its token hits exchanges. In a space full of speculation, BDAG is quietly becoming the most prepared—and potentially most profitable—project of 2025. Dogecoin Hits New Lows—Is This the Calm Before a Big Rebound? Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped below the $0.16 support level, touching $0.149 in the latest market pullback. This marked its lowest point since November, wiping out recent gains. Despite the dip, rising trading volume, peaking at $3.51 billion, and a Relative Strength Index near oversold territory suggest a potential turnaround. Futures data adds to the optimism: DOGE open interest rose 4.68% to $1.35 billion, with over 50% of traders going long. On Binance, long positions surged to 71.5%, reflecting a risk-on shift among leveraged traders. Adding fuel, major DOGE whales have re-entered the market, accumulating around 300 million tokens—their first big move since March. If DOGE can hold above $0.14 and demand continues to rise, a mean-reversion rally could follow. Ethereum’s RSI Hits 3-Year Low—Is a 4x Rally Coming? Ethereum’s RSI has dropped to levels last seen before its past major rallies—one leading to a 5,600% surge, another to 322%. Now near $1,500, ETH could be gearing up for a breakout that some analysts believe may take it to $5K–$7K. Its ETH/BTC ratio is also at a macro low, a signal that often precedes Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin. Ethereum is currently hovering near a descending trendline that has acted as resistance since March 25. A failure to break above could trigger a fresh wave of sell pressure, pushing ETH back toward the $1,522 support area, which has held firm in recent dips. Coinglass data shows $77.86 million in liquidations for ETH futures over the past 24 hours, split between $43.16 million in long positions and $34.69 million in shorts. This reflects continued volatility as traders react to resistance levels and regulatory developments. With a possible SEC green light for staking later in the year and technical signals at a critical juncture, Ethereum’s price could go either way in the short term—but the stakes are rising. BlockDAG Explodes 2,380%—Is This the Last Chance to Get In Before $1? BlockDAG (BDAG) is turning heads after the release of Keynote 3, and its $1 price target suddenly looks realistic. Starting at just $0.001, BDAG has surged to $0.0248 in Batch 27—a massive 2,380% gain. With 19.1 billion tokens sold and $214 million raised, all without VC backing, the growth is entirely community-driven. But BlockDAG isn’t just riding hype. The Beta Testnet is already live, running smart contracts and a redesigned explorer. Over 110,000 users are receiving weekly airdrops, while the no-code Token and NFT Creator lets anyone launch digital assets instantly. Add in live dApps and the BlockDAG Academy, and it’s clear this project is building before most have even launched. BDAG is quietly building momentum with real tools and adoption. With listings on centralized exchanges coming soon, this presale could be the last low-price window. A $1 BDAG would mean a $150B market cap—putting it in the same league as crypto’s biggest players. With utility, adoption, and timing all lining up, BlockDAG might just be the breakout of 2025. What’s Next While Dogecoin’s volatility attracts high-risk traders and Ethereum’s setup suggests a macro-level breakout, BlockDAG is positioning itself as the strongest all-around play. DOGE might bounce, but it remains driven by sentiment and speculative volume. ETH has long-term potential, but it now shares the spotlight with rising altcoins built for scalability and utility. That’s where BlockDAG stands apart. The project’s presale has raised over $214M without VC help, its Beta Testnet is live, and users are already interacting with smart contracts and building NFTs via its no-code tools. With over 110,000 users onboarded before launch and exchange listings on the way, BDAG’s $1 price target feels within reach.

The surge showcases a newfound demand for easy liquid staking solutions—the kind that lets a Bitcoin holder earn a staking reward without locking up their tokens. These “LSTs” are a potential path for Bitcoin to bridge the staking gap. They now stand as a tempting, flexible, liquid service in an illiquid staking world. That feature has acquired extra luster as the decentralized finance (DeFi) world has continued to evolve. This market keeps on expanding, and a few major players have started emerging within it. They each offer something a little different, and together they seem to be providing a set of workable conditions under which Bitcoin holders can stake assets. And liquidity—that is, the ability to easily convert your Bitcoin to cash or cash-like equivalents—seems to be a major part of those working conditions. Let’s consider a few of the more prominent protocols that are pushing this rapidly growing segment of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Key Players in the Bitcoin LST Market A handful of prominent protocols hold sway over the Bitcoin liquid staking space, with a firmly established position capturing a largely significant share of the TVL. This only goes to show the variety of products and platforms available for Bitcoin holders looking to participate in staking activities. – Lombard Finance: Beating all the rest with 21,011.23 LBTC, Lombard Finance occupies a top spot in the liquid staking market. Their platform offers the chance to stake Bitcoin with a pin-drop-level of liquidity, far better than what you’d get with any other synthetic asset or even a Diversified Liability Management Strategy. Solv Protocol: Solv has made substantial strides in the Bitcoin LST market, with 7,891.48 SolvBTC.BBN presently staked on its platform. Solv offers a diverse array of staking options, and its contributions to the liquid staking ecosystem have positioned it as one of the dominant forces in this space. Its offerings—ranging from single-staking to complex opportunities involving yield farming or other decentralized finance (DeFi) primitives—put it in a leading position. Bitcoin LST landscape: 6,601.24 pumpBTC. This platform has carved out a niche for itself in the Bitcoin LST landscape and is now attracting users who are seeking innovative mechanisms for staking Bitcoin. pumpbtcxyz is gaining traction in the DeFi space due to its unique offerings and the user-centric design of its platform. – Bedrock DeFi: Bedrock DeFi has marked its territory with 4,579.26 uniBTC in total value locked. It is #2 for total value locked on the Bitcoin blockchain. Known for its emphasis on DeFi (i.e., decentralized finance) protocols, Bedrock DeFi provides users with flexible staking options, allowing them to earn rewards while still accessing their Bitcoin holdings (i.e., the Bitcoin they use to stake). – Lorenzo Protocol: With 1,263.55 stBTC, Lorenzo Protocol is a protocol that has entered the liquid staking sphere with a penchant for the user experience and, more specifically, for accessibility. By offering a simple and straightforward staking solution, this protocol has quickly grown in adoption, particularly among retail investors who are new to the liquid staking space. stBTC stands for the Bitcoin staking token. In the world of cryptocurrency, when people talk about Bitcoin, they are almost always referring to the Bitcoin network’s native currency. For Bitcoin, this currency is the stBTC. It is a tokenized form of BTC that allows holders to stake and earn rewards while still using their Bitcoin. stBTC is a non-redeemable token that gets you staked in the ecosystem. You cannot use stBTC in the same way that you might expect to use a Bitcoin token. You are using a token that represents staked Bitcoin. – Acorn Network: Holding 1,197.09 aBTC, Acorn Network has been gaining momentum, providing users a chance to stake without worry. It is all about decentralized governance at Acorn; there is no way for those in charge to be in charge unless the network allows them to. Transparency is a real value at Acorn, and it is a network just begging to be understood. Acorn and aBTC are not household names. When Acorn is mentioned, some online commentators respond with a confused, “Huh?” This is exactly why Acorn deserves our attention. – Added Contributions: Other remarkable protocols that are helping to generate and develop the Bitcoin LST sector are Solv Protocol, with many offerings like 1,090.96 SolvBTC.ENA and 882.79 SolvBTC.CORE; and allo.xyz, which has 544.13 alloBTC staked.

There is a clear demand tap, then, for not just liquid staking but for flexible solutions that allow users to earn rewards while maintaining the liquidity of their assets. That demand is no doubt a driver of the current Bitcoin liquid staking solutions market, which has over $4 billion currently locked in these on-chain contracts. Widespread fascination with liquid staking demonstrates the sophistication of the DeFi space. Liquid staking is the middle ground between the traditional, unyielding, long-term locked Bitcoin staking that many institutional and retail investors first encounter and the era of true liquidity that we live in now. As much of a stepping stone as it is for converging on the era of liquidity, it represents a moment in that broader transition. Upcoming months will bring more changes and additions to the Bitcoin LST market, as the space around it continues to mature. We can look forward to some yield optimization innovations, for example. More will be said about governance, and the kind of structures that are better or worse for this new setup. One kind of innovation most likely to affect you directly is around liquidity.

Overall crypto market capitalization fell 3.3% in the past 24 hours, with BTC sliding to nearly $83,500 from a high above $84,200 a day earlier. Ether (ETH) and Cardano’s ADA fell as much as 5% to lead losses among majors. XRP showed steady declines, with price action suggesting a plunge in the coming days. Fundamentals showed a positive bump, however, with exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider ProShares amending its spot XRP ETF (to be offered in the U.S.) filing on Tuesday — targeting a launch date of April 30. Bitcoin selling by large investors has eased as they realize losses, on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant shared in a note to CoinDesk. Daily bitcoin selling from large investors has declined from a high of 800,000 BTC in late February to a daily rate of about 300,000 BTC. “The slowdown in selling has come as these investors have been realizing losses since late February amid low prices,” analysts wrote. “However, accumulation by large investors remains weak. Their holdings declined by approximately 30K BTC over the past week, and their monthly accumulation rate dropped from 2.7% at the end of March to just 0.5%—its slowest pace since February 20.” A slump in majors came as Chinese stocks in Hong Kong extended their losses to as much as 2.9% after Wednesday’s open despite the Chinese economy growing 5.4% in the first quarter. The extent of tariff impact remains a concern among traders, whose risk-off moves eventually weigh down crypto markets. ""There can be no doubt that fears of a U.S. recession are intensifying, with major institutions revising their forecasts sharply upwards,” James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, told CoinDesk in an email. “Economic growth is forecast to stall at anywhere between 0.1% and 1%, and many believe these risks are already priced into equities, but I am not so sure that we’ve even seen the bottom.” “It does however feel that Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized asset grows, especially as traditional markets face volatility. While Trump’s policies have introduced significant macroeconomic uncertainty, they may paradoxically be fueling Bitcoin’s recent rise—though the risks remain elevated for all markets, crypto included,” Toledano added.",Markets|Bitcoin|Cardano|XRP,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-16 06:03:42

Nvidia stated in an April 15 regulatory filing that it is expecting around $5.5 billion in charges associated with its AI chip inventory due to significant export restrictions imposed by the US government affecting the company’s business with China. Nvidia said that the US government informed it on April 9 that export licenses are now required for its popular H20 integrated circuits and any chips with similar bandwidth capacity. “First quarter results are expected to include up to approximately $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.” The restrictions specifically mention China, Hong Kong and Macau, and the government indicated that the license requirement “addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.” The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can export to China under previous export rules. Government officials have been calling for stronger export controls on the chip, which was reportedly used to train models from China-based AI startup DeepSeek. The Trump administration initially put the restrictions on hold following President Donald Trump’s meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this month, NPR reported .

43396897,https://nulltx.com/?p=148016,1744783521,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Avalon Labs and Bybit Launch Institutional Yield Layer, Transforming Bitcoin Lending for the CeFi Ecosystem",https://nulltx.com/avalon-labs-and-bybit-launch-institutional-yield-layer-transforming-bitcoin-lending-for-the-cefi-ecosystem/,"Avalon Labs has formally introduced the institutional yield layer on Bybit Earn; it’s a new model for lending Bitcoin and generating yield that combines centralized finance efficiency with decentralized finance innovation. Bybit Earn is a yield product offered by Bybit, a centralized exchange (CEX) for trading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Bybit Earn, as an offering, is more like a savings account than a fixed-income product in terms of how one would expect it to work, and that’s intrinsic to the new model Avalon Labs has built. The new initiative centers on using Avalon’s fixed-rate institutional borrowing infrastructure and integrating FunctionBTC ($FBTC), a version of Bitcoin fully compatible with DeFi protocols and pegged to Bitcoin. This combination allows Bitcoin to become a productive, yield-generating asset without exposing users to the direct dynamics of DeFi, which can be both complex and volatile. Unlocking Yield Through CeFi-to-DeFi Bridging At the core of this system is $FBTC, a pegged Bitcoin asset that holds a 1:1 value with Bitcoin. Holding over $1.25 billion in total value locked (TVL), $FBTC forms a solid bridge, bringing Bitcoin into DeFi across Ethereum and other compatible blockchains. It lets users access DeFi protocols and yield strategies while keeping the economic exposure of Bitcoin. In this innovative structure, Avalon serves as the intermediary that transforms passive Bitcoin into an active yield-generating instrument. It all starts with $FBTC deposited as collateral on Avalon’s institutional platform. Next, Avalon lends against the $FBTC at fixed interest rates. This setup offers predictability and transparency to both borrowers and lenders. The capital that is borrowed—denominated in USDT—gets put to work in high-yield strategies, using yield-bearing synthetic assets like $USDe and $sUSDE, which Ethena Labs issues. These DeFi-native assets are designed to hold their value and pay off consistently, making them ideal for Avalon to construct strategies around. The here is not just in the technology but in the structure of the ecosystem. The entire yield cycle—from collateralization to deployment and eventual yield distribution—is automated and optimized. This means that users can access the benefits of institutional-grade yield farming without the complexities or risks typically associated with DeFi involvement. Making Bitcoin Work Harder This new layer is more than just a new application of blockchain technology; it’s a move toward reinventing Bitcoin’s role in the financial system. Traditionally regarded as a secure way to hold wealth, Bitcoin has until now mostly sat still, with holders hoping for it just to get more valuable. Avalon isn’t just offering a new way to earn that kind of passive income; its model is even more radical because it reinterprets the underlying financial instrument. Avalon enables retail users to access institutional-grade strategies when they integrate with Bybit Earn. This was something only within the reach of the privileged few before. But now, the vast majority can access these kinds of strategies. And there are two things in particular about the way that Avalon works that I want to highlight. One is that the yield is fixed. This is really important because more and more in the crypto space, we are seeing products that have variable yields. Yielding a variable amount is a really good way of saying we might not be able to service our debt. But when you see a product with a fixed yield, it is very clear that particular product is hitting some sort of threshold for servicing its debts. Avalon’s multilayered model also stresses security and simplicity. The whole process is set up to bypass the kinds of overleveraging and murky risk-taking that some DeFi lending platforms have previously dragged us into. By using overcollateralized positions and directing capital only into kinds of high-grade, yield-bearing assets, Avalon guarantees that the yield mechanism remains intact. This partnership has established a bridge between CeFi and DeFi, and it has created a way for users of a Bitcoin-native platform to generate yield on their digital assets. As soon as next month (March 2023), users on BlockFi’s platform will be able to stake their Bitcoin and earn Bitcoin yields, all while the assets remain in a fully collateralized state. This clean structure—a wall between Bitcoin and Ethereum and between BlockFi and the Staking Ethereum-using platform—could make the BlockFi-to-Ethereum staking operation a possible model for CeFi-to-DeFi collaborations in the future. Avalon’s institutional layer on Bybit Earn is now launched, and it is a watershed moment for crypto finance. This system is using the best of both centralized and decentralized worlds, and it is yielding something that looks quite nice for Bitcoin holders. The basic premise—layered on top of Bybit’s existing centralized finance (CeFi) structure—is that there are now two main ways for these holders to earn yields: either by putting their BTC in a custodial solution where it’s safe and sound (but with the risk of it being too accessible to hackers), or by allowing their BTC to be used in a revolutionary new way that more closely aligns with the Bitcoin ethos.

Several high-profile Solana memecoins have recently racked up significant new smart money activity. In this post, we’re going to outline some key trends from this on-chain data. Momentum Picks Up for Select Memecoins Of the 25 memecoins looked at, four have emerged with particularly strong momentum: GIGA, MTN, MUMU, and ALON. These tokens are showing serious inflows from wallets that look a lot like (highly informed) institutional investor wallets. This is behavior very commonly associated with projects that are about to undergo significant price increases. When these tokens are being bought up by wallets associated with mysterious “smart money,” it is very often a sign that the price of those tokens is about to increase. Smart Money Activity on the Top 25 Memecoins on Solana Today Strong Momentum: $GIGA $MTN $MUMU and $ALON are showing strong inflows with clear Smart Money confidence — these are currently hot and worth watching closely. Held, But Quiet: Smart Money is still holding JOBCOIN,… pic.twitter.com/XoErOuhL9P — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 15, 2025 More and more capital is flowing into these projects, and that is indicating a growing belief in their viability—or in the narrative strength of the memecoin space. Whether that belief is being fueled by actual community growth and token utility, by viral marketing or by a speculative mania, these tokens are now way too hot to not trade as short-term opportunities. These tokens are the most alluring in the Solana memecoin space right now, for both retail investors and speculators. But as with all fast-moving, meme-fueled markets, one can’t become complacent. Stay vigilant. What seems to have all the momentum today can very easily run out of gas tomorrow. Quiet Confidence: Tokens Being Held Without Much Activity Conversely, a second bucket of tokens seems to be in a holding pattern. Smart money wallets still hold JOBCOIN, BUCKAZOIDS, SCS, AVA, and RETARDIO, but none of these tokens is seeing inflows or even engagement at this hour. This signals a level of confidence you don’t really get to see in the public markets very often. Smart money is not pulling the fire alarm and exiting these positions. Instead, it’s at worst passively confident and maybe even tentatively bullish on these products. Such behavior can indicate several things. For one, these tokens might be considered long-term holds, with future catalysts expected. For another, the initial hype might have cooled, but there’s no strong reason to exit yet. It’s also possible that liquidity is thin, markets are waiting for the next big move, or just re-engaging. All these possibilities raise a question: Is crypto lull truly a lull, or just a formless, directionless period that will end when something—probably a regulatory event, return of bull market conditions, or both—happens? This set of tokens may be of interest to traders, but they should not take any action yet. These could be positions that explode if sentiment shifts suddenly, but for now, they are dormant. Distribution in Progress: Smart Money Exits Signal Cooling Sentiment The most telling category is where knowledgable money has actively started to move out. Today’s data shows that institutional and seasoned investors have offloaded their positions in CLAUDIUS, GOAT, KAFKA, TITCOIN, and wPOND. This sell-off behavior typically points to a distribution phase, where earlier investors are taking profits and reducing exposure. This movement frequently denotes the commencement of a downtrend or diminishing market interest. If smart money investors are divesting from these tokens, retail investors may be left holding the bag if the broader market sentiment follows the lead of the smart money. It’s a sobering reminder of the meager memecoin market. When confidence appears to be on the upswing, these assets seem to appreciate in value. When confidence slopes downward, so does the value of these assets. Remarkably, tokens that are in the distribution phase rarely experience rapid rebounds without the push of external catalysts or a fresh marketing effort. Traders, be warned: The price action in these tokens now may reflect near-term exit liquidity rather than long-term, serious investment. The projects themselves don’t seem to be healthy. Conclusion: Smart Money as a Compass in Memecoin Chaos A current look at smart money actions in Solana’s top 25 memecoins provides insight into the market’s state. Even as the memecoin scene remains the speculative breeding ground it has always been, the moves of well-informed investors stick out as reliable early indicators of when and where the market might be up to something. For individuals traversing this unstable area, the essential lesson is obvious: track the cash, but grasp the context. Right now, the entities to keep your eye on are GIGA, MTN, MUMU, and ALON, while CLAUDIUS and GOAT look to be on a downward trajectory. As is always the case in crypto, timing is key—especially in the meme economy. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

With net inflows indicating the increasing interest of experienced crypto investors, it took on a decidedly optimistic tone. Even with the inherent volatility and high risk associated with tokens built around memes, it seems as if some institutional wallets and high-volume traders, who we often refer to as “smart money,” are making calculated decisions to allocate capital into certain assets. Those seem to include some from the Solana ecosystem. On-chain data indicates that memecoins saw inflows of around $3.62 million yesterday. Meanwhile, outflows were estimated at about $2.15 million. This results in a net amount of $1.46 million, with a total transaction volume of $5.77 million. The appearance that market participants are accumulating rather than exiting memecoins indicates a shift in momentum that could have them rallying again. When entering positions like these, it’s smart to consider any potential for price moves. Focused Accumulation: Smart Money Bets on Select Memecoins A detailed look at the incoming flow data identifies several specific tokens that prefer capital inflow from discerning investors. The largest single-token inflow was observed in JLP, which attracted $310,000. This is a punchy amount and may indicate growing confidence in the project. Community sentiment around JLP seems to be robust, the tech seems to be shaping up well, and the traders in this space are starting to talk it up more. These are all good signs for JLP. Whether it will make a mind-blowing return in the next couple of months is anyone’s guess. Another notable arrival of capital was in FARTCOIN, which secured $205,000 from smart wallets. This level of inflow, despite the giggle factor that brands like FARTCOIN tend to evoke, does speak to the willingness of certain types of investors to place bets on the very viral and sentiment-driven space that asset classes like FARTCOIN inhabit. Other tokens experiencing considerable capital influxes include MPLX (with a substantial $85,000), ARC ($90,000), and RFC ($61,000). While these figures seem paltry next to those for JLP and FARTCOIN, they are still significant amounts in a niche segment of the market where relatively small sum changes might lead to outsized price reactions. Furthermore, the apparent spreading of smart money across these various tokens could indicate a diversification strategy by investors. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 14/04/25 Yesterday, there was more inflow than outflow Inflow: $3.62M Outflow: $2.15M Volume: $5.77M Net Volume: $1.46M There was inflow into: $RFC ($61K) $MPLX ($85K) $JLP ($310K) #FARTCOIN ($205K) $ARC … pic.twitter.com/00uCOJqx75 — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 15, 2025 Light Outflows Suggest Mild Profit-Taking Although the general sentiment seems to be bullish, a few memecoins experienced outflows. However, these outflows were modest in comparison to the overall inflows and could just be a blip in the trend. HONEY was the leading memecoin in this regard, with $61,000 being withdrawn from it by smart wallets. Of course, this could just be a manner of speaking in describing what is really just a few smart wallets cashing out, but it’s a narrative we’ve seen before. XBG experienced $31,000 in outflows, FWOG saw a decrease of $20,000, and POPCAT registered a $19,000 drop in capital. These figures do not indicate a large-scale withdrawal of funds from these positions, but they may point to a trend where money is moving from these slightly older avenues of investment into either newer or more promising opportunities. It is also important to highlight that such movements are often part of a routine set of actions that occur within the rapidly moving memecoin ecosystem. These outflows, which were relatively mild, suggest that some profit-taking took place but that the overall sentiment is still positive. The outflows were not enough to affect the market narrative, and in fact, they were far outpaced by the inflows into other tokens. Even though some folks were taking profits and there were some outflows from Bitcoin, this is a very bullish kind of signal for Bitcoin. Conclusion: Net Inflows Signal Renewed Confidence in Memecoin Market Smart money activity on April 14 shows revived interest and careful accumulation in the memecoin sector. The inflows topped the outflows by a healthy $1.46 million. That signals a pretty good-sized section of the market memeing itself up in preparations for a potential upswing. Of course, memecoins are still not-wise investments fueled mainly by the enthusiasm of people who have lost all sense of what “money” is. However, tracking sector rotation and what smart money is doing can offer some appearance of illumination in a pretty dark and pretty dumb-space. In the coming days, broader market behavior could be set by sophisticated players paying attention to the tokens JLP and FARTCOIN. These tokens have attracted the interest of some truly serious players. They have caught the attention of sophisticated market participants, for which reason I believe they could be a driver of broader market behavior. Traders should always be careful, but at the moment, signs from smart money movements indicate that the market is preparing, in an unhurried way, for its next big shift.

Source: CoinMarketCap “As a result, short-term signals are not aligning with longer-term indicators, highlighting the disconnect in the market outlook,” Thielen said. “Bitcoin is no longer a parabolic ‘Long-Only’ retail-driven market,” he added, explaining it now “demands a more sophisticated, finance-oriented approach.” “Bitcoin’s rally over the past year hasn’t been driven by typical ‘crypto-bro’ speculation but by long-term holders seeking diversification and adopting a buy-and-hold strategy,” Thielen said. Over the past 12 months, Bitcoin is up 32.80% and is trading at around $83,810 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin price action may repeat 2024 pattern Thielen reiterated his stance that Bitcoin may consolidate for an extended period, much like it did in 2024. “Despite our cautious optimism, we view Bitcoin as trading within a broad range of $73,000 to $94,000, with a slight upward bias,” he said. In March 2024, Bitcoin reached its then-all-time high of $73,679 before entering a consolidation phase, swinging within a range of around $20,000 until Donald Trump won the US elections in November. Related: Bitcoin price recovery could be capped at $90K — Here’s why Many crypto analysts are eyeing June as the month when Bitcoin could surpass its current all-time high of $109,000, which it reached in January just before Trump’s inauguration. Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten told Cointelegraph in early March that “there’s more than 50% chance we will see all-time highs before the end of June this year.” Sharing a similar view, Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson and Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts have also marked June as when Bitcoin could reach a new high. “It is entirely possible Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high before June,” Peterson said. Meanwhile, Coutts said, “The market may be underestimating how quickly Bitcoin could surge – potentially hitting new all-time highs before Q2 is out.” Magazine: Riskiest, most ‘addictive’ crypto game of 2025, PIXEL goes multi-game: Web3 Gamer This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This concerning trend only strengthens the narrative that the SEC lawsuit closure was a typical sell-the-news event. Ripple Whales Are Selling As with all other cryptocurrencies, Ripple whales’ behavior is typically a solid sign of overall market conditions, sentiment, and short-term price directions, at least to some extent. They can impact price moves with massive purchases or sales. After the US elections, whales went on a substantial accumulation spree as their holdings reached a six-year high. A few months down the road, XRP peaked at $3.4. That’s where the landscape started to change and Ripple whales began offloading significant portions of their XRP fortune. This, alongside the overall worsening market conditions and political uncertainty, pushed the asset south to under $2 on several occasions. These market participants have continued to dispose of their XRP tokens since the start of April, thus confirming the ongoing trend. According to Ali Martínez, they have sold more than 370 million tokens in the past few weeks, which equals roughly $800 million given XRP’s price. Whales have sold over 370 million $XRP since the start of the month! pic.twitter.com/KXiCjGHmBM — Ali (@ali_charts) April 15, 2025 Peculiar Timing Whales’ sell-offs began in late March and have continued until today, with a few exceptions. This is so worrisome because they began shortly after Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced on X that the lawsuit between his company and the US securities watchdog had effectively ended after both parties dropped their latest appeals. Although the SEC has yet to publish an official confirmation, industry experts believe this is just a matter of time and has already been priced in. As such, the recent behavior by whales reaffirms a previous narrative that the real gains for XRP came on hype that the lawsuit would be concluded instead of the actual ending—or, as they say in the financial world, a typical ‘buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news’ event. Looking ahead for Ripple, there are still some hype-worthy developments to anticipate, such as a potential approval of an XRP ETF in the States. Such products could restart another hype-driven rally, like Bitcoin last year, but they can also lead to the opposite long-term effects, like Ethereum.

This is not just a new record for Axiom , set on April 14, 2025; it’s also a new record for the meme trading space on Solana. It’s growth like this that makes Axiom the clear frontrunner in the mean trading space on Solana, with a whopping share of something close to 50 percent of the total overall meme trading volume that’s now part of this Solana ecosystem. Axiom is not just the platform on which the most meme trading is happening on Solana; it’s the platform where the most meme trading is happening, period. Meme trading platform Axiom's daily trading volume exceeded $100 million for the first time on April 14, accounting for about 50% of the market share of Solana Meme trading platform; the number of trading users reached 26,800, a record high. Axiom's advantages include the support… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 15, 2025 With this trading volume surge, Axiom also hit another notable benchmark: a record number of daily active traders. On April 14, the platform saw 26,800 individual users participating in trades—its highest user count to date. This dual milestone underscores the platform’s rapidly expanding influence in the highly speculative, yet increasingly strategic, trading world of meme tokens. Strategic Advantages Powering Growth Axiom has not purely risen by itself—it is supported by well-structured strategic and technical advantages that appeal to both casual and seasoned traders. One of the basic building blocks of its growth is that it is backed by Y Combinator, the world-renowned startup incubator. This affiliation gives Axiom early-stage credibility, access to early-stage capital, and a platform that allows it to be more widely exposed. One more reason Axiom appeals to investors is a suite of advanced analytical tools that come with the platform, such as Wallet Tracer and Twitter Tracker. These tools enable Axiom members to keep tabs on not just their own trades, but on significant movements (in both directions) of some of the most important wallets in the ecosystem. With direct access to this data, Axiom members can spot potential price moves before they happen. Axiom has pulled ahead of its rivals by including derivatives trading and basic financial management features in its platform. These are almost nonexistent in the meme coin trading sector and enable traders to flesh out their strategies with a couple of not-so-basic options. If you’re looking to diversify your way out of a spot trading bind, or leverage your way into a new volatility moment, well, that’s what these tools are for. The platform’s growth has also been speeded up by a well-implemented points and referral system. Users earn points based on their trading activity, which can be redeemed for platform benefits or incentives that we plan to offer in the future. Axiom also offers rebates through our invitation program; the users whom you see on this invitation leaderboard have brought in new traders, for whom we now reward them with cash. This gamified approach has not only encouraged higher engagement but has also helped drive user acquisition at scale. Engaging Western communities has significantly contributed to Axiom’s success as well. Axiom has gone live, holding video trading sessions in real time for the Western audience. It has formed partnerships with influencers whose bases of fandom run deep in the Western community. And it has realm (as in the next cosmos) leads to its promotional campaigns, which are now helping it capture the attention—not to mention the imaginations—of English-speaking audiences in the U.S. and Europe. Concerns Linger Over Trading Integrity Even with its solid figures and seeming forward motion, the trading activity on Axiom remains to be seen as legitimate. Some in the crypto community raise eyebrows over the possibility of wash trading or, at the very least, transaction volumes that appear to be artificially inflated. No smoking gun has been found, of course, but the whole situation is a reminder of just how much is still at stake—and still up for grabs—in high-growth crypto platforms. Axiom isn’t the only one with these problems (newer exchanges and platforms across fast-moving market segments seem to be afflicted by them), so this isn’t just an Axiom problem. If Axiom wants to keep up its good reputation and stay in the lead, it seems to me that it needs to be proactive in dealing with these matters—either through audits, improved transparency, or community communication. For now, the figures convey a lot. Axiom has stepped into a commanding position within the meme trading ecosystem of Solana. How did it get there? Through a combination of solid infrastructure, smart strategy, and aggressive outreach. If it keeps addressing concerns about trading behavior and maintains this momentum, we could be looking at the Axiom blueprint for how to meme trade, both in terms of platform design and the way you scale a platform. Not just a personal milestone for Axiom, April 14 may be remembered as a marker in the evolution of meme trading itself—a space once considered a joke, now growing into a complex, data-driven market in its own right.

Analyst Explains Two Reasons,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-bitcoin-btc-price-isnt-making-the-big-explosive-spikes-of-old-times-analyst-explains-two-reasons/,"Despite Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rally in the current cycle, the market is exhibiting unusually calm behavior compared to previous bull runs, according to CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan. In a recent analysis, Dan cited both macroeconomic conditions and changing market dynamics as the primary reasons for this divergence, citing a lack of “explosive new funds and participants.” “In past cycles, the market usually heats up quickly with strong upsides and a large influx of short-term holders,” Dan said. “But this time, the percentage of Bitcoin held from one week to one month is significantly lower than before. This points to a notable absence of speculative capital and new retail participants.” Dan attributes this change to two key factors: Changing Liquidity Environment: “The 2020-2021 bull run occurred in an environment of near-zero interest rates and aggressive quantitative easing,” Dan explained. “Now we are in a phase of high interest rates and tight liquidity. Capital flows are no longer free, and large-scale swings have become more difficult to achieve.” Institutional Dominance: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has structurally changed the market, according to Dan. “Individual investors used to drive the momentum. Now, with institutional capital leading the way, we are seeing a more controlled, ladder-like rise in Bitcoin price, rather than the rapid, emotional rallies of the past,” he said. Related News: Here are the Altcoins Developers Focused on the Most in the Last 30 Days, There Are Surprises - Here's the List This cautious institutional behavior is also reflected in on-chain data, which some analysts suggest may already be signaling a cycle peak. However, Dan believes that the current phase does not imply a traditional boom-and-bust trajectory. Instead, he envisions a longer and more complex market structure ahead. “ETF inflows are still ongoing and if the macro environment gradually eases, we could see meaningful trends emerge in 2025,” Dan said. *This is not investment advice.

43397134,https://nulltx.com/?p=148012,1744784117,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Volatility Strikes: STORY (IP) and ACT Tokens Suffer Sharp Drops Amid Heavy Liquidations,https://nulltx.com/volatility-strikes-story-ip-and-act-tokens-suffer-sharp-drops-amid-heavy-liquidations/,"The latest storm to hit the crypto world came on April 14, when the prices of two big tokens—STORY (IP) and ACT—took a nosedive. This was a day for large-scale liquidations and for expressing concerns about the market’s stability and sentiment. STORY (IP), a token tied to an ever-expanding narrative-driven decentralized ecosystem, took a blunt noontime hit of about 21.5 percent. The token went from $3.90 to a low of $2.90 before it staged a bit of a recovery to close the day around the $4.00 level. While brief, the steep correction sent ripples of activity across the major exchanges, with Binance Futures and the spot markets of OKX appearing to be the centers of that trading volume. $IP dropped over 20% from $3.9 to $2.9 yesterday, before bouncing back to around $4. In the past 24h, $2.07M in positions were liquidated: $1.17M in longs and $902K in shorts. pic.twitter.com/RUh16lwRdz — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) April 15, 2025 Based on data from on-chain and exchange sources, the plunge in IP’s price caused liquidated positions exceeding $2.07 million to vanish within a mere 24 hours. Of these positions, around $1.17 million belonged to long traders, while $902,000 was held by shorters. The almost equally shared load of long and short liquidations between these two trading groups points to a very unstable environment, with rapid price changes stopping both kinds of traders in their tracks. The steep drop, which was almost immediately followed by a recovery, suggests that the token’s price action was influenced by some combination of aggressive leverage trading, stop-hunting behavior, and maybe a touch of automated liquidation. That dynamic—if that’s what was going on—certainly isn’t uncommon in the crypto derivatives space, where rapid price moves tend to be amplified by excessive leverage and market inefficiencies. ACT Token Joins the Slide with Steeper Losses As the market concentrated on the IP token’s sharp decrease, the ACT token experienced a similar, if not more intense, selling on the centralized exchanges. The result of this was a sudden drop of roughly 27 percent in the price of ACT in just a few hours. There are both narrative and infrastructure reasons that make ACT an increasingly attractive token. Despite these reasons to be bullish on the price of ACT, however, the token dropped sharply—much like the IP token. Even though ACT’s trading data lacks some of the granular liquidation figures seen with IP, the drop likely triggered the cascade of automated trades and selling by panicked humans that we associate with downward momentum. Earlier in the week, ACT had shown signs of strength, but its sharp reversal underscores just how unpredictable it is to trade sentiment-driven tokens in a market that is so very speculative. Both IP and ACT falling in sync could signal an even broader decline in the altcoin market—a sign of market fragility. Bitcoin and Ethereum are in somewhat of a range, consolidating at the recent highs. That means the smaller-cap tokens, in comparison to BTC and ETH, are acting somewhat as wildcats—unexpectedly shifting much lower, or, in some cases, much higher (in the direction of the recent highs). Market Context and Caution Ahead Both tokens’ sharp price swings are a stark reminder of the crypto market’s volatility, particularly for sectors driven by the hype of good narratives, potential use cases, or speculation. And yet, even volatility can’t explain why an event on April 14 sent the prices of both swinging in the same direction. Especially traders who use high leverage are advised to stay careful and watchful in these kinds of environments. This is because trading in futures and on margin can yield vast amounts of gains but also expose traders to very large and very quick losses when volatility kicks up. At present, both IP and ACT seem to have slightly stabilized after their sharp declines, but a lot of uncertainty still prevails. Market watchers will be closely observing in the next few days for any signs that renewed volatility may be just around the corner. If that does happen, one can bet that derivatives-heavy platforms like Binance Futures will once again be playing an oversized role in any price action we see across the broader crypto market. In summary, the happenings associated with IP and ACT provide yet another lesson about the market’s behavior, risk management, and the often-unpredictable course of digital assets. Whether or not these tokens make an even more robust recovery or face an ongoing deluge of sell orders will depend, in a very large way, on what happens next in the minds of investors, in the crypto sector’s overall market conditions, and in the digital asset space’s broader bubble or not trajectory.

Multiple major asset managers, including ProShares and Bitwise, have now filed to launch XRP ETF, signaling a wave of institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. The most talked-about filing is from ProShares , which applied for a futures-based “Short XRP ETF,” aiming for a launch as early as April 30, 2025. This would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP through regular brokerage accounts, without buying or holding the asset directly. Kaiko research says XRP leads all altcoins with 10 active ETF filings, more than Solana, Litecoin, or Dogecoin. It also has the strongest liquidity, meaning there’s a lot of buy and sell activity near its market price. This kind of depth is a key factor the SEC looks at when considering ETF approvals. Is XRP the Next Big ETF Bet? Crypto analyst John Squire expressed his excitement after a big development around XRP. Shortly after he shared his thoughts about a possible settlement in the Ripple and SEC case unlocking a major move for XRP, ProShares submitted an official filing to launch an XRP ETF. The target date for this ETF is April 30, 2025. Squire believes this moment signals real momentum, not just speculation. According to him, XRP is no longer sitting on the sidelines waiting for approval. Instead, it is stepping confidently into the spotlight and moving toward broader market recognition. He further highlights that the SEC now holds the key to what happens next. Under the new leadership SEC’s actions will likely shape how far and fast XRP can grow from here. More Players Join the XRP ETF Race Moreover, the ProShares application is part of a larger trend. Other companies like Bitwise, 21 Shares, and CoinShares have also stepped in, looking to offer XRP-based products. These filings reflect rising demand from investors who want exposure to XRP in a regulated and more accessible way. If these ETFs are approved, it could significantly boost XRP’s visibility and credibility within traditional finance circles. The SEC Factor and BlackRock’s Silence One reason for the growing optimism is the shift in the SEC’s leadership. There’s speculation that the agency might drop its appeal in the ongoing Ripple case, which could open the door for a spot XRP ETF. A move like that would be a massive milestone. However, one major player is still missing from the list is BlackRock. Known for its influence in the ETF world, BlackRock’s entry could reshape the entire XRP ETF landscape if it chooses to get involved. For now, XRP’s path to mainstream adoption seems to be gaining traction faster than ever. With strong filings, shifting regulations, and analysts calling attention to the trend, the stage is being set for XRP to finally shine in traditional finance.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-16 06:15:22
43397175,https://nulltx.com/?p=148011,1744784270,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,CeFi Lending Shrinks to $11.2B as DeFi Surpasses 60% Share of Crypto Credit Market,https://nulltx.com/cefi-lending-shrinks-to-11-2b-as-defi-surpasses-60-share-of-crypto-credit-market/,"The lending landscape in crypto has changed drastically over the past two years. Once a prominent sector in the crypto space, centralized finance (CeFi) lenders have seen their presence dramatically reduced, mainly due to the turbulence in the overall crypto market and rising regulatory scrutiny from lawmakers and government agencies. According to a comprehensive review of public filings, bankruptcy proceedings, and voluntary disclosures from active CeFi lending platforms, the combined outstanding loan book size of the CeFi sector stands at just $11.2 billion, as of the end of last year—an incredible 68% drop from its all-time high of $34.8 billion just a year prior. This downturn signifies a key transition in the architecture of crypto finance. Meanwhile, decentralized finance, or DeFi, keeps growing and has emerged as the principal driver of lending in this sector. CeFi’s Downfall and DeFi’s Rise As of year-end 2024, the installment of the mix of old titans and new contenders among the top ten centralized finance (CeFi) lenders reveals a few incumbents. At the top is Tether, the stablecoin (and everything else) issuer that retains a sizable role in the lending space through its affiliated operation, Tether Lending. One spot behind is Galaxy Digital, another player with one foot in the traditional finance world and one foot in the crypto world. Following these two behemoths are two still-relevant crypto exchanges, Ledn and Coinbase. The latter pair even amounts to somewhat of a return to exchange territory among these top ten. Still, both Ledn and Coinbase have shrunk their loan books from 2024’s previous peaks. Most elements of the lending space continue to be very much under the radar. In spite of their efforts, the most recent numbers reveal exactly how much the CeFi lending model has been pulled back. This was a part of the crypto industry that was really quite vivacious, and it was a part that was growing quite rapidly if you looked at it from any angle, whether it was revenue, profit, or just the number of people they were serving. But then we had a bunch of these big high-profile collapses that happened in 2022 and 2023. how big is the crypto lending market? no one has ever really known now we do based on reviews of public filings, bankruptcy documents, and voluntary disclosures from active lenders, the combined CeFi loan book size at YE 2024 was $11.2bn, down 68% from the 2022 ATH of $34.8bn pic.twitter.com/SDceeHxfom — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) April 14, 2025 This retrenchment has opened the door for DeFi to assert itself as the new foundation of crypto lending. The DeFi lending market, by contrast, has grown steadily and now holds a commanding lead. When combined, the total outstanding crypto loans across both CeFi and DeFi platforms are estimated to be around $30 billion. However, over 60% of that amount—more than $18 billion—is now accounted for by DeFi protocols, according to data compiled from on-chain analytics and lending dashboards. Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, and similar decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms have profited from something very basic: their transparency. By virtue of being built on top of public blockchains, these lending protocols are simultaneously open to everyone, in real time, to see what is happening inside them. Unlike traditional banks and even many central business models in crypto, DeFi lending protocols don’t operate in a black box. That’s a pro. (Some would argue it’s a fundamental necessity for any business calling itself decentralized.) Decentralization isn’t a magic wand that protects you from dumb decisions. At the same time, it’s not totally obvious that letting everyone see exactly what’s happening in a lending protocol at any given moment is a good business model. Additionally, when the collateralized debt positions (CDPs) from stablecoin protocols like MakerDAO’s DAI are included, the total amount of credit provided on-chain by decentralized systems grows to over $35 billion. This in turn strengthens and further confirms the appearance of decentralized systems as the source of on-chain credit. CDP-backed stablecoins represent a growing demand for on-chain leverage and debt tools that do not rely on centralized intermediary institutions. These tools are especially popular among advanced users of DeFi (decentralized finance) and requesters of liquidity, such as DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations). They favor them because they offer ways of obtaining liquid assets without the risk of having a counterparty who might become illiquid or insolvent. Transparency vs. Opacity: A Defining Divide One of the most stubborn differences between DeFi and CeFi is transparency. DeFi is inherently open, with data and smart contracts visible to all. CeFi, by contrast, is largely opaque. Much of the data available on CeFi lending is from voluntary disclosures, public filings, and court-supervised bankruptcy proceedings. Because of this, it’s very hard for anyone to get an accurate and up-to-date picture of risk and exposure. The crypto community has been asking for more transparency and better auditing standards from centralized platforms. The implosion of firms like Celsius, BlockFi, and Voyager this past year has only intensified this demand. Meanwhile, DeFi platforms are seen as much more resilient because their operations are open and transparent. If a DeFi platform is operating “under stress,” the community will likely know about it and be able to respond quickly. DeFi is fundamentally community-based and user-stabilized. The future of crypto lending is becoming more and more about decentralization. Risk transparency, programmatic enforcement, and composability have made DeFi the go-to architecture for retail and institutional users who want to access the crypto credit markets. These three elements are not just ideals within the DeFi space; they’re largely what render DeFi usable and reliable. By the end of 2025, CeFi will be an expired concept—it will be gone, while DeFi will exist, possibly with more users than now, and the number of crypto users in general will have grown as well. CeFi’s shriveling has been so rapid that it seems to be possibly history’s first business model that has been put into a coffin by a federal regulatory agency.

Altcoin Market Shrinks Sharply, While Venture Capital Fails to Rebound The broader crypto market is already showing signs of strain. Excluding Bitcoin, the total crypto market cap has fallen to $950b, down 41% from a peak of $1.6 trillion in Dec. 2024. That valuation is lower than levels seen during most of the August 2021 to April 2022 period. How Do You Define a Crypto Bear Market? Several converging signals may be pointing to the start of a new “crypto winter” as some extreme negative sentiment has set in due to the onset of global tariffs and the potential for further escalations. Here's one methodology to track… pic.twitter.com/hXEJwJ2sWx — David Duong (@Dav1dDuong) April 15, 2025 At the same time, venture capital investment, while slightly improved from late 2024, remains 50 to 60 percent below the highs seen during the 2021-2022 bull cycle. Coinbase Cites Tariffs and Tightening as Key Drivers of Market Paralysis According to Coinbase, these declines are being compounded by macroeconomic headwinds. Global tariff escalation and prolonged fiscal tightening have curbed investor appetite for risk, freezing capital flows into altcoins and early-stage blockchain projects. Duong said this has made the investment environment “paralysed,” with traditional and digital assets alike under pressure. Image Source: Coinbase Research “We think this warrants taking a defensive stance on risk for the time being,” Duong wrote, adding that the market may find its floor between mid-to-late Q2 of 2025, potentially setting the stage for a recovery in the second half of the year. Crypto Slump Resembles 2022 Crash, Yet Rebound May Follow Soon While the report did not use the term “crypto winter” lightly, the signals mirror conditions seen during the last major market contraction, which followed the collapse of several large crypto firms and wiped out nearly $2 trillion in value over 18 months. The current market, though less chaotic, shows similar signs of liquidity stress and investor fatigue. Still, Coinbase remains cautiously optimistic. The research team believes a tactical approach will be essential, as sentiment could shift quickly once external pressures ease. “When the sentiment finally resets, it’s likely to happen rather quickly,” Duong noted, pointing to the potential for a more constructive second half of 2025.

43397224,https://nulltx.com/?p=148010,1744784404,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Signals: Key Narratives and Tokens Accumulated Over the Past 24 Hours,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-signals-key-narratives-and-tokens-accumulated-over-the-past-24-hours/,"In the rapidly changing business of crypto trading, smart money wallets—that is, those belonging to well-informed, data-driven investors—are proving an increasingly reliable indicator of what kinds of narratives are bubbling up and what sorts of market trends are on the verge of emerging. In just the past 24 hours, several smart money wallets have been seen amassing all sorts of tokens across all kinds of sectors—from gold-backed tokens and artificial intelligence infrastructure to the latest meme tokens and various RWA (real-world asset) tokenization schemes. The movements offer a glimpse into what sorts of themes are resonating most with investors in the current market. Strategic Accumulation Across Narratives Recent on-chain data shows that smart money has been focusing on four main narratives: gold-backed tokens, AI agents, meme coins, and real-world assets. There were 26 different smart money wallets that participated in accumulation across these thematic sectors. The AI agent account seems to be taking the lead, with 10 wallets involved in the purchase of decentralized AIs. The meme token movement is almost neck and neck with the AI account, as 7 wallets make their way toward meme tokens. Meanwhile, 5 wallets have taken a liking to gold-backed tokens, and 4 wallets are probing the RWA accumulation narrative. These changes imply not just speculative activity but also a more comprehensive strategic vision on the part of experienced market players. It seems they are repositioning in anticipation of shifts in narrative momentum or in response to forthcoming catalysts. Paxos Gold ($PAXG): A Flight to Stability One of the most exciting developments was the purchase of $PAXG, the gold-backed token issued by Paxos. One smart wallet bought over $100,000 worth of the asset, signaling renewed interest in crypto tied to traditional stores of value. With a market cap of $739 million, $PAXG is one of the most established and trusted gold-backed digital assets available. The surge may be linked to its recent addition to Bithumb, a major South Korean exchange, according to @CobakOfficial. This could be seen as a sign that global demand is rising for real-world commodities in tokenized form—especially since investors appear to be looking for hedging instruments in the face of economic tinder that could ignite a downturn. Heurist ($HEU): Betting on AI Infrastructure Artificial intelligence remains a captivating and swiftly expanding sector in the crypto ecosystem, and this has appeared in the behavior of smart money. Two wallets were noticed gathering $HEU, the native token of Heurist—a platform dedicated to constructing infrastructure for autonomous AI agents. Heurist has a market cap of just $4.8 million, meaning it is very early in its growth cycle. Yet the project has been getting some attention lately, mainly through its Twitter account, @heurist_ai. Several wallets notorious for identifying early-stage projects have recently accumulated roughly $18,000 worth of HEUR. While that may seem like a drop in the bucket, especially when you consider that there are some 190,000 HEUR in circulation as of this writing, even a modest buy can have a marked impact on liquidity and price, given that HEUR faces both headwinds (low liquidity) and tailwinds (high volatility) that are typical of small-cap tokens. Memecoin ($MEME): Community-Driven Hype Continues The resilient memecoin narrative is ever alive and well, with $memecoin seeing active accumulation by four smart money wallets to the tune of $92,000. With a market cap of $8.3 million, $memecoin is emerging as a community darling in the new generation of meme tokens. Memecoins may be connected to the @gmonadofficial community’s ongoing initiatives, such as giveaways and engagement campaigns, which appear to be quite effective in driving sentiment and loyalty. The memecoin community may be the most niche in crypto, but it is intensely loyal—three times as many people on Twitter hold a memecoin compared to the average Twitter user. This is their way of giving back to a community that has given them so much. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: Gold-backed tokens (5 wallets) AI agents (10 wallets) MEME (7 wallets) Real-world assets (RWA) (4 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $PAXG -> Paxos Gold is… pic.twitter.com/xCMYSqjloh — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) April 15, 2025 Zodor ($ZOD): Quiet Confidence in Real-World Asset Tokenization A less audible but equally significant development stemmed from the RWA sphere, where $ZOD, the native token of Zodor, witnessed $7,600 in accumulations across three smart money wallets. Even though this sum is modest, the interest it represents is starting to gain some notice, and it signals something that’s been building for a while now: the RWA-to-token trend is starting to pick up some serious steam. Zodor, with a market cap of only $289,000, is one of the micro-cap players in this field. Yet its focus on real-world growth, coupled with its co-ownership models, makes it seem like a viable candidate for getting early believers. The company’s strategy, as outlined by @ZodorRWA, includes building a comprehensive RWA ecosystem that stands a good chance of benefitting from the future institutional push towards tokenized, physical assets. Conclusion: Where Smart Capital Is Moving Though the figures for each individual accumulation may differ in magnitude, the basic patterns grant us the kind of clear insight that we private citizens—sheltered from the omnipresent gaze of state surveillance—enjoy. And what does all this tell us? From the safety of gold-backed tokens to the innovation of AI and the speculative frenzy of meme culture, smart money is clearly courting multiple narratives with long-term potential. For traders and investors observing the markets, these actions may act as early indicators of sectors that are picking up steam. As is always the case, trades driven by narrative can be quite unstable, but tracking the consistently outperforming wallets can lead to identifying opportunities before the wider market takes notice.

43399254,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64171,1744786995,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction For April 16, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-btc-price-prediction-for-april-16-2025/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $83,601, showing uncertainty after recent recovery attempts. On the daily chart, price action hovers between the middle and upper Bollinger Bands, suggesting a slight bullish tilt within a range-bound market. The MACD has turned positive, with green histogram bars and a bullish crossover—indicating possible upward momentum. Yet, Bitcoin’s inability to close above $87,000 following a bounce from $77,900 signals hesitation as volatility begins to compress. Rounded Bottom Pattern Signals Slow Accumulation BTC continues forming a rounded bottom structure on the daily timeframe—an accumulation pattern with bullish implications if confirmed. A breakout above $87,100, the current neckline, would suggest strength and open targets toward $92,000–$95,000. However, repeated upper wicks hint at lingering sell pressure. Unless the price secures a decisive close above resistance, downside risk toward the $80,000 zone still looms. Horizontal Channel Defines Four-Hour Price Action The 4-hour chart shows BTC consolidating within a narrow range between $81,200 and $87,100. This tight structure follows March’s strong recovery from sub-$70,000 levels. Although the price is closer to mid-range, the narrowing Bollinger Bands suggest an imminent breakout. The MACD remains slightly bullish but lacks strong conviction—reflecting weak momentum and a market waiting for a catalyst. Ascending Triangle Suggests Potential Bullish Continuation A classic ascending triangle has emerged on the 4-hour chart, defined by higher lows converging beneath resistance at $87,100. This pattern implies accumulation and brewing breakout energy. If bulls maintain higher lows and volume increases, a breakout could be swift and decisive. Conversely, a breakdown below the $82,500–$81,200 support zone would invalidate the pattern and expose BTC to $78,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bearish Flag Forms on the Lower Timeframe On the 15-minute chart, BTC is forming a bearish flag just below the $84,200 local peak. Price action hugs the lower Bollinger Band, and the MACD is flat with weak red histogram bars—suggesting fading momentum. Short-term traders should stay cautious as intraday dips remain likely before any renewed attempt to move higher. Key Levels: $87K Resistance, $81K Support Immediate resistance is seen at $84,200, with major resistance at $87,100. A confirmed breakout above this level could spark a push toward $90,000 or higher. Meanwhile, support sits at $82,500 and $81,200. A drop below these could lead to a further decline toward $78,000. Tight Bollinger Bands across timeframes highlight growing breakout pressure. Prediction For Today Bitcoin remains range-bound but coiled for movement. Daily and 4-hour charts reflect mild bullish momentum , while the 15-minute chart leans neutral to slightly bearish. The expected trading range is $81,200 to $87,100. A breakout from this band will likely dictate the market tone heading into the rest of the week.

Pseudonymous crypto strategist Dave the Wave tells his 149,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart. An inverse head-and-shoulders structure is traditionally viewed as a bullish reversal pattern, as it suggests that buyers are no longer waiting for the price to revisit recent lows before accumulating the asset. Dave the Wave sees Bitcoin rallying close to $89,000 before dropping to support at $77,000 and rallying to a new all-time high above $110,000. “With a push through the first line of resistance, the neckline of a possible BTC reverse [head and shoulders] would be formed… a great basing pattern.” Source: Dave the Wave/X He also believes that Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend is intact, even though market sentiment for BTC has flipped bearish. He highlights that BTC’s price action suggests that the correction is almost over. “The year rolls on, and so does the chart. Any objective observer of the chart, unfamiliar with the market and not being caught up in it, will no doubt wonder what the panic is regarding price [yes, people can be emotionally detached toward Bitcoin]. Their initial impression of the chart would be a visual one, seeing a regular series of moves and corrections, and they would most likely incline toward seeing the price currently at the end of yet another correction. And yet most of those more closely tied to the market, watching its every daily move in price, are currently in a state of near panic. The explanation of this phenomenon, in my opinion, is collective/crowd sentiment on the one hand, and ‘money illusion’ on the other.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $83,500.

Expert Clears the Air,https://timestabloid.com/will-rlusd-take-some-of-xrps-use-away-expert-clears-the-air/,"WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman), a recognized voice in the crypto space, recently addressed the evolving conversation around Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin RLUSD and its relationship to XRP on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). In a post on X, he explained that while stablecoins like RLUSD may handle direct transfers more efficiently due to their price stability and guaranteed backing, they do not replace XRP’s essential role in the XRPL ecosystem. The discussions of #RLUSD and #XRP are too flat. Will stablecoins take some of #XRP 's use away? Maybe, for direct transfers. Stables are less volatile and guaranteed. And no, XRPL burn fees aren't significant, but XRP always plays a key role via autobridging. If you don't… — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) April 14, 2025 He emphasized that XRP is critical through the ledger’s built-in auto-bridging functionality. According to his explanation, XRP is automatically used when two tokens lack a direct trading pair. This allows the system to bridge transactions using XRP to maintain liquidity and ensure execution. Auto-bridging on the XRPL Auto-bridging is more than an interesting theoretical feature. It operates behind the scenes when pathfinding mechanisms determine that using XRP as an intermediary yields better exchange rates than direct trading. This means that even when users transact with RLUSD or other tokens, XRP can still serve as a liquidity intermediary without the user explicitly holding it. WrathofKahneman highlighted that while RLUSD may become a trusted, low-cost stablecoin issued by Ripple, XRP underpins broader system efficiency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Perspectives and Functional Reality In response to the post, Daniel Keller, CEO of Eminence, challenged the notion that auto-bridging holds practical value, stating, “There is no need for auto bridging. I can onramp 1 to 1 if I want to.” He acknowledged the theoretical value of XRP bridging illiquid tokens but questioned its utility in practice, arguing that real-world usage remains limited unless the assets involved gain meaningful market traction. WrathofKahneman invited further clarification, and Keller elaborated by giving an example of two obscure tokens lacking a direct pair. In that case, XRP could bridge the gap, allowing each party to transact in their chosen asset. While he admitted this mechanism was “a genius idea,” he doubted its relevance until such tokens achieved significant value. He added that if markets existed for those pairs, there would be no need for XRP to step in. While experts have revealed that RLUSD will not limit XRP , Keller strongly argues for the asset’s reduced role in the ecosystem. However, the XRPL documentation confirms that auto-bridging is an active feature. Offers submitted to the decentralized exchange can utilize synthetic order books created through XRP. Suppose no sufficient direct path exists between two tokens. In that case, the system may convert one into XRP and then into the desired asset to optimize rates, making XRP’s position integral to the working of the XRPL .

On-chain data shows $4.6M in USDC were taken out and bridged to Ethereum. The developer behind Official Trump (TRUMP) drained some of the token’s liquidity. A wallet linked to the project launch took 4.6M USDC after removing liquidity in the past day. The selling came just a day before the first unlock for TRUMP, which will release another 20% of the supply. The developer’s wallet still holds over 15.3M TRUMP. Despite this, the developer’s involvement renewed expectations that the upcoming unlocks may increase selling pressure. In addition to whale trades, the DEX liquidity pool is facing ongoing selling pressure, with 706 on-chain wallets selling and only 456 buying. Based on volumes, however, most of the sellers are smaller wallets, while buying comes from whales with slightly bigger orders. TRUMP is seen as a risky trade, which may lead to unexpected rallies. In the past day, the top TRUMP seller whale continued to take profits, locking a total of $28M in net earnings. TRUMP developer drain liquidity from Solana to Ethereum After taking $4.6M from the liquidity pool, the developer immediately bridged the funds to Ethereum. The USDC stablecoins were then moved to an address identified as Coinbase Prime. The move coincides with the Trump family dedication to the Ethereum ecosystem, through their World Liberty Fi fund. The TRUMP token developer bridged the USDC from Solana and sent them to an address linked to Coinbase Prime. | Source: Etherscan USDC is the preferred store of value for World Liberty Fi, though it is unknown if the profits from TRUMP are lumped with the earnings from the DeFi project. Currently, the Trump family holds at least 25.43M USDC as its main storage, based on wallets identified by Arkham Intelligence. TRUMP still carries over $327.6M in liquidity for its main decentralized pair, remaining one of the most funded meme tokens. This would also allow the team and early investors to continue extracting value without causing major panic. After the sale, the token traded at $7.95, with minor slippage for the past day. The TRUMP meme token does not react to timely news or social media trends. The asset mostly moves based on the influence of trader whales, who are often taking profits. In the past day, two prominent whales bought TRUMP for $5M USDC. Both of the identified wallets later sold the tokens for a small profit, as the token bounced from lows of $7.80. Celebrity memes lag behind overall market recovery The recent liquidity removal is similar to the behavior of Melania (MELANIA) team wallets. The token was used to extract value by creating, then draining liquidity pools. After the recent liquidity operations, MELANIA lost more ground, sinking to $0.42. The presence of insiders for celebrity tokens has made investors more wary. The TRUMP rally in the past week is much weaker compared to the overall recovery of Solana meme assets. TRUMP only recovered by 6%, while other Solana tokens easily gained over 22%. TRUMP is still bundled with Solana memes, remaining the token with the biggest market capitalization. However, the asset is not backed by a community or a cult, despite riffing off Trump’s personality. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

43398974,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=25043,1744788350,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,Bitfinex Alpha | Phe Mua Đang Chờ Thời Cơ,https://blog.bitfinex.com/bitfinex-alpha/bitfinex-alpha-phe-mua-dang-cho-thoi-co/,"XEM FULL BÁO CÁO Tạo Tài kHoản Bitfinex Tuần qua, Bitcoin đã có màn hồi phục đầy ấn tượng khi tái chiếm mốc $85,000. Sự bật dậy này được thúc đẩy bởi làn sóng lạc quan vĩ mô sau khi Tổng thống Mỹ Donald Trump tuyên bố tạm ngừng áp thuế mới trong 90 ngày, giúp giảm căng thẳng thương mại và khơi dậy khẩu vị rủi ro của nhà đầu tư. Đặc biệt, sự phục hồi này không dựa vào các vị thế đòn bẩy phái sinh mà đến từ nhu cầu thực tế trên thị trường giao ngay—chứng tỏ niềm tin mạnh mẽ của người mua. Kết thúc tuần, Bitcoin tăng 6,67%, kéo dài đà tăng 15% từ đáy và cho thấy đợt điều chỉnh hiện tại—kéo dài 83 ngày với mức giảm 31%—vẫn nằm trong phạm vi bình thường của các đợt thoái lui giữa chu kỳ trong các thị trường bò trước đây. Giá Bitcoin và Các Đợt Điều Chỉnh Hàng Năm (Nguồn: CryptoQuant) Dữ liệu về khối lượng tích lũy trên các sàn giao dịch lớn cho thấy lực mua mạnh mẽ liên tục, nhưng giá vẫn bị kẹt trong khoảng 75,000 − 85,000. Sự phân kỳ này gợi ý về khả năng bứt phá tăng nếu nguồn cung tiếp tục suy giảm. Tuy nhiên, một đợt điều chỉnh ngắn hạn vào đầu tuần này là điều được dự đoán , chủ yếu do chốt lời. Phản ứng với đợt giảm này — liệu người mua có tiếp tục hấp thụ nguồn cung hay không — sẽ quyết định xem Bitcoin có tiến tới mốc $90,000 hay không. Dữ liệu on-chain cũng ủng hộ xu hướng tích cực , khi lượng tích lũy của các nhà đầu tư dài hạn lần đầu tiên chuyển sang trạng thái tích cực kể từ tháng 12. Dù tín hiệu ban đầu khá khả quan, sức mạnh của xu hướng vẫn phụ thuộc vào cách nhu cầu giữ vững trong bất kỳ đợt suy yếu ngắn hạn nào. Tháng 3 mang lại một chút thở phào khi chỉ số giá tiêu dùng (CPI) giảm nhẹ nhờ giá năng lượng và vận tải sụt giảm. Tuy nhiên, dưới lớp vỏ bình yên tạm thời này là cơn bão đang âm thầm hình thành: các mức thuế quan mới, đặc biệt là những chính sách gần đây của Mỹ, đang chuẩn bị đẩy giá cả tăng cao trong những tháng tới. Lạm phát cốt lõi, đặc biệt trong lĩnh vực dịch vụ và nhà ở, vẫn cao ngất ngưởng , củng cố lo ngại rằng áp lực lạm phát chưa hề nguội. Bối cảnh lạm phát bất ổn này trùng hợp với sự hỗn loạn ngày càng tăng trên thị trường tài chính. Chính sách thương mại thay đổi chóng mặt—ban đầu tăng thuế, sau đó vội vàng rút lại—đã làm lung lay niềm tin toàn cầu vào định hướng kinh tế Mỹ, gây ra dòng vốn chảy khỏi tài sản Mỹ . Chỉ số Đồng Đô La Mỹ (DXY) (Nguồn: Tradingview) Đồng đô la suy yếu mạnh, lợi suất trái phiếu kho bạc tăng vọt , và biến động thị trường tăng cao , cho thấy một môi trường ngày càng căng thẳng. Ngay cả đợt tăng ngắn hạn của S&P 500 cũng không đủ để xoa dịu nỗi sợ hãi, khi các nhà đầu tư vẫn vật lộn với hậu quả của các chính sách thất thường. Trong khi đó, tâm lý người tiêu dùng đang lao dốc. Khảo sát mới nhất từ Đại học Michigan cho thấy sự sụt giảm nghiêm trọng về niềm tin và kỳ vọng lạm phát tăng vọt lên mức cao nhất kể từ đầu thập niên 1980. Các hộ gia đình đang chuẩn bị tinh thần cho lạm phát dai dẳng và thất nghiệp tăng cao, cắt giảm chi tiêu và đề phòng khó khăn kinh tế. Sự suy giảm niềm tin tài chính và tiêu dùng này cho thấy nền kinh tế Mỹ đang đứng trước bước ngoặt quan trọng. Khi nỗi lo lạm phát đối đầu với tăng trưởng chậm lại, Fed rơi vào thế khó : có thể phải trì hoãn việc cắt giảm lãi suất trong khi cố gắng cân bằng giữa kiểm soát lạm phát và tránh suy thoái toàn diện. Sự kết hợp giữa lạm phát do thuế quan, biến động thị trường do chính sách và niềm tin tiêu dùng sụp đổ vẽ nên một bức tranh u ám: trừ khi sự rõ ràng và ổn định sớm quay lại, nền kinh tế Mỹ có thể đang bước vào giai đoạn khó khăn nhất kể từ đại dịch. Trong tuần qua, Galaxy Digital đã nhận được sự chấp thuận từ SEC để tái cơ cấu tại Delaware và niêm yết trên Nasdaq với mã cổ phiếu GLXY. Đây là một động thái chiến lược, đánh dấu sự chấp nhận ngày càng tăng của thị trường vốn truyền thống Mỹ đối với các khoản đầu tư tài sản kỹ thuật số. Tuy nhiên, mặt tối của sự cường điệu không kiểm soát cũng được phơi bày. Tại Argentina, một cuộc điều tra quốc hội đã được khởi động về Libra token—một memecoin trên Solana mà Tổng thống Javier Milei từng công khai ủng hộ trước khi giá trị của nó sụp đổ hơn 90%, xóa sổ hàng tỷ USD vốn hóa thị trường. Ban đầu là biểu tượng ủng hộ đổi mới, nhưng nhanh chóng biến thành bê bối, với các nghị sĩ yêu cầu giải trình và thậm chí kêu gọi luận tội Milei. Ở Mỹ, Bắc Carolina đang đi theo hướng thận trọng nhưng lạc quan bằng cách giới thiệu dự luật Digital Asset Freedom Act , cho phép một số loại tiền mã hóa được sử dụng để nộp thuế và giao dịch—với điều kiện chúng đáp ứng các tiêu chuẩn nghiêm ngặt về thanh khoản, phi tập trung và tính toàn vẹn thị trường dài hạn. Với những diễn biến đa chiều—từ sự chấp nhận thể chế đến bê bối chính trị—bức tranh crypto tiếp tục phát triển như một công cụ chuyển đổi và cũng là tấm gương phản chiếu những thách thức của sự gián đoạn. Với những diễn biến đa chiều—từ việc chấp nhận tổ chức đến những hệ quả chính trị—thế giới crypto tiếp tục phát triển như một công cụ chuyển đổi đồng thời phản ánh những thách thức của sự phá cách. Bitcoin đang chứng kiến sự phục hồi mạnh mẽ với niềm tin từ người mua thực tế, nhưng thị trường vẫn cần vượt qua các đợt điều chỉnh ngắn hạn để xác nhận xu hướng tăng. Trong khi đó, tình hình kinh tế vĩ mô toàn cầu đang đầy biến động, đặt ra nhiều thách thức cho cả thị trường truyền thống và crypto. Thế giới tiền mã hóa tiếp tục là điểm sáng chuyển đổi, nhưng cũng là tấm gương phản chiếu những rủi ro và bài học từ sự đổi mới.

Profit-Taking and Recession Fears Hit Prices,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-crypto-market-down-today-profit-taking-and-recession-fears-hit-prices/,"The post Why is Crypto Market Down Today? Profit-Taking and Recession Fears Hit Prices appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin and other major cryptos like Ether, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin and Cardano also dropped over 3% early Wednesday as traders booked profits after Tuesday’s price rally. The total crypto market cap fell over 4% in the past 24 hours to $2.73 trillion as per data from Coingecko . Bitcoin was down to $83,600 from $84,200 while Ether and Cardano fell as much as 5%. XRP continued to drop and it may further face more downturns. However, the XRP ETF filing by ProShares was some positive news as it plans to launch it on April 30. BNB is also down around 2%, currently trading at $578. Investors Still Cautious The movements in crypto market shows that investors are still cautious and avoiding risk due to global economic issues and upcoming regulatory changes. According to data from CryptoQuant, daily sales by large Bitcoin investors have now dropped from 800,000 BTC in late February to about 300,000 BTC now, as they have already sold most of their coins at loss. Analyst Ali Martinez highlighted in a recent post that whales have been taking profits during the recent rally, offloading over 29,000 BTC since April 9. In a recent X post he also shared that over $600 million in short positions could get liquidated if Bitcoin bounces back to $86,900. There has been a drop in accumulation by large investors and their holdings have declined by about 30K BTC over the past week. Meanwhile, major cryptocurrencies slumped as Hong Kong stocks fell 2.9% despite strong growth in China’s economy. The ongoing tariff troubles continue to push traders to avoid risk assets, impacting crypto markets. Amid market uncertainty, stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) have held their ground. Tether is currently trading at $0.9999, with a market cap of $144.56 billion. While USDC is currently trading at $1. Stablecoins are becoming essential for liquidity and security during volatile times in crypto like now. Nvidia Drop Impacts Crypto Prices Markets saw a downturn on Tuesday evening after Nvidia Stock dropped, which was triggered due to a $5.5 billion charge as a result of US government’s decision to ban the company from selling H20 chip sales to China. As a result, Bitcoin fell to $83,600 while XRP and Cardano followed suit falling over 2% and 4% respectively. Besides, AI coins also struggled as Nvidia’s stock dropped 8% to $89.10. The company revealed that it expects to loose $5.5 billion in Q1 due to restrictions on its H20 chip exports to China. Markets Await Powell’s Speech Amid Rate Cut Speculation Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to speak today about the US economy as the markets watch closely for any signs of a potential rate cut sooner than expected due to the ongoing tariff concerns and the rising concerns about a recession. Research suggests that the trade war and Trump tariffs might lead to lower inflation which may give opportunity to Fed to cut rates. There are rising fears of recession. Although some think that markets have already priced in the risks, the worst may still not be over, claim analysts. Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralised asset is rising amid traditional volatility. However, Trump’s policies could help drive Bitcoin gains although market risks remain high. Coinbase’s recent report shows that the crypto markets excluding Bitcoin have seen a drop of 41% from its December peak. Besides, VC investment in crypto is also down by 50-60% from 2021-22 highs. However, it predics that the crypto market will recover in Q3 after hitting its lowest point by mid-to-late Q2 2025.

MUTM token pre-sale has become successful by attracting 409 million dollar purchases and expending $6.8 million to earn 8,300 token holders. Current MUTM presale phase at $0.025 attracts strong investor interest as the price will rise to $0.03 during Phase 5. Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself from Solana network through decentralized lending features that provide useful application value thus anticipating future market performance. Numerous market predictions exist in the crypto sector because this particular token attracts intense market discussion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Ignites Demand The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 4 presale maintains its fast sales velocity at its present market price of $0.025. During its current presale phase people who buy MUTM can expect their investment to rise 20% in value until phase 5 reaches $0.03. Tokenomics show buyers an attractive opportunity because the initial launching price will be $0.06 allowing them to earn 140% profit. The market presages MUTM token to achieve $2.50 value following launch and suggests a profit potential exceeding 9900 percent for incoming investors. The team works to update security measures at the same time as Certik performs smart contract verification tests that will be made available on social networks soon. Buyers rush to obtain tokens because their low supply continues to reduce their number in the market. Transitioning to community perks, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rolling out a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders. Those securing a spot earn bonus tokens, a clever nudge to hold tight. Unlike Solana’s broader ecosystem play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) focuses on lending precision, making it a magnet for yield-seekers. Phase 4’s low entry price is a fleeting chance, and the crypto market is alive with FOMO as investors scramble. Solana’s 2021 Run Fades in Comparison The SOL token from Solana experienced explosive growth in 2021 because developers and fast-processing became prevalent in its ecosystem. The massive 12,000% price increase of the asset occurred without the benefits that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings to the Solana ecosystem at present. The sharp price increase of Solana caused early investors to experience fluctuating value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) builds its market ascendancy through pre-sale phases along with loan incentives to maintain stability. The $0.025 current price of Solana seems like a solid deal when you compare its values to previous Solana prices. Investors now choose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) above other cryptocurrencies because its strategy of reaching gains is straightforward. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Sparks Urgency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes new expectations in the crypto world. The early adopters of Mutuum Finance benefit most from the presale format because phase 4 sells at $0.025 until the next price increase to $0.03 takes effect. The 140% initial stake within a $0.06 entry point has solidified but a forecasted ending price of $2.50 will energize the entire crypto marketplace. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) focuses exclusively on lending effectiveness since it already attracted 8,400 investors while Solana’s platform remains expansive. Leaderboard rewards play a motivational function by creating a competitive dynamic for buyers to secure allocations in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Investors are circling. The upcoming phase 5 of MUTM stands as an imminent release after the current phase 4 period. The crypto market responds favorably to strategic investment decisions by showing a brighter rally potential than Solana’s widespread growth during 2021.

But the signs were there—tiny price, growing community, unexplored utility, and an early group of believers. Now in 2025, some investors are looking for that moment again. And while no two projects are ever the same, the energy building behind MAGACOINFINANCE feels familiar. While large-cap assets like XRP , ETH , Chainlink (LINK) , and SUI continue to deliver utility and long-term value, the traders seeking exponential growth are looking beneath the surface. That’s where MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious traction. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! MAGACOINFINANCE – The Pre-Discovery Stage Investors Love Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE trades at just $0.0002908 —and the project has already locked in a listing target of $0.007 , offering early investors a clean 25x ROI potential. But numbers only tell part of the story. What’s capturing attention is the pattern: a growing retail base, daily wallet inflow, rising social activity—and a price level that still lets investors go big from a small base. This is the early calm that often precedes the storm. It’s where conviction is formed—well before headlines catch on. Projects like these don’t knock twice.

Bitcoin Binance Net Taker Volume Is Currently At A Notable Positive Level As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, Bitcoin taker buyers have dominated the Binance platform during the last few days. The indicator of relevance here is the “Net Taker Volume,” which measures the difference between the taker buyer and taker seller volume on any given centralized exchange. When the indicator has a positive value, it means the taker buyers are outweighing the taker sellers on the platform. This kind of trend implies a bullish sentiment is shared by the majority of the users. Related Reading: Behind The Mantra (OM) Collapse: Glassnode Reveals The On-Chain Side Of Things On the other hand, the metric being under the zero mark suggests a bearish mentality is dominant on the exchange as the short volume is larger than the long volume. Now, below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 7-hour moving average (MA) Bitcoin Net Taker Volume for the largest exchange in the cryptocurrency sector: Binance. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume has mostly remained inside the positive territory since April 11th. The metric’s green values haven’t been small, either, which suggests the futures users have been placing some aggressive bullish bets on the platform. The shift toward the positive sentiment on the exchange has come as BTC has been making recovery following the news of the 90-day pause on the tariffs for most countries. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to move in the direction that the crowd least expects, so this bullish mood may actually prove to be a bad sign for the recovery rally. It only remains to be seen, though, whether a top would now be hit or if the bet of these investors would pay off. In some other news, the 30-day of the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio has hit the lowest level in six months, as an analyst has pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that basically tells us about the profit-loss status of the Bitcoin investors. From the chart, it’s apparent that the 30-day value of this metric has plunged recently, suggesting holder profitability has declined.

BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $85,800, up more than 8% in the last seven days.

Tariffs on US imports jumped to 125% , and restrictions were introduced on the export of rare earth elements, materials essential to global manufacturing. Within days, trade between the world’s two largest economies had slowed dramatically. The markets didn’t take it well. The S&P 500 dropped 15% in under a week. The Nasdaq was down nearly 20% for the year by April 7. Investors were rattled by the scale of the escalation and the potential knock-on effects on global growth. Crypto didn’t stay quiet either. As stocks fell and uncertainty spread, Bitcoin ( BTC ) saw a surge in trading volumes, with many turning to digital assets as a hedge. What follows is a closer look at how these trade tensions hit financial markets, starting with traditional stocks and then crypto. Trade wars' impact on stocks Markets don’t like surprises – and they really don’t like trade wars. When the US announced its 145% tariff on Chinese imports in April 2025, the response from Wall Street was swift and brutal. The S&P 500 tanked more than 10% in just two days. Tech stocks took it even harder, with the Nasdaq shedding nearly 20% since the start of the year. Still, if you’ve watched the markets through past trade fights, this was all pretty familiar. In 2018–19, during the first round of US-China tariff battles , every tweet about negotiations or new duties sent stocks whipsawing. And if you zoom way out, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 is one of the earliest and most notorious examples as tariffs piled up, global trade shrank and the Great Depression got worse. So why do stocks get hit so hard? A few reasons. Tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, which squeezes profit margins for companies that rely on international supply chains. When a carmaker or electronics brand has to pay more for components, that cost either eats into profits or gets passed on to customers. Either way, it’s bad news for earnings, and earnings are what drive stock valuations . There’s also the fear factor. Trade wars inject a lot of uncertainty into the economy. Will more tariffs follow? Will other countries retaliate? That kind of unpredictability causes companies to delay investments and hiring, while consumers may start pulling back on spending. This shows up as increased market volatility, often tracked by the VIX , Wall Street’s so-called “fear index,” which tends to spike in times like this. Central banks sometimes try to cushion the blow by tweaking interest rates or injecting liquidity. But there’s only so much they can do when the root of the problem is political. Did you know? On April 9, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on new tariffs for most countries. He explained the pause by saying people were getting ""a little bit yippy,"" his way of describing nervousness in the markets. When tariffs hit, crypto takes a punch, then bounces back The tariffs hit crypto, too, but the market recovered just days later, reflecting crypto’s volatile yet responsive nature during global uncertainty. After Trump’s new tariffs were announced, Bitcoin slid to around $76,000. Ethereum and other major tokens followed suit, and around $200 billion was wiped off the total crypto market cap in a few days. Again, this kind of sell-off isn’t unusual. When uncertainty spikes – like during a sudden escalation in global trade tensions – investors tend to play it safe. That means pulling out of more volatile assets, including crypto, and moving into what’s seen as safer ground, like cash or bonds. It’s a classic “risk-off” move. But as you've seen before, crypto doesn’t stay down for long . By mid-April, Bitcoin had bounced back and was trading at just under $85,000. Ether ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ) and other major altcoins also recovered some ground. For many investors, this rebound was a reminder that while crypto is volatile, it’s also increasingly viewed as a valuable hedge, something outside the reach of any government or policy decision. In 2018–19, during an earlier round of US-China tensions, Bitcoin showed similar patterns: short-term drops followed by fast recoveries. And earlier in 2025, new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports triggered a dip that quickly reversed. Stocks, meanwhile, tend to have a tougher time recovering. As of April, the S&P 500 is down nearly 9% for 2025, and the Nasdaq is off more than 13%. There was a brief lift after the US paused some tariffs for 90 days, but overall, the mood in equity markets remains shaky. What trade wars mean for supply chains and consumers The ripple effects of the 2025 trade war are grinding through global supply chains, one industry at a time. From electronics to autos to medicine, the cost of moving goods worldwide is rising. Let’s talk about a few industries in particular. Trade wars' impact on electronics and semiconductors Electronics are at the heart of it. In 2024, the US imported $146 billion of electronics from China. With tariffs on those goods jumping, companies could be looking at an added $182 billion in annual costs if these rates stick around. This is also a problem for consumers. Take Apple, for example. With no lasting exemption for phones, an iPhone 16 Pro Max could climb from $1,199 to over $1,800. Add in uncertainty about future duties on laptops, chips and smart devices, and the entire sector is on edge. Trade wars’ impact on the automotive industry Carmakers are in a similar bind. The US has raised tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles from 25% to more than 100%. And it’s not just the finished cars — batteries, chips, and other parts sourced from China are also caught in the crossfire. For electric vehicle manufacturers, in particular, this is a serious hit. Chinese battery components are essential for many US and European EV brands. With supply chains suddenly tangled in red tape and higher costs, some automakers are pausing production or switching suppliers. Trade wars’ impact on pharmaceuticals Even the healthcare system is feeling it. The US depends heavily on China for key medical supplies and pharmaceutical ingredients. With new tariffs, prices are climbing, and existing shortages are worsening. Industry experts are warning of major disruptions. Everything from common medications to hospital-grade equipment is likely to get more expensive. And in a healthcare system already under pressure, even a small bottleneck can cause big problems down the line. Did you know? European markets are already seeing signs of a spillover. Chinese exporters, locked out of the US by tariffs, are redirecting goods to Europe, especially in tech and consumer goods. Rising tariffs, shaky markets, what’s next? The big picture regarding the 2025 US-China trade war still looks hazy amid real implications for investors, business leaders and policymakers worldwide. Let’s examine the short-, medium- and long-term outlooks. Short-term There’s been a bit of short-term relief . When the US announced exemptions on some tech products – like smartphones and laptops – from the harshest tariffs, markets breathed a sigh of relief. The S&P 500 saw an uptick, and global markets followed suit. Tech-heavy Asian indexes rallied, and European markets, including Germany’s DAX and the UK’s FTSE 100, climbed. Even US bank earnings helped push optimism a bit further. Still, it’s probably temporary. These exemptions are under review, and the bigger trade policy feels like shifting sand. Medium-term Looking ahead a bit further, the risks start to grow. If the trade conflict drags on, it could seriously slow down global growth. JPMorgan recently raised its global recession risk to 60%, and that’s no small thing. Central banks are already weighing their next moves; interest rate adjustments, coordinated actions, and contingency planning are all back on the table. Some voices, like former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, call for a global response similar to what we saw during the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile, businesses are rethinking their supply chains and scrambling to find alternatives, something that’s easier said than done. Long-term You’re seeing a pivot with nations exploring new trade deals and trying to reduce reliance on traditional powerhouses. China, for example, is pushing harder to internationalize the yuan and accelerate its Belt and Road Initiative. Conversely, the US is leaning into domestic manufacturing and trying to reduce its dependence on imports. And the consequences could be massive. The WTO has warned that trade between the US and China could shrink by as much as 80%. That’s a huge shift, considering these two countries account for about 3% of global trade. If that drop materializes, it could rattle the global economy.",trade war,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-16 07:40:00

In a recent post , on-chat data analysis from LookOnChain revealed that developers of the presidential meme coin previously extracted a large chunk of USD Coins ( USDC ) from its liquidity pool, worth $4.6 million. The USDC pile is later bridged to Ethereum ( ETH ) before they were deposited into Coinbase Prime. Coinbase Prime is a brokerage platform that is mainly used for institutional investors. It offers institutional traders a variety of on-chain services including trading, financing, and custody of digital assets. Many traders in the comments section responded to this news by speculating that a big sell-off may be on the way as the team appears to cash out on the token’s liquidity. While it does not indicate a full exit, traders have begun raising concerns about a potential rug pull . “When the dev moves like that, it’s usually one of two things.. exit or reposition. Either way, eyes on the next move,” said one trader. “Trump and dump move,” said another trader.

Investments would have been capped at 10% of funds per account, and assets would be held with regulated custodians.

Figma, the design software giant, has thrown down the legal gauntlet, sending a cease-and-desist letter to Lovable, a rising star in the AI startup world. And guess what’s at the heart of this clash? The term ‘Dev Mode’. Yes, you heard that right. Figma’s Trademark Claim on ‘Dev Mode’: What’s the Fuss? Figma confirmed to Bitcoin World that they indeed sent the letter to Lovable, urging them to stop using ‘Dev Mode’ for their new feature. Why? Because Figma trademarked ‘Dev Mode’ last year. Now, you might be thinking, ‘Dev Mode’? Isn’t that, like, a super common term? You’d be spot on. ‘Dev mode’ or ‘developer mode’ is practically industry jargon for a setting that unlocks advanced features for programmers. Think of it as an edit mode for code. Consider this: Tech Giants Use It: Apple’s iOS, Google’s Chrome, and Microsoft’s Xbox all have features officially called ‘developer mode’, often shortened to ‘dev mode’. Open Source Staple: Countless open-source projects use ‘dev mode’ as a feature name. Atlassian’s History: Even Atlassian, a major software company, used ‘dev mode’ in their products long before Figma got its trademark. So, it’s a bit like claiming ownership of the word ‘edit’ in the context of software. Figma, however, clarifies that their trademark is specifically for the shortcut ‘Dev Mode’, not the full ‘developer mode’. Still, as some online commentators pointed out, it feels a little like trademarking ‘bug’ to refer to ‘debugging’. Why the Cease and Desist ? Protecting the Brand Why is Figma going after Lovable with a cease and desist letter? Well, trademark law is all about protecting brand identity. If Figma doesn’t defend its ‘Dev Mode’ trademark, the term could become generic, weakening their legal claim. It’s a case of ‘use it or lose it’ in the trademark world. The internet is buzzing with opinions. Some argue that ‘dev mode’ is already generic and shouldn’t have been trademarked in the first place. They suggest Lovable should fight back. But here’s the catch: Legal Battles are Pricey: Taking on a legal fight, especially an international one, is expensive. Lovable, as a young Swedish startup, might find this a daunting prospect. Easier Alternatives Exist: For Lovable, changing the feature name to ‘developer mode’ or something else entirely is a much cheaper and less risky option. Lovable: The AI Startup Challenging Figma with ‘Vibe Coding’ This isn’t just about a trademark squabble; it’s also about competition. Lovable is making waves in the tech world with its ‘vibe coding’ approach. What’s ‘vibe coding’? Imagine describing what you want in a text prompt, and AI builds it – code and all! Lovable’s ‘Dev Mode’ feature, launched recently, allows users to tweak that AI-generated code. Lovable is positioning itself as a direct competitor to Figma, even stating on their homepage that designers can use Lovable to bypass ‘tedious prototyping work in tools like Figma.’ Ouch! Many new startups are embracing this approach, seeing Lovable as a fresh alternative. David vs. Goliath? Figma Cracks Knuckles at Upstart Competitor Figma, valued at a massive $12.5 billion, seems to be flexing its muscles at a smaller, but increasingly noticed competitor. A Figma spokesperson hinted at this competitive aspect, telling Bitcoin World that they haven’t sent similar letters to giants like Microsoft because their products are in ‘a different category of goods and services.’ Essentially, Lovable is seen as a more direct threat. But is ‘vibe coding’ truly a threat to established design tools like Figma? Figma CEO Dylan Field downplayed the idea in a recent conversation with Y Combinator’s Garry Tan. While acknowledging the speed of vibe coding, Field questioned its ability to deliver polished, finished products, not just rapid prototypes. He sees a ‘disconnect’ in vibe coding’s current capabilities, for both design and code. Lovable’s Unfazed Response to the Trademark Threat Interestingly, Lovable co-founder Anton Osika seems unfazed by the legal threat . He shared a copy of the cease-and-desist letter on X with a grinning emoji. Does this signal a willingness to fight, or simply a calm acceptance of the situation? Only time will tell how this tech industry drama unfolds.

Media Network (MEDIA) sank to as low as $1.68 on April 16, cutting its market cap from over $1 million to around $430,000. Trading volume also plunged nearly 85% in the last 24 hours as users rushed to exit. Coinbase pulled the plug on MEDIA on April 15, 2025, at around 2:00 PM ET, halting trading across multiple services, including Coinbase.com (both Simple and Advanced Trade), Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. While users can no longer trade MEDIA on Coinbase, they can still withdraw their tokens to external wallets. According to Coinbase, the delisting followed a routine asset review meant to ensure all tokens met its listing standards. While no specific reason was given, projects often get delisted due to low trading activity, slowed development, or possible regulatory concerns. Coinbase first announced plans to drop MEDIA on April 1, and since then, the token has dropped by 84.5%. From its all-time high of $312.25, MEDIA has lost more than 99% of its value per CoinGecko.

Its official X account, @Media_FDN, has been inactive since August 2024, and there have been no meaningful updates about the Media Network mainnet launch for nearly a year. MEDIA went live on Base in March 2024, but developers have since failed to share any developments or engage with the community. Frustrated users have criticized the team for disappearing post-launch, with many blaming the prolonged silence for the token’s downfall. a whole year and zero updates on anything…im about to dump this trash scam — Neighborhood Crypto Watch (@BlakeH47189) January 28, 2025 Meanwhile, MEDIA isn’t the only token affected by a recent delisting, as Coinbase also suspended trading for Floki, GIGA, and Turbo a day earlier, specifically for New York State residents, all memecoins that saw massive gains following Donald Trump’s election win last year. These delistings come during a shaky time in the market. Trump’s new tariff policies against major trade partners have raised fears of a global trade war, leading to cautious investor behavior and shrinking liquidity across both crypto and traditional markets. What is Media Network? Launched in 2021, Media Network was a blockchain-based project that aimed to decentralize how online content is delivered. It lets users share their internet bandwidth in exchange for MEDIA tokens, creating an open, peer-to-peer system for content delivery. The project was reportedly backed by now-defunct Alameda Research , the crypto trading firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, according to crypto fundraising tracker platform ChainBroker. Alameda was the only listed investor and supported a $1 million public token sale on Raydium’s AcceleRaytor platform at $10 per token. All public sale tokens were unlocked at launch, while tokens for the team and advisors had an 18-month lockup with gradual release after that.

Overall crypto market capitalization fell 3.3% in the past 24 hours, with BTC sliding to nearly $83,500 from a high above $84,200 a day earlier. Ether (ETH) and Cardano’s ADA fell as much as 5% to lead losses among majors. The cryptocurrency market added 8% over 7 days, stabilising at the $2.7 trillion level since Saturday. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich says a move higher could bolster hopes for further gains, but these expectations will “only be confirmed after a solid consolidation above the 200-day moving average, which is now near $2.97 trillion.“ ""Bitcoin continues its cautious rise, trading above its 50-day moving average and reaching $85,700. This is an important technical attempt to reverse the downtrend. Interestingly, the 200-day average is quite close, so a second confirmation of a trend change could come quite quickly,” Kuptsikevich said, adding that bitcoin had entered a resistance accumulation zone where the “strength of the initial rebound may fade.” Solana’s SOL is showing strength in a downtrodden market, making it ripe for a move higher if overall conditions improve. “Solana is recovering faster than many of the major altcoins, trading at its 50-day moving average near $130. A consolidation above this level will open the way to $145, the area of previous peaks. A sustained move above them will signal a break of the downtrend and could lead to a move towards $180,” Kuptsikevich noted. On a more pessimistic approach, prominent market chartist Peter Brandt is not optimistic about bitcoin setting new highs in the current cycle. “A trendline violation does NOT signify a transition of trend BTC Sorry,” the trader noted said in an X post in response to sentiment for a bullish rebound. Trendlines are a subjective price-action analyst method and less dependable than moving averages or key levels. A break, used in tandem with technical analysis, could hint at a change in movement. Here’s what AI-driven market insights for some majors look like on Wednesday. Dogecoin Price Analysis as Whales Accumulate 800M DOGE Dogecoin whales have accumulated over 800 million DOGE in the last 48 hours, signaling potential confidence in the asset's short-term prospects, data shows . DOGE is currently trading at a critical juncture around $0.154-$0.155, with immediate resistance at $0.157 and crucial support at $0.153 that must hold to prevent further decline. DOGE experienced significant volatility, reaching a peak of $0.169 before entering a pronounced downtrend with lower highs and lower lows since April 14th. Support levels established around $0.155 have been repeatedly tested, with volume spikes coinciding with major price movements. The 48-hour Fibonacci retracement shows price currently hovering near the 0.618 level, suggesting potential consolidation before the next directional move. A sharp selloff occurred between 05:19-05:24, with price plummeting 1.1% in just five minutes on exceptionally high volume (15.3M in a single minute). The subsequent bounce formed a potential double bottom at $0.153, with price currently consolidating around $0.154. Volume analysis shows clear distribution before the drop and accumulation during the recovery attempt. Solana Shows Consolidation Recent price action shows SOL navigating volatility as geopolitical factors create market uncertainty. Solana (SOL) experiences significant price volatility, consolidating between $125-$132 after a 13.7% surge from $119.59 to $136.01. Solana leads decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, outpacing Ethereum for three consecutive days with $2.43 billion in trading activity. Recent trading shows SOL consolidating between $125-$132, with key support established at $125.25. Volume analysis reveals diminishing buying interest after the initial rally, suggesting market indecision. The 50-hour moving average at $129.80 now serves as a critical pivot point. Fibonacci retracement levels indicate potential support at $127.40 (38.2%) if current levels fail to hold. Cardano Sees 8% Bellyflop in Volatile Session ADA experienced significant volatility, surging from $0.618 to a peak of $0.667 (8.0% range) before undergoing a substantial correction. Recent trading shows ADA consolidating between $0.605-$0.615, with increased volume during downward movements suggesting continued bearish pressure. Trading data reveals increasing volume during downward price movements, suggesting persistent selling pressure despite oversold conditions on 48-hour momentum indicators. While some accumulation appears to be occurring at lower levels, potentially forming a base for recovery, ADA now faces significant overhead resistance from the 200-hour moving average. The 200-hour moving average now acts as overhead resistance, reinforcing the bearish trend. 48-hour momentum indicators reveal oversold conditions, potentially offering short-term relief.

The decline follows a tug-of-war in sentiment—on one end, growing institutional adoption; on the other, discreet sell-offs from a major government holder. Brazilian fintech firm Meliuz made headlines after confirming its intention to add Bitcoin to its corporate treasury strategy. The company already holds 45 BTC—worth around $4.1 million—and plans to expand its exposure using operating income and future partnerships. A shareholder vote on May 6 will determine whether BTC will officially become a long-term reserve asset. The announcement sent CASH3 shares soaring 14% on the day and up 27% over five days, sparking optimism across Latin America’s corporate crypto landscape.

Ripple CEO Sees Bitcoin at $200K, Offers XRP for SEC Settlement Meanwhile, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse boosted market confidence with a bold call: Bitcoin could hit $200,000 if regulatory reforms continue to unlock institutional interest. In an interview with Fox Business, Garlinghouse revealed Ripple may settle its SEC case using XRP, with a revised $50 million fine (down from $125 million), to be paid in Ripple’s native token. Ripple might pay the SEC in XRP itself. Let that sink in Brad Garlinghouse says the $125M set aside is now just $50M… and XRP could be the currency of the deal.

What You Need to Know: China holds ~194,000 BTC (second only to the U.S.) 15,000 BTC currently being offloaded Sales could apply short-term pressure to BTC price While this selling might cap near-term gains, it also reflects Bitcoin’s emerging role as a strategic reserve asset—even in highly regulated jurisdictions BTC/USD Technical View: Momentum Weakens Below $84K From a charting perspective, Bitcoin has broken below its ascending channel and the 50-period EMA at $84,020. Currently trading near $83,460, BTC is testing short-term support zones. RSI: 38.5 – bearish momentum building Key Support: $82,488 and $81,354 Immediate Resistance: $84,020 Trade Setup: Entry: Short below $83,300 (after confirmation) Target: $82,500 → $81,350 Stop Loss: $84,300 Pro Tip: Wait for a candle close below $83,300 with strong volume before entering. Premature shorts can get trapped in false breakdowns. Final Thoughts Bitcoin’s price action reflects a battle of opposing forces: bullish tailwinds from institutional adoption, and bearish headwinds from state-level sell-offs and regulatory uncertainty. With Ripple’s settlement strategy and Meliuz’s treasury move in play, the long-term trend remains constructive—but traders should stay cautious until the dust settles around $83K support.

Just as cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility and competitive spirit, the AI development landscape is becoming equally intense. OpenAI, the creator of groundbreaking AI models, has signaled a potential shift in its approach to AI safety standards . Are these changes a necessary adaptation to market pressures, or a risky compromise on crucial safeguards? Let’s dive into the details of OpenAI’s updated Preparedness Framework and what it means for the future of AI and potentially, by extension, the crypto space, which increasingly relies on and intersects with AI technologies. Why is OpenAI Adjusting its AI Safeguards Framework? OpenAI’s recent update to its Preparedness Framework reveals a significant consideration: the actions of its competitors. The core message is that if a rival AI lab releases a ‘high-risk’ AI model without adhering to comparable safety measures, OpenAI may ‘adjust’ its own requirements. This isn’t a decision they claim to take lightly, but it highlights the intense AI development competition that is driving the industry. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors at play: Competitive Pressure: The race to deploy advanced AI models is fierce. Companies are vying for market share and recognition, pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities at an unprecedented pace. Balancing Innovation and Safety: OpenAI is trying to navigate the delicate balance between rapid innovation and ensuring the responsible development and deployment of AI. The pressure to release cutting-edge models quickly can sometimes clash with thorough safety testing. Maintaining a ‘Protective’ Stance: Despite the potential adjustments, OpenAI insists that it will maintain AI safety standards at ‘a level more protective.’ They emphasize that any changes will be carefully considered and transparently communicated. Concerns and Criticisms Surrounding AI Safety Standards OpenAI’s announcement comes amidst existing criticisms regarding its commitment to safety. The company has faced accusations of: Lowering Safety Standards: Critics argue that OpenAI might be prioritizing faster releases over rigorous safety checks to stay ahead in the AI development competition . Compressed Timelines: Reports suggest that safety testing timelines for major model releases have been significantly shortened, raising concerns about the thoroughness of these evaluations. Testing on Older Models: Allegations have surfaced indicating that safety tests are sometimes conducted on earlier versions of models, rather than the final versions released to the public. Lack of Transparency: Concerns have been raised about the timeliness and detail in OpenAI’s safety testing reports, impacting transparency and accountability. While OpenAI disputes these claims and asserts its commitment to safety, the updated framework introduces a layer of complexity and raises questions about the future of AI preparedness framework in a highly competitive environment. Automated Evaluations: A Double-Edged Sword? To accelerate product development and keep pace with the rapid release cadence, OpenAI is increasingly relying on automated evaluations. While automation offers speed and efficiency, it also brings potential challenges: Advantages of Automated Evaluations Potential Disadvantages Speed and Scalability: Automated systems can process vast amounts of data and conduct evaluations much faster than human-led testing. Limited Nuance: Automated systems may struggle to detect subtle or complex safety issues that require human judgment and contextual understanding. Consistency: Automated evaluations can provide consistent and objective assessments, reducing variability associated with human testers. Over-reliance: Excessive reliance on automated systems could lead to neglecting crucial qualitative aspects of safety testing that humans are better equipped to assess. Cost-Effectiveness: Automation can reduce the costs associated with extensive human-led testing, making the process more economically viable. Bias in Design: If the automated evaluation systems are not designed and validated carefully, they could inadvertently introduce biases into the safety assessment process. OpenAI maintains that it hasn’t completely abandoned human-led testing, but the shift towards automation signifies a strategic adjustment in their AI preparedness framework . Categorizing Risk: ‘High Capability’ vs. ‘Critical Capability’ Another significant change in OpenAI’s framework is the refined categorization of AI models based on risk. They are now focusing on two key thresholds: ‘High Capability’: Models that can ‘amplify existing pathways to severe harm.’ These models require safeguards to minimize associated risks before deployment. ‘Critical Capability’: Models that ‘introduce unprecedented new pathways to severe harm.’ These systems necessitate safeguards to minimize risks even during development. This refined categorization reflects a more nuanced approach to risk assessment, acknowledging that different levels of AI capability pose distinct types of threats and require tailored AI safeguards . What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? The developments at OpenAI have broader implications beyond just the AI industry. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into various sectors, including cryptocurrency and blockchain, the approach to AI safety standards and high-risk AI models will be crucial. Here’s why this is relevant to the crypto world: AI-Driven Crypto Tools: AI is being used to develop sophisticated trading algorithms, security systems, and analytical tools within the crypto space. The safety and reliability of these AI systems are paramount. Smart Contracts and AI: The intersection of AI and smart contracts could lead to more complex and autonomous decentralized applications. Ensuring the safety and security of AI-integrated smart contracts is vital. Ethical Considerations: As AI’s influence grows in finance and technology, ethical considerations around bias, fairness, and transparency become increasingly important, both in AI and crypto development. Conclusion: Navigating the Complex Landscape of AI Safety OpenAI’s updated Preparedness Framework reflects the complex realities of developing advanced AI in a competitive landscape. The potential adjustments to AI safeguards , driven by external pressures and internal strategies like automated evaluations, highlight the ongoing tension between rapid innovation and responsible AI development. For the cryptocurrency community and the broader tech world, staying informed about these shifts in AI safety standards is crucial. The future of AI depends on a balanced approach that fosters innovation while prioritizing safety and ethical considerations. Only time will tell how these adjustments will play out and shape the trajectory of AI development and its integration with other transformative technologies.

Gold beats records as Bitcoin ETFs slump As the US trade war sees investors flee to gold, Bitcoin has lost the limelight as a hedge against macroeconomic volatility.

This is 2 TIMES more than the previous high set in the full year 2020,” Kobeissi noted. “Investors are pouring money into gold at a record pace as the market uncertainty has skyrocketed.

43400068,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149798,1744790744,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Trump Crypto Ventures Trigger Political Risk for US Regulations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-crypto-ventures-political-risk/,"Is the crypto world about to face a political storm? A recent warning from U.S. investment bank TD Cowen suggests that the foray of the Trump family into cryptocurrency ventures could stir up significant political risk , potentially throwing a wrench into the gears of much-needed U.S. cryptocurrency regulation . Let’s dive into what this means for the future of digital assets in America. Why is Political Risk Surging in the Crypto Space? TD Cowen’s alert shines a spotlight on the intersection of politics and crypto, specifically highlighting ventures linked to the Trump family. These ventures, notably including a planned stablecoin , are raising eyebrows and sparking concerns about potential political backlash. But why is this happening, and what are the specific worries? Political Backlash: The core concern is that associating crypto ventures with politically charged figures, like the Trump family, can inject partisan politics into the already complex regulatory landscape of digital assets. This could lead to increased scrutiny and opposition, not necessarily based on the merits of crypto itself, but on political affiliations. Stalling Crypto Legislation: Just as the U.S. seemed to be making headway in establishing clear cryptocurrency regulation , this new layer of political complexity could slow things down, or even halt progress altogether. Imagine lawmakers becoming more hesitant to support crypto-friendly legislation if it’s perceived as benefiting politically divisive figures. Specific Ventures Under Scrutiny: Reports, as highlighted by The Block, mention discussions between Trump-linked entities and major crypto players like Binance and World Liberty Financial. These connections, while not inherently problematic, amplify the political risk because they involve established industry giants operating within a politically charged environment. How Could Trump Crypto Ventures Impact Cryptocurrency Regulation? The timing of this political risk couldn’t be more delicate. The crypto industry has been eagerly awaiting clearer guidelines and a more defined regulatory framework in the U.S. Progress has been made, but TD Cowen suggests this could be jeopardized. Let’s break down the potential impacts: Potential Impact Description Delayed Legislation Political gridlock or increased opposition could push back timelines for passing comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation . Stricter Regulations Instead of balanced rules, political pressure might lead to overly strict or punitive regulations, hindering innovation. Focus Shift in AML Policy Concerns over money laundering (AML) could be amplified due to political sensitivities, leading to more stringent, potentially stifling AML policies for the crypto sector. Uncertainty and Volatility Increased political risk injects uncertainty into the market, potentially leading to price volatility and investor hesitancy. It’s a precarious situation. On one hand, regulatory clarity is crucial for the long-term health and growth of the crypto industry. On the other hand, politically charged ventures could inadvertently undermine these efforts. Stablecoin and Political Scrutiny: What’s the Connection? The mention of a Trump-linked stablecoin is particularly noteworthy. Stablecoins , cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value (often pegged to the US dollar), are already under intense regulatory scrutiny globally. Why does this matter in the context of political risk ? Regulatory Focus on Stablecoins: Regulators worldwide are actively examining stablecoins due to their potential systemic importance and risks related to reserves, issuance, and overall financial stability. Any stablecoin project, especially one with high-profile political connections, will likely face even greater scrutiny. Trust and Transparency: For a stablecoin to succeed, trust is paramount. Political controversy surrounding its backers could erode public trust and make adoption more challenging. Transparency regarding reserves and operations becomes even more critical in such scenarios. Amplified Political Attention: A Trump-linked stablecoin is bound to attract significant political attention, both positive and negative. This attention could either accelerate regulatory frameworks for stablecoins or lead to a more cautious, restrictive approach depending on the prevailing political winds. Navigating the Political Risks in Cryptocurrency: What Should Investors Know? So, what does all this mean for crypto investors and enthusiasts? Here are some actionable insights to consider as we navigate this evolving landscape of political risk and cryptocurrency regulation : Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on regulatory developments and political discussions surrounding crypto. News sources, industry publications, and regulatory body announcements are crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Political risk is just one factor influencing the crypto market. Diversification remains a sound strategy to mitigate risks from various sources. Understand Project Backing: Be aware of the entities and individuals behind crypto projects you invest in. Political affiliations and potential sensitivities can impact a project’s trajectory. Focus on Fundamentals: While political risk adds complexity, the fundamental value proposition of different cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies remains important. Assess projects based on their technology, use cases, and adoption potential. Prepare for Volatility: Increased political risk can contribute to market volatility. Be prepared for potential price swings and manage your risk tolerance accordingly. The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly significant. TD Cowen’s warning serves as a timely reminder that the path to mainstream crypto adoption isn’t just about technological advancements and market trends; it’s also deeply intertwined with the complex web of political dynamics and regulatory landscapes. The coming months could be pivotal in determining how Trump crypto ventures and the broader political risk landscape will shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-16 08:10:00

43400303,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149799,1744791349,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Victory for CyberKongz: SEC Investigation Ends, Paving Way for Web3 Gaming",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-closes-cyberkongz-investigation/,"In a landmark moment for the Web3 gaming space, CyberKongz , the popular Ethereum-based NFT project, has announced the successful closure of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation. The probe, which had cast a shadow of uncertainty over the project and the broader sector, concluded without any enforcement action. This development marks a significant win for CyberKongz and is being hailed as a beacon of hope for regulatory clarity in the burgeoning world of Web3 gaming and NFT projects. What Sparked the SEC Investigation into CyberKongz? The SEC’s scrutiny of CyberKongz primarily stemmed from concerns surrounding its BANANA token and a contract migration that occurred back in 2021. These actions placed CyberKongz under the regulatory microscope, prompting the agency to delve into whether these aspects of the project fell under securities laws. The situation intensified in December when CyberKongz received a Wells notice, a formal communication indicating that the SEC staff intended to recommend an enforcement action against the company. A Wells notice is a serious matter, acting as a precursor to potential legal battles and significant penalties. It essentially gives the recipient a chance to argue why enforcement action should not be taken. For CyberKongz, this notice triggered a period of intense uncertainty and required them to engage legal counsel and cooperate fully with the SEC’s inquiries. The fact that the investigation has now been closed without any action speaks volumes about CyberKongz’s compliance and the arguments they presented to the regulatory body. Relief and Jubilation: CyberKongz Reacts to SEC Closure Unsurprisingly, the CyberKongz team has expressed immense relief and satisfaction at the outcome. They view this conclusion as not only a personal victory but also a positive sign for the entire Web3 gaming ecosystem. In a statement released shortly after the announcement, the team highlighted that this development brings much-needed regulatory clarity to a space often plagued by ambiguity and uncertainty. This sentiment was echoed across the Web3 community, with many seeing it as a crucial step forward in legitimizing and fostering innovation in the sector. CyberKongz Joins Growing List of Cleared NFT Projects CyberKongz is not alone in experiencing SEC scrutiny and subsequently emerging unscathed. This positive outcome places them alongside other prominent NFT projects like Yuga Labs (the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club) and the leading NFT marketplace OpenSea , all of whom have recently navigated similar investigations and been cleared without enforcement action. This trend suggests a potential shift in the SEC’s approach, or perhaps a clearer understanding of the nuances within the NFT and NFT project space. Key Projects Navigating SEC Scrutiny: Project Type Outcome of SEC Investigation CyberKongz NFT Gaming Project Investigation Closed – No Action Yuga Labs NFT Collection & Metaverse Investigation Closed – No Action OpenSea NFT Marketplace Investigation Closed – No Action This pattern of investigations concluding without enforcement raises important questions. Is the SEC refining its approach to regulating digital assets? Are these projects demonstrating sufficient compliance to satisfy regulatory concerns? Or is this a signal that the initial wave of intense scrutiny is giving way to a more nuanced and practical regulatory landscape for the NFT project and Web3 industries? The Significance of Regulatory Clarity for Web3 Gaming The closure of the SEC investigation into CyberKongz is particularly meaningful for the Web3 gaming sector. Gaming, with its inherent digital nature and vibrant virtual economies, is seen as a prime use case for blockchain technology and NFTs. However, the regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets has been a significant impediment to growth and innovation in this area. Benefits of Regulatory Clarity for Web3 Gaming: Increased Investor Confidence: Clearer rules attract institutional and retail investors, injecting capital into Web3 gaming projects. Reduced Legal Risks: Developers can build and operate with greater certainty, minimizing the fear of unexpected regulatory action. Faster Innovation: Focus shifts from compliance concerns to creative development, accelerating the evolution of Web3 games. Mainstream Adoption: As the space becomes more regulated and secure, mainstream gamers are more likely to embrace Web3 gaming experiences. The CyberKongz case, along with the outcomes for Yuga Labs and OpenSea, could represent a turning point. It suggests that projects operating responsibly and engaging constructively with regulators can navigate the complex legal landscape and achieve positive outcomes. This is a crucial message for the entire Web3 space, encouraging proactive compliance and open dialogue with regulatory bodies. What’s Next for CyberKongz and Web3 Gaming? For CyberKongz, this SEC closure allows them to fully focus on their core mission: building and expanding their NFT gaming ecosystem. Freed from the shadow of the investigation, they can now confidently pursue their roadmap, innovate further, and continue to engage their community. For the broader Web3 gaming industry, this development offers a renewed sense of optimism and encourages continued development and investment. However, it’s crucial to remember that the regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. While this is a positive signal, it does not mean the Web3 space is entirely free from regulatory oversight. Projects must remain vigilant, prioritize compliance, and stay informed about ongoing regulatory developments. Engaging with legal experts and adopting best practices will be essential for navigating this dynamic environment and ensuring long-term success. A Powerful Signal for the Future of Web3 The SEC’s decision to close the CyberKongz investigation without enforcement action is more than just a win for one NFT project; it’s a potentially transformative moment for the entire Web3 ecosystem. It provides a tangible example of how projects can successfully navigate regulatory scrutiny and emerge stronger. This victory offers a powerful signal of hope and regulatory clarity , encouraging innovation and growth in the exciting and rapidly evolving world of Web3 gaming and beyond. The message is clear: responsible innovation and proactive compliance can pave the way for a thriving and sustainable future for decentralized technologies.

This scenario looks increasingly likely, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering near neutral at 48—suggesting that selling pressure has eased.

While this level may continue to provide short-term stability, a breakdown below it could initiate a sharp decline toward the $1K region. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart ETH’s strong bearish momentum has been temporarily paused at the critical $1.5K support zone, resulting in a phase of sideways consolidation with mild volatility. This area has historically acted as a major support and holds psychological significance for market participants. However, the recent formation of a death cross, where the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA, reinforces the prevailing bearish sentiment. If the $1.5K level fails to hold, Ethereum will likely experience a sharp decline, with the $1.1K zone being the next significant target. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, ETH continues to trade within a descending price channel, fluctuating between its upper and lower boundaries. The price recently bounced from the channel’s lower trendline, triggering a short-term bullish correction. Yet, Ethereum has now approached the upper boundary of the channel near the $1.7K level, facing mild rejection. With overall market activity remaining subdued, any resurgence in selling pressure could invalidate the correction and lead to a fresh downward movement, potentially breaching the $1.5K support and targeting the $1K level in the medium term. Onchain Analysis By Shayan The Binance liquidation heatmap offers valuable insights into potential price targets, as liquidity zones often serve as magnets for market movements. Ethereum’s recent consolidation phase has resulted in a significant cluster of liquidation levels just below the $1.5K support zone. These levels, tied to long-position liquidations, are particularly appealing targets for institutional sellers and bearish traders. Should renewed selling pressure drive the price into this liquidity pocket, a wave of long liquidations could be triggered, potentially amplifying the downward momentum and pushing ETH toward the $1K threshold.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit is reversing its April 15 airdrop of PAWS tokens and plans to redistribute them again after a flawed distribution left some users with extra tokens, others with none, and prompted widespread complaints. In a blog announcement on Wednesday, the exchange said that the PAWS project team “has provided a revised eligibility list, which includes previously omitted participants.” It’s unclear how many participants where omitted, though Bybit reminded that users based in the European Economic Area “remain ineligible” for this campaign “due to MiCA regulatory requirements.” You might also like: Telegram-linked TON eyeing U.S. expansion The move has left many users frustrated and confused. One user on X noted that Bybit “not getting things right lately,” urging the exchange to “restrategize.” Bybit has apologized to affected users, but it hasn’t clarified whether anyone will be compensated for the distribution issues. The exchange said the redistribution will be completed before the token’s official spot listing. PAWS is a Solana memecoin that initially started as a Telegram mini-app rewarding users with “PAWS points” for joining groups, following channels, and inviting friends. The project quickly jumped ship to Solana after Telegram spooked developers with new rules favoring the TON network and clamping down on similar projects, forcing them to look for a more open alternative.

The perpetual futures exchange will allow and trader with a non-sanctioned wallet to get access to fully-encrypted trading, as well as deep liquidity pools, advanced execution tools, and cross-chain trading. How does it achieve this level of encryption? The platform has decentralized its core operations, dividing them between a network of independent attestors. This guarantees that no single participant can control the trading environment. Regarding the launch of EnclaveX, Enclave Marketes Chief Executive Officer (CEO) David Wells stated: “The future of trading isn’t just on-chain – it’s encrypted, high-performance, and permissionless. We’re putting professional-grade execution in the hands of every trader while maintaining the exceptional performance that has made Enclave the platform of choice for serious traders.” The EnclaveX launch is a crucial step in the company’s roadmap EnclaveX allows traders to access cross-chain perpetual futures. However, the difference-maker is the fact that these futures can be traded using USD Coin ( USDC ) from multiple L1 and L2 blockchains, which currently include Avalanche ( AVAX ), Solana ( SOL ), and Ethereum ( ETH ) — all without the need for manual bridging. Moreover, the EnclaveX launch is just the latest step in a rather comprehensive (and ambitious) roadmap. The platform also has plans for community ownership, expanded on-chain operations, and a trader reward program. On top of that, the platform will introduce incentives for early adopters, including fee rebates, enhanced governance rights, and potential token distributions aligned with platform usage. In the coming weeks, Enclave Markets will mark another milestone by launching Alpha Strats, thereby providing retail traders with access to professional hedge fund strategies. The company intends to maintain its previous permissioned institutional offerings alongside EnclaveX.

Cryptocurrency wallets using the Chinese-made ESP32 chip, a widely used microcontroller designed for embedded systems and connected devices, are at risk, according to cybersecurity firm Crypto Deep Tech, which flagged a major vulnerability in a recent report . Often deployed in security-critical environments and used in hardware wallets like Blockstream Jade and open-source projects such as Bowser and Colibri, these chips often act as gateways to sensitive networks or store cryptographic credentials, making the vulnerability especially severe. According to researchers, attackers can exploit the chip’s Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity to inject malicious module updates, gain low-level access, and extract sensitive wallet data such as private keys. The chip suffers from multiple vulnerabilities, including a weak random number generator that makes Bitcoin private keys dangerously predictable, and broken validation checks that allow invalid or low-value keys to be used. You might also like: Chrome extension compromise puts crypto wallets at risk, analysts warn Electrum-based wallets are especially vulnerable, as the chip’s flawed hashing logic allows attackers to exploit non-BIP-137 message formatting and generate forged ECDSA signatures that validate as real Bitcoin transactions. What makes this vulnerability especially concerning for crypto users is its stealthy execution. In a real-world test case, Crypto Deep Tech researchers were able to exploit the vulnerability to bypass normal security checks, recover a private key, and gain access to a live Bitcoin wallet holding 10 BTC without alerting the user at any point. The risks aren’t limited to just cryptocurrency wallets. The vulnerability opens the door for large-scale supply chain attacks, state-level espionage, and coordinated theft campaigns targeting any network where ESP32-powered devices are in use. To mitigate the threat, researchers advised using trusted devices, keeping Bitcoin software up to date, and relying on secure cryptographic libraries to avoid risks like key theft and transaction forgery. Although considered a secure alternative to software wallets, which are often exploited , hardware wallet vulnerabilities remain a serious issue for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Last month, Ledger Donjon researchers found that wallet maker Trezor’s latest Safe models still rely on a general-purpose microcontroller that is vulnerable to physical attacks. Despite having a certified secure element for PIN and secret storage, the STM32-based chip used in Trezor devices could reportedly be exploited through voltage glitching, an attack that can be carried out purely in software and is nearly impossible to detect.

What does this mean for the future of AI development and the semiconductor landscape? Let’s dive into the details. Why the Sudden Halt on Nvidia H20 Exports? Semiconductor giant Nvidia, a key player in powering the AI revolution, is now facing unexpected headwinds. The US government has imposed a new license requirement for exporting its H20 AI chips to China. This isn’t a temporary measure; it’s an indefinite requirement, as revealed in Nvidia’s Tuesday filing. The reason? The US government is concerned about the “risk that the [H20] may be used in a supercomputer in China.” This development comes as a surprise to many, especially after reports last week suggested Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang might have navigated around potential restrictions. Did a dinner at Mar-a-Lago offer only a temporary reprieve? It seems the concerns about advanced AI chips ending up powering sophisticated Chinese systems have ultimately prevailed. The Financial Fallout: $5.5 Billion Hit for Nvidia The immediate financial impact on Nvidia is significant. The company anticipates a hefty $5.5 billion charge in its Q1 2026 fiscal year, ending April 27. Investors reacted swiftly, with Nvidia’s stock dropping around 6% in extended trading. This is a clear indicator of the market’s sensitivity to these US export controls and their potential long-term effects on Nvidia’s revenue streams from China. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key financial implications: Significant Financial Charge: $5.5 billion expected impact in Q1 2026. Stock Market Reaction: Approximately 6% drop in extended trading. Future Revenue Uncertainty: Potential long-term impact on Nvidia’s China business. H20: The Most Advanced Chip Now Under Scrutiny The H20 chip is particularly noteworthy because it represents the pinnacle of AI chip technology that Nvidia could previously export to China under existing regulations. It was already designed to comply with previous US export controls , making this new restriction even more impactful. This suggests a significant tightening of the regulatory environment surrounding advanced technology exports to China. Did Nvidia’s US Investment Pledge Fall Short? Adding another layer to this complex situation, Nvidia announced just on Monday a plan to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in manufacturing AI chips in the US over the next four years. This announcement followed reports of CEO Jensen Huang’s discussions and commitments at Mar-a-Lago. While seemingly a positive step, pundits quickly pointed out the lack of concrete details in Nvidia’s commitment. Was this pledge insufficient to allay US government concerns, or was the decision to impose US export controls already in motion? DeepSeek’s R1 Model and the Supercomputer Connection The article points to a critical link: multiple government officials raised concerns about the H20 chip being used to train models from DeepSeek, a China-based AI startup. DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model, which caused a stir in the US AI market in January, is specifically mentioned. This connection between the H20 chip, Chinese AI development, and the potential for supercomputer applications seems to be at the heart of the US government’s decision. To summarize the concerns: DeepSeek Connection: H20 chips allegedly used to train DeepSeek’s advanced AI models. R1 Model Impact: DeepSeek’s R1 model challenged the US AI market, raising concerns about Chinese AI capabilities. Supercomputer Risk: Fear that H20 chips could power Chinese supercomputers, enhancing their technological and potentially military capabilities. What’s Next for Nvidia and the AI Chip Landscape? Nvidia has declined to comment on these new US export controls . The industry is now watching closely to see how Nvidia will adapt to these restrictions and what long-term strategies they will employ. Will they need to further localize manufacturing? Will they develop modified chips specifically for the Chinese market that still comply with regulations? The future of AI chip exports and the global semiconductor industry is now even more uncertain. Key Takeaways on US Export Controls and Nvidia H20: Indefinite License Requirement: US government mandates licenses for Nvidia H20 AI chip exports to China indefinitely. Supercomputer Concerns: Risk of H20 chips being used in Chinese supercomputer development is the primary driver. Financial Impact: Nvidia anticipates a $5.5 billion charge and stock market reacted negatively. Geopolitical Implications: Escalating tensions in the tech race between the US and China. Industry Uncertainty: Raises questions about the future of global AI chip supply chains and international technology trade. This move by the US government is a significant escalation in the ongoing tech rivalry and underscores the strategic importance of AI chips in the global landscape. For the cryptocurrency and tech communities, this development highlights the interconnectedness of geopolitics, technology, and market dynamics.

However, if you’re a dedicated crypto trader trying to make a living by second-guessing the market, then you’ll likely be aware of how the losses from MEV and front-running can significantly add up over the long term. If that’s the case, Enclave Markets is offering what looks like a tantalizing solution with the debut of EnclaveX , said to be the first “Fully-Encrypted Exchange” platform that’s open to every crypto trader. EnclaveX is a permissionless and decentralized perpetuals exchange that offers many of the same advanced features found on popular platforms such as GMX, dYdX and HyperLiquid. The difference is it has none of the security downsides associated with those very public platforms. Whereas regular perpetuals DEX platforms use open orderbooks that anyone can view, and manipulate, EnclaveX ensures that all of its orders and transactions are obscured from view within a “secure enclave”, ensuring that no sneaky bots are able to jump the queue and pull off MEV and front-running attacks. It uses the same cryptographic security found on Apple iPhones, and it’s backed by a network of independent attestors, with each one running its own independent node to authenticate the platform’s code and hosting blockchain state. Through this, it provides the most secure trading environment possible, suitable for even the most demanding of institutional traders. EnclaveX also boasts of multi-chain credentials, enabling seamless cross-chain swaps without manual bridging. At launch, it supports USDC and other cryptocurrencies across Avalanche, Ethereum and Solana, with many more networks, including Layer-2s, set to be added in future. Its performance matches industry leaders in terms of its low-latency and deep liquidity, the company said. With the launch of EnclaveX, Enclave Markets is trying to bring the capabilities of its already-established, institutional-grade platform to every trader. “The future of trading isn't just on-chain, it's encrypted, high-performance, and permissionless,” said Enclave Markets Chief Executive David Wells. “We're putting professional-grade execution in the hands of every trader while maintaining the exceptional performance that has made Enclave the platform of choice for serious traders.” The company is planning to give traders access to more advanced trading tools through the imminent availability of “Alpha Strats”, or USDC trading vaults, which are expected to go live on the platform in the coming weeks. According to Enclave Markets, these vaults will be managed by partnering hedge funds and other “elite traders”, and provide a way for users to engage in more sophisticated trading strategies, hopefully making them more profitable, even during adverse market conditions. In essence, they will give every user the opportunity to utilize structured trades and algorithmic trading strategies, for a very small fee. Going forward, Enclave Markets plans to double down on its users with the launch of a comprehensive rewards program. It will introduce fee rebates and additional governance rights for regular users, and also talked about the possibility of a future token distribution as an incentive to grow adoption of its platform.

In a filing on April 14, Nvidia said it expects around $5.5 billion in charges for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 because of U.S. government rules limiting its AI chip sales to China. On April 9, officials told Nvidia it now needs special export licenses for its popular H20 chips and others with similar capabilities. The new restrictions target China, Hong Kong, and Macau, with the government warning that the chips could end up powering Chinese supercomputers. The H20 chip is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia is currently allowed to sell in China under the earlier rules. It’s reportedly been used by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek to train models, something that has raised concerns among U.S. lawmakers. Even though Nvidia said it plans to spend hundreds of millions over the next four years making some AI chips in the U.S. , that hasn’t stopped the stock from sliding after its latest filing and the expected hit to future revenues. NVDA dropped 6.3% in after-hours trading on April 15 to $105.10, and it’s down about 16.45% so far this year.

Other prominent tech stocks were also in the red, with Apple down 0.20% from the previous close to $202.14, Microsoft off 0.56% at $385.73, Alphabet sliding 1.71% to $156.31, and Amazon dropping 1.33% to $179.59. Adding to Nvidia’s troubles, a “death cross” has formed on the 1-day NVDA/USD chart, a bearish technical signal where its 50-day moving average drops below the 200-day one. The last time this happened was in April 2022, and Nvidia’s stock plunged nearly 50% in the following six months. Nvidia’s 1-day price chart has formed a death cross | Source: TradingView That’s got investors in AI crypto tokens on edge, as these tokens have often reacted to Nvidia-related news mostly due to the fact that Nvidia’s hardware plays a central role in powering the AI infrastructure that many of these projects rely on. For instance, in December, reports of China launching an antitrust probe into Nvidia caused the AI crypto token market cap to drop by over 14% in a single day. In the past, a surge in the Nvidia stock price has also resulted in bullish rallies for AI tokens. Following Nvidia’s latest filing, the total market cap of AI-related tokens has fallen 3.7% in the past 24 hours, now sitting at around $20.1 billion. Trading volume also declined, signaling weaker demand. Near Protocol ( NEAR ), the biggest AI crypto by market cap, slid 5.3% over the past day. Other major tokens like Internet Computer ( ICP ), Render ( RENDER ), Sei ( SEI ), Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ), and Akash Network ( AKT ) also lost between 5% and 12%.

43402269,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/tiktoks-secret-gems-the-6-best-meme-coins-only-the-experts-know,1744795705,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/43402269.jpeg,TikTok’s Secret Gems—the 6 Best Meme Coins Only the Experts Know,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/tiktoks-secret-gems-the-6-best-meme-coins-only-the-experts-know,"TikTok has become a hotspot for uncovering hidden low-cap cryptos, and the latest meme coin frenzy is no exception. While the spotlight tends to stay on the usual names, deeper dives are uncovering a new crop of meme coins quietly building momentum. With strong communities forming around them, these meme coins are becoming ones to watch. As they begin to bridge speculation with utility, they’re well placed to ride the momentum of the next market rally. TikTok’s six best meme coins Here are the six meme coins TikTok is buzzing about. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) : The future of meme coin trading on Bitcoin PepeX (PEPEX): A fairer meme coin launchpad with presale-driven community growth CartelFi (CARTFI): a meme coin platform built for yield-farming. Snek (SNEK): A community-driven meme coin thriving on viral social media engagement. Toshi (TOSHI): A meme coin with utility featuring NFTs, DeFi tools, and launchpads. Broccoli (BROCCOLI): A meme coin frenzy inspired by CZ’s dog, driven by speculation. Bitcoin Pepe: The future of meme coin trading on Bitcoin Bitcoin Pepe aims to redefine meme coin trading. It delivers a Solana-like experience on Bitcoin—combining Bitcoin’s security with high-speed, low-cost transactions. As a Layer 2, it creates a more scalable foundation for launching and trading meme coins. For years, Bitcoin maxis ignored meme coins, and meme coin traders steered clear of Bitcoin due to its slow speeds and high fees. Bitcoin Pepe is bridging this gap with the PEP-20 token standard, allowing anyone to launch and trade top meme coins on Bitcoin. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale has already raised $6.6m, blasting through 8 presale stages in record time. Starting at $0.021, the price has surged to $0.0295. BPEP offers early investors up to 300% potential gains before its Q2 2025 exchange listing. With a 5% price increase per stage, the demand is soaring. Moreover, Bitcoin Pepe is more than just a token—it’s an entire ecosystem. Plans are underway to launch a meme-focused decentralized exchange (DEX), cementing its status as one of the best meme coins to watch. As upcoming meme coins flood the market, Bitcoin Pepe is positioned as the go-to platform for meme coin trading on Bitcoin. PepeX.fun: A fairer model for meme coin launches emerges PepeX is trying something few have done well—making meme coin launches fair. It’s a direct response to the dominance of platforms like pump.fun, where insiders tend to win while most traders get left behind. PepeX tackles this with a capped 5% allocation for founders, anti-sniping protection, and complete transparency, which will be available through bubble mapping. What stands out, though, is the presale structure. With 30 stages and a 5% price jump every three days, early investors are incentivised without overhyping short-term gains. Just 45% of the total 5 billion supply is available in the presale, helping balance access and long-term value. The setup encourages smarter participation, not speculation. If the team executes as planned, PepeX could build the long-lasting community that meme coins have lacked. CartelFi: Turning Idle Meme Coins Into Earning Assets CartelFi (CARTFI) offers something many meme projects don’t: practical use. Instead of leaving tokens idle, the platform lets holders earn yield through DeFi farming—without selling. CartelFi’s liquidity pools center on top meme coins, with a presale structured across 30 ascending price stages—rewarding early participants with lower entry points. The total token supply is capped at 1 billion, with only 25% allocated to the presale. To support long-term value, the protocol burns 50% of all bought-back tokens, introducing a deflationary mechanism that could shift how tokenomics are approached in this space. Snek: The community-driven meme coin making waves Snek is one of the top meme coins in the market today. This meme coin blends humor, viral marketing, and community engagement to make a distinctive presence in the crypto market. By tapping into internet culture and interactive content, Snek has developed a loyal following that keeps growing. With its latest listing on Coins.ph, Snek is making waves in the meme coin space, further solidifying its growing market presence. Officially listed on 5th March, Snek continues to gain traction across major platforms, proving its strength in a highly competitive sector. Kraken has added Snek to its listing roadmap after its listing committee thoroughly reviewed it. The evaluation considered trading volume, market performance, and community strength, and Snek met all the criteria. While its future remains speculative, Snek’s strong community support makes it one of the meme coins to buy for those seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Toshi: The new meme coin with explosive growth potential Toshi has emerged as one of the best meme coins to watch, blending meme culture with real utility on the Base blockchain. First launched in September 2023, Toshi gained momentum in January 2024, fueled by rising institutional interest in Bitcoin. The most significant surge came after its Coinbase listing, pushing it to an all-time high of $0.0015. Unlike many new meme coins, Toshi offers real perks beyond hype. The meme coin’s NFTOSHIS 2.0 collection, available on Magic Eden, adds value to the ecosystem, while Toshi Tools provides a DeFi suite for developers. Additionally, Toshi Mart, a 1-click meme coin launchpad, simplifies trading by sending tokens directly to Uniswap. With its growing ecosystem, Toshi is shaping up as one of the best meme coins with long-term potential. Broccoli: The latest meme coin frenzy with massive gains The Broccoli meme coin craze exploded after Binance co-founder CZ revealed his dog’s name, sparking a wave of new meme coins across the market. Traders quickly jumped in, with one investor making an insane $27.8 million by acquiring and flipping Broccoli-themed tokens. Broccoli’s popularity comes from its direct link to CZ, which fuels social media buzz and speculative buying. As liquidity surges, it has positioned itself among the top meme coins, catching investors' attention. But like many crypto meme coins, Broccoli's future isn't defined. Broccoli has high risk-reward potential, but its long-term viability depends on whether the hype holds or stalls as market trends change. Why these meme coins could lead the next crypto surge Bitcoin Pepe’s record-breaking presale is capturing serious attention, but it’s not the only one shaking up the space. PepeX and CartelFi also prove that meme coins can offer much more than just laughs. Where Snek relies on hype, Toshi chases NFTs, and Broccoli rides fleeting trends, this trio brings real utility and smart design to the table. Bitcoin Pepe blends viral energy with BTC-first mechanics. PepeX fixes launch fairness with clean tokenomics and transparent presale structures. CartelFi adds real yield through DeFi tools, giving holders passive income potential. With early Bitcoin Pepe backers already eyeing 300% gains and 193% left before the presale closes, this trio is setting the pace for the next meme coin wave.

Speaking at an event in Milan, Giancarlo Giorgetti said that while trade tariffs dominate headlines, new US policies on dollar-backed stablecoins present an “even more dangerous” threat to European financial stability, according to a Reuters report. US stablecoins allow users to invest in a widely accepted method for cross-border payments without opening a US bank account, Giorgetti said. He warned that the growing appeal of US stablecoins to Europeans should not be underestimated. Giorgetti urged European Union lawmakers to take more steps to boost the euro’s position as an international currency. He added that the digital euro under development by the European Central Bank (ECB) will be essential to minimize the need for Europeans to resort to foreign solutions. US lawmakers advance stablecoin bills Presently, stablecoin regulation in the US remains fragmented. Instead of a unified framework, multiple agencies apply existing laws to regulate stablecoins. However, lawmakers are working to implement changes, with several pieces of stablecoin legislation progressing. On April 2, the US House Financial Services Committee passed the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act. The bill is now headed to the House floor for a full vote. The bill was introduced on Feb. 6 by Committee Chair French Hill and the Digital Assets Subcommittee Chair Bryan Steil. It would ensure that stablecoin issuers provide information on their businesses, including how their tokens are backed. In addition, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act establishes rules that require issuers to maintain reserves backed one-to-one, comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws, protect consumers and boost dollar dominance in the global economy. The GENIUS Act still requires approval by both chambers of Congress and a presidential signature before becoming law. Related: Stablecoins are the best way to ensure US dollar dominance — Web3 CEO ECB exec renews digital euro push Apart from Giorgetti, ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone also urged European lawmakers to intensify their efforts to combat dollar-backed stablecoin dominance in Europe. On April 8, Cipollone wrote an article expressing concerns about the growing popularity of US stablecoins. The official suggested launching a central bank digital currency to combat this threat to the euro. He said this would aid in preserving the monetary sovereignty of the eurozone.

Technical analysts show bullish signs through their predictions that momentum could result in a price increase of 100% for Ethereum. The decentralized finance token MUTM from Mutuum Finance has surged throughout its presale by raising $6.8 million as 8,300 investors joined the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sells at $0.025 in phase 4 as investors monitor Ethereum for potential high-grade returns due to its connection with the Ethereum ecosystem. The future performance of this token is linked to Ethereum’s market performance since a strong Ethereum market could drive explosive growth at the same rate as the cryptocurrency giant. Ethereum’s breakout potential Expert analysts show great interest in analyzing Ethereum’s price movement patterns. Market actors are watching how the asset maintains consistent trading above a descending trendline which has triggered historically strong price surges in the past. A technical jump toward $4,000 seems achievable now that the market momentum strengthens so $4,800 will not prove too distant. Extremely bullish momentum from such a price increase has the potential to increase investor values by two times within a weekly timeframe. The asset’s recent price descent to $1,400 level displayed variations in market confidence. System delays in Ethereum’s upgrades along with quick blockchain competitors have created conflicts for the network. The smart contract dominance of Ethereum maintains its essential role in the market. A present rise in Ethereum’s value could establish its recovering position which would elevate the market value of related tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) conducts its fourth presale stage during which investors acquire tokens at $0.025 each. The presales of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have resulted in the sale of 409 million tokens while generating $6.8 million which is now stored in their bank. Phase 5 will trigger an increase to $0.03 yet investors currently face the opportunity to lock in and gain returns instantly because the token presale presents phase 5 as $0.03 for immediate purchase. The identified exchange tokenomics will trigger a 140% value expansion starting from $0.06 price levels. Some analysts expect Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to reach $2.50 after launch which would deliver an ROI of 9,900%. The team strengthens credibility as they finish the Certik smart contract audit and plan to publish findings on social networks. The high demand for this project has caused phase 4 to disappear quickly. Innovative Lending Model Beyond presale hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers real utility. Through its lending platform users can take both borrowing and earning opportunities by providing loans that surpass their values to protect system stability. Depositors who hold mtTokens including mtETH watch their assets develop through interest which generates passive income. The platform’s revenue stream moves through a buy-and-distribute system that purchases MUTM tokens to distribute to stakeholders while boosting the market demand. A recently developed dashboard presents the list of top 50 holders who gain extra tokens because they did not sell their MUTM tokens. The elevated degree of visibility between investors and projects causes a competitive drive that requires immediate action. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out among Ethereum-based altcoins because its value directly derives from the concrete DeFi operational mechanics built into the platform. Final Countdown The upcoming 2x rally of Ethereum will transform the crypto market structure during 2025 while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands prepared to exploit this trend. The available phase 4 tokens at $0.025 will vanish rapidly which creates an urgent situation. The upcoming listing would offer a 140% profit opportunity and a predicted $2.50 price post-launch turns initial small investments into substantial life-transforming wealth. Ethereum’s breakout might be the spark, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s fundamentals fan the flames.

43402309,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=710891,1744795811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43402309.jpeg,We’re in the early stages of a crypto winter. Here are the signs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/were-in-the-early-stages-of-a-crypto-winter/,"Coinbase has said what everyone’s been scared to admit: the next crypto winter has probably already started, and the signs are everywhere, according to a report released by the company on Tuesday. The total crypto market cap without Bitcoin has dropped to $950 billion—that’s a nasty 41% drop from its December 2024 high of $1.6 trillion. It’s also 17% lower than where things stood a year ago. To be clear, this is below nearly the entire range of prices seen between August 2021 and April 2022. At the same time, there’s been a little uptick in venture capital activity during Q1 2025, but it’s still way down—50% to 60% lower than the insane highs of 2021–2022. Investors cut exposure as macro pressure builds Coinbase analysts say this bad run could last at least another 4 to 6 weeks, if not longer. According to their outlook, “the interplay of macro factors and risk sentiment still calls for short-term caution.” But they’re also trying to play the long game. Coinbase said, “Once the mood resets, it might do so fast.” They’re still betting on a stronger second half of 2025, though right now, most traders are sitting on their hands. Forget the idea that a 20% swing marks a bull or bear market. That rule barely works in stocks and makes even less sense in crypto, where 20% moves happen in a weekend. Case in point: when Bitcoin dropped 76% between November 2021 and November 2022 while the S&P 500 only fell 22% during the same window. That’s more than 3x the pain, yet both happened during the same overall macro hellscape, said Coinbase. Because crypto never sleeps, it reacts faster and harder to global shocks. Weekends and nights—when stock markets are closed—are when a lot of the drama happens. That makes crypto a punching bag for all global sentiment changes. One trigger and everything spirals. There’s no agreed-on definition of what actually makes a bear market. People throw out that 20% number, but it’s just tradition—not science. As Coinbase put it, it’s more like “you know it when you see it.” They studied the S&P 500 by looking at its one-year rolling highs and lows to find real changes. That method showed four bull markets and two bear markets in the last 10 years—not counting the new dip that began around late March and early April. But even that method missed two big panic moments: 2015, when China’s markets crashed, and 2018, when the Fed’s global trade uncertainty index spiked. Both caused deep investor fear but didn’t hit the 20% number. So clearly, it’s not about the percentage. Alternative indicators show the market damage is deeper To fix that, Coinbase says they’re using new tools risk-adjusted performance—basically how far returns move from the average, measured in standard deviations. From November 2021 to November 2022, Bitcoin dropped 1.4 standard deviations, which is dangerously close to the S&P 500’s 1.3 standard deviation decline. That shows how big the crash was, even if the raw numbers look different. Measuring by risk lets you compare across assets, but the downside is it’s very complicated. The z-score model gives fewer signals when markets are calm and doesn’t always catch fast changes. Their data says the most recent bull cycle ended in late February. Since then, the model has shown nothing but neutral, which means it’s late to react. The 200-day moving average (200DMA) might be better. It’s easier to use and smooths out short-term noise. When prices fall below their 200-day average, that’s usually a real trend change. It caught the big sell-offs in early 2020 (COVID), 2022-23 (Fed hiking), the 2018–19 crypto winter, and the mid-2021 crash caused by China’s mining ban. So, is this a new crypto winter? Coinbase’s Tuesday report said yes, and it’s just getting started. “The 200DMA model on bitcoin does suggest that the token’s recent steep decline qualifies this as a bear market cycle starting in late March. But the same exercise performed on the COIN50 index (which includes the top 50 tokens by market capitalization) shows the asset class as a whole has been unequivocally trading in bear market territory since the end of February,” said Coinbase.

43402455,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149807,1744796156,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Strategic Shift: Semler Scientific’s Bold $500M Corporate Bond for Bitcoin Investment,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/semler-scientific-bitcoin-corporate-bonds/,"In a surprising turn that blends the worlds of medical technology and digital assets, Nasdaq-listed Semler Scientific has just signaled a bold move into the cryptocurrency realm. The company, known for its innovative medical devices, has filed an S-3 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue a substantial $500 million in short-term corporate bonds. But here’s the kicker – a portion of these funds is earmarked for the purchase of none other than Bitcoin. Let’s dive into what this means and why a medical tech firm is venturing into the volatile yet potentially lucrative world of cryptocurrency. Semler Scientific’s Strategic Dive into Bitcoin: What’s the Plan? Semler Scientific, primarily focused on developing and marketing products for early detection and treatment of chronic diseases, is broadening its financial horizons. The S-3 filing indicates that the net proceeds from this bond issuance are intended for general corporate purposes. While that sounds broad, the filing explicitly mentions a key intention: acquiring Bitcoin . This isn’t just about diversifying assets; it’s a strategic allocation into a digital asset class that has captured the attention of institutional investors and corporations alike. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: S-3 Filing: Semler Scientific has filed an S-3 registration statement with the SEC. This form is typically used by companies that are already public and want to issue new securities. Bond Issuance: The company plans to issue $500 million in short-term corporate bonds. Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by companies to raise capital. Purpose: The funds are for general corporate operations, notably including the purchase of Bitcoin. Nasdaq Listed: Semler Scientific trades on the Nasdaq, indicating it’s a publicly traded company subject to regulatory scrutiny and reporting requirements. Why Corporate Bonds for Cryptocurrency Investment? Issuing corporate bonds to fund a Bitcoin purchase is an intriguing financial strategy. Why not use existing cash reserves or other financing methods? Here are a few potential reasons: Capital Efficiency: Bond issuance allows Semler Scientific to raise a significant amount of capital without depleting its current operating funds. This can be crucial for a growing medical technology company that needs to invest in research, development, and market expansion. Low Interest Rate Environment: With relatively low interest rates, issuing bonds can be an attractive way to raise capital at a manageable cost. The returns expected from a Bitcoin investment might outweigh the interest expenses on the bonds, especially if Bitcoin’s price appreciates. Diversification Strategy: Investing in Bitcoin can be seen as a diversification move, hedging against traditional economic uncertainties and potential inflation. For a company holding significant cash, allocating a portion to Bitcoin could be viewed as a prudent risk management strategy. Signaling Innovation: Embracing Bitcoin can also send a signal to the market that Semler Scientific is an innovative and forward-thinking company, potentially attracting investors who are interested in companies exploring new financial frontiers. However, it’s worth noting that using debt to invest in a volatile asset like Bitcoin also carries risks. If Bitcoin’s price were to decline significantly, Semler Scientific would still be obligated to repay the bonds, potentially creating financial pressure. Decoding the S-3 Filing: What Does it Mean for Semler Scientific and Investors? The S-3 filing is a simplified registration form for companies that meet certain requirements, primarily those already reporting to the SEC for at least 12 months and having a specified market capitalization. For Semler Scientific, filing an S-3 indicates a level of maturity and compliance. Here’s what’s important about an S-3 filing in this context: Aspect Description Streamlined Process S-3 allows for a quicker and less burdensome registration process compared to other forms, enabling Semler Scientific to move swiftly on its bond issuance plans. Shelf Registration Often used for shelf registrations, meaning the company can register securities now and sell them at a later date, providing flexibility in timing the bond issuance and subsequent Bitcoin purchase. Investor Confidence Using an S-3 form can instill investor confidence as it signals that Semler Scientific meets SEC requirements for established, compliant companies. Transparency The filing is publicly available, providing transparency into Semler Scientific’s intentions and financial strategies, allowing investors to make informed decisions. You can find the filing on the SEC’s EDGAR database. For investors, this filing is a crucial piece of information. It’s a clear signal of Semler Scientific’s intent to diversify into cryptocurrency investment , specifically Bitcoin. Investors should consider this development as part of their overall assessment of the company’s risk profile and growth strategy. The Broader Cryptocurrency Investment Trend: Are More Corporations Following Suit? Semler Scientific’s move is not entirely unprecedented. MicroStrategy, for instance, has famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, holding billions of dollars worth. Other companies have also dipped their toes into the cryptocurrency waters, though perhaps not as explicitly as Semler Scientific in this bond issuance. This raises the question: Is this the beginning of a broader trend? Several factors could be driving corporate interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often touted as a hedge against inflation, as its supply is capped at 21 million coins. In times of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, corporations might see Bitcoin as a store of value. Alternative Asset Class: Cryptocurrencies offer diversification beyond traditional assets like stocks and bonds. For companies looking to optimize treasury management, Bitcoin can represent a new avenue for potential returns. Growing Acceptance: As regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies become clearer and institutional adoption increases, the perceived risk of holding Bitcoin may be diminishing for some corporations. Technological Innovation: Some companies might see investing in Bitcoin as aligning with broader technological trends and demonstrating an understanding of emerging digital finance. However, the path is not without challenges. Cryptocurrency investment comes with significant volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and operational complexities in terms of custody and security. Companies considering this route need to carefully weigh the potential benefits against these risks. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors and Industry Watchers Consider? For investors and industry observers, Semler Scientific’s move into Bitcoin offers several key takeaways: Monitor Semler Scientific’s Performance: Keep an eye on Semler Scientific’s financial reports and stock performance to see how this Bitcoin investment strategy unfolds. Does it enhance shareholder value or introduce new risks? Track Bitcoin’s Impact: Observe how Bitcoin’s price movements correlate with Semler Scientific’s announcements and actions. Does their entry into Bitcoin have any noticeable impact on Bitcoin’s market dynamics? Industry Trend Watch: Look for signals of other companies, especially in non-financial sectors, considering similar Bitcoin or cryptocurrency investments. Is Semler Scientific an early adopter or part of a growing wave? Risk Assessment: For companies considering cryptocurrency investments, Semler Scientific’s case serves as a real-world example to study. Analyze the potential risks and rewards, and develop a robust risk management framework. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Corporate Treasuries? Semler Scientific’s decision to issue $500 million in corporate bonds, with the explicit intention to purchase Bitcoin, marks a significant moment. It’s a bold step that blurs the lines between traditional corporate finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Whether this move proves to be a masterstroke or a cautionary tale remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly adds an exciting new dimension to the narrative of corporate Bitcoin adoption. As more companies explore the possibilities of cryptocurrency in their treasury strategies, Semler Scientific’s journey will be closely watched as a potential blueprint or a valuable lesson.

The latest incineration has removed over 1.57 million tokens, sparking interest in BNB’s potential reaction. Token burns introduce scarcity to boost the asset’s demand. BNB Chain’s auto-burn mechanism The protocol introduced a distinct deflationary model to manage Binance Coin supply. Unlike manual burns, the automatic approach runs independently, using BNB’s average price and the number of produced blocks in a quarter. The approach guarantees predictability and transparency, matching the burns with network usage and market activity. The platform destroys more assets upon surged activity and transaction volume, aiming to reduce Binance Coin’s supply from 200 million to 100 million. Notably, the quarterly burn differs from the fee-burning mechanism that the Chain introduced via the BEP-95 update, which burns gas fees in real-time to enhance the asset’s deflationary.

BNB price outlook Binance’s native token trades at $577 after gaining nearly 4% in the past week. Chart by Coinmarketcap It has lost 2% over the past day as Bitcoin remained stuck below $85K . BNB’s current performance reflects the prevailing bear dominance in the crypto market.

Reduced asset supply boosts scarcity, an essential component for influencing supply and demand. Thus, BNB Chain’s token burns position Binance Coin for impressive price movements in the upcoming times. Proponents trust that BNB’s current price is a bargain. Dip buyers expect the altcoin to soar to $1,000, translating to an over 70% surge from current prices.

""A new era has begun!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/minister-mehmet-simsek-issues-a-strong-warning-to-cryptocurrency-exchanges-a-new-era-has-begun/,"As is the case all over the world, regulatory efforts regarding cryptocurrencies continue in Türkiye. While much progress has been made in crypto regulations at this point, Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek issued warnings to cryptocurrency service providers and payment institutions. Speaking to AA, Mehmet Şimşek evaluated the work MASAK has carried out for crypto money service providers and payment institutions. Şimşek warned cryptocurrency service providers and payment institutions, stating that new strict rules introduced within the scope of increasing the security of the financial system and combating criminal proceeds must be followed. Referring to the regulations published in the Official Gazette on December 25, 2024 by MASAK to protect the financial system and combat crime revenues more effectively, Şimşek reminded crypto platforms and financial institutions of his previous warnings that they should not mediate the transfer of citizens' personal and financial information to illegal betting sites. At this point, Minister Şimşek warned cryptocurrency platforms and organizations to comply with the strict regulations introduced with the legislative changes, stating that they will be closely monitoring and drawing attention to the fact that those who do not comply will face severe sanctions: “We are taking decisive steps to bring our country's financial system into line with international standards. At this point, we will not allow those who want to abuse our financial system to open their eyes. “Crypto asset service providers are now required to fulfill their responsibilities as part of the financial system. Within the scope of the new regulations, crypto asset service providers are also included among the financial institutions subject to the same obligations as banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies in terms of MASAK legislation.” Stablecoin Regulation On The Way! Şimşek also stated that MASAK will make the necessary regulations in the field of stablecoins in a short time and underlined that cryptocurrency transfers that do not meet the obligations will not be allowed. Şimşek said, “Cryptocurrency service providers need to prepare a compliance program and appoint a compliance officer. It is important for them to create risk management and customer transaction monitoring mechanisms, register with the electronic notification system, and implement detailed customer identification measures. These institutions are required to fulfill important obligations such as making the first financial transactions through the bank. In cryptocurrency transfers, it has become mandatory to obtain detailed information in the transfer process, known as the travel rule in the international literature. If there is a deficiency in this information, transfer transactions will not be allowed.” *This is not investment advice.

43403316,https://invezz.com/?p=2674612,1744796453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Crypto price prediction: Pi Coin, Bitcoin, PepeX",https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/16/crypto-price-prediction-pi-coin-bitcoin-pepex/,"After US President Donald Trump’s tariff-induced market plunge, the crypto market, including Bitcoin (BTC), Pi Network’s Pi Coin, and the presale-stage PepeX (PEPX), is experiencing a rebound after tariffs pause, with investors eyeing potential gains as the market stabilizes. Trump’s pause on tariffs has alleviated pressure on digital assets, sparking renewed optimism across financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. This shift, combined with strong economic signals, has set the stage for a potential crypto boom, and Bitcoin, Pi Coin, and PepeX are poised to capitalise on this momentum, each representing a unique segment of the market. Bitcoin price prediction: breaking through resistance As the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate the market, with its price movements often setting the tone for the entire crypto ecosystem. With a market capitalisation exceeding $1.6 trillion, Bitcoin remains the largest cryptocurrency by far, attracting both retail and institutional investors. Trump’s decision to pause tariffs has provided a much-needed respite for the crypto market, which had been reeling from trade policy uncertainty. This policy shift, coupled with strong earnings reports from major banks, has bolstered investor confidence, potentially setting the stage for BTC to break through its current resistance at $85,000. Bitcoin has on several occasions been rejected at the $85,021 resistance level, which coincides with its 200-day EMA, a key indicator for long-term trend direction. Bitcoin price chart by TradingView Failure to break above this level could lead to a retest of the $78,258 support, while a successful breakout might propel BTC towards $90,000 and potentially $95,000. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently hovering around 50, it indicates a lack of clear momentum, though recent whale activity and positive macroeconomic factors could tip the scales in favour of the bulls. In addition, institutional investors like Metaplanet and Strategy have been accumulating Bitcoin, signalling their belief in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Pi Coin’s price outlook: navigating volatility Pi Network, with its innovative mobile mining approach, has garnered a significant following, but its token, Pi Coin, has faced challenges in maintaining its value. Currently trading at $0.667, Pi Coin has experienced significant volatility , dropping 52% over the past month, with concerns about its tokenomics weighing on investor sentiment. With a total supply of 100 billion tokens and only 6.87 billion currently in circulation, Pi Coin faces significant inflationary pressures as more tokens are released. However, the project’s focus on mobile mining and its growing user base could provide a counterbalance, especially if the team implements measures to control supply. The project’s transition to mainnet and the ability for users to sell their mined tokens have contributed to selling pressure, but the unique mobile mining concept continues to attract interest. Parody accounts and influencers have played a role in Pi Coin’s price movements, highlighting the importance of community sentiment in the crypto space. While Pi Network recently broke from a month-long falling wedge, the bullish momentum seems to be diminishing, with the token headed for the support at $0.5. However, the RSI indicator has been on a freefall and it is currently at 31.71, just above the oversold region, hinting ata possible bounce back. Pi Coin price chart by TradingView A hold above the $0.6 support could pave the way for a gradual recovery in case of a bounce back, while a break below might lead to further declines towards $0.5. PepeX’s market potential: innovation meets opportunity As Bitcoin rebounds and Pi Coin struggles to gain a footing, PepeX, a newcomer to the crypto scene, is generating buzz with its AI-powered memecoin launchpad, promising to democratize access to early-stage investments. PepeX is currently in its presale stage, and it has already raised over $1.389 million, showing a strong demand from crypto enthusiasts eager to invest in the revolutionary platform before it launches. With a total supply of 5 billion tokens and 45% allocated for the presale, PepeX is positioning itself as a decentralised alternative to traditional venture capital. Besides the presale investment opportunity, PepeX aims to revolutionise the crypto launchpad space with its AI-powered platform, offering instant tokenisation and fairness mechanisms. Notably, contrary to other launchpad platforms that leave marketing to the founders/developers, PepeX’s AKIRA AI Growth Engine will automate marketing and community management, leveraging AI to drive engagement and growth for newly launched tokens. In addition, the platform’s anti-sniping technology and transparent bubble maps will be responsible for preventing insider manipulation, addressing a common pain point in the crypto industry. Looking ahead, the project’s roadmap includes developing smart contract infrastructure, AI marketing agents, and partnerships with decentralised exchanges, which could drive adoption and value appreciation. As the team prepares for the official launch of PepeX.fun launchpad, those participating in the presale can expect the value of the PEPX token to rise astronomically through the remaining presale stages, with the final stage offering a 311.5% return compared to the initial price. Bitcoin, Pi Network, and PepeX: which is the best buy? With the crypto market rebounding from the US tariffs-induced plunge, Bitcoin, Pi Coin, and PepeX each present unique opportunities and challenges for investors looking to capitalise on the next wave of digital asset growth. Notably, the three coins exemplify the diversity of the cryptocurrency market, each catering to different investor profiles and risk appetites. While Bitcoin (BTC) offers relative stability and institutional backing, Pi Coin appeals to those seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities, and PepeX targets investors looking for cutting-edge technology and early-stage access.

The company even plans on raising $500 million for corporate purposes including more Bitcoin purchases. Meanwhile, Brazilian fintech firm Meliuz proposed making Bitcoin its primary treasury asset, sparking a 27% surge in its stock price. Despite these moves into crypto, tech stocks took a hit. Nvidia and AMD shares fell sharply after Nvidia revealed it expects $5.5 billion in charges due to new US export restrictions on its AI chips to China. Bitcoin Slump Hits Semler Scientific Healthcare technology company Semler Scientific recently revealed big paper losses on its Bitcoin holdings during the first quarter of 2025 due to the broader cryptocurrency market correction. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 15, the firm reported an unrealized loss of approximately $41.8 million from changes in the fair value of its Bitcoin holdings since the end of December. As of March 31, Semler held 3,182 BTC valued at around $263.5 million, with the price of Bitcoin dropping 12% from $93,500 at the start of the year to $82,350 by the end of the quarter. The full correction extended further into April as well, with Bitcoin falling more than 30% from its all-time high to under $75,000. At press time, BTC was trading hands at $83,606 after its price fell by just over 2% over the past 24 hours of trading. Despite the losses, Semler is still committed to its Bitcoin investment strategy. CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian previously talked about the company's focus on acquiring and holding Bitcoin while continuing to support innovation in healthcare. Semler ranks as the twelfth largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, which places it ahead of firms like Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive International, according to data from Bitbo . Largest corporate holders of Bitcoin (Source: Bitbo ) Financially, Semler reported expected revenues of between $8.8 million and $8.9 million and operating losses of $1.3 million to $1.5 million for the first quarter. It also disclosed holding approximately $10 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the company revealed it reached an agreement in principle to pay nearly $30 million to settle claims tied to a Department of Justice civil investigation. In a separate SEC filing on the same day, Semler outlined plans to raise up to $500 million through the sale of securities. The company plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including more Bitcoin purchases. The firm also pointed out that its stock , which trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker SMLR, has experienced high volatility and declined 36% since the beginning of the year. Semler Scientific YTD stock price (Source: Google Finance ) Meliuz Makes Bitcoin Its Strategic Asset Despite the big losses suffered by companies like Semler Scientific, many companies are still interested in adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Brazilian fintech company Meliuz proposed a plan to expand its Bitcoin holdings and designate the cryptocurrency as a strategic asset in its treasury. The company is known for its cashback and financial technology services, and outlined the initiative in an April 14 statement . There is also a shareholder meeting scheduled for May 6 to vote on the proposal. While Meliuz explained that its core business operations will remain unchanged, it pointed out that cash generation from its business activities is crucial to supporting ongoing Bitcoin acquisitions. If approved, Bitcoin will become the firm’s primary treasury asset, with Meliuz also exploring additional ways to generate Bitcoin for shareholders through operational income and strategic initiatives. To accommodate investors, the company allowed shareholders who held their stock before April 14 and who oppose the new direction to request reimbursement. However, the market responded positively to the news, and Meliuz shares (CASH3) jumped by over 14% in the trading session after the announcement was made. Over the last five days, the company’s stock surged more than 27%. Meliuz stock price over the past 5 days (Source: Google Finance ) Meliuz made its first Bitcoin purchase in March of 2025 when it bought 45 BTC for approximately $4.1 million after its board authorized using up to 10% of company cash for the asset. This move placed Meliuz among a growing number of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. According to crypto investment firm Bitwise, publicly traded firms collectively increased their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% in the first quarter of the year after purchasing roughly 95,431 BTC and raising the total corporate holdings to about 688,000 Bitcoin. Meliuz was one of 12 new entrants to adopt Bitcoin during this period. Meanwhile, Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor and his firm Strategy are still boosting their position in the cryptocurrency market. On April 14, the company added 3,459 BTC to its treasury in a transaction worth $285.5 million. Nvidia and AMD Stocks Slide on AI Chip Restrictions While crypto is boosting the stock prices of some companies, chipmaking leaders Nvidia and AMD experienced sharp declines in after-hours trading after a disclosure by Nvidia that US export restrictions on artificial intelligence chips to China will have a huge financial impact. In a regulatory filing that was submitted on April 15, Nvidia revealed that it expects to incur charges of up to $5.5 billion in its upcoming first-quarter report, which ends April 27. These charges are related to inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves for its H20 AI chips and other components with comparable bandwidth capabilities, which are now subject to new export license requirements. The US government notified Nvidia on April 9 that licenses will be needed for the export of H20 chips and similar products to China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Authorities are concerned that such chips could be diverted for use in Chinese supercomputers. The H20 is currently the most advanced AI chip Nvidia is permitted to sell to China under earlier restrictions. The new controls come due to scrutiny over the use of these chips by Chinese firms like AI startup DeepSeek. Despite a brief pause in the restrictions earlier this month after a meeting between President Donald Trump and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the renewed enforcement triggered concerns among investors. Nvidia responded by announcing plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to manufacture some AI chips in the United States over the next four years. Still, the market reaction has been quite negative. Nvidia share price YTD (Source: Google Finance ) Nvidia shares dropped 6% to $105 in after-hours trading on April 15, bringing its year-to-date loss to 16%. The decline also reflects the broader market worries amid an escalating trade conflict that was fueled by Trump’s aggressive stance on tariffs. AMD, Nvidia’s main competitor, also felt the pressure, with its stock falling over 7% to $88.55 after hours. The company’s shares declined by more than 25% since the start of the year.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-16 09:42:35

With $113 million in AUM and a 0.50% expense ratio, BKCH is competitive with similar products offered by Fidelity and VanEck. BKCH has a high turnover ratio and a 37% allocation to the top 3 stocks in the fund. In my view, the fund's holdings need tweaking. BKCH has a high reliance on Bitcoin mining stocks, and crypto pure plays like Exodus Movement and Coincheck aren't in the fund at all. The Global X Blockchain ETF ( BKCH ) is an actively managed fund that offers investors exposure to companies that stand to benefit from blockchain technology innovation. Some of the ways the fund builds that exposure is through publicly listed equities that touch blockchain technology either through digital asset transactions, cryptocurrency mining, mining hardware, or integration with blockchain networks. In my initial coverage of BKCH, we'll look at fund details compared to peers, holdings, and whether I personally think the ticker is one to consider for investment. BKCH Details There are really only a handful of ETFs that I have come across that have attempted to build a 'blockchain' fund as a theme. While this isn't an exhaustive list, I see the closest natural peers for BKCH as the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF ( FDIG ), the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ), and the iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF ( IBLC ). The latter of which is the smallest at just $27.3 million in AUM. Blockchain ETFs BKCH FDIG DAPP IBLC Issuer Global X Funds Fidelity Investments VanEck iShares Inception 07/12/2021 04/19/2022 04/12/2021 04/25/2022 Expense Ratio 0.50% 0.40% 0.51% 0.47% AUM $113,160,512 $132,467,749 $133,702,510 $27,296,737 Source: Seeking Alpha, AUM as of 4/15/25 Fee-wise, the funds are all very close though FDIG is cheapest. But at 50 basis points, I don't think BKCH is terribly overpriced for an actively managed fund. However, the fund is very concentrated in top stocks and only has about two dozen positions. Blockchain ETFs BKCH FDIG DAPP IBLC Number of Holdings 25 53 22 48 Assets in Top 10 74.8% 68.5% 62.9% 66.4% Turnover 56.4% 53.0% 57.0% 81.0% Source: Seeking Alpha, as of 4/15/25 The Global X Blockchain ETF has a similar turnover ratio to FDIG and DAPP at a little over 56% and has less holdings than FDIG at just 25. Perhaps the biggest thing that separates BKCH from the rest of the pack is the concentration in the fund's top 10 holdings. At just under 75% of assets in the top 10 holdings, this is a fund that I'd call reliant on its top stocks. ETF Grades BKCH FDIG DAPP IBLC Momentum F D- F F Expenses C+ B- C+ C+ Dividends A- F D- C+ Risk F F F F Liquidity C C+ B F Source: Seeking Alpha, as of 4/15/25 One thing that is interesting is the fund gets an 'A+' Dividend grade from Seeking Alpha while the other funds are well below that. At 11.5%, BKCH has a very high trailing twelve month yield. The TTM yield on DAPP is 6.3% and IBLC paid out 2.2% over the last year. Performance vs The Peer Group Data by YCharts Since three of these funds are actively paying dividends, it's important to look at the performance of the funds through the total return rather than just the share price performance. From a total return standpoint, these ETFs have all had generally awful starts to 2025: Data by YCharts At a 34% negative total return, BKCH is closer to the worst performer of the peer group shown above. The 1-year performance is also quite poor with BKCH standing out as the clear laggard of the group: Data by YCharts With all of these funds generally sharing similar themes and 12 month trends, it ultimately comes down to where the major allocations are to discern what might explain the underperformance of BKCH relative to the other funds. Holdings Breakdown Before we get into the deeper BKCH breakdown, I wanted to look at the top 3 assets for each fund as well as the allocation to those top three positions. For ease of reading the table, I'm keeping it to just the tickers. The unique stocks that make it into these top 3 positions are the following: Coinbase Global ( COIN ) MARA Holdings ( MARA ) Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) CleanSpark ( CLSK ) Strategy ( MSTR ) Block, Inc ( XYZ ) Unsurprisingly, there are a lot crypto-focused companies and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining stocks. Three of the funds have top equity exposure to Coinbase: Top 3 Stocks BKCH FDIG DAPP IBLC 1st COIN COIN MSTR COIN 2nd MARA MARA COIN MARA 3rd RIOT CLSK XYZ RIOT Top 3 Weighting 37.0% 25.0% 25.4% 30.8% Source: Seeking Alpha, as of 4/15/25 I should note that this table puts COIN as FDIG's top position, but FDIG actually has 23.8% of AUM in the income-based Fidelity Securities Lending Cash Central Fund. Which could possibly disqualify that fund from consideration entirely since it might not make sense to pay Fidelity 40 basis points to put a quarter of the fund's assets in T-bills. The flip side of that coin is perhaps FDIG is better insulated from drawdowns - and we can certainly see that reflected in FDIG's relative outperformance year to date. Here's the full asset breakdown for BKCH specifically: BKCH Holdings 4/14/25 (Global X ) 57.4% of the fund is allocated to Bitcoin mining stocks. To me, that seems like a large allocation. For an actively managed fund, I think there can/should be more discernment regarding what is included in a 'blockchain' ETF. In my opinion, there are some fairly notable omissions from this fund that I would think would fit with the overall thesis of businesses using blockchain. Some examples of publicly traded companies that I'm surprised didn't make it in the fund would be Exodus Movement, Inc. (NYSE: EXOD ), Fold Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: FLD ), and Coincheck Group N.V. (NASDAQ: CNCK ). Furthermore, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) mining with GPUs produced by NVIDIA ( NVDA ) ended over 2.5 years ago. That BKCH has almost as much exposure to NVDA as it does to a company like Bit Digital ( BTBT ) seems off base for a 'blockchain' fund. Closing Thoughts I think investors who want exposure to 'blockchain' as an idea can probably do better picking their own stocks. Beyond direct buys of Coinbase, MARA Holdings, and maybe Galaxy Digital ( GLXY:CA )( OTCPK:BRPHF ), there are a lot of companies in this fund that investors can likely pass on if they want to play the 'blockchain' ponies. Even something like EXOD, which I'm not actually bullish, makes more thematic sense than some of the other companies included in BKCH. At the end of the day, it's a fund with a lot of capital allocated to a handful of crypto-adjacent stocks and a high reliance on a mining sector that faces long term economic challenges. For me, BKCH is a 'hold.'",FDIG|DAPP|IBLC|BKCH,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-16 09:45:19

In a preliminary filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dated April 15, the company reported an unrealized loss of approximately $41.8 million on its Bitcoin holdings for the first quarter of 2025 . Bitcoin Strategy Leads to Major Paper Losses As of March 31, Semler held 3,182 BTC, which it valued at roughly $263.5 million. The price of Bitcoin dropped by 12% over the quarter —from around $93,500 at the start of January to $82,350 at the end of March. And by April 7, the correction had deepened, pushing BTC briefly below $75,000—a 32% drop from its peak. Despite these market setbacks, the company remains committed to Bitcoin. CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian reiterated in a previous statement that Semler is “laser-focused” on accumulating BTC while continuing to grow its healthcare business. That conviction appears unshaken, even as the firm posted expected Q1 revenues of just $8.8 to $8.9 million and operational losses in the range of $1.3 to $1.5 million. At the end of the quarter, Semler held only about $10 million in cash reserves. $500M Securities Offering to Fund Further BTC Buys Alongside its Q1 report, Semler also disclosed plans for a substantial capital raise. According to a second SEC filing on the same day, the company is preparing to offer and sell up to $500 million in securities. While the proceeds are officially designated for “general corporate purposes,” Semler made it clear that a significant portion will go toward further Bitcoin acquisitions . This bold financial move arrives as the company’s stock, trading under the ticker SMLR on Nasdaq, has tumbled 36% since the beginning of the year. Still, Semler appears to be betting that Bitcoin will eventually deliver long-term returns, even as short-term volatility hits both its digital assets and equity. Meanwhile, Semler also announced it had reached a tentative $30 million settlement in a Department of Justice civil probe—another financial hurdle that adds context to its ambitious crypto strategy.

WLFI, for those not in the know, is the ambitious crypto project backed by none other than the Trump family. This move is generating significant waves, especially considering Saqib’s influential position and the potential global implications. Let’s dive into what this groundbreaking alliance means for the future of crypto, particularly in terms of crypto adoption and crypto regulation . Who is Bilal Bin Saqib, the CEO of Pakistan Crypto Council? Bilal Bin Saqib isn’t just another name in the crypto space; he’s a recognized leader making significant strides in Pakistan’s burgeoning digital economy. As the CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council , he’s been at the forefront of advocating for responsible crypto policies and fostering innovation within the nation. His accolades speak volumes: Forbes 30 Under 30 Honoree (2020): This prestigious recognition highlights his early impact and leadership in the business world. Influential Voice: Saqib has consistently voiced informed opinions on the global stage, as evidenced by his recent Bloomberg interview where he discussed Trump’s crypto stance. Champion of Crypto in Pakistan: He’s been instrumental in shaping conversations around crypto adoption and navigating the complex landscape of crypto regulation in Pakistan. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and the Trump Connection: What’s the Buzz? World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is rapidly gaining attention due to its high-profile backing and ambitious goals. Here’s a snapshot of what makes WLFI noteworthy: Trump Family Backing: The project is spearheaded by figures closely associated with the Trump family, instantly bringing it into the global spotlight. Vision for Financial Freedom: WLFI aims to create a crypto ecosystem that champions financial freedom and innovation, resonating with a global audience seeking alternatives in the traditional financial system. Capitalizing on Trump’s Crypto-Friendly Stance: With Donald Trump increasingly vocal about his positive view on cryptocurrencies, WLFI is strategically positioned to benefit from this evolving political landscape. Trump’s evolving stance on crypto is particularly noteworthy. Once perceived as skeptical, his recent statements indicate a warming attitude, potentially signaling a significant shift in US policy and influencing global crypto regulation trends. Why is the Saqib-WLFI Alliance a Game Changer for Crypto Adoption? The collaboration between Bilal Bin Saqib and World Liberty Financial is more than just a partnership; it’s a strategic alignment that could significantly accelerate crypto adoption on a global scale. Here’s why: Geopolitical Bridge: Saqib’s leadership in the Pakistan Crypto Council brings a crucial perspective from a key emerging market. This bridge between established and developing crypto ecosystems is invaluable. Policy Influence: Saqib’s statement about Pakistan potentially aligning its policies with Trump’s crypto-friendly approach underscores the potential for WLFI to influence governmental decisions on crypto regulation . Increased Credibility: Having a respected figure like Saqib on board lends substantial credibility to WLFI, potentially attracting a broader range of investors and users who might have been initially skeptical. Saqib’s Vision: A Catalyst for Global Crypto Policy Shift? In his Bloomberg interview, Saqib highlighted a fascinating possibility: Trump’s favorable stance on crypto could be a catalyst for other nations, including Pakistan, to re-evaluate and potentially align their crypto regulation frameworks. This isn’t just about one project; it’s about a potential ripple effect across global crypto policies. Imagine a scenario where more countries adopt crypto-friendly regulations, spurred by the influence of figures like Trump and projects like WLFI. This could unlock unprecedented levels of crypto adoption worldwide. Navigating the Complexities of Crypto Regulation Globally While the Saqib-WLFI alliance sparks excitement, it also brings to the forefront the ongoing challenges and complexities of crypto regulation . Here are key aspects to consider: Challenge Opportunity Regulatory Uncertainty: Global crypto regulation remains fragmented and often unclear, creating hurdles for widespread crypto adoption . Harmonization Potential: Initiatives like WLFI, influenced by figures with political connections, could push for greater harmonization and clarity in global crypto regulation . Security Concerns: Ensuring the security and integrity of crypto platforms and transactions is paramount to building trust and fostering crypto adoption . Technological Advancements: Continuous advancements in blockchain technology and security protocols offer solutions to mitigate risks and enhance user safety. Financial Stability: Governments are wary of the potential impact of cryptocurrencies on financial stability and monetary policy. Economic Growth: Recognizing the potential of crypto to drive economic growth and innovation could incentivize more favorable crypto regulation . The Road Ahead: What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto and Pakistan? The inclusion of the Pakistan Crypto Council CEO in World Liberty Financial is a bold move that underscores the increasingly interconnected nature of the global crypto landscape. For Pakistan, this could signify a pivotal moment. If Saqib’s predictions hold true, and Pakistan indeed considers aligning its policies with a more crypto-friendly approach, it could unlock significant economic opportunities and position the nation as a key player in the global digital economy. For the broader crypto world, this alliance represents a fascinating intersection of political influence, technological innovation, and global crypto adoption aspirations. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments in crypto regulation , both in Pakistan and globally, as they will significantly impact market trends. Diversify Investments: Consider exploring diverse crypto projects and platforms, including those with strong leadership and clear regulatory strategies. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in conversations about crypto adoption and crypto regulation to contribute to a more informed and constructive global discourse. Conclusion: A Powerful Partnership Poised to Reshape the Crypto World The alliance between Bilal Bin Saqib and World Liberty Financial is undoubtedly a powerful development in the crypto sphere. It brings together a respected voice from a key emerging market with a project backed by significant political influence. Whether this partnership will truly revolutionize crypto adoption and reshape crypto regulation remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: it has ignited a crucial conversation and set the stage for potentially transformative changes in the global crypto landscape.

It managed to defend itself from a possible price slip on Saturday and even went on the offensive on Sunday. Monday began on an even more positive note as BTC challenged $86,000 for the first time in about a week. It failed there at first and was pushed south to $83,000, but the bulls seemed determined to continue this rally. The culmination, at least for now, came yesterday when bitcoin spiked above $86,000 and tapped a two-week peak of $86,500. However, that was a brief run that ended there with a violent rejection.

The fear-birthed online shopping spree has made apps like DHgate, Taobao, and Shein top download charts in the United States. DHgate, a Chinese e-commerce platform known locally as Dunhuang, surged to the second position in Apple Inc.’s US App Store rankings, according to mobile analytics firm SensorTower. The app, affectionately dubbed “The Little Yellow App” by bargain-hunting shoppers, saw its popularity accelerate upwards after viral TikTok videos promoted low-cost luxury lookalikes it had on sale. TikTok videos push American consumers into Chinese online stores According to Bloomberg, the shared clips claim that high-end Western brands, such as Hermes and Louis Vuitton, source their goods from Chinese factories, and the same factories are now selling directly to consumers via platforms like DHgate.

According to local news outlets, on April 11, DHgate issued an open letter to its merchants to introduce its “Tariff Escort Plan.” In response to US tariffs that had reached 125% at the time, the marketplace said it would assist sellers with subsidies, promotional traffic, and logistical support to stabilize business operations and maintain price competitiveness. The platform, founded in 2004 by Wang Shutong, a former executive at Microsoft and Cisco, supports more than 2.6 million registered suppliers. It has over 30 million products listed and operates across 200 countries and regions. Wang, often referred to in local media as the “female Jack Ma,” also co-founded Joyo.com, one of China’s earliest e-commerce ventures, which Amazon later acquired. Europe worried about Chinese goods on the EU market In the East of the US, European leaders believe the indirect consequence of Trump’s tariffs is a market flocked by Chinese goods. If the US successfully restricts most goods from China, the Asian nation could begin offloading its industrial overcapacity onto Europe, threatening local industries and market stability. Liana Fix, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, called the situation “a tipping point for the continent.” “ There is a general trend and a feeling in Europe that in these times, Europe has to stand up for itself and has to protect itself ,” she said. The European Commission, led by President Ursula von der Leyen, had promised to “engage constructively” with Beijing, but von der Leyen told reporters she was well aware of the risks posed by a flood of underpriced Chinese goods. “ We cannot absorb global overcapacity nor will we accept dumping on our market ,” she surmised, announcing the creation of a task force to monitor imports for signs of market dumping. In the United Kingdom, domestic retailers also fear that goods previously destined for the US will now be redirected toward British shores. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned that a loophole for low-cost imports was closed when Trump slapped Chinese goods with a 145% tariff. “ Retailers are very concerned about the risk of some lower quality goods being rerouted from the US to Europe due to the tariffs ,” said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.

With nearly ₹2,000 crore still unaccounted for and no solid legal action in sight, users are left to wonder if they will ever get their money back or if the system is simply not ready to handle such massive crypto cases yet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Right now, the crypto winds are blowing towards caution as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals heightened anxiety among investors. Let’s delve into the latest shift in this crucial market indicator and what it means for your crypto strategy. Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Dive into Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely tracked metric by Alternative.me , has recently dipped, falling nine points to a score of 29 as of April 16th. This shift pushes the index deeper into the “Fear” zone, a sentiment classification that reflects investor unease and potential market downturns. But what exactly does this index measure, and why should crypto enthusiasts pay attention? Essentially, the Fear & Greed Index acts as a barometer for crypto market sentiment . It aggregates various data points to provide a single, easy-to-understand score ranging from 0 to 100. Here’s a quick breakdown: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Signifies a market gripped by panic, often presenting potential buying opportunities as assets may be undervalued. 25-49: Fear – Indicates caution and risk aversion among investors, suggesting a potential market correction or stagnation. 50-74: Greed – Points towards growing optimism and investment appetite, hinting at potential market rallies. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Signals excessive market exuberance, which can be a warning sign of an impending bubble or correction. Currently sitting at 29, the index firmly resides within the “Fear” zone. This isn’t just a number; it’s a reflection of the collective emotional state of the crypto market, influencing trading decisions and overall market dynamics. Decoding the Drivers: What Fuels the Fear? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on gut feelings; it’s a data-driven tool that meticulously analyzes six key market indicators. Understanding these components is crucial to interpreting the index’s movements and anticipating market behavior. Let’s break down the factors that contribute to the current Fear zone reading: Volatility (25%): Measures the rapid and unpredictable price swings in the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin. High Bitcoin volatility often triggers fear as investors become wary of sudden losses. Increased volatility contributes significantly to a lower index score. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Examines the trading volume and price momentum compared to recent averages. Weakening momentum and lower trading volumes signal reduced investor interest and contribute to fear. Declining market activity pulls the index down. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms, primarily Twitter and Reddit, related to cryptocurrencies. A surge in negative sentiment and bearish discussions pushes the index towards fear. Social media chatter reflects and amplifies market emotions. Surveys (15%): Periodically conducted polls gauge investor sentiment directly. While less frequent than other factors, survey results reflecting pessimism contribute to the fear index. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the rest of the crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a flight to safety during fearful times, as investors move away from riskier altcoins. However, the relationship isn’t always straightforward and depends on market context. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and crypto terms. A decrease in search interest can suggest waning enthusiasm and contribute to a fearful outlook. Reduced public attention mirrors market sentiment shifts. The current dip to 29 suggests a confluence of these factors leaning towards fear. Investors might be reacting to macroeconomic uncertainties, regulatory concerns, or simply profit-taking after recent market gains. Understanding these underlying drivers provides a more nuanced perspective on the index reading. Navigating the Fear: Opportunities and Cautions While a “Fear” reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index might sound alarming, it’s essential to remember that it’s not necessarily a signal to panic. In fact, historically, periods of extreme fear have often presented lucrative buying opportunities in the crypto market. Here’s how to approach the current market sentiment: Potential Opportunities: Buying Low: As the adage goes, “buy when there’s blood in the streets.” Fear can drive asset prices down to undervalued levels. For long-term investors with conviction in the crypto market, this period could be an opportune time to accumulate assets at a discount. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Implementing a DCA strategy during periods of fear can be particularly effective. By investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price fluctuations, you can average out your entry point and potentially benefit from future market rebounds. Focus on Fundamentals: Market fear can sometimes overshadow the underlying fundamentals of strong crypto projects. Use this time to research and identify projects with solid technology, strong teams, and real-world use cases that are likely to weather market storms and thrive in the long run. Cautions to Consider: Increased Volatility: Fear often accompanies heightened Bitcoin volatility . Be prepared for potentially larger price swings and manage your risk accordingly. Avoid over-leveraging or investing more than you can afford to lose. Potential for Further Downturn: While fear can present buying opportunities, it’s also crucial to acknowledge the possibility of further market declines. The index reflects current sentiment, but market conditions can evolve rapidly. Emotional Trading: Fear can lead to impulsive and emotional trading decisions. Resist the urge to panic sell based on short-term market fluctuations. Stick to your long-term investment strategy and avoid making rash choices driven by fear. Actionable Insights: Riding the Waves of Crypto Sentiment The crypto market sentiment , as indicated by the Fear & Greed Index, is a dynamic force. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate the current “Fear” zone and beyond: Monitor the Index Regularly: Keep an eye on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a gauge of overall market sentiment. Track its daily and weekly movements to identify shifts in investor emotions. Correlate with Price Action: Analyze the index in conjunction with price charts and technical indicators. Confirm index signals with price patterns and volume trends to gain a more comprehensive market view. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news and events that could be influencing market sentiment, such as regulatory updates, macroeconomic data, and technological developments in the crypto space. Develop a Risk Management Strategy: Implement robust risk management practices, including setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio, and only investing what you can afford to lose, especially during periods of heightened fear. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile and cyclical. Maintain a long-term perspective and avoid getting swayed by short-term fear-driven fluctuations. Focus on the long-term growth potential of the crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: Fear as a Compass in the Crypto Seas The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s current position in the “Fear” zone serves as a timely reminder of the emotional undercurrents that drive the cryptocurrency market. While fear can be unsettling, it also presents opportunities for astute investors. By understanding the index, its components, and the broader market context, you can navigate periods of fear with greater confidence and potentially position yourself for long-term success in the exciting, yet often turbulent, world of crypto.

Analyst Says ‘Face-Melting’ Rally Comes Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-the-storm-over-for-ethereum-analyst-says-face-melting-rally-comes-next/,"Ethereum (ETH) continues to hold a crucial support level after recovering from last week’s correction. Its recent bounce from historical demand zones has led some analysts to suggest that the altcoin is gearing up for a breakout. Related Reading: Forget XRP At $3, Analyst Reveals How High Price Will Be In A Few Months Ethereum Holds Key Support Ethereum has reclaimed the key $1,600 level after dropping below the $1,400 support for the first time since 2023. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently fell to a two-year low during last week’s correction, fueled by US President Donald Trump’s trade tariff war. ETH touched $1,385 last Wednesday, retesting the 2018 all-time high (ATH) levels before recovering. Amid Trump’s 90-day tariff pause announcement, Ethereum jumped over 10% from $1,480 to $1,600, briefly nearing the $1,700 resistance. However, its price retraced to the $1,400-$1,500 support zone on Thursday amid the market’s volatility. Over the weekend, the King of Altcoins recovered, hovering between the $1,580-$1,680 price range for the past four days. Ethereum has reclaimed the $1,600 support in the past 24 hours, fueling a bullish sentiment among some market watchers. Analyst Ted Pillows noted that ETH might be getting closer to a breakout from its short-term downtrend line. According to him, investors could expect the cryptocurrency to hold the $1,550-$1,600 level now that global markets are gaining some strength. He considers holding this range could propel Ethereum’s price toward the one-month downtrend line. A breakout and confirmation of this resistance, at around $1,670, could set the base for a 20% jump toward the $2,000 resistance level. Is ETH Out Of The Woods? Merlijn The Trader suggested that ETH is gearing up for a breakout. The market watcher pointed out the cryptocurrency’s two-month descending channel, which could be “history” if volume surges. The analyst considers that as Ethereum nears the channel’s upper boundary, “all we need now is volume” for a surge above the $1,690 mark, adding that a breakout from this level would target $2,700. He also underscored that ETH’s double top formation was completed after “smashing” the $1,432 target, signaling that it “survived the storm.” Notably, the cryptocurrency confirmed this pattern, which developed within its $2,196-$3,904 Macro Range, following its March close below the $2,100 support. After recovering from the recent lows, “Now comes the face-melting rally no one expects. $4,000 is only the beginning.” Meanwhile, Rekt Capital highlighted that Ethereum’s Dominance has almost equaled old All-Time Lows. He explained that since June 2023, ETH’s Dominance has dropped from 20% to 8%, historically a reverse area for the cryptocurrency.

When the ETH Dominance hit the $7.5%-8.25% range, it reversed “to become more market-dominant,” which could signal a reversal for the King of Altcoins. As of this writing, ETH trades at $1,609, a 1% decrease in the daily timeframe.

43403134,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149810,1744797656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Relief for Coinbase: SEC Disclosure Review Cleared Without Amendments,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-sec-review-cleared/,"In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry and leading exchange Coinbase, the company has announced a successful resolution to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure review. This news brings a wave of relief to investors and the broader crypto community, signaling a positive step forward in regulatory clarity for digital assets. But what exactly does this mean for Coinbase and the future of crypto regulation? Let’s dive into the details. Coinbase SEC Review: A Smooth Clearance Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the positive update. He stated that after a thorough Coinbase SEC review of their public filings, the SEC has concluded its inquiry without requiring any restatements or amendments. This is a crucial win for Coinbase, especially considering the scrutiny crypto companies often face from regulatory bodies like the SEC. Here’s a quick breakdown of what this SEC review entailed: Nature of the Review: The SEC conducted a disclosure review of Coinbase’s Form 10-K filings. These filings are comprehensive annual reports that publicly traded companies like Coinbase are required to submit, detailing their financial performance and operational activities. Timeline: The SEC’s comments were raised more than two years after Coinbase went public. This prolonged period underscores the depth and complexity of regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space. Outcome: Crucially, the review was completed without any need for Coinbase to revise or correct its previously filed disclosures. This indicates that Coinbase’s filings were deemed compliant and accurate by the SEC. Confirmation: Grewal even shared a letter from the SEC confirming the closure of the review, providing concrete evidence of this positive outcome. Why is this SEC Disclosure Coinbase Clearance Important? The successful SEC disclosure Coinbase clearance is more than just a procedural step; it carries significant implications for Coinbase and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. Here’s why this development is noteworthy: Boosts Investor Confidence: Regulatory clarity is paramount for investor confidence. The SEC’s nod of approval without amendments suggests that Coinbase operates with a high degree of transparency and compliance. This can attract more institutional and retail investors to Coinbase and the crypto market in general. Reduces Regulatory Uncertainty: The crypto industry has long grappled with regulatory uncertainty. This successful review provides a degree of assurance that Coinbase is navigating the complex regulatory landscape effectively. It sets a positive precedent for other crypto companies undergoing similar scrutiny. Validates Coinbase’s Operations: The fact that the SEC found no need for restatements validates Coinbase’s existing disclosure practices and internal controls. It reinforces Coinbase’s position as a responsible and compliant player in the crypto exchange arena. Potential for Future Growth: By clearing this regulatory hurdle, Coinbase can focus more on innovation and expansion.

Which ways are already on the table?,https://crypto.news/the-us-must-use-budget-neutral-ways-to-increase-its-btc-reserve-which-ways-are-already-on-the-table/,"On Mar. 6, 2025, an executive order set up the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The order prohibits the government from selling bitcoins or buying more using taxpayers’ money. Since then, it has been unclear how the U.S. is going to acquire more bitcoins, although several options have been named. In a recent interview with Professional Capital Management CEO Anthony Pompliano, the President of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, Bo Hines mentioned two methods that were actively discussed by the officials. Let’s dive deeper into what he said and name other ideas on how the U.S. could acquire more bitcoins. Table of Contents What Hines said? Other options Accounting issues What Hines said? A video clip of Hines’ interview with Pompliano emerged on the Internet on Apr. 14, 2025. In the clip, Hines mentions two legitimate avenues for the U.S. to increase its bitcoin holdings. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TRUMP'S COUNCIL OF ADVISORS ON DIGITAL ASSETS BO HINES SAYS THE U.S. COULD USE REVENUE FROM TARIFFS TO BUY $BTC pic.twitter.com/jo1MJf3NQ7 — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) April 15, 2025 Hines began by mentioning the Bitcoin Act introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis. He said that the act “has taken the community by storm.” He added that “that’s currently circulating its way through Capitol Hill” and that the supporters are looking for co-sponsors to help the act come to fruition. Sen. Lummis and Rep. Nick Begich introduced the Bitcoin Act on Mar. 11. The act enables the U.S. to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve similar to the gold reserves and formally recognize Bitcoin as a strategic national asset. The act suggests that the U.S. must acquire one million bitcoins in five years using budget-neutral ways, including Federal Reserve remittances and gold certificate revaluations. In an interview, Hines emphasized the latter way of increasing the national BTC holdings. He explains that currently, most of the gold certificates in the U.S. Treasury are valued at $43 per ounce, while the current gold price exceeds $3,000. The Treasury Secretary may issue new certificates that reflect the fair market value of gold, not just a statutory price of gold certificates. Hines says that the U.S. can use “that extra funding” to buy more BTC. The actual statutory gold certificate price is set at $42.2 per troy ounce. Craig Hemke of Sprott Money has been critical of the gold revaluation strategy, dismissing it as an “accounting gimmick that enables the U.S. Treasury to create a trillion dollars from nothing while not impacting the net deficit of the current balance sheet.” Hemke noted that by adding $1 trillion to the asset side while simultaneously adding $1 trillion to the liabilities side, the only result is the dollar devaluation, driving the gold price higher. However, a weak dollar is something Trump needs, so the U.S. may boost exports and bring back manufacturers from abroad. More than that, inflation usually results in a stronger Bitcoin performance. Given that, the gold certificate revaluation may result in exactly what the current administration aims for, even aside from finding money to buy Bitcoin. Read more: If the Fed prints more money, what’s at stake for Bitcoin? The gold certificates revaluation isn’t the only way to fund the SBR. Hines mentioned one more method that wasn’t outlined before, the revenue from tariffs. According to research by the Tax Foundation, a 10% universal tariff may bring $2.2 trillion in nine years, while a 20% tariff would raise $3.4 trillion during the same period. The negative macroeconomic feedback may decrease these figures. Acquiring one million bitcoins at the current price takes much less than one trillion dollars. So, both the revenue from tariffs and the gold certificate revaluation seem to be efficient enough. These two methods are not the only. Hines admits there are countless possible ways to grow the SBR without spending taxpayers’ money. “Everything’s on the table. And like we’ve said, we want as much as we can get. So we’re going to make sure that no stone is unturned as we start fleshing out some of these processes.” Other options Other options brought up by various experts include establishing Bitcoin bonds and using the Exchange Stabilization Fund surplus to buy BTC. Selling surplus from Exchange Stabilization Fund and Special Drawing Rights, which is an accounting maneuver similar to gold certificate revaluation. Selling this surplus doesn’t need Congress’s approval. It may give the government between $39 and $40 billion to spend on Bitcoin without much hassle. Bitcoin Policy Institute introduced Bitcoin bonds, or BitBonds. Investors will have a fixed 1% annual interest paid in USD. 90% of the money obtained via BitBonds sales will fund the government, while the rest of the money may be used to buy more bitcoins for the SBR. Accounting issues The approximately 200,000 BTC stockpile existing in the U.S. now consists of bitcoins collected through seizures. Accounting of bitcoins held by the U.S. agencies should have been done within 30 days after the adoption of the SBR on Mar. 6, 2025. However, it is still unknown if the audit took place and what the results are. Sure. The interview was comfort food if you are a crypto lobbyist. Bo broadly supported all the things crypto lobbyists want, even if it was light on actual specifics. The reason why I'm souring so hard on this interview in particular because this wasn't just a regular Pomp… — Pledditor (@Pledditor) April 14, 2025 Pompliano has been criticized online for not bringing up the audit issue during the White House interview with Bo Hines, with some dismissing Pompliano as a Trump administration shill.

Accordingly, Alphractal, one of the leading analysis companies, examined the Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD) indicator, which is considered one of the most accurate tools for determining cycle bottoms in Bitcoin. Stating that CVDD is one of the top metrics to be followed, Alphractal stated that the CVDD indicator gives a bottom signal for LTC, DOGE, BCH and Dash. “The CVDD metric, considered one of the most accurate tools for identifying cycle bottoms in Bitcoin, shows similar potential in other cryptocurrencies with similar structures. “The implementation of the CVDD goes beyond simply identifying entry points for relevant cryptocurrencies; it enables the development of more complex and well-founded investment strategies.” Litecoin (LTC): CVDD has proven to be incredibly effective for Litecoin, correctly supporting all of LTC’s cycle bottoms. The model’s effectiveness on LTC is comparable to its performance on Bitcoin, reinforcing its value as an analytical tool. Another bottom may be in sight for LTC. Dogecoin (DOGE): Dogecoin has exhibited a similar behavior, with both CVDD patterns consistently supporting price bottoms. Recently, DOGE’s price found support precisely at CVDD pattern 2. Barring additional significant declines, the bottom may have already been reached. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): CVDD has also proven to be a good support indicator for Bitcoin Cash. Its price has never fallen below the level indicated by CVDD and has found support in 2020, particularly in model 2, reinforcing the validity of the metric. It may now be signaling a bottom for BCH. Dash: It has experienced a prolonged bear market for most of its existence and recently tested the CVDD level for the fourth time since 2024. This was the first significant approach for the metric and the price has remained stable since then without any additional declines. The CVDD indicator offers a positive signal for Dash.

The move will give U.S.-based crypto traders access to the platform and its native OKX Wallet. Additionally, OKX hired former Barclays executive Roshan Robert as its U.S. CEO to lead the company’s U.S. expansion. The renewed focus on the U.S. comes after OKX recently reached a settlement of over $500 million with the DOJ to resolve allegations that it had operated in the United States without a money transmitter license. Roshan Robert reveals OKX’s U.S. strategy Roshan Robert was a founding member of the crypto prime broker Hidden Road, which Ripple recently purchased for $1.25 billion. He recently served as an executive at the institutional crypto lending platform CLST. Meanwhile, Robert, now acting as the recently hired CEO, announced that the new expansion was a commitment to responsible growth. Robert also detailed the new strategies OKX plans to implement in its U.S. operations. He emphasized that OKX is actively working with U.S. lawmakers and regulators to adapt to evolving regulations, underscoring the company’s commitment to transparent and compliant trading practices. To further demonstrate their commitment to a secure trading environment, he highlighted that the crypto exchange platform’s comprehensive, risk-based global compliance program includes enhanced due diligence, robust KYC procedures, customer risk rating systems, advanced fraud detection, AML tools, geo-blocking measures, and market surveillance technologies. Additionally, the company’s launch announcement stated that existing users of OKCoin—OKX’s U.S.-accessible sister company—will be smoothly transitioned to the OKX platform, granting them access to advanced trading tools, lower fees, and greater liquidity. The cryptocurrency industry has turned its attention to the U.S. The United States has become much more welcoming to the cryptocurrency industry under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. To support this, OKX recently considered expanding into the United States with a new office. This followed the DOJ’s earlier allegation that, despite having a formal policy prohibiting U.S.-based users from using its platform, it actively sought clients in the U.S., including in the Southern District of New York. The platform served both retail and institutional clients in the U.S. from around 2018 until early 2024, processing over a trillion dollars’ worth of crypto transactions. OKX pleaded guilty to offering services to U.S.-based clients without obtaining a money transmitter license and paid more than $504 million in the settlement, of which $84 million was a penalty. The remaining amount reflected fees the exchange earned from its U.S. customers. Interestingly, apart from OKX, bigger names, like Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, is reportedly thinking about returning to the United States. At the same time, CoinList, a token launch platform, announced earlier this month that it would return to the country after being away for five years.

Not With PEP-20 Taking Off,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/is-mind-of-pepe-good-investment-not-with-pep-20-taking-off/,"The post Is Mind of Pepe Good Investment? Not With PEP-20 Taking Off appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With so many Pepe derivatives around, it’s fair to pause and ask: who created Pepe , and why is this character still captivating crypto buyers? Matt Furie is an American comic artist who introduced Pepe the Frog back in 2005 through his indie series Boy’s Club. What started as a mellow cartoon evolved into one of the most iconic memes of all time. But unlike Furie’s laid-back comic roots, the team behind Bitcoin Pepe has something far more explosive in mind. Built by Bitcoin Maxis, the project is layering meme coins on top of the most secure blockchain in crypto, something no one else has managed to do at scale. The team’s presale has gotten off to a flying start; with 1000s driving the raise past $6.5m in anticipation of the token listing and product launch. Bitcoin Pepe: BTC-grade security meets meme-level gains Bitcoin Pepe is a Layer 2 bringing Solana-grade speed, low fees, and modern UX to Bitcoin. But this goes deeper than performance. Bitcoin Pepe is the first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network, making this a very interesting idea. It basically is the route to moving meme coin trading on to the Bitcoin network, which if executed correctly could be powerful indeed. Thanks to Bitcoin Pepe’s new PEP-20 token standard , anyone will be able to create and launch assets directly on BTC, lowering the barrier for meme coin creation and setting the stage for the same kind of explosion Ethereum saw with ERC-20. BTC maxis can finally ape into memes without leaving home. Letting bitcoin holders trade memes without jumping chains opens up a new frontier where Bitcoin becomes more than just digital gold. It becomes the hub for DeFi, NFTs, and the wildest meme runs of 2025. There’s a lot to like about this. Mind of Pepe vs Bitcoin Pepe: What to buy? Mind of Pepe (MIND) brings a decent pitch. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, it’s easy to use and slides neatly into the existing DeFi ecosystem. MIND’s big play is an AI agent that’s supposed to help users stay ahead of trends and noise. That’s cute, but is it enough? In reality, the AI tool market is stacked. With over $3 billion already in play and tons of projects promising to make crypto simpler, MIND doesn’t bring anything radically new to the table given the countless tools offering the same kind of intel. When you stack that against Bitcoin Pepe, it’s not even close. By unlocking $1.5 trillion in BTC capital, enabling DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins on Bitcoin, and offering juicy staking pools with rewards that reach up to 10,000% APY, BPEP gives holders something real to gain from the start. The presale is structured in 30 stages with prices climbing 5% every time a stage sells out. Early birds get the meme worm and the cheapest entry. If Bitcoin’s going to explode again, it won’t be because of another halving. It’ll be because retail comes roaring back, and Bitcoin Pepe is what they’ll follow in. Bitcoin Pepe: The Next Step in Bitcoin’s Evolution? For years, Bitcoin has been wearing a three-piece suit: digital gold, inflation hedge, institutional darling. All good things… if you’re building a retirement plan. But crypto wasn’t built for suits, it was built for the man on the street. Bitcoin Pepe is hauling that energy back where it belongs and there’s no telling how far it could go. It could be a huge catalyst for reapproaching the Bitcoin blockchain from a developer standpoint. Proof of Work has had its issues but Bitcoin itself remains the pillar of the industry. Whether you’re hunting for meme coins to buy, seeking staking rewards, or just want a stake in BTC’s next evolution, it’s worth checking out Bitcoin Pepe whilst it’s still priced at $0.0295.

The constant ups and downs can be dizzying, right? Well, there might be a glimmer of hope on the horizon! A recent Coinbase report suggests we could see some much-needed stability in crypto prices as we move into late Q2 of 2025. Let’s dive into what this report means for you and your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Coinbase Report: What Does Market Stabilization Mean for Crypto Prices? Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange based in the U.S., recently released a report offering insights into the potential future of the crypto market. The key takeaway? They predict that crypto prices might just find a stable base, or a price floor, towards the end of the second quarter of 2025. This is significant because a stable price floor can act as a launching pad for a potential market rebound . Think of it like building a solid foundation before constructing a skyscraper – stability first, then growth! But what exactly does ‘ market stabilization ‘ mean in the volatile world of crypto? It essentially implies a period where the dramatic price swings we’ve become accustomed to start to lessen. Volatility is part and parcel of the crypto world, but extreme volatility can make long-term investment strategies challenging. Market stabilization doesn’t mean prices will be static, but rather that the fluctuations will become more predictable and less erratic. Here’s a breakdown of what market stabilization could entail, according to industry experts: Reduced Price Swings: Expect less dramatic daily or weekly price changes. While there will still be movement, the wild surges and crashes should become less frequent. Increased Investor Confidence: Stability often breeds confidence. As the market becomes less turbulent, both institutional and retail investors may feel more comfortable deploying capital, potentially driving further growth. More Predictable Trading Patterns: Technical analysis and fundamental analysis may become more reliable tools as market behavior becomes less driven by sudden shocks and more by underlying fundamentals. Focus on Long-Term Growth: With reduced short-term volatility, investors can shift their focus towards the long-term potential of crypto assets and blockchain technology, rather than being constantly reactive to market noise. Navigating Uncertainty: Why Coinbase Suggests a Cautious Approach in the Short Term While the Coinbase report offers a positive outlook for late Q2 2025 and beyond, it also emphasizes the need for caution in the immediate future. The report highlights that the next four to six weeks could remain unpredictable. This isn’t necessarily bad news; it’s more of a realistic assessment of the current market landscape. Think of it as a weather forecast – predicting sunshine later in the week doesn’t negate the possibility of rain today! Why the cautious stance? Several factors could contribute to continued market uncertainty in the short term: Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, and interest rate decisions by central banks continue to exert significant influence on all markets, including crypto. Uncertainty in these areas can lead to market volatility. Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Unexpected regulatory announcements or actions can trigger market fluctuations. Geopolitical Events: Unforeseen geopolitical events can also introduce volatility into financial markets, and crypto is no exception. Market Sentiment: Investor sentiment can be fickle. Negative news or market corrections can sometimes lead to fear-driven sell-offs, exacerbating volatility. Given these potential uncertainties, Coinbase advises investors to adopt a “cautious and defensive approach” in the short term. This doesn’t mean panic selling! Instead, it suggests strategies like: Portfolio Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto holdings and potentially your broader investment portfolio to mitigate risk. Risk Management: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Avoid investing more than you can afford to lose. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider DCA – investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals. This can help smooth out the impact of short-term price fluctuations. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic trends. Knowledge is power, especially in volatile markets. Q2 2025: The Potential Turning Point for Crypto Market Rebound? The Coinbase report points to late Q2 2025 as a potential turning point, setting the stage for a market rebound in Q3. This is exciting news for crypto enthusiasts who have been patiently waiting for the next bull run. But what factors could contribute to this anticipated rebound? Several potential catalysts could drive a market rebound in Q3 2025 and beyond: Potential Catalyst Explanation Increased Institutional Adoption As the regulatory landscape becomes clearer and market infrastructure matures, more institutional investors (like hedge funds, pension funds, and corporations) may allocate capital to crypto assets, driving demand and prices upwards. Technological Advancements Continued innovation in blockchain technology, such as scalability solutions, interoperability protocols, and the growth of decentralized applications (dApps), can enhance the utility and appeal of cryptocurrencies. Halving Events (for Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies) Pre-programmed events like Bitcoin halvings, which reduce the rate at which new coins are mined, historically have had a bullish impact on prices due to reduced supply. Positive Macroeconomic Shifts If global economic conditions improve, inflation moderates, and interest rate hikes slow down or reverse, risk assets like cryptocurrencies could become more attractive to investors. Growing Retail Adoption As crypto education increases and user-friendly platforms become more accessible, a new wave of retail investors may enter the market, further fueling demand. It’s important to remember that these are potential catalysts, and the future is never guaranteed. However, the confluence of these factors, coupled with the anticipated market stabilization in Q2, paints a potentially optimistic picture for the latter half of 2025. Actionable Insights: Preparing for Potential Crypto Market Rebound So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights to consider as you navigate the current market and prepare for a potential market rebound : Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Don’t rely solely on reports or predictions – understand the fundamentals of the projects you are interested in. Focus on Quality Projects: In a potential bull market, not all cryptocurrencies will perform equally. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, solid teams, real-world use cases, and active communities. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency investing is often best approached with a long-term perspective. Avoid getting caught up in short-term hype or fear. Stay Flexible: The crypto market is dynamic. Be prepared to adapt your strategies as market conditions evolve. Consider Staking and Yield Farming (with Caution): If you hold cryptocurrencies for the long term, explore opportunities to earn passive income through staking or yield farming, but always be aware of the associated risks. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Landscape with Informed Optimism The Coinbase report offers a valuable perspective on the potential future trajectory of the crypto market. While short-term uncertainty remains, the anticipation of market stabilization in late Q2 2025 and a potential market rebound in Q3 provides a reason for informed optimism. By adopting a cautious yet proactive approach, staying informed, and focusing on long-term value, you can navigate the crypto landscape with greater confidence and position yourself to potentially benefit from future market growth. Remember, patience and informed decision-making are your best allies in the exciting world of cryptocurrencies.

After a period of market fluctuations, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are showing strong signs of life. On April 15th, these investment vehicles collectively pulled in a significant $76.89 million in net inflows. This marks the second consecutive day of positive flow, suggesting a potential shift in investor sentiment and renewed interest in digital assets. Let’s dive into the details of this positive Bitcoin ETF inflow and what it could mean for the broader crypto market. What’s Fueling the Recent Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows? The crypto market is known for its volatility, and Bitcoin ETF inflows are often seen as a key indicator of institutional and retail investor confidence. This recent surge of $76.89 million is particularly noteworthy because it breaks a previous trend of mixed or negative flows. Several factors could be contributing to this positive momentum: Renewed Market Optimism: After some price corrections and uncertainty, the crypto market may be entering a phase of renewed optimism. Positive news or developments in the regulatory landscape can often trigger increased investment activity. Institutional Adoption: Spot Bitcoin ETFs are designed to make Bitcoin accessible to a wider range of investors, including institutions. Increased inflows could signal growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin as an asset class. Price Stability: A period of relative price stability in Bitcoin might be encouraging investors to allocate funds to ETFs, viewing it as a strategic entry point. Growing Awareness: As spot Bitcoin ETFs become more established and understood, more investors may be comfortable including them in their portfolios. Breaking Down the Bitcoin ETF Inflow Leaders: Which ETFs are Shining? According to data from Trader T (@thepfund) on X, several key players are driving this wave of crypto inflows . Let’s take a closer look at the ETFs that are attracting the most capital: ETF Provider ETF Ticker Net Inflow (April 15) BlackRock IBIT $38.69 million Ark Invest ARKB $13.42 million Bitwise BITB $10.98 million Grayscale GBTC $8.93 million Franklin Templeton EZBC $4.87 million Source: Trader T (@thepfund) on X As you can see, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF is leading the pack with a substantial $38.69 million inflow. Ark Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB are also demonstrating strong performance, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC. It’s important to note that while GBTC experienced inflows, it has historically seen outflows, making this positive figure a potentially significant shift. The fact that multiple ETFs are seeing positive inflows across the board paints a healthy picture for the overall spot Bitcoin ETF market. Why Are Bitcoin ETF Inflows a Big Deal for the Crypto Space? The significance of Bitcoin ETF inflows extends beyond just the ETF products themselves. They serve as a barometer for the health and direction of the broader cryptocurrency market. Here’s why these inflows are considered so important: Increased Liquidity: Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs inject more capital into the Bitcoin market, enhancing liquidity. This can lead to more efficient price discovery and potentially reduce volatility over time. Mainstream Adoption: ETFs provide a regulated and familiar investment vehicle for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Positive inflows suggest growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. Price Impact: While not the sole driver, consistent crypto inflows into Bitcoin ETFs can contribute to upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price by increasing demand. Market Sentiment Indicator: As mentioned earlier, ETF flows are a strong indicator of market sentiment. Positive flows reflect investor confidence and a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future. Validation of Crypto as an Asset Class: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the consistent inflows they attract further validate cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and investable asset class in the eyes of the traditional financial world. Navigating the Crypto Investment Landscape: Actionable Insights So, what are the key takeaways from this positive Bitcoin ETF inflow data, and what actionable insights can investors glean? Monitor ETF Flows: Keep an eye on daily and weekly Bitcoin ETF inflow data as a gauge of market sentiment and potential shifts in investor behavior. Diversification: Consider spot Bitcoin ETFs as a potential component of a diversified investment portfolio, especially if you are looking for exposure to digital assets within a regulated framework. Due Diligence: Research different Bitcoin ETFs , considering factors like fees, tracking error, and the ETF provider’s reputation before making any investment decisions. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency investments, including Bitcoin ETFs , are generally considered long-term plays. Be prepared for volatility and focus on the long-term growth potential of the asset class. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Stay updated on regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors that could influence Bitcoin ETF inflows and the broader market. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for the Crypto Market? The $76.89 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on April 15th is undoubtedly a positive sign for the cryptocurrency market. While one day’s data doesn’t define a trend, two consecutive days of inflows suggest a potential shift towards renewed investor optimism and institutional investment . The strong performance of ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT and Ark Invest’s ARKB highlights the growing appeal of these investment vehicles. As the market continues to evolve, monitoring Bitcoin ETF inflows will remain crucial for understanding the pulse of investor sentiment and the trajectory of the crypto space. This recent surge offers a hopeful indication that the market is regaining momentum, and Bitcoin ETFs are playing a vital role in facilitating broader adoption and growth.

Niinami made the comments amid an upcoming three-day trip by top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa to the U.S for talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi noted that the visit will strengthen its relationship with the U.S. and allow the country to drop tariff measures on Tokyo. Tokyo plans to keep its U.S. Treasurys stock Takeshi Niinami, senior economic advisor to Japan’s prime minister, said Japan will keep its massive stock US Treasurys, adding “We know that the President is [very concerned] over the bond market,” referring to US President Donald Trump.” https://t.co/omCeCX90u4 — LK Preserve (@LKPreserve) April 16, 2025 Takeshi Niinami, senior economic advisor to Japan’s prime minister, acknowledged that the nation has “many cards” to play in tariff negotiations with the U.S. The economic advisor said he is “cautiously optimistic” about the trade talks. The chairman and CEO of Japanese drinks manufacturer Suntory Holdings also argued that Japan should therefore, talk about more opportunities in the U.S. Niinami acknowledged that Japan has been the biggest foreign investor in the U.S. and the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury bonds. He also said that the country will keep its massive stock of U.S. Treasurys, which is about $1.1 trillion. Niinami stated that “we know that the President is [very concerned] over the bond market,” while referring to the U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump argued that the bond market sell-off last week was part of the reason he reversed his reciprocal tariffs. He said, “I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line; they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.” Director of the U.S. National Economic Council Kevin Hassett highlighted on April 10 that the bond market decline contributed to Trump’s decision. From April 8, the 10-year Treasury yield surged above 4.5% on speculation a big bondholder like Japan or China was dumping U.S. bonds. Prime minister’s senior economic advisor acknowledged the Asian economic giant could make another move to talk about military purchases from the U.S. Niinami argued that it strives to elevate defense spending to 2% of gross domestic product. The country and the U.S. have deep military relations, and Japan’s Self-Defense Forces use several U.S. equipment, such as fighter jets, helicopters, and some small arms. “Let’s normalize the relations because we are the biggest ally of the United States. So we want to normalize the relationship, and we want to upgrade the relationship between the U.S. and Japan in terms of regional security.” ~ Takeshi Niinami, senior economic advisor to Japan’s prime minister. Trump had imposed a 24% reciprocal tariff on Japan, but it was suspended for 90 days from April 9, leaving a 10% baseline tariff. Niinami also argued that while it’s not ideal for Tokyo to invest in the U.S. given the current situation, he believes that U.S. productivity is much higher than other countries, which makes the market attractive. He noted that he was not pleased with the current plan from the U.S. but added that “we want to keep investing in the United States.” Japan’s chief trade negotiator visits Washington for tariff talks Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi acknowledged that Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa will visit Washington from Wednesday to Friday. Akazawa is expected to have talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. He said he will “carefully think what will best serve Japan’s national interest, what will be most effective” and do his utmost in the negotiation. Hayashi noted that the visit will be to “build a relationship of trust” between the two sides, with Tokyo requesting the U.S. to remove the tariff measures. He also believes that Japan’s government will “tackle the challenge” and work as one to resolve the issue as soon as possible. The country’s Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, referred to the current situation as “a national crisis.” He also mentioned in a Monday parliamentary session that “haste makes waste,” and he was in no rush to conclude the negotiations with the U.S. Ishiba stated that Japan was not retaliating with tariffs against the U.S. since the measures weren’t beneficial.

33767162,[object Object],1744803012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Ethereum Breakout Imminent? Analyst Expects ETH Price Surge To $2,000",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-breakout-imminent-analyst-expects-eth-price-surge-to-2000/,"Ethereum (ETH) is down nearly 50% over the past year, eroding investor confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, crypto analysts suggest that ETH’s fortunes might be about to turn. Ethereum Set For A Bullish Breakout? Unlike Bitcoin (BTC), ETH has not significantly benefited from the bullish developments of 2024. While the approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) opened the floodgates for institutional capital to flow into the top digital asset, ETH ETFs have failed to generate the same level of interest. Moreover, ETH’s underperformance relative to BTC has only deepened. Crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades shared the following two-week ETH/BTC chart showing how ETH has consistently broken through key high time-frame support levels against BTC over the past few years. Currently, ETH is trading at levels not seen since 2020 relative to BTC. According to the analyst, the final major ETH/BTC support lies around 0.016 – nearly 20% below the current level of 0.019. On a more optimistic note, fellow analyst Ted pointed out that ETH may be breaking out of a downward-sloping trendline on the two-hour chart. He commented: Global markets are gaining some strength, so expect Ethereum to hold the $1,550-$1,600 level. For now, I’m hoping for a breakout above and close above $1,670 for a rally towards $2K. Similarly, seasoned analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted that ETH appears poised to break out from an ascending triangle pattern on the weekly time frame. According to him, ETH is currently trading at the bottom of the structure and could be setting up to test the top of the formation around $3,600. For the uninitiated, the ascending triangle is a continuation pattern that forms when price makes higher lows while facing resistance at a horizontal level, eventually creating a triangle shape. It signals building buying pressure, and a breakout above the resistance line often leads to a strong upward move. Rising ETH Exchange Reserves Could Suppress Price While the analysts above point to a potential bullish reversal for ETH, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that over 368,000 ETH has been sent to exchanges since the beginning of the month. A rise in exchange reserves for a digital asset is typically bearish news, as it indicates that holders may be looking to sell their assets in the near-term. Additionally, even if ETH has already bottomed for this market cycle, it still faces strong resistance around the $2,300 mark. At press time, ETH trades at $1,612, down 2.7% over the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Ascending Triangle Pattern|bitcoin|btc|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|ethbtc|Ether|ETHUSDT|Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-16 11:30:12

A combination of bearish signals has disrupted bullish momentum and left traders cautious. Data indicates sluggish appetite from institutional players, particularly through spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have acted as a bellwether for broader market sentiment this year. Adding to the pressure is a notable lack of whale accumulation. Large holders have been largely absent from recent buying activity, while Bitcoin’s price faced rejection at key technical trendlines, further stalling upward momentum. The absence of bullish catalysts and persistent outflows from institutional products has left Bitcoin vulnerable to deeper corrections should macroeconomic uncertainty persist. However, an upcoming project, Bitcoin Pepe , continues to see strong demand for its presale. The Bitcoin Pepe presale is on track to hit the $7 million mark soon. BTC bullish sentiments fading? According to Farside Investors, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $964 million in net outflows between March 28 and April 15. The persistent selling pressure emerged as global trade tensions heightened and recession fears deepened, draining liquidity from risk assets, including crypto. CryptoQuant noted on April 14 that ETF demand is decisively cooling. Its head of research, Julio Moreno, pointed to the Bull Score Index, a market health gauge for Bitcoin, which has stayed below 50 for 58 of the last 60 sessions — effectively confirming sustained weakness in market conviction. However, the ETFs have recorded two straight days of inflows. On Tuesday, US BTC ETFs saw a net inflow of around $76 million. Bitcoin Pepe presale shows no sign of slowing Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself as a major player in the intersection of meme culture and blockchain innovation. It is introducing the PEP-20 token standard, allowing investors to launch meme coins directly on the Bitcoin network. The presale of Bitcoin Pepe’s native token, BPEP, has already raised more than $6.7 million in just a few weeks, signaling strong investor interest. The presale is structured in 30 stages, each featuring a 5% price increase. Each successive presale stage has sold out faster than the last, with the most recent rounds closing in record time amid rising buy pressure. Since its launch, the price of BPEP has risen from $0.021 to $0.031 by stage 9, with the next stage expected to push the price to $0.0326. Early participants in the presale are already seeing a return of over 40%, with the token projected to hit $0.0864 by the end of the presale. The Bitcoin Pepe opportunity Bitcoin Pepe has managed to stand out in the crowded meme coin market, showing resilience despite the broader market’s challenges. While well-known meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe have faced significant declines, Bitcoin Pepe has sustained its upward momentum since its presale launch in mid-February, offering solid returns for early investors. The project’s potential exchange listing in the second quarter of 2025 could act as a significant catalyst for further price appreciation. Bitcoin Pepe is making history as the world’s first Bitcoin meme ICO, integrating meme culture directly into the Bitcoin ecosystem. As the first meme-focused Layer 2 solution on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe aims to combine the security of Bitcoin with the scalability akin to Solana, which could make it a game-changer in the crypto space.

Mantra had reserved 300 million OM tokens, that is about 16.88% of its total supply for its team and core contributors. The tokens were locked and were planned to be released in stages gradually between April 2027 and October 2029, as per a blog post from April 8. The team’s tokens are now worth about $236 million with OM trading at $0.78. However, before the crash on April 13, the tokens were worth around $1.89 billion. OM’s price saw a sharp drop from $6.30 to as low as $0.52, wiping out over $5.5 billion in value. Criticisms Over Token Burn Plan While some in the community members backed Mullin’s plan to burn the team tokens, others were worried that it could hurt the team’s motivation in the long run. Crypto Banter’s founder Ran Neuner noted that while the ‘incentive’ might seem like a good gesture, it could weaken the team’s drive to build the project. However Mullin suggested that the decision could be made through a community vote. This would be a mistake. We want teams that are highly incentivized. Burning the incentive may seem like a good gesture but it will hurt the team motivation long term. My suggestion; Just keep building. — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) April 15, 2025 A Post-Mortem Report To Be Released Mullin promised to release a post-mortem report of what went wrong in order to ensure transparency with the community. Mullin also shared plans to use Mantra’s $109 million Ecosystem Fund for the possible token buybacks and burns to help stabilize OM’s price after it crashed. MANTRA has all along denied any rumors that it controls 90% of the OM tokens or it was involved in insider trading or market manipulation. Instead it noted that the crash was due to ‘reckless liquidations’. Crypto exchanges Binance and OKX witnessed massive OM activity before the crash, but denied any wrongdoing. They pointed out to past tokenomics and extreme volatility that led to massive liquidations. Mullin also thanked the community for its support after the crash. He shared with the community that Mantra has weathered multiple market cycles and will keep building even through this one. He also addressed the losses faced by traders and also praised long-term investors like Shorooq Partners and Laser Digital for their continued support and openness with the community.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|OM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-16 11:39:33

Dual-Flow Investment Channels: Catering to both crypto traders and traditional investors, BiyaPay supports asset conversion across crypto and equity markets, enabling diversified portfolio management through a single interface.

Through seminars, online courses, and localized campaigns, BiyaPay aims to demystify blockchain technology for a broader audience and encourage long-term user participation.

Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, says in a new interview with David Lin that his target is based on an analysis of previous BTC cycles. Sigel cautions, however, that Bitcoin will need to get through the current “macro-driven” period of uncertainty to reach that $180,000 level. He says he’s been encouraged by the spike in interest he’s seen in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from traditional asset managers. “My inbound phone calls are up like 300% from investment advisers who were afraid to allocate to Bitcoin ETFs and now with the election and the change in administration, they’re much more open to discussing the investment case for Bitcoin.” The research analyst also shares his 2026/2027 outlook for the top crypto asset. “For those advisers taking a longer-term perspective, we benchmark Bitcoin against gold, specifically the 50% of the gold market that is more speculative in nature. So about half of gold goes into jewelry or industrial use cases, but putting that aside, if Bitcoin can reach the 50% of gold that’s speculative in nature, that would imply roughly $450,000 per coin.” BTC is trading at $83,900 at time of writing.

Wallets holding between 100,000 to 1,000,000 XRP have seen steadily declining balances since early April, coinciding with rising price volatility, according to April 15 on-chain data from crypto analytics platform Santiment . XRP whale transaction chart. Source: Santiment At XRP’s current price, the dumped tokens are valued at approximately $765 million. This large-scale sell-off may reflect a lack of confidence among major holders, fueling market uncertainty. Historically, reducing whale holdings typically increases selling pressure, suppressing upward momentum or triggering price corrections. Such a move might also spook retail investors to join the selling party. XRP price reaction Interestingly, the Santiment data also shows whale wallets declining during XRP’s rally, which has hit a monthly peak of $2.23, indicating distribution. Although the destination of these offloaded tokens remains unclear, the transactions align with recent heightened whale activity amid speculation around a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). Notably, Finbold reported that on April 15, one XRP whale moved over $60 million to Coinbase , hinting at further sell-side pressure. This follows another notable transfer, where Whale Alert flagged a shift of 131 million XRP (worth $273 million) between two unidentified wallets. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.08, down over 3% on the day, yet up 13% over the past week, holding above the key psychological level of $2. XRP seven-day price chart.

The South Korean crypto giant, Upbit , has just dropped an important announcement that could impact your SCR holdings. If you’re active on Upbit and deal with SCR tokens, you need to be aware of an upcoming change. Breaking: Upbit Announces SCR Deposit and Withdrawal Suspension In a recent announcement on their official website, Upbit , one of South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, stated they will be temporarily suspending deposits and withdrawals for the SCR token. This suspension is slated to begin on April 16th at 13:00 UTC . But why the sudden halt? Let’s dive into the details. Decoding the Suspension: Why is Upbit Halting SCR Transactions? The reason behind this temporary suspension is quite straightforward and actually positive for the SCR ecosystem in the long run. Upbit is taking this step to support the highly anticipated Scroll Mainnet Upgrade . Think of a mainnet upgrade as a significant software update for a blockchain network. It’s often implemented to improve performance, enhance security, or introduce new features. In this case, Scroll, the network associated with the SCR token, is undergoing a major upgrade to its main network. To ensure a smooth and secure transition during this upgrade, crypto exchanges like Upbit often temporarily suspend certain token activities. This precautionary measure prevents any potential disruptions or complications that could arise during the upgrade process, safeguarding user funds and ensuring the integrity of transactions. Key Takeaways: What You Need to Know About the Upbit SCR Suspension Let’s break down the essential points you need to be aware of: Exchange: Upbit (South Korean Crypto Exchange) Token Affected: SCR Action: Temporary Suspension of Deposits and Withdrawals Start Date & Time: April 16th, 13:00 UTC Reason: Support for Scroll Mainnet Upgrade Impact: You will not be able to deposit or withdraw SCR tokens on Upbit during the suspension period. Trading of SCR might still be available, but always check Upbit’s official announcements for complete information. It’s crucial to understand that this suspension is temporary . Once the Scroll Mainnet Upgrade is successfully completed and deemed stable, Upbit will likely resume SCR deposits and withdrawals. Keep an eye on Upbit’s official channels for updates on when services will be restored. Understanding the Scroll Mainnet Upgrade: What’s the Big Deal? So, what exactly is this Scroll Mainnet Upgrade that necessitates a suspension of SCR transactions? While specific technical details are usually provided by the Scroll team, mainnet upgrades generally aim to enhance the blockchain network in several key areas. These improvements can include: Scalability Enhancements: Making the network faster and capable of handling more transactions per second. This is crucial for the growth and wider adoption of any blockchain. Security Upgrades: Strengthening the network’s defenses against potential attacks and vulnerabilities, ensuring the safety of user assets. New Features and Functionality: Introducing new capabilities to the blockchain, which could open up new possibilities for developers and users. This might include smart contract improvements, new token standards, or enhanced privacy features. Improved Efficiency: Reducing transaction costs and energy consumption, making the network more environmentally friendly and economically viable. For the Scroll network and SCR token holders, a successful mainnet upgrade is a positive development. It signals the project’s commitment to continuous improvement and growth, potentially leading to increased utility and value for the SCR token in the future. Actionable Insights: What Should SCR Holders on Upbit Do? If you are holding SCR tokens on Upbit or plan to transact with SCR on the exchange, here’s what you should do: Note the Dates and Times: Mark April 16th, 13:00 UTC on your calendar. This is when the suspension begins. Plan Your Transactions: If you need to deposit or withdraw SCR, do it before the suspension time. If you try to initiate a transaction during the suspension, it will likely be rejected or delayed. Stay Updated: Regularly check Upbit’s official website and announcement channels for updates regarding the SCR suspension and the resumption of services. Consider Trading (with Caution): While deposits and withdrawals are suspended, trading of SCR might still be available on Upbit. However, be aware of potential price volatility that can sometimes occur during such periods of uncertainty. Always trade responsibly and do your own research. Long-Term View: Remember that this suspension is temporary and in support of a network upgrade that aims to improve the Scroll ecosystem. This is generally a positive sign for the long-term prospects of SCR. The Bigger Picture: Crypto Exchange Updates and Market Dynamics Updates like Upbit’s SCR suspension are common occurrences in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Crypto exchanges constantly need to adapt to blockchain upgrades, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. These updates, while sometimes causing short-term inconvenience, are crucial for the overall health and evolution of the crypto ecosystem. Staying informed about these updates is paramount for anyone involved in cryptocurrencies. It allows you to make informed decisions, manage your crypto assets effectively, and navigate the dynamic crypto landscape successfully. In Conclusion: Navigating Crypto Updates with Confidence Upbit’s temporary suspension of SCR deposits and withdrawals is a necessary step to facilitate the Scroll Mainnet Upgrade. While it might cause temporary adjustments for SCR holders on Upbit, it’s ultimately a move towards a more robust and improved Scroll network. By staying informed and taking appropriate action, you can navigate these crypto updates with confidence and continue to participate effectively in the exciting world of digital assets.

The dollar index slipped below the 100 mark, trading near three-year lows, also falling against nearly all Group-of-10 currencies in early London trading. According to the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, the dollar fell as much as 0.72% earlier in the day before trimming losses slightly to 0.55%. The decline comes after a brief uptick to 100.2 on Tuesday, its first gain in nearly a week. US investors jittery over trade war Rodrigo Catril, a strategist at National Australia Bank, says investors in the US market have taken exit positions on USD because the West’s economic situation is “uneasy.” “ All this uncertainty and talk of more tariffs is fueling the idea of de-risking from US assets, selling the dollar ,” he asserted. The sell-off was accelerated by new restrictions from the Trump administration on Nvidia Corp.’s chip exports to China, exacerbating the unsettlement from investors about supply chain disruptions. Scope Rating analysts led by Alvise Lennkh-Yunus warned that current tariff measures could trigger one of the largest peacetime trade shocks in modern history. “ Even their full reversal, though unlikely, would not fully restore the confidence of previous alliances and supply chains, indicating a degree of durable economic loss ,” the analysts noted. The Group of Seven (G7) nations, including Japan, the UK, France, and Germany, also have the world’s deepest banking linkages with the US. A dollar depreciation situation could be more dire for their economies than it would be for China. China holds meetings with Southeast Asia to battle US negotiations Meanwhile, President Xi Jinping headed to Southeast Asia to strengthen Beijing’s foothold through investment and infrastructure partnerships. On Wednesday, Xi met with Malaysia’s King Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, encouraging Chinese businesses to invest in the country. Xi told Malaysian officials that he supported importing more Malaysian agricultural products and accelerating joint ventures like the East Coast Rail Link. According to Chinese state media Xinhua, Xi reiterated the need to advance cooperation in artificial intelligence, the digital economy, and green development. The visit is Xi’s second stop in Southeast Asia this week, following a two-day trip to Vietnam. He arrived in Malaysia late Tuesday and was received by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Per Bloomberg’s report, he will move to Cambodia from Malaysia. Sultan Ibrahim stated via his official Facebook page that China-Malaysia cooperation has “great potential,” especially under China’s Belt and Road Initiative framework. Xi’s latest visit to Malaysia is his first since 2013, when the two nations upgraded ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Last year, they commemorated the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations and promised to deepen their economic and political cooperation. Washington is piling the pressure on these countries because they supposedly serve as intermediaries for Chinese exports to avoid tariffs. President Trump has threatened to employ more punitive measures, like import tax hikes, for those who do not comply. Xi asks Vietnam to help fight against ‘unilateral bullying’ In Vietnam, Xi met with Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam, asking the nation to join China in battling “unilateral bullying” from the US. “ We must strengthen strategic resolve and uphold the stability of the global free trade system as well as industrial and supply chains ,” he said. Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, analyzed Xi’s messaging as “a very shrewd tactical move.” “ While Trump seems determined to blow up the trade system, Xi is positioning China as the defender of rules-based trade while painting the US as a reckless rogue nation ,” Olson reckoned. President Trump, meanwhile, made brash comments during a press conference in the Oval Office on Monday about Xi’s meetings in Southeast Asia. “ That’s a lovely meeting. Meeting like trying to figure out, how do we screw the United States of America? ” Trump said. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to crypto analyst and market watcher Xaif , a staggering 7,010,000 XRP, worth several million dollars, was recently transferred to Bitso, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in Latin America. This substantial movement has sparked a wave of speculation across the digital asset space, with many wondering: Should investors be worried? Whale Activity and Market Implications Whale transactions—particularly those involving centralized exchanges —are often interpreted as potential sell signals. When large holders move tokens from cold wallets to exchanges, it may indicate an intent to liquidate holdings, thereby exerting downward pressure on price. While not always definitive, such movements tend to generate concern, especially during critical market junctures. The 7.01 million XRP transfer to Bitso, identified through on-chain data and flagged by Xaif on X, is significant both in magnitude and in its destination. Bitso is Ripple’s key partner in the Latin American corridor and plays a critical role in facilitating cross-border remittances through the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network. This adds an additional layer of complexity—could the transfer be operational rather than speculative? BREAKING A WHALE TRANSFERED 7,010,000 XRP TO BITSO EXCHANGE SHOULD WE BE WORRIED pic.twitter.com/6ujtrV8Vrv — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) April 16, 2025 Speculation vs. Strategic Movement Context is essential. While whales are known to move assets ahead of market downturns, not all transfers result in selling. Given Bitso’s role within Ripple’s ODL ecosystem, it’s plausible that this transaction may be tied to liquidity provisioning or corridor balancing rather than a direct sell-off. In this sense, the move might not reflect bearish intent, but operational realignment. Additionally, there has been no significant drop in XRP’s price in the immediate aftermath of the transfer. This suggests that, at least for now, the market has absorbed the information without panic. Still, it has reignited conversations about transparency, market manipulation, and how whale actions influence retail sentiment. Historical Context and Whale Behavior Historically, XRP has seen similar large transfers precede bullish and bearish outcomes, making it difficult to draw a straight line between whale movements and market direction. For instance, past whale activity in 2023 and early 2024 frequently preceded volatility spikes, though not always in a negative direction. In some cases, major inflows to exchanges were part of liquidity tests, token redistributions, or strategic partnerships. Moreover, XRP’s deep liquidity and broad exchange listings make it less vulnerable to the influence of a single whale than smaller-cap assets. That said, continued monitoring of Bitso wallets and other whale transactions will be key to understanding the real intent behind this movement. 131 Million XRP Makes Waves Elsewhere In another development , a more jaw-dropping movement of XRP tokens surfaced, capturing the attention of the broader crypto world. Blockchain monitoring service Whale Alert revealed a transaction involving 131 million XRP, valued at over $273 million. This massive transfer coincided with a 5.37% dip in XRP’s price over 24 hours, setting off a flurry of speculation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The transaction, which transferred funds between two unknown wallets, was initially mysterious. However, data from XRP-focused analytics provider Bithomp later confirmed that the receiving wallet is linked to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. This has led many to suspect the movement was likely part of internal fund reallocation or liquidity adjustments within Binance’s ecosystem, rather than a traditional whale dump. More Whale Sightings in the Same Week The 131 million XRP transfer was not an isolated event. Just days earlier, Whale Alert flagged another notable transaction involving 70 million XRP, worth over $150 million , that changed hands. Community speculation linked this move to Ripple’s internal payment systems. Adding to the intrigue, another 29.5 million XRP was moved to Coinbase, raising concerns of a large-scale sell-off. However, Bithomp again provided clarity, identifying it as an internal Coinbase transaction, effectively quelling fears of a market-impacting dump. Caution Over Panic Whether it’s the 7 million XRP moved to Bitso or the enormous 131 million XRP shifted elsewhere, one thing is clear: XRP whales are active, and their moves are being closely watched. However, not every large transaction signals doom or a bullish breakout. Some are operational, others are strategic, and many fall into a grey area. For investors, the key is to remain informed and cautious, but not reactive. In a maturing crypto economy, whale movements are not just market signals, they are also part of complex liquidity dynamics, internal restructurings, and ecosystem logistics. Eyes wide open, but feet on the ground—the mantra XRP holders may need to adopt as the digital asset world evolves.

The report suggests that Ethereum’s L2 blockchain networks — built to improve mainnet scalability and lower transaction costs — may be cannibalistic of the Ethereum base layer, negatively impacting the price of Ether ( ETH ). Ethereum’s dominance in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and fees generated is “under threat” by Solana and BNB Smart Chain, Binance Research wrote. Ethereum, Solana, BNB, DEX volume. Source: Binance Research The main factors include slow and expensive transactions, fragmented “developer mindshare and liquidity, and reduced value accrual to the L1 due to the rise of L2s,” the report said. Ethereum’s roadmap already includes future upgrades aimed at creating cheaper transactions, additional security, and more future-proof incentives for the mainnet. Still, Ether’s value accrual may continue to suffer in the near term since the next two major upgrades don’t immediately address these issues, but are aimed at creating more scalability around data availability and incorporating more L2 networks.

Ethereum’s Pectra, Fusaka upgrade won’t address Ether’s value accrual After initial delays , Ethereum’s highly anticipated Pectra upgrade is set to go live on the mainnet on May 7. The Pectra upgrade aims to improve Ether staking and L2 network scalability, increase blob capacity to enable more data handling on the mainnet and improve overall network capacity. The Fusaka upgrade, expected in late 2025, will focus on scaling the Ethereum mainnet as a data availability layer by introducing EIP-7594. Fusaka may also bring an update to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), resulting in a “more structured approach” to smart-contract creation, reducing runtime overhead and improving developer experience. Ethereum data capacity upgrades. Source: Binance Research Ethereum’s commitment to L2 scaling may be a “double-edged sword” due to concerns around the mainnet’s “competitiveness as a data availability layer” and “the sustainability of value accrual to Ethereum the asset,” the report said. Related: Ethereum shorter gains $1.1M on 50X leverage in 2 days “One promising path for stronger ETH value accrual is the development of based rollups,” which “contribute significantly more in fees” to Ethereum compared with L2s like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism, according to a Binance Research spokesperson. L2s, rollups by costs paid to Ethereum mainnet. Source: Binance Research “Another avenue is Ethereum’s evolving role as a data availability layer,” the spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding: “Value accrual through this model depends on external factors: L2s must continue to choose Ethereum for data availability, and blockspace demand must grow in a competitive landscape where alternatives like Solana and BNB Smart Chain are gaining traction.” “Aligning incentive structures between Ethereum and L2s, whether through fee sharing, MEV capture, or protocol-level integrations, will be essential to ensure sustainable value flow back to ETH as an asset should Ethereum continue to commit to scaling with L2s,” he added.

This interest is no doubt a good thing for the crypto market, especially in the long-term. But looking back at previous trends involving the Bitcoin open interest, it is concerning that the value is still so high and this could hinder a recovery for the Bitcoin price from here. Bitcoin Open Interest Still Above $56 Billion Data from the Coinglass website shows that the Bitcoin open interest is still quite high and not far off from its November 2024 highs after the BTC price hit a new peak above $109,000. This consistently high open interest signifies traders still taking considerable positions in the digital asset despite its price falling over 20% since then, something that could be a hindrance to recovery. Related Reading: Analyst Who Called Dogecoin Price Rally In 2024 Predicts 300% Rally In April The total Bitcoin open interest is currently sitting at $56.17 billion, falling approximately 22% from its all-time high of $71.85 billion. This shows a close correlation between how much the price has fallen compared to the open interest. However, the open interest remaining this high could have some negative implications for the BTC price and the crypto market by extension. For example, looking at the chart above, it is obvious that Bitcoin has seen its largest moves upward when the open interest has been low. This suggests that the lack of market pressure gives bulls the space to push the price upward. Hence, with the open interest still so high, it could be much harder to push the price higher. Given this, the BTC price could see further decline before there is more recovery from here. BTC Price Crash Below $70,000 Imminent? Besides the Bitcoin open interest remaining high, a crypto analyst has also given reasons why the BTC price could see a crash from here. The first factor given is the fake bullish divergence. According to the analysis, the RSI may be showing a bullish divergence but the price action isn’t following it. Hence, this could lead to a bull trap, pulling traders into losses as the price crashes. Related Reading: Is The XRP Price Mirroring Bitcoin’s Macro Action? Analyst Maps Out How It Could Get To $71 Another factor given is the fact that the Bitcoin price has broken a trendline support after falling to the low $80,000s. This suggests that bullish momentum is weakening and the recent recovery might not hold. Given the factors listed above, the crypto analyst expects the Bitcoin price to fall another 20% from here. The target is placed at $69,149, which is an all-time high from 2021. “This level coincides with the intersection of the mid-channel support line and horizontal price structure,” the analyst explains.

In an April 14 statement , the firm revealed it would seek shareholder approval on May 6 to formally adopt Bitcoin as its primary strategic asset, while maintaining its existing focus on cashback and financial technology services. From Cashback to Crypto The company emphasized that its core operations won’t be disrupted, but future Bitcoin acquisitions would be driven by operational cash flows. Meliuz also hinted at exploring new avenues to generate Bitcoin for shareholders—either through its regular business activities or through broader financial initiatives. For shareholders who may be hesitant about this strategic shift, the company is offering an exit option. Those who held shares before April 14 and do not support the proposed pivot will have the opportunity to request reimbursement, giving dissenting investors a formal path to opt out. Meliuz Stock Soars In the trading session following the announcement, the Meliuz stock (CASH3) jumped over 14%, rising from 3.28 to 3.76 Brazilian reals on the São Paulo Stock Exchange. Over the course of five days, shares have gained more than 27%, now trading at around 3.85 reals. The surge reflects growing investor optimism around Bitcoin’s adoption by publicly traded companies . Meliuz’s decision to test the waters came earlier this year in March, when its board greenlit the allocation of up to 10% of its cash reserves to Bitcoin. The firm acquired 45 BTC for approximately $4.1 million, making it one of 12 public companies to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets in Q1 2025. According to Bitwise, public companies collectively purchased 95,431 BTC during the first quarter of 2025, bringing the total corporate-held Bitcoin to around 688,000. Meliuz joins a growing list that includes video platform Rumble and MicroStrategy, which just added another 3,459 BTC for $285.5 million.

While mainstream coins capture most attention, hidden among the vast array of digital assets are lesser-known tokens with massive growth potential. This article reveals five such gems that could soar 1000 times in value before the halving changes the playing field. Investors seeking groundbreaking opportunities may find these underappreciated coins poised for significant returns. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price : $0.0001 Price Now : $0.003333 Next Stage : $0.005 Final Presale Price : $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $10 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! NEAR Protocol: The New Frontier for Decentralized Apps NEAR Protocol is making waves by helping developers create and launch decentralized applications more easily. It uses a technology called sharding to split the network’s workload, which boosts efficiency and allows for more transactions at once. Think of it like a decentralized version of big data storage systems, but without a central point of control. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, NEAR has caught the eye of major investors, raising over $20 million to fuel its growth. What sets NEAR apart are features like Nightshade, its sharding solution that enhances scalability, and the Rainbow Bridge, which lets users transfer tokens from Ethereum seamlessly. Then there’s Aurora, a Layer 2 solution that uses Ethereum’s tools to offer better performance with lower fees. In today’s market, scalability and lower transaction costs are big deals. NEAR’s focus on these areas puts it in a strong position, especially as more developers look for alternatives to networks with higher fees and slower speeds. While the crypto space is crowded with competitors, NEAR’s unique approach and solid backing make it a project worth keeping an eye on. Ondo Finance: Bringing Stable Yields to the Blockchain World Ondo Finance is changing how we think about money by blending the trust of traditional finance with the power of blockchain. They turn real-world assets that earn steady income, like government bonds, into digital tokens. This lets more people access top-quality financial products that were once only for a few. Ondo has two parts: a team that creates these tokenized products, and a tech team that builds tools to make their services better. In a crypto market where trust is a big issue, Ondo stands out. They work with well-known partners like BlackRock and use Coinbase for safe storage of digital assets. They focus on being open and following the rules, which helps build confidence. Their USDY coin is special—it stays stable and offers returns, backed by U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits. This is great for non-U.S. investors who want reliable, regulated options. Compared to other coins that can be unstable, Ondo offers a safer path with real-world backing. In today’s market, where people value stability, Ondo’s approach looks very attractive. HBAR and Hedera Hashgraph: A Faster, Greener Future for Crypto Hedera Hashgraph is forging a new path in decentralized networks. Unlike traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hedera uses hashgraph technology. This allows for faster transactions and greater efficiency. Without mining, it’s more environmentally friendly and offers lower transaction costs. HBAR, the native currency, covers transaction fees and secures the network through Proof of Stake. This setup promises a secure, fast, and cost-effective platform for transactions and smart contracts, appealing to finance and other sectors. In today’s market, HBAR looks attractive due to its innovative approach. Its advantages over traditional blockchains, like speed and sustainability, position it well as demand grows for better crypto options. While its patented technology might limit community involvement compared to open-source projects, Hedera’s backing by industry leaders could drive adoption. Compared to other coins, HBAR’s unique method might appeal to those seeking alternatives to blockchain limitations. As the crypto market evolves, Hedera Hashgraph could play a significant role, making it a platform to watch. Polygon’s POL: The Token Transforming Blockchain Engagement The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is a key asset in the Polygon network. It has many uses, making it important for anyone involved. One main function is staking. By locking up their tokens, holders help secure the network and earn rewards. This benefits both the user and the system. POL also plays a big role in governance. Holders can vote on proposals that shape the network’s future. This means the community has a say in how Polygon grows. Moreover, POL gives access to exclusive services and features within the ecosystem. This offers unique chances that others might not get. POL’s potential is linked to the success of Polygon. As more apps and services join, demand for POL may rise. This could increase its value. Compared to other tokens, POL is special because of its many uses and strong community support. In today’s market, where utility matters, POL seems attractive. With the crypto world changing, tokens like POL, offering real benefits, might draw more interest from users and investors. Conclusion While NEAR, ONDO, HBAR, and POL are promising, XYZVerse offers a unique, community-driven memecoin uniting sports fans, aiming for 20,000% growth and stands out even more.

If so, you need to pay attention to some potentially game-changing developments brewing in South Korea. Lawmakers are pushing for crypto regulation to rein in the wild west of speculative crypto chat rooms, and it could impact how you get your crypto advice. Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it means for you. Why the Sudden Focus on Crypto Regulation in South Korea? South Korea has always been a hotbed for cryptocurrency trading, boasting some of the highest adoption rates globally. This enthusiasm, however, has also attracted its fair share of speculative frenzy and potential market manipulation. To address these concerns and protect everyday investors, lawmakers are stepping up to introduce stricter rules. The current move is specifically targeted at those informal, often unregulated, chat rooms where investment advice and tips are shared – sometimes with questionable motives. The core issue? These chat rooms, often found on popular social media platforms, can easily become breeding grounds for pump-and-dump schemes, misinformation, and unqualified financial advice. Imagine joining a chat group hyped about a new altcoin, only to find out later that the ‘insider tips’ were orchestrated to inflate the price for a select few, leaving you holding the bag. This is exactly what South Korean regulators are trying to prevent. Virtual Asset User Protection Act: The Foundation for Change The proposed amendments are built upon the existing Virtual Asset User Protection Act , a piece of legislation already in place to safeguard crypto users. Think of this Act as the foundational law for crypto in South Korea. Now, lawmakers are looking to expand its reach and tighten its grip, specifically targeting the grey areas where speculative chat rooms operate. The goal is to bring these informal advisory spaces under the formal regulatory umbrella, ensuring a level playing field and greater investor protection. The proposed bill, spearheaded by Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) lawmakers, isn’t about stifling crypto innovation. Instead, it’s about fostering a healthier, more transparent, and safer crypto investment environment. Here’s a breakdown of what the amendments aim to achieve: Registration Requirement: Crypto chat rooms will need to register as ‘quasi-investment advisory businesses’ with the Financial Services Commission (FSC). This is a crucial step towards bringing these entities into the regulated financial system. Prohibition of Misleading Practices: Existing laws already prohibit practices like guaranteeing returns or promoting false profit rates. The amendments reinforce these prohibitions and extend them explicitly to crypto chat rooms. This aims to curb misleading and overly optimistic claims that can lure unsuspecting investors. Increased Oversight of Exchanges: Crypto exchanges will be required to report any changes to their terms and conditions to the FSC. This enhances transparency and allows regulators to monitor exchange practices more effectively, indirectly impacting the ecosystem around chat rooms as well. What Does Registration as a ‘Quasi-Investment Advisory Business’ Mean? This is a key aspect of the proposed crypto regulation . By requiring chat rooms to register, the FSC gains the authority to oversee their operations. Think of it like licensing for financial advisors, but tailored for the digital age. Registration would likely entail: Compliance with KYC/AML regulations: Knowing Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures would become mandatory. This helps prevent illicit activities and promotes accountability. Disclosure Requirements: Chat room operators might need to disclose information about their team, their investment strategies (if any), and potential conflicts of interest. Transparency is the name of the game here. Regular Reporting to the FSC: Registered entities may be required to submit periodic reports to the FSC, allowing for ongoing monitoring and compliance checks. Potential Audits and Inspections: The FSC would have the power to audit and inspect registered chat rooms to ensure they are adhering to regulations. Essentially, registration aims to professionalize the space and reduce the anonymity that can currently shield bad actors in crypto chat rooms . Impact on Crypto Exchanges in South Korea The amendments also include measures to increase oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges. Requiring exchanges to report changes in their terms and conditions to the FSC might seem like a minor detail, but it’s a significant step towards greater regulatory scrutiny. This increased oversight could lead to: More robust compliance frameworks: Exchanges will likely need to strengthen their internal compliance processes to ensure they are meeting reporting requirements and other regulatory obligations. Enhanced user protection policies: As regulators pay closer attention, exchanges might proactively improve their user protection policies to avoid potential penalties and maintain a positive public image. A more level playing field: Stricter regulations, applied consistently, can help create a fairer and more stable market environment for all participants. While these measures are not directly targeting exchanges’ core trading operations, they contribute to a broader environment of increased crypto regulation and accountability within the South Korean crypto ecosystem. Challenges and Potential Pushback Implementing these new regulations won’t be without its challenges. Here are a few potential hurdles: Defining ‘Speculative Crypto Chat Rooms’: Clearly defining what constitutes a ‘speculative crypto chat room’ for regulatory purposes could be tricky. Where do you draw the line between a casual community discussion forum and a quasi-investment advisory service? Enforcement Challenges: Policing online chat rooms, especially those operating across different platforms and potentially anonymously, can be technically and logistically complex. Effective enforcement will be crucial for the success of these regulations. Potential for Over-regulation: There’s always a risk that regulations could become overly burdensome, stifling innovation and driving activity underground or offshore. Finding the right balance is key. Industry Pushback: Some chat room operators and potentially even crypto exchanges might resist these new regulations, arguing they are unnecessary or overly intrusive. Navigating potential pushback and ensuring industry buy-in will be important. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors in South Korea (and Beyond) Regardless of where you are in the world, the South Korean move towards tighter crypto regulation on chat rooms offers some valuable lessons: Be Skeptical of Unsolicited Investment Advice: Treat any investment advice you receive in unregulated online chat rooms with a healthy dose of skepticism. Always do your own research and never invest solely based on tips from anonymous sources. Seek Qualified Financial Advice: If you need investment guidance, consult with registered and qualified financial advisors. Don’t rely on unregulated online communities for critical financial decisions. Understand the Regulatory Landscape: Stay informed about the evolving regulatory landscape in your jurisdiction and in key crypto markets like South Korea. Regulations are changing, and it’s important to be aware of how they might affect your crypto activities. Support Responsible Regulation: Advocate for sensible and balanced crypto regulations that protect investors without stifling innovation. Engage in constructive dialogue with policymakers and industry stakeholders. Conclusion: A Step Towards a More Mature Crypto Market? South Korea’s push for tighter crypto regulation of speculative chat rooms is a significant development. It reflects a growing global trend towards bringing the crypto space under greater regulatory oversight. While challenges remain, these amendments signal a commitment to creating a more secure and transparent environment for crypto investors in South Korea . Whether this move will successfully curb speculative excesses and protect investors remains to be seen, but it’s undoubtedly a step towards a more mature and regulated crypto market.

The analyst emphasized the timing of the transfer, stating, “Something significant is unfolding behind the scenes before April 16, a crucial date for the SEC and Ripple!” The large-scale transaction, tracked by Whale Alert , has attracted significant attention due to its timing and potential connection to a key legal development anticipated in the ongoing dispute between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BREAKING: 70,000,000 #XRP worth $150,361,090 has been transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet! Something significant is unfolding behind the scenes before April 16, a crucial date for the SEC and Ripple! pic.twitter.com/PlNMwKtgpB — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) April 15, 2025 April 16: A Date of Legal Expectation The XRP community had widely anticipated a court filing by Ripple on April 16, which would have addressed the SEC’s appeal of Judge Analisa Torres’ 2023 ruling . That ruling concluded that XRP sales on public exchanges did not violate securities laws. Ripple was expected to challenge the SEC’s appeal of the public sales portion of the ruling. Case Paused Amid Settlement Talks Despite expectations, legal analyst Fred Rispoli clarified that there was only a 10 percent chance that a filing would occur on April 16. He explained that the case is currently being handled across two courts, and no updates can proceed in the district court until the appeal is either withdrawn or resolved through a settlement. The pause in proceedings, also noted by X user Alessandro, is due to a mutual agreement between the SEC and Ripple to suspend the appellate process while settlement discussions continue. This status was confirmed by earlier reports from Times Tabloid. SEC Appeal Withdrawal Signals Shift in Strategy While no filing has been made so far, April 16 remains significant due to its role in highlighting the current state of the case and the potential for a near-term resolution. The SEC’s withdrawal indicates a possible recalibration of its approach to digital asset regulation and could signal more favorable conditions for Ripple moving forward. JackTheRippler’s observation of the 70 million XRP transfer underscores how closely major holders and analysts monitor the case’s progress and how it could be linked to certain transactions.

The move aims to rebuild the project’s reputation and the value of the native token. John Mullin, the CEO of Mantra (OM), announced he is considering a wider token burn platform to cause deflation and revive the token’s value. Mullin clarified he is ready to burn his own portion of the team token allocation. To be 100% clear, I am stating that I am burning MY team tokens, and we will create a comprehensive burn program for other parts of the OM supply. https://t.co/Yy6GzRBbM8 — JP Mullin (🕉, 🏘️) (@jp_mullin888) April 16, 2025 In the initial burn, the rest of the team will retain their tokens. The project’s core contributors hold 16.6% of the supply. The biggest weight comes from legacy OM, currently vested in a special wallet. Mullin announced the terms of the burn are to be negotiated, but he will strive for a maximum amount. OM has a circulating supply above 1.8B tokens and no cap on the total supply. The burn will have to tweak the tokenomics in a way to reassure holders of the value of OM. The token is mostly used for staking, as well as to secure the positions of the Mantra chain’s 29 validators. After the market crash, Mantra DAO has not moved any OM to the market. Currently, Mantra DAO holds 95.52M OM, after moving 23.54K tokens for staking. OM has still not recovered from its 90% collapse and trades at a lower range of $0.77. Trading volumes are picking up again, at $1.7B in 24 hours, following a previous stagnation at $69M in 24 hours. The heightened trading activity after the price drop suggests some confidence is left for MANTRA, and buyers may be hoping for a recovery. The team has also not given any signs of shutting down the project. The OM token fell after on-chain signs of insider selling. Early investors sold a relatively small amount of OM, but enough to cause a panic and drive centralized exchanges to quickly close positions. Can Mantra rebuild OM’s value? After the crash , OM trades at $1.4B in total valuation. Some of the price predictions suggest the token may return to a valuation of $2B. OM hopes for a recovery to $2, as the project claims the price crash was not a deliberate rug pull. | Source: Coingecko The most recent price moves also sparked hopes of OM returning to $2. Mantra Chain’s team is still preparing for a detailed report on why OM crashed, and how to avoid similar events in the future. What is known is that the team and early investors sold $43M OM during a low-liquidity weekend. Unlike previous periods, there was no effort to defend the price or inject additional liquidity. Currently, Mullin has not given additional evidence of burning tokens or a deadline for changing the project’s tokenomics. The main claim of Mantra’s team is that the crash is nothing like the crisis of Terra (LUNA), as Mantra did not have a stablecoin or any other way to boost value. The OM crash was simply due to a lack of liquidity, which led to doubts that the price was not organic and was most likely reflecting the effect of market makers.

Decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators seem to be all the rage in DeFi today. These entities, which source liquidity from multiple DEXs to optimize trading conditions, aim to bolster prices for consumers by lowering fees and reducing slippage. According to recent data, total trading value of DEX aggregators has grown to $2.03 billion as of February 2025. It is a sector in crypto that many are eyeing for future growth. One of these DEX aggregators, 1inch, sat down with crypto.news on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week to discuss the challenges and opportunities for DEX aggregators in the current crypto cycle. 1inch, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, was founded in May 2019 by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov, two Russian developers who met at a hackathon and turned their knack for optimizing crypto trades into a DeFi powerhouse. The platform now optimizes trades across 400+ liquidity sources on 12 blockchains, processing over $500 billion in volume as of today, with zero withdrawal and gas fees offered by its native Chi token. Co-founder of 1inch , Sergej Kunz, told crypto.news how the firm is aiming to make the jump from the decentralized finance sector into the crypto space by offering users a seamless cross-chain experience that rivals that of centralized exchanges , with a strong focus in the next quarter on DeFi growth and backing entities like Bitcoin and Solana, better UX, and features that aim to bolster and leverage AI, with the goal of using this to aggregate media into a seamless technological umbrella a new super-powered 1inch. “It’s getting better and better. I think we will see in a couple of years a seamless experience like in centralized exchanges with the benefits of non-custody and atomic execution,” said Kunz to crypto.news at a cafe in Paris on April 16. In the Wild West of DeFi, Atomic execution refers to the process where a transaction is executed in its entirety or not at all, ensuring no partial completion. This guarantees that all parts of a trade, such as swapping tokens across multiple DEXs, occur simultaneously and are only finalized if all conditions (e.g., price and liquidity) are met, preventing losses from failed or partial trades, including MEV bots that sandwich transactions and extract fees from crypto users. With 1inch, Kunz explained, new features now allow routes to trade through multiple DEXs to optimize pricing, with atomic execution ensuring the entire swap completes as a single, indivisible transaction on the blockchain. If any part fails (e.g., insufficient liquidity), the transaction reverts, and no funds are exchanged. As a DEX aggregator, 1inch ( 1INCH ) sources liquidity from multiple DEXs to find the most favorable rates for a single trade. The firm uses a smart contract-based system that enables users to swap between tokens and set their desired price. “We came to the idea that we have this intent-based protocol to just say what they want to get and how it’s going to be executed is the bread of market makers and market traders,” said Kunz. “We extended this functionality with cross-chain swaps. And now, we are a cross chain marketplace for all users,” he continued. The total trading value of DEX aggregators was over $2.03 billion as of February 2025, reflecting their growing role in DeFi, while the market capitalization of DEX aggregator coins was $2.5 billion as on January of this year. Top coins include Jupiter, 1inch, and Cetus Protocol, but others are nipping at the heels of these competitors, given the potential for enormous growth if assets like securities are able to be traded on-chain. To this end, Kunz says that to standout he has launched Fusion+, an advanced upgrade to 1inch’s Swap Engine. The idea with Fusion+ is to create more efficient cross-chain swaps to get better rates through intent based architecture and bridge less technology. The technology aims to connect user to extensively more Web3 liquidity, but also to protect against front-running attacks like MEV with more security features that gets the best price for Chi users. So far, Fusion+ has facilitated over $200 million in cross-chain trading volume, Kunz says, noting that since its beta launch last September integrations like ZKsync have boosted overall performance and security. You might also like: 1inch and Linea join forces to improve swap rates and liquidity in DeFi Today, he says that 1inch is prioritizing cross-chain integration in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana (SOL), with the idea to allow users more interoperability across popular cryptocurrency options. Right now, there are now EVM-compatible solutions for bridging Bitcoin to Ethereum without wrapping the BTC, and this poses several significant hurdles for those wanting to deploy capital cross chain. Integrating these coins, which operate on their own non-EVM blockchain, still presents several technical challenges due to differences in blockchain architecture. These hurdles limit Bitcoin’s utility in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, where over $100 billion in TVL (as of April 2025) is concentrated in EVM chains. Bitcoin holders face friction when attempting to use BTC in yield farming, lending, or trading on platforms like Aave, Compound, or 1inch. And the reliance on wrapped tokens means BTC remains a secondary asset in DeFi, with most activity centered on Ethereum-native tokens or stablecoins, with developers building cross-chain dApps (e.g., 1inch, as discussed previously) must integrate multiple BTC variants (WBTC, tBTC) or bridges, increasing complexity and maintenance costs. Still, 1inch also has their sights set on conquering the traditional finance sector by partnering with banks and other financial institutions to deploy DeFi technology and bring more players on-chain. The idea according to Kunz is to open up the floodgates for institutional adoption of cryptocurrency, but in a way that is DeFi native. “Self custody is our value proposition as well as atomic execution. We plan to expand to TradFi. From our point of view, TradFi needs to adapt for us. It is not us that has to be able to adapt to TradFi, in terms of technology because our technology is unique,” said Kunz. Kunz also views security as a major hurdle. He explained how the 1inch team is aiming to solve security issues by integrating anti-money laundering procedures and know-your customer procedures, which may open the doors to greater institutional interest. “We have a service that aggregates other security services who monitor all the wallets who funds, launder funds. And who move funds from central wallets, and we decline the interaction for APIs at 1inch lab for such wallets,” Kunz said of the current security architecture 1inch maintains. You might also like: Ross Ulbricht-linked wallets lost $12m in meme coin blunder Will 1inch venture into real-world asset tokenization? With the rise of real-world asset tokenization , Sergej Kunz sees the sector as a natural second step within 1inch’s roadmap for expansion. In the next five to ten years, he predicts that people will be able to trade traditional stocks and other conventional securities on-chain. Soon, Kunz believes, traders will be able to retain non-custody on these assets in a way that transcends regional boundaries and builds on atomic execution. According to a recently published joint report by Ripple and BCG, the market size for asset tokenization has the potential to hit $18.9 trillion in 2033. At the moment, the market size for tokenized asset stands at $600 billion, with major expansion predicted by experts who see on-chain, trade-able stocks as the natural evolution of fin-tech. In light of this potential for major growth, Kunz worries about a lack of secondary markets for tokenization of real-world assets, despite DeFi being a burgeoning sector of the crypto ecosystem, not many advanced secondary markets exist for niche tradable assets. “There’s no single place where you can wait for the best execution, and that’s where 1inch comes in. That’s what we’re building. The potential is huge.” Read more: Ripple and BCG report: Global asset tokenization could reach $18.9t by 2033",News|1INCH|asset tokenization|DEX|interoperability,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-16 12:10:58

Recent data reveals a concerning trend in the U.S. spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF market. On April 15th, these investment vehicles experienced a significant combined net outflow of $14.2 million. This marks the sixth consecutive day of investors pulling funds out, raising eyebrows and sparking discussions about the current sentiment surrounding Ethereum and the broader crypto market. Let’s dive deeper into what’s happening and what it could mean for you. Decoding Ethereum ETF Outflows: What’s Behind the $14.2M Exit? The latest figures from Farside Investors paint a clear picture: investors are withdrawing from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs . A total of $14.2 million was pulled out on April 15th alone. This continuous outflow over nearly a week suggests more than just a temporary blip. But what factors could be contributing to this trend? Let’s break down the key players and the numbers: Grayscale’s ETHE Leads the Charge (Downwards): Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) experienced the most significant withdrawals, with a staggering $10.6 million in outflows. This highlights the continued pressure on ETHE, which has been converting from a trust to an ETF. Fidelity’s FETH Follows Suit: Fidelity’s Spot ETH ETF , FETH, also saw notable outflows, registering $3.6 million in withdrawals. While less than ETHE, this still contributes to the overall negative trend. Rest of the Pack Stays Put: Interestingly, the remaining U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs reported no change in their holdings on April 15th. This suggests that the outflows are concentrated in specific ETFs, particularly Grayscale and Fidelity. ETF Net Outflow (April 15) Grayscale (ETHE) $10.6 million Fidelity (FETH) $3.6 million Other ETFs No Change Total Net Outflow $14.2 million Spot ETH ETF Performance: A Broader Perspective While a single day’s outflow might seem like noise, six consecutive days of withdrawals raises valid concerns. To understand the significance of these Ethereum ETF outflows , it’s crucial to look at the bigger picture. Are these outflows indicative of a broader market trend, or are they specific to Ethereum ETFs? Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Price swings in Ethereum and Bitcoin can significantly influence investor sentiment and ETF flows. Recent market fluctuations could be prompting investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets like crypto ETFs. Profit Taking: Following periods of price appreciation, some investors might be taking profits from their Crypto ETF Investment , leading to outflows. It’s important to analyze the market context to see if this aligns with recent price movements. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, such as interest rate hikes or inflation concerns, can also impact investment decisions. Investors might be reallocating capital to different asset classes based on macroeconomic outlooks. Grayscale ETHE Conversion Impact: The ongoing conversion of Grayscale’s ETHE from a trust to an ETF has been a complex process. Some investors who initially held ETHE in its trust form might be re-evaluating their positions now that it’s an ETF, potentially leading to outflows. The higher fees associated with ETHE compared to newer ETFs might also be a contributing factor. Grayscale ETHE: Why the Continued Outflow? The consistent and significant outflows from Grayscale’s ETHE warrant a closer look. As mentioned earlier, the transition from a trust to an ETF is a key factor. However, there are other elements at play: Higher Fee Structure: ETHE has a relatively higher management fee compared to newer spot Spot ETH ETF offerings from competitors like BlackRock and Fidelity. Investors sensitive to fees might be shifting their holdings to ETFs with lower expense ratios. Early Investor Profit Taking: Investors who held ETHE in its trust form for a long time may now be realizing profits after the ETF conversion unlocked redemption possibilities. Market Competition: The emergence of numerous competing spot Ethereum ETFs provides investors with more choices. Some may be diversifying or consolidating their holdings into newer, potentially more attractive ETF options. Ethereum Price and ETF Flows: Is There a Correlation? The price of Ethereum Price and the flows into and out of Ethereum ETFs are likely interconnected. Let’s explore this potential relationship: Price Drops Can Trigger Outflows: When the price of Ethereum declines, investors may become concerned and sell their ETF holdings to mitigate potential losses, leading to outflows. Outflows Can Exacerbate Price Drops: Conversely, significant outflows from ETFs can put downward pressure on the price of Ethereum itself, as ETF providers may need to sell ETH to meet redemptions. Positive Price Action Can Attract Inflows: Conversely, if the price of Ethereum starts to rise, it could attract new investors to Crypto ETF Investment , resulting in inflows into Ethereum ETFs. It’s a complex interplay, and while correlation doesn’t equal causation, monitoring both Ethereum Price movements and ETF flows can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. Navigating Crypto ETF Investment: Actionable Insights So, what does this mean for investors interested in Crypto ETF Investment ? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on ETF flow data, particularly for Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs. Track daily and weekly net flows to gauge market sentiment. Understand ETF Fee Structures: Compare the expense ratios of different ETFs. Lower fees can make a significant difference in long-term returns. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto investments across different assets and strategies. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Crypto markets are volatile. Focus on your long-term investment goals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Do Your Research: Before investing in any ETF, thoroughly research its holdings, management team, and track record. Conclusion: Decoding the Crypto Signals The $14.2 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs is a signal worth paying attention to. While it’s crucial not to jump to conclusions based on a single data point, the sixth consecutive day of withdrawals suggests a potential shift in investor sentiment. Whether this is a temporary correction, profit-taking, or a reaction to broader market conditions remains to be seen. For investors, staying informed, understanding market dynamics, and maintaining a long-term perspective are key to navigating the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency investments.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) is currently trading at $0.00001157, which is within a historically significant support zone around the $0.00001150–$0.00001250. This level has been tested multiple times and acted as major support throughout the consolidation phase between August to September last year, suggesting it’s an important line of defense for buyers. Even though the overall trend is still bearish, with SHIB price trading below all key moving averages, momentum indicators reflect a slight cooling of bearish pressure . The Relative Strength Index is hovering around 42.81, neither oversold nor strong, suggesting weak bearish momentum but also room for recovery. RSI has also been flat-lining, which often precedes a bounce—especially when paired with key support. The MACD histogram is flat, indicating that selling pressure may be losing steam. A break above the $0.00001212–$0.00001270 resistance cluster, which includes the 20-day EMA and approaches the 50-day SMA, would be the first meaningful signal of strength. This range previously acted as support multiple times last year, particularly between August and October, before it broke and flipped into resistance, making it a key support-turned-resistance area. Once this is cleared, it opens the door toward the $0.00001545 area (100-day SMA) as the next upside target.

The price also recently made a higher high and tried to reclaim 20-day Exponential Moving Average ($2.1039) and even briefly tested the 50-day Simple Moving Average ($2.2375), signaling a possible breakout effort. It also recently bounced from the 200-day SMA (at $1.9118) in a strong bullish move on April 9, marked by a large bullish candle accompanied by a notable spike in volume on that day. The MACD line has also recently crossed above the signal line, with the histogram flipping green — an early bullish momentum signal. The RSI is at 46.92, which isn’t yet overbought, meaning there’s plenty room for the upside. A close above $2.14–$2.23 (the 20 EMA and 50 SMA cluster) would reinforce bullish intent and potentially trigger further upside toward $2.48 (100 SMA). Similarly, analyst @Dom noted in an April 13 post on X that “$2.20 is now the only objective here,” adding that a decisive breakout above this level could pave the way for a move toward $2.50.

Europe ‘s crypto industry is entering a major shake-up under the new MiCA regime, and as the blockchain forensic firm TRM Labs puts it, not all crypto business — also known as crypto asset service providers or CASPs — will make the transition. In a blog post , the analysts suggested that some firms are expected to shut down, while others are likely to merge in search of scale. MiCA officially came into force on Dec. 31, 2024. The regulation aims to replace the previously fragmented approach with a single set of rules for all 27 EU member states. As of April 15, only 17 crypto businesses had received authorization under MiCA across seven EU countries, according to the European Securities and Markets Authority, the report reads. Another 15 entities were listed as non-compliant, all reported by Italy’s securities regulator. “MiCA aims to replace this patchwork with a single, harmonized rulebook. All CASPs seeking to operate in the EU must now go through a standardized authorization process — raising the bar for compliance and clarity.” TRM Labs You might also like: Ethena Labs exits Germany, abandons MiCA license effort TRM Labs notes that’s a small number compared to the over 3,000 crypto firms previously registered across the EU before MiCA.

Now, those firms must go through a standard approval process to continue operating, the analysts suggest, adding that existing firms may benefit from “grandfathering provisions” depending on their country. While it’s still might be too early to call which countries will emerge as the leading destinations for authorization, TRM Labs pointed out that the first quarter of 2025 already showed signs of a smaller, more regulated market taking shape.

Matthew Sigel pitched the concept of “BitBonds” — US Treasury bonds with exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC ) — at the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Summit 2025 on April 15. The new 10-year bonds would be composed of 90% US traditional debt and 10% BTC exposure, Sigel said, appealing to both the US Treasury and global investors. Even in a scenario where Bitcoin “goes to zero,” BitBonds would allow the US to save money to refinance the estimated $14 trillion of debt that will mature in the next three years and will need to be refinanced, he said. Bitcoin to boost investor demand for T-bonds “Interest rates are relatively high versus history. The Treasury must maintain continued investor demand for bonds, so they have to entice buyers,” Sigel said during the virtual event. Meanwhile, bond investors want protection from the US dollar inflation and asset inflation, which makes Bitcoin a good fit for being a component of the bond, as the cryptocurrency has emerged as an inflation hedge . An excerpt from Matthew Sigel’s presentation on Bitbonds at the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Summit 2025. Source: Matthew Sigel With the proposed structure and a 10-year term, a BitBond would return a “$90 premium, along with whatever value that Bitcoin contains,” Sigel stated, adding that investors would receive all the Bitcoin gains up to a maximum annualized yield to maturity of 4.5%. “If Bitcoin gains are big enough to provide that above a 4.5% annualized yield, the government and the bond buyer split the remaining gains 50 over 50,” the exec said. Upsides and downsides Compared to standard bonds, the proposed 10-year BitBonds would offer the investor substantial gains in a scenario where Bitcoin gains exceed the break-even rates, Sigel said. A downside, however, is that Bitcoin must attain a “relatively high compound annual growth rate” on lower coupon rates in order for the investor to break even, he added. Source: Matthew Sigel From the government’s perspective, if they are able to sell the bond at a coupon of 1%, the government will save money “even if Bitcoin goes to zero,” Sigel estimated, adding: “The same thing if the coupon is sold at 2%, Bitcoin can go to zero, and the government still saves money versus the current market rate of 4%. And it’s in these 3% to 4% coupons where Bitcoin has to work in order for the government to save money. Previous BitBonds pitches to the government While the idea of crypto-backed government bonds is not new, Sigel’s BitBond pitch follows a similar proposal by the Bitcoin Policy Institute in March. The BPI estimates the program could generate potential interest savings of $70 billion annually and $700 billion over a 10-year term. Treasury bonds are debt securities issued by the government to investors who loan money to the government in exchange for future payouts at a fixed interest rate.

Bitcoin's (BTC) recovery rally has stalled since Sunday, raising the risk of a bearish shift in key indicators. Since Sunday, the $86,000 mark has emerged as a resistance and supply zone, with bulls failing to keep gains above that level. The elusive breakout has raised the risk of a bearish realignment in key momentum indicators – the 50, 100- and 200-hour simple moving averages (SMA). The three averages stacked one below the other and trending south represent the bearish alignment. The 50- and 100-hour SMAs have peaked and appear on track to produce a bearish crossover that will see the former move below the latter. While the cryptocurrency's price remains above the 200-hour SMA, the impending bear cross of the other two SMAs indicates that sellers are looking to reassert themselves. Additionally, the daily chart MACD histogram has stopped printing successively higher bars above the zero line, reflecting a loss of upward momentum to support the notion of potential bearish developments in the market. All this, when viewed against the backdrop of downward trending 50- and 100-day SMAs, calls for caution on the part of the bulls. A move below $83K, the hourly chart support, would validate the bearish developments, potentially yielding a sell-off toward the recent lows near $75K.

43406846,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149835,1744806354,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding Asia FX Surge: Tariff Uncertainty & China’s Crucial Q1 GDP Data,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-tariff-china-gdp/,"Navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency often means keeping a close watch on global financial markets. And right now, all eyes are on Asia FX as it shows signs of life, buoyed by a wave of optimism. But beneath the surface, tariff uncertainty casts a long shadow, potentially capping these gains. Adding to the mix is the highly anticipated China Q1 GDP data, a critical indicator that could sway market sentiment dramatically. Let’s dive deep into what’s driving these Forex trends and what it means for you. Decoding Asia FX’s Recent Rise: What’s Fueling the Optimism? Asian currencies have shown impressive resilience recently, climbing against major global currencies. This positive momentum is fueled by several factors, creating a sense of cautious optimism in emerging markets . But what exactly is behind this upward trend? Easing Inflationary Pressures: Across several Asian economies, there are signs that inflation may be starting to cool down. This is crucial because it reduces pressure on central banks to aggressively hike interest rates, which can stifle economic growth and currency appreciation. Anticipation of Dovish Central Banks: Following global trends, there’s growing speculation that some Asian central banks might adopt a less hawkish stance on monetary policy in the near future. This expectation alone can boost investor confidence and attract capital into the region, strengthening local currencies. Positive Economic Indicators (Beyond China): While China’s GDP is a major focal point, other Asian economies have also released encouraging data in sectors like manufacturing and exports. This broad-based improvement contributes to a more positive outlook for the entire region. Geopolitical Stability (Relatively Speaking): Compared to other regions grappling with intense geopolitical tensions, Asia has experienced relative stability recently. This perceived safety net can make Asian assets more attractive to international investors seeking refuge from volatility elsewhere. However, it’s not all smooth sailing. The path ahead for Asia FX is riddled with potential roadblocks, most notably the ever-present threat of tariffs. The Shadow of Tariff Uncertainty: Why Gains Could Be Capped Just as Asian currencies begin to breathe a sigh of relief, the specter of tariff uncertainty looms large. Trade tensions, particularly involving major global economies, can quickly unravel positive momentum and trigger significant currency fluctuations. Here’s why this uncertainty is such a critical factor: Trade Wars and Currency Devaluation: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. When countries impose tariffs on each other’s products, it can escalate into trade wars. In such scenarios, nations may resort to currency devaluation to make their exports cheaper and more competitive, leading to a downward spiral for their currencies. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs disrupt established global supply chains. Businesses face increased costs and uncertainty, which can lead to reduced investment and economic slowdown, ultimately weakening currencies in affected regions like emerging markets . Investor Risk Aversion: Trade disputes and tariff hikes breed uncertainty and fear in the markets. Investors tend to become risk-averse, pulling their capital out of perceived risky assets like Asia FX and flocking to safe-haven currencies like the US dollar or Japanese Yen. Impact on Export-Oriented Economies: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on exports. Tariffs directly impact their export competitiveness, potentially leading to trade deficits, reduced economic growth, and currency depreciation. To better understand the potential impact, consider this hypothetical scenario: Scenario Impact on Asia FX Contributing Factors Increased Global Trade Tensions & Tariff Hikes Negative: Currencies likely to depreciate Escalating trade war rhetoric, new tariff announcements, breakdown in trade negotiations. Resolution of Trade Disputes & Tariff Reductions Positive: Currencies likely to appreciate Successful trade negotiations, easing of trade tensions, removal of existing tariffs. Status Quo – Existing Tariff Levels Maintained Neutral to Slightly Negative: Gains capped, limited appreciation potential Ongoing trade uncertainty, tariffs remain in place, but no new escalations. China Q1 GDP in Focus: The Make-or-Break Data Point Amidst the push and pull of positive momentum and tariff uncertainty , China’s Q1 GDP data emerges as a pivotal event. As the world’s second-largest economy and a major trading partner for most Asian nations, China’s economic health has a profound ripple effect on Asia FX and global markets. Why is this GDP data so crucial? Indicator of Regional Economic Health: China’s GDP growth serves as a bellwether for the broader Asian economic landscape. Strong GDP growth in China often translates to increased demand for goods and services from its Asian neighbors, boosting their economies and currencies. Impact on Commodity Prices: China is a massive consumer of commodities. Strong GDP growth typically leads to increased commodity demand, driving up prices. Commodity-exporting Asian nations benefit from higher commodity prices, which strengthens their currencies. Investor Sentiment and Capital Flows: China’s GDP data significantly influences global investor sentiment. Positive GDP figures can attract foreign investment into China and the wider Asian region, boosting Asia FX . Conversely, weak GDP data can trigger capital outflows and currency depreciation. Policy Implications: The GDP data will inform China’s economic policy decisions. Strong growth might lead to a continuation of existing policies, while weak growth could prompt stimulus measures. These policy shifts can have a significant impact on market expectations and currency valuations. Actionable Insights for Navigating Asia FX in the Current Climate So, what does all of this mean for you? Navigating the Forex trends in Asia FX requires a nuanced approach, considering both the upside potential and the downside risks. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on Trade Developments: Keep a close watch on news related to international trade negotiations and tariff policies, particularly those involving major economies. These developments can trigger rapid shifts in market sentiment and currency valuations. Monitor China’s Economic Data Closely: Beyond the headline GDP figure, pay attention to other key Chinese economic indicators such as industrial production, retail sales, and purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs). These data points provide a more comprehensive picture of China’s economic health and its potential impact on Asia FX . Diversify Your Portfolio: Given the uncertainties, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes and currencies to mitigate risk. Consider Currency Hedging Strategies: If you have significant exposure to Asia FX , explore currency hedging strategies to protect your portfolio from potential adverse currency movements due to tariff uncertainty or unexpected economic data. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with financial advisors or Forex market experts who can provide tailored guidance based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives. They can help you interpret complex market signals and make informed decisions. Conclusion: A Balancing Act of Hope and Caution in Asia FX Markets Asia FX currently presents a fascinating paradox. There’s a palpable sense of optimism fueled by easing inflation and positive economic signals, leading to a welcome surge in some currencies. However, the ever-present tariff uncertainty acts as a significant headwind, potentially limiting these gains. The upcoming China Q1 GDP data is a crucial litmus test that will likely set the tone for Forex trends in the region for the near future. For investors and market participants, navigating this landscape requires a delicate balancing act – embracing the potential for growth while remaining vigilant about the risks. Staying informed, adaptable, and prepared for volatility will be paramount to success in the dynamic world of emerging markets and Asia FX .
