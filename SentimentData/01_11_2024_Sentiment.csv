At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading with a 0.07% gain in the past 30 days, which reveals the current consolidation situation it finds itself under. However, according to a technical analysis on TradingView, the Ethereum price could be well on its way to reaching a new all-time high after 12 weeks of consolidation. Ethereum Price Completes Bottom Formation According to a technical analysis of the Ethereum price in the weekly candlestick timeframe, the cryptocurrency is currently in its 12th week of consolidation after a decline that ended in the first week of August. Interestingly, analysis reveals that the consolidation is at the bottom of the lower trendline in a Channel Up trend in the weekly timeframe that started as far back as June 2022. Related Reading: End Of The Road For Solana? Analyst Predicts 77% Price Crash To $40 Particularly, a close look at this Channel Up trend reveals that the Ethereum price action has been confined between its upper and lower trendlines in the past two and a half years. Fortunately, the trend is a bullish one with the creation of higher highs and higher lows, which suggests a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price. As it stands, the Ethereum price has been on an uptrend since the beginning of the week, essentially reversing last week’s declines. Consequently, the price has flipped from bearish to neutral on the weekly outlook and is now moving towards bullish. The only thing left is for the Ethereum price to keep pushing on this uptrend and flip above the weekly MA50 (50-Day Moving Average). A successful push above this level, according to crypto analyst InvestingScope, would not only signal an end to Ethereum’s prolonged consolidation but also set the stage for a rally toward the channel’s upper trendline. ETH On The Journey To Recording New Highs As it stands, the 1W Relative Strength Index has already crossed over its MA, lending charge to the momentum. All that’s left now is an Ethereum price break above the weekly MA50. A break above the MA50 on the weekly timeframe would confirm the shift from consolidation to bullish momentum, draw in fresh buying interest and open up Ethereum’s path to creating a higher high within the Channel Up structure. Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion Above $3 Is A Matter Of When, Not If: Analyst Reveals Timeline The Channel Up structure is structured in such a way that the creation of a new higher high at this point would necessitate a break above the current all-time high of $4,900. A touch of the upper trendline in the Channel Up would see the Ethereum price peaking above $5,500 before undergoing any major correction. “When that happens, aim for no lower than the All Time High (TP = 4,900),” the analyst said. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,631.

Recent bearish pressure has driven the token to a point where a recovery might be on the horizon, yet the critical question is: can buyers defend this level and push prices higher? With momentum shifting and market sentiment in flux, the scene is set for either a breakout on the upside or a breakdown. This article aims to analyze ApeCoin’s resilience at a critical support level, exploring whether current market dynamics could spark a rebound. Through a breakdown of technical indicators and recent price action, we seek to analyze the possibility of a bullish reversal or signs of continued downward pressure on ApeCoin. Technical Analysis: Signs Af A Rebound Or Breakdown? APE’s price on the 4-hour chart is consolidating above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the key $1 support level, indicating market indecision. While the position above the SMA suggests an optimistic trend, this consolidation could lead to a rally or strong decline, depending on whether bulls or bears take control. Meanwhile, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for ApeCoin shows bearish signals, as its SMA line edges toward a crossover below the signal lines near the zero level. This crossover attempt is typically seen as a bearish indicator, suggesting that downside momentum may be gaining steam. A successful crossover below the signal lines could confirm a shift in trend, potentially signaling more selling pressure on APE in the near term. Related Reading: Is Apecoin On Your Radar? APE Soars By 30% In 48 Hours, Signaling A Potential Bull Run On the daily chart, APE is in a consolidation phase while showing downbeat strength as it nears the $1 mark. Although it trades above the 100-day SMA, the increasing selling pressure raises concerns about its ability to stay above the $1 level. This combination of consolidation and bearish momentum could indicate a struggle to maintain its position, potentially leading to a decline if the bearish trend continues. A detailed analysis of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator shows that ApeCoin is overbought, indicating possible extended losses. The signal line is attempting to cross below the SMA line, which usually signals a shift in momentum toward the downside and increasing selling pressure. If this crossover happens, it could reinforce the likelihood of continued declines, leading traders to reconsider their positions amid the weakening bullish sentiment. Risk Vs. Reward: What’s Next For ApeCoin? Based on the analysis, ApeCoin’s price appears poised for a drop toward the $1 support level. A breakdown below this mark could lead to additional losses for the cryptocurrency, which could push it down to the $0.660 support level and beyond. Related Reading: ApeCoin Climbs 21% In Last 7 Days As Sentiment Remains Bullish However, if ApeCoin breaks above the $1 mark, the price is likely to move upward toward the $1.7 resistance level. Furthermore, a breach of this level could trigger further upward movement, potentially leading to the $2.1 resistance level and beyond.

In a series of posts on X, Robinson highlighted how blobs could revolutionize Ethereum’s scalability and economic dynamics. “Many people arguing about blobs, but so far no one has simulated how they respond to demand… until now,” Robinson stated. “TL;DR: Blobs are insanely bullish for ETH long term.” Why Blobs Are ‘Insanely Bullish’ For Ethereum Price Blobs, introduced in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844, are large data structures designed to enhance the network’s capacity by efficiently storing and processing data off-chain. This mechanism is pivotal for Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions, enabling them to offer lower transaction fees while maintaining security through Ethereum’s consensus. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: Whales Withdraw $750 Million In ETH From Exchanges Robinson’s simulation projects Ethereum operating at 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), burning 6.5% of its total ETH supply annually, with L2 transactions costing an average of $0.06. This scenario involves 16 MB of blobs per block, aligning with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s medium-term goals outlined in his latest “The Surge” post. “Yes, that’s Ethereum operating at 10k TPS, burning 6.5% a year while L2 transactions cost an average of $0.06, with 16 MB of blobs per block,” Robinson elaborated. “You thought L2’s were parasitic and Vitalik didn’t think this through? Ah, sweet summer child, little do you realize how insane this will get when the Ethereum ecosystem really kicks into high gear.” A key insight from Robinson’s research is the rapid escalation of ETH burning as blob usage increases. “It’s interesting how quickly blobs go from being free to burning a ton of ETH. It seems almost everyone doesn’t understand this tipping point. It also makes me think there might be a better pricing mechanism,” he observed. Robinson provides a simulation tool illustrating the ETH burn rate‘s exponential growth as TPS scales from the current ~180 TPS to 400 TPS. The data shows burned ETH increasing from roughly 4 ETH per day to 1,832 ETH per day. It’s interesting how quickly blobs go from being free to burning a ton of ETH. It seems almost everyone doesn’t understand this tipping point. It also makes me think there might be a better pricing mechanism. Here’s what it looks like increasing from today’s ~180TPS to 400TPS pic.twitter.com/fjuK19NL6y — Tim Robinson (@timjrobinson) October 29, 2024 The scalability potential is further enhanced by the implementation of Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS), which allows blob capacity to scale with the number of validators. “Because total blob capacity scales with total validators, after PeerDAS is implemented, blobs can scale as high as needed,” Robinson explained. “There are 10k+ nodes to shard the load between them. While other ecosystems struggle under load, Ethereum will supply the world with cheap, abundant block-space while being extremely deflationary.” Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For Potential Rally To $6,000, Analyst Says An intriguing feedback loop identified by Robinson is the inverse relationship between ETH price and the burn rate. “Another interesting feedback loop is the lower the ETH price, the higher the burn! As transaction prices are lower, more transactions are made, and the burn soars,” he noted. “See how different the burn is with ETH at $2k vs ETH at $10k”. Another interesting feedback loop is the lower the ETH price, the higher the burn! As transaction prices are lower, more transactions are made, and the burn soars. See how different the burn is with ETH at $2k vs ETH at $10k: pic.twitter.com/tbSbC6unwM — Tim Robinson (@timjrobinson) October 29, 2024 Addressing the question of value accrual for ETH, Robinson stated, “So how will ETH accrue value? Being the most useful, scarce, deflationary asset with 10,000+ teams using Ethereum to grow their products will probably do it. Long term, ETH has the best fundamentals in the world; it just takes time for them to play out.” The research sparked enthusiasm and discussions within the ETH community. Mat (@materkel) commented on X: “Will be extremely interesting once we hit blob capacity. My guess is a lot of L2s still need to figure out how to handle this case and properly fee their users. There will be a lot of inefficiencies to fix; we just didn’t really have multiple competing L2s in this scenario before. Once the dust settles, we’ll have proper price discovery both for fees on L2s together with blobs on L1.” Robinson responded, emphasizing the importance of proactive analysis: “Yeah, absolutely! I’m trying to bring the data so we can solve any problems before we get there. The market becomes more stable with more blobs, but in the early days, fees could be quite volatile.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,638.

OG, short for “original gangster” or “original gangsta,” is a slang expression for someone who is exceptional, unique, or “old-school.” The BTC supporter also suggested that the coin is moving in the direction that will allow the crypto to outshine gold, the US dollar, and other major assets soon. Related Reading: Tether’s $1 Billion USDT Mint On Tron: What’s Fueling The Demand Surge? Rising Over Gold, Greenback ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees, an early investor of Bitcoin, sees that the cryptocurrency would surpass the major assets in the upcoming months, saying that the coin has “high potential” to eclipse fundamental assets such as gold, the US dollar, and even oil. When demand for gold rises, more gold is produced. When demand for oil rises, more oil is produced. When demand for USD rises, more USD are produced. When demand for Bitcoin rises… — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) October 29, 2024 In a post, Voorhees pointed out that when the appetite for gold rises, gold production will surge while if the demand for oil rises, more oil will be extracted. He added that more US dollars are printed, once the demand for the greenbacks soar, saying that supply for these assets would not run out in the upcoming years. However, the founder of the Venice.AI project hinted that it is not the same case with Bitcoin when demand for it increases. It is an indication that additional BTC cannot be produced because Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, only designed the cryptocurrency not to exceed 21 million coins. Bitcoin-Gold Relationship Earlier, another Bitcoiner, Max Keiser, believed that there is a relationship between the price of gold and Bitcoin price, saying that BTC price could soar because of gold. Keiser explained that for every $1 increase in gold prices, BTC prices also experienced a hike of $20, adding that since gold prices hit a record amount, Bitcoin prices are more likely to follow suit. Expecting A Bitcoin Surge Voorhees is already telling the cryptocurrency community to keep an eye on Bitcoin because he predicts that all aspects of the coin will move upward including its price. The ShapeShift executive remarked that this attribute of Bitcoin would be the main factor why demand for the coin will soar quickly. In the past few days, several crypto experts have already projected the inevitable growth of Bitcoin, saying that its price will breach the six-figure level. Related Reading: Cardano To Soar 22X?

We know we need to have pro-crypto legislation passed in this country.” Fairshake, which has garnered backing from major players in the digital asset sector, including Ripple Labs and Andreessen Horowitz, aims to ensure that both Republican and Democratic candidates recognize the importance of cryptocurrency in their platforms. The committee is poised to spend over $40 million in the lead-up to the 2024 elections, having already invested $140 million in various congressional races across the nation.

Conversely, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris has pledged to support a regulatory framework for digital assets if elected. Armstrong noted, “We get the US election results in six days, and no matter how you slice it, it will be the most pro-crypto Congress ever.” Coinbase’s CEO emphasized the growing influence of the “crypto voter,” suggesting that their impact will only continue to expand. Despite these political developments, Coinbase’s stock faced significant pressure following the company’s recent earnings report, which fell short of expectations. Analysts Call Current Crypto Market Dip A ‘Temporary Unwind’ Coinbase shares dropped 14.3% on Thursday, marking the steepest decline since May 2022. This downturn was exacerbated by a broader market decline and disappointing earnings from other crypto-related firms, including Robinhood, which saw its stock tumble 15% after reporting weak results. However, analysts are viewing the current market conditions as a temporary setback. Devin Ryan of JMP Securities described the situation as a “temporary unwind” in crypto stocks, suggesting that long-term investors may find opportunities amidst the volatility. The analyst further pointed out that upcoming events—such as the US elections and rising crypto prices—could positively impact Coinbase’s fourth-quarter revenue if trends continue. Related Reading: Institutional Traders Bet On Bitcoin Exceeding $79,300 By End Of November Owen Lau, an analyst at Oppenheimer, also noted that the recent stock decline might be tied to concerns about subdued trading volumes and the potential impact of lower US interest rates on Coinbase’s stablecoin revenue. At the time of writing, COIN shares were trading at $179 after hitting a three-month high of $223 last Tuesday.

Retail Investors Turn To Bitcoin For ‘Debasement Trade’ In a recent client note, analysts at JPMorgan suggested that a Trump win might provide ‘additional upside’ for both BTC and gold, as retail investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a ‘debasement trade.’ Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes ATH Against Euro Due To Change In Dollar Strength, Details Inside In simple terms, a debasement trade is a strategy to protect purchasing power against the steady erosion of fiat currencies due to extensive money printing. Notably, the M2 money supply – a measure of total money in circulation – sharply rose during the coronavirus pandemic. This surplus in money supply led to heightened inflation, forcing the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to raise interest rates to contain it. By purchasing BTC, retail investors aim to maintain their money’s value, hoping Bitcoin will act as a hedge against currency depreciation. The JPMorgan note states: Retail investors appear to be embracing the ‘debasement trade’ in an even stronger manner by buying bitcoin and gold ETFs. The retail impulse is also seen in meme and AI tokens the market cap of which has outperformed. Data from SoSoValue shows that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) have attracted a whopping $1.3 billion in inflows over the past two days alone. As of October 30, the cumulative net inflow to US-based spot BTC ETFs is $24.18 billion. October’s total ETF inflows alone amount to $4.4 billion, marking it the third-highest month for BTC ETF inflows since their launch earlier this year. However, institutional investors appear to have slowed down on BTC futures activity recently, with analysts noting that Bitcoin futures have entered overbought territory, potentially introducing vulnerability for BTC’s near-term outlook. The client note highlights that credit and prediction markets lean toward a Trump win, unlike equities, foreign exchange (FX), and rates markets. The analysts conclude: Overall, to the extent a Trump win inspires retail investors to not only buy risk assets but to also further embrace the ‘debasement trade’, there could be additional upside for bitcoin and gold prices in a Trump win scenario. Where Is BTC Headed? Analysts Share Their Outlook Bitcoin is trading within 2% of reaching a new all-time high (ATH), driving renewed optimism among crypto analysts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 13% In 1 Month: Time For Q4 2024 Rally? For instance, crypto analyst Timothy Peterson recently posited that BTC could surge to as high as $100,000 by February 2025. Meanwhile, crypto options trading data indicates that traders remain confident BTC will hit $80,000 by the end of November 2024, regardless of the election outcome. Veteran trader Peter Brandt, however, has urged caution, advising BTC bulls that a daily close above $76,000 is critical for confirming a true breakout. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $71,798, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

SOL price is now approaching the $165 support and might bounce back in the near term. SOL price started a fresh decline after it struggled near the $185 zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $172 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $172 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward movement if it stays above the $165 and $162 support levels. Solana Price Holds Support Solana price struggled to clear the $185 resistance and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $180 and $175 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below $172 and tested the $165 support zone. A low was formed at $165 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $183 swing high to the $165 low.

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $172 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The main resistance could be $175 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $183 swing high to the $165 low. A successful close above the $175 resistance level could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $182. Any more gains might send the price toward the $185 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $170 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $165 level. The first major support is near the $162 level. A break below the $162 level might send the price toward the $150 zone.

Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support To Set A $6,000 Target – Analyst Rise In Funding Rates To Drive Breakout? Positive funding rates imply that there are more aggressive buyers, indicating bullish sentiment, whereas negative rates suggest more sellers and a bearish outlook. This trend reflects a favorable market sentiment for Ethereum, albeit with some caution regarding its sustainability. Despite this renewed optimism, the current positive funding rates for Ethereum, as highlighted by Shayan are yet to match levels seen in early 2023, when the cryptocurrency experienced a marked bullish trend in March. This difference may indicate that, although sentiment is shifting, the momentum may need further strengthening to ignite a sustained rally. Shayan observations suggest that while traders lean towards a positive outlook on Ethereum, this sentiment must translate into higher funding rates to indicate a stronger conviction in the asset’s potential price rise. The analyst wrote: For Ethereum to overcome key resistance levels and sustain an upward trajectory, a higher funding rate would signal increased buying interest and confidence from futures traders. Higher funding rates would not only confirm participants’ willingness to go long on Ethereum but would also add upward pressure on the price, potentially leading to a stronger and more sustained rally. Ethereum Market Performance Ethereum has seen a noteworthy recovery in price in recent weeks. The asset has recorded a price uptick rising to as high as $2,719 on Wednesday. However, following the asset reaching this price mark comes a noteworthy correction. Over the past day, ETH has decreased by 5.1%, shedding some of the profits in the past few days. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $2,550 from its 24-hour low of $2,548. ETH’s daily trading volume has also followed the same trend, dropping from above $24 billion on Wednesday to below $20 billion. Regardless of this performance, some analysts remain bullish on ETH.

Despite the drop, some analysts consider the cryptocurrency is still in a strong position for an upcoming breakout, setting the next levels to watch. Related Reading: Analyst Says It’s ‘Time To Be Bullish On Ethereum’ As ETH Retests $2,700 BTC’s Sweet 16 Party Turns Spooky Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recorded an impressive rally in ‘Uptober,’ surging around 13% in the last 30 days. BTC’s price has jumped from the $58,900 monthly low to near its all-time high (ATH) price of $73,737, reaching the $73,300 mark on Wednesday. Following the green September close, the flagship crypto is set to have its best monthly close since March, potentially registering around 13$ to 14% in monthly returns despite its most recent price action. On its whitepaper’s 16th birthday, Bitcoin recorded a spooky 2% drop, driving the rest of the market to a red Halloween party. BTC’s price fell below the $71,000 mark, reaching an intraday low of $70,600. Meanwhile, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH), pulled back around 5.1%, losing the $2,600 support zone. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that today’s drop is the fifth consecutive rejection BTC faces at $72,000. Since its ATH, Bitcoin has been rejected from this resistance level five times, dropping between 8.2% and 18% the four previous times. Analyst Altcoin Sherpa suggested that BTC could see a 4% to 5% dip if the largest cryptocurrency doesn’t hold the $70,000 support zone. Nonetheless, Sherpa considers that the cryptocurrency should “see some sort of bounce” from the $70,800-$71,400 area in the short term. BTC is expected to have an extremely volatile week ahead of the US presidential elections. Bitfinex analysts predicted that Bitcoin volatility will peak between November 6 and November 8, as speculation and anticipation about the election outcome affect the cryptocurrency’s performance. Is Bitcoin Gearing Up For End-Of-Year Breakout? Cryptoinsightuk weighed in on Bitcoin’s performance, noting that BTC is still at ATH by Open Interest (OI). The crypto investor considers that the Daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) could potentially “cross bearish” today. He also highlighted that $69,600 should work as a key support level for Bitcoin bulls but warned that losing the $66,500 range could be “messy” as BTC’s open interest would “flush.” Meanwhile, Crypto Kaleo posted a more bullish outlook for BTC’s price action. The analyst highlighted that the flagship crypto didn’t break above its ATH when it retested the $20,000 mark in 2020. Related Reading: Neiro Breaks Above Key Level Following 10% Weekly Drop, Is $0.0020 Next? Instead, Bitcoin initially pulled back nearly 20% during Thanksgiving, moving from $19,400 to $16,100. Moreover, BTC’s price accumulated within that range for 30 days before breakout, seeing the next leg up in late December 2020. The analyst pointed out the breakout happened 219 days after May 2020’s Halving. As Bitcoin is currently 194 days post-halving, the analyst considers that “a little bit of a pullback here isn’t any reason for concern.” As of this writing, Bitcoin has held the $70,000 support level, currently trading at $70,522.

We've had a year without any big crypto industry meltdowns and a strong start to the year with spot bitcoin ETF launches. This year has been one of the busiest in terms of crypto ETF launches. Issuers and investors are perhaps envisioning a more crypto-friendly environment post-election, which has reignited innovation. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has had its highs and lows when it comes to investor interest (and its prices). But lately, interest has remained relatively high, and bitcoin prices have now reached over $70,000. We’ve had a year without any big crypto industry meltdowns and a strong start to the year with spot bitcoin ETF launches. Now the U.S. election has been making issuers and investors more excited for the future of crypto. This year has been one of the busiest years in terms of crypto ETF launches. I’ve offered glimpses of the future before. But this note provides a more focused look back at the crypto ETF industry and how that builds toward the future. Phase One: Early Beginnings, Trusts, Blockchain ETFs In the early days, we saw the beginning of crypto ETFs. The Winklevoss twins are a name many of us may have forgotten. But they were some of the original big thinkers behind crypto ETFs. Back in July 2013, the Winklevoss twins filed for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. That would have been the first bitcoin ETF. After three years of back and forth with the SEC, the filing was rejected citing fraud and lack of regulation (this should sound familiar because it is the same rationale given over the next 10 years). The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) (now an ETF) was launched as a trust structure in September 2013 and was initially accessible only to accredited investors. Grayscale first submitted its application for conversion to an ETF in 2016-2017 and received pushback from the SEC. It withdrew its application but continued to push for change in the regulatory environment. Around this time, they also launched the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) (also now an ETF) as a trust. The first blockchain ETFs launched in 2018: the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF ( BLOK ) and the Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF ( BLCN ). Blockchain ETFs hold equity securities in the blockchain and crypto space, which was a very nascent industry at the time. Coinbase Global ( COIN ), which is one of the most well-known crypto stocks, did not go public until April 2021. Phase Two: Bitcoin Goes Mainstream During the pandemic, crypto took off. Partly fueled by stimulus payments and partly fueled by the boredom of staying at home - suddenly everyone became a crypto investor. If you were lucky enough to follow the meme stock craze in early 2020, you might have bought bitcoin for $5,000-10,000. After only about a year, the price of bitcoin would reach over $60,000. By this time, BLOK had reached over $1 billion in assets. But this also led to a disconnect. Investors were interested in bitcoin. But ETFs weren’t really part of that picture, since we only had blockchain equity ETFs. They were correlated with bitcoin prices. But the comparison is like investing in an energy ETF versus investing in an oil ETF. Issuers were still eager to file for the first spot bitcoin ETF. Issuers like VanEck, ARK, and Bitwise continued to file for a spot bitcoin ETF filing despite persistent denials. It wasn’t until May 2021 that the first ETF with crypto in its name launched - the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ). As mentioned before, blockchain ETFs typically used terms like blockchain, digital transformation, next-generation economy. We were getting closer to a true bitcoin ETF, but still only in the adjacent space. Phase Three: Finally... the First U.S. Bitcoin ETF The excitement continued to build until the first U.S. bitcoin ETF was launched in October 2021 - the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ). At the time, this was the second-biggest launch in history in terms of trading activity. While this was considered the first U.S. bitcoin ETF (and a big milestone), it was futures-based. Investors were looking ahead to potential spot bitcoin ETF launches, which would be physically backed by bitcoin and not subject to roll costs like a futures-based product. That same month, Grayscale filed another application for GBTC’s conversion, which was later rejected in June 2022. That summer, there was a shift in sentiment toward bitcoin and crypto. We saw the collapse of terraUSD and luna, along with the bankruptcy of Celsius. Bitcoin prices were heading below $20,000. It was the perfect time for an inverse bitcoin ETF to come out. The ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITI ) was launched in June 2022 at a time where many expected bitcoin prices to keep falling. Phase Four: Short Bitcoin and Closures After the inverse product was released, bitcoin prices continued to see pressure. This was further fueled by the FTX collapse and many investors wanted nothing to do with crypto anymore. During this time, several funds closed, including funds that focused on the crypto mining equity sector. But a bullish sentiment wasn’t dead - the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ) was launched a year after BITI, in June 2023. At this point, it was unclear why a spot bitcoin ETF wasn’t approved. But we had inverse and 2x leveraged products. Futures are regulated by the CFTC. But common sense suggested that a spot bitcoin ETF should have been approved by this point. Phase Five: Spot ETFs and Everything Else You Can Think Of A lot of things happened very quickly over the past year and a half. In August 2023, the courts finally agreed that it did not make sense for futures bitcoin products to exist and not spot bitcoin products. Grayscale won its legal battle against the SEC. That meant it was now a matter of when, not if, spot bitcoin ETFs would be approved. But before spot bitcoin ETFs were launched, ether futures ETFs were surprisingly fast-tracked in October 2023. That added more fuel to the fire that not only spot bitcoin ETFs would be approved but so would spot ether ETFs. Issuers raced to file, including large asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ). With several almost identical products filed, a fee war resulted. Most of the spot bitcoin ETFs had fee waivers for the first six months or up to a certain amount of assets. Even after fee waivers, fees were generally low (20-25 bps). Spot bitcoin ETFs finally launched in January. They ended up being the most successful launch on record (and they continue to draw attention almost 10 months later). The spot ether ETF launch followed somewhat quickly in July and was relatively less successful. But since then, issuers have been getting creative with other launches. Most of these are “complex” strategies like leveraged or derivative funds, despite some roadblocks to adoption for anything beyond traditional spot bitcoin ETFs. Besides leveraged or derivative funds, we’ve also seen funds like the STKD Bitcoin & Gold ETF ( BTGD ), which holds both bitcoin and gold. New blockchain ETFs like the SPDR Galaxy Transformative Tech Accelerators ETF ( TEKX ) are still emerging, which State Street and Galaxy launched in early September, along with a suite of two other ETFs. Additionally, the SEC granted approval to the Cboe and NYSE for trading options for certain ETFs recently. (The NYSE has also approved options on a small number of spot bitcoin ETFs.) Several more spot ETFs have also been filed, including Solana, XRP, and Litecoin. Final Thoughts: More Crypto Innovation, Launches in the Future Notably, the biggest takeaway from this is that issuers haven’t been holding back with crypto. Issuers and investors are perhaps envisioning a more crypto-friendly environment post-election, which has reignited innovation. Although it is currently ahead of the investor adoption curve, I believe innovation is essential for the crypto ETF environment and plays an important role in competition and education - which will ultimately breed greater adoption.

Shiba Inu put in a strong performance earlier in the week, surging to $0.00001947 on Tuesday. Its bullish uptick ensured it surpassed Avalanche to become the 12th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.However, a global market downturn on Wednesday triggered a correction for the crypto market, with Shiba Inu also facing the heat. For context, the dog-themed meme coin is down 6.40% in the past 24 hours, relinquishing all its weekly gains to the latest retracement.Meanwhile, market analyst Crypto Jack has identified an important price structure standing in the path of Shiba Inu’s explosive uptrend, arguing that the top-ranking meme coin will surge extensively if it breaks from the pattern.Analyst Shows Shiba Inu’s Major Price ImpedimentIn a Thursday X post , Crypto Jack noted that Shiba Inu is in a price range. The accompanying SHIB/USD 1D chart shows that the meme coin started forming the price pattern after hitting the three-month high on September 27. Shiba Inu price prediction Notably, the $0.000020 to $0.000021 zone formed the range top, while the $0.000015 zone became the lower region. SHIB has continued to trade within the range for over one month now.Crypto Jack asserted that Shiba Inu must break past the range's upper boundary to “explode to the upside.” Meanwhile, the analyst’s chart shows he expects a revisit of the lower zone before breaking past the resistance at $0.000021.Explosive Upside After Defying ResistanceMeanwhile, the market watcher had earlier identified the $0.000021 resistance as a must-breach for sustained Shiba Inu upsides. In an earlier report , he noted that if SHIB breaks above the supply zone, the next stop would be around $0.000027.Furthermore, analyst Crypto Sheriff expects Shiba Inu’s next stop to be around $0.0002 after breaching the resistance. The renowned market speculator also targeted an ambitious surge to $0.001, representing an over 5,400% increase from the current market price.Notably, Shiba Inu currently trades at $0.00001745 as at press time, down almost 2% in the past seven days and 20.3% away from Crypto Jack’s upper range price.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today,EN,0,0,SHIB|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-11-01 13:10:48

After reaching a peak of $73,620 on Tuesday, the cryptocurrency has declined by approximately 5.7%, hitting a low of $68,830 on Friday. Analysts point to several key factors behind this decline: #1 Risk-Off Sentiment Ahead of US Election The timing of Bitcoin’s price drop coincides with a narrowing lead for former President Donald Trump over Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris in prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, where users bet on election outcomes. Bitcoin has been considered a “Trump hedge” due to the former president’s strong advocacy for the cryptocurrency sector. Donald Trump has proposed establishing a “strategic Bitcoin reserve” in the United States if re-elected. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, he outlined plans to retain all Bitcoin currently held or acquired by the US government as part of this reserve. This initiative is a core element of his campaign to strengthen the US as a leader, aiming to make the country the “crypto capital of the planet.” Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hit $200,000 Only If The Dollar Falls? Bitwise CIO Answers Earlier in the week, when Trump’s lead over Harris was more substantial, Bitcoin neared its all-time high of $73,777. The shrinking of Trump’s lead appears to have prompted investors to adopt a risk-off stance, contributing to the price decline. Crypto analyst HornHairs noted that derisking before elections has precedent. “Derisking into the election 5-6 days before it takes place happened in both 2020 and 2016. Price then went on to never retest the lows set the week before the election ever again. Be careful what you sell here,” he remarked via X. #2 S&P 500 Loses 3-Month Trendline The correlation between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets may have also influenced BTC’s price movement. The S&P 500 has fallen to its lowest level since October 9, potentially affecting investor sentiment in the crypto space. Analysts from The Kobeissi Letter observed that despite major tech companies like Apple reporting strong earnings, their stock prices have declined. “Yet another tech giant to beat earnings but trade lower,” they noted, adding that technology stocks faced widespread selling even as Meta, Amazon, and Apple exceeded earnings expectations. They added, It appears that markets are de-risking ahead of the election next week. Brace for volatility.” Related Reading: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Reaches 2% Of Total BTC Supply Amid Record Inflows Crypto trader Marco Johanning highlighted concerns about the S&P 500 losing its three-month trendline. “Given that the S&P 500 lost the 3-months trendline yesterday, it looks more like a potential selloff before the US election on Tuesday and lower prices in the short term. The perfect bounce level is the 7-month trendline (blue). I don’t want to see prices below the POC/key level around 63k (red),” he wrote via X. #3 Leverage Flush Out A significant unwinding of leveraged positions in the markets has also contributed to Bitcoin’s price decline. The market correction appears to be a healthy response to an overextension driven by leverage. Renowned crypto analyst Miles Deutscher noted: “This pullback is normal (and expected). Market was looking overextended the last few days, and largely driven by leverage. Still not buying heavy as it isn’t a full cascade yet—will wait for one of those days around the election. Not a bad DCA day for certain coins tho.” Austin Reid, Global Head of Revenue & Business at crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX, pointed out that the crypto derivatives market was “on fire” ahead of the election, with futures open interest for BTC, ETH, and SOL crossing the $50 billion mark for the first time. On-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr reported that open interest was reduced by $2.1 billion, implying a significant leverage flush out. According to data from Coinglass, over the past 24 hours, 93,864 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations amounting to $286.73 million. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance’s BTCUSDT pair, valued at $11.26 million. For Bitcoin alone, $81.38 million in long positions were liquidated—the largest amount since October 1. At press time, BTC traded at $69,446.

This retrace has sparked renewed interest among investors, with top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt sharing a technical analysis that points to a promising setup for accumulation. Runefelt highlights a bullish pattern emerging in ETH’s price action, indicating that this retracement could be a prime opportunity for long-term holders to accumulate more Ethereum before a potential rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Near ATH – Volume Suggests A Big Move Ahead The coming days will be pivotal for Ethereum as the crypto market closely watches Bitcoin’s attempt to break its all-time highs. Should BTC achieve this feat, it would confirm a new bull run, likely bringing Ethereum. The crypto community is eagerly waiting to see if Ethereum can hold its ground above $2,400 and eventually surpass resistance at $2,820, potentially setting the stage for higher gains. Ethereum’s current levels and consolidation phase suggest a decisive move could unfold soon, making it a crucial time for ETH’s trajectory in the broader market cycle. Ethereum Sideways Consolidation Ethereum has been lagging behind Bitcoin and several other altcoins like Solana, which have recently seen more robust price action. This underperformance has drawn attention from analysts and investors alike, including top analyst Carl Runefelt, who recently shared an in-depth technical analysis on X. Runefelt highlights Ethereum’s current formation around an ascending support level, suggesting that ETH’s current price could present one of the best accumulation opportunities before a potential rally. Runefelt’s analysis points to a crucial ascending support level of around $2,450, which has held steady despite Ethereum’s pullbacks, maintaining a bullish structure. He emphasizes that if Ethereum continues to trend down, this support could be an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to accumulate ETH while it’s relatively undervalued. The chart formation suggests a possible price floor, which, if buyers intervene, could catalyze a move toward higher levels. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Prepares For A Bullish Breakout – Analyst Sets $3 Target On the upside, Ethereum faces a key resistance at $2,800. Runefelt notes that breaking this resistance could trigger a significant upward move, potentially aligning ETH with broader market trends if BTC breaks into new all-time highs. If Ethereum successfully clears the $2,800 level, it would confirm the bullish pattern and likely fuel a surge in price action. This breakout could signal that Ethereum is ready to catch up to Bitcoin and outperform altcoins, creating a more favorable outlook for ETH in the broader market landscape. The next few days will be crucial for Ethereum’s trajectory as it continues to hold above the ascending support level. Traders and investors are watching closely to see if ETH can break out of its recent underperformance and reclaim its position as an altcoin leader. ETH Technical Details Ethereum is trading at $2,505 after a failed attempt to hold above the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $2,530. This slip below the 200 MA has put ETH in a precarious position as it seeks new demand levels to stabilize the recent retrace. The price is nearing a crucial support level, and breaking below this area could trigger a significant correction, adding considerable downside risk to Ethereum’s current price action. For Ethereum to avoid a deeper drop, finding support around the $2,450 mark is essential. If buyers step in and manage to keep ETH above this level, it would signal a positive shift in momentum. An even stronger bullish indicator would be if ETH rebounds and pushes above the $2,550 level, which would help restore confidence in the asset and signal a potential recovery phase. Related Reading: Dogecoin Metrics Reveal Increasing Network Activity – Is DOGE Ready To Break Yearly Highs? Such a move could mark the end of the retrace and position ETH for further upside in the coming sessions. However, until the price finds solid footing, ETH remains vulnerable to further declines, making this a pivotal moment for the asset’s short-term outlook.
