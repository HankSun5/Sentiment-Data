At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading with a 0.07% gain in the past 30 days, which reveals the current consolidation situation it finds itself under. However, according to a technical analysis on TradingView, the Ethereum price could be well on its way to reaching a new all-time high after 12 weeks of consolidation. Ethereum Price Completes Bottom Formation According to a technical analysis of the Ethereum price in the weekly candlestick timeframe, the cryptocurrency is currently in its 12th week of consolidation after a decline that ended in the first week of August. Interestingly, analysis reveals that the consolidation is at the bottom of the lower trendline in a Channel Up trend in the weekly timeframe that started as far back as June 2022. Related Reading: End Of The Road For Solana? Analyst Predicts 77% Price Crash To $40 Particularly, a close look at this Channel Up trend reveals that the Ethereum price action has been confined between its upper and lower trendlines in the past two and a half years. Fortunately, the trend is a bullish one with the creation of higher highs and higher lows, which suggests a bullish outlook for the Ethereum price. As it stands, the Ethereum price has been on an uptrend since the beginning of the week, essentially reversing last week’s declines. Consequently, the price has flipped from bearish to neutral on the weekly outlook and is now moving towards bullish. The only thing left is for the Ethereum price to keep pushing on this uptrend and flip above the weekly MA50 (50-Day Moving Average). A successful push above this level, according to crypto analyst InvestingScope, would not only signal an end to Ethereum’s prolonged consolidation but also set the stage for a rally toward the channel’s upper trendline. ETH On The Journey To Recording New Highs As it stands, the 1W Relative Strength Index has already crossed over its MA, lending charge to the momentum. All that’s left now is an Ethereum price break above the weekly MA50. A break above the MA50 on the weekly timeframe would confirm the shift from consolidation to bullish momentum, draw in fresh buying interest and open up Ethereum’s path to creating a higher high within the Channel Up structure. Related Reading: XRP Price Explosion Above $3 Is A Matter Of When, Not If: Analyst Reveals Timeline The Channel Up structure is structured in such a way that the creation of a new higher high at this point would necessitate a break above the current all-time high of $4,900. A touch of the upper trendline in the Channel Up would see the Ethereum price peaking above $5,500 before undergoing any major correction. “When that happens, aim for no lower than the All Time High (TP = 4,900),” the analyst said. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,631.

Recent bearish pressure has driven the token to a point where a recovery might be on the horizon, yet the critical question is: can buyers defend this level and push prices higher? With momentum shifting and market sentiment in flux, the scene is set for either a breakout on the upside or a breakdown. This article aims to analyze ApeCoin’s resilience at a critical support level, exploring whether current market dynamics could spark a rebound. Through a breakdown of technical indicators and recent price action, we seek to analyze the possibility of a bullish reversal or signs of continued downward pressure on ApeCoin. Technical Analysis: Signs Af A Rebound Or Breakdown? APE’s price on the 4-hour chart is consolidating above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the key $1 support level, indicating market indecision. While the position above the SMA suggests an optimistic trend, this consolidation could lead to a rally or strong decline, depending on whether bulls or bears take control. Meanwhile, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for ApeCoin shows bearish signals, as its SMA line edges toward a crossover below the signal lines near the zero level. This crossover attempt is typically seen as a bearish indicator, suggesting that downside momentum may be gaining steam. A successful crossover below the signal lines could confirm a shift in trend, potentially signaling more selling pressure on APE in the near term. Related Reading: Is Apecoin On Your Radar? APE Soars By 30% In 48 Hours, Signaling A Potential Bull Run On the daily chart, APE is in a consolidation phase while showing downbeat strength as it nears the $1 mark. Although it trades above the 100-day SMA, the increasing selling pressure raises concerns about its ability to stay above the $1 level. This combination of consolidation and bearish momentum could indicate a struggle to maintain its position, potentially leading to a decline if the bearish trend continues. A detailed analysis of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator shows that ApeCoin is overbought, indicating possible extended losses. The signal line is attempting to cross below the SMA line, which usually signals a shift in momentum toward the downside and increasing selling pressure. If this crossover happens, it could reinforce the likelihood of continued declines, leading traders to reconsider their positions amid the weakening bullish sentiment. Risk Vs. Reward: What’s Next For ApeCoin? Based on the analysis, ApeCoin’s price appears poised for a drop toward the $1 support level. A breakdown below this mark could lead to additional losses for the cryptocurrency, which could push it down to the $0.660 support level and beyond. Related Reading: ApeCoin Climbs 21% In Last 7 Days As Sentiment Remains Bullish However, if ApeCoin breaks above the $1 mark, the price is likely to move upward toward the $1.7 resistance level. Furthermore, a breach of this level could trigger further upward movement, potentially leading to the $2.1 resistance level and beyond.

In a series of posts on X, Robinson highlighted how blobs could revolutionize Ethereum’s scalability and economic dynamics. “Many people arguing about blobs, but so far no one has simulated how they respond to demand… until now,” Robinson stated. “TL;DR: Blobs are insanely bullish for ETH long term.” Why Blobs Are ‘Insanely Bullish’ For Ethereum Price Blobs, introduced in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844, are large data structures designed to enhance the network’s capacity by efficiently storing and processing data off-chain. This mechanism is pivotal for Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions, enabling them to offer lower transaction fees while maintaining security through Ethereum’s consensus. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: Whales Withdraw $750 Million In ETH From Exchanges Robinson’s simulation projects Ethereum operating at 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), burning 6.5% of its total ETH supply annually, with L2 transactions costing an average of $0.06. This scenario involves 16 MB of blobs per block, aligning with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s medium-term goals outlined in his latest “The Surge” post. “Yes, that’s Ethereum operating at 10k TPS, burning 6.5% a year while L2 transactions cost an average of $0.06, with 16 MB of blobs per block,” Robinson elaborated. “You thought L2’s were parasitic and Vitalik didn’t think this through? Ah, sweet summer child, little do you realize how insane this will get when the Ethereum ecosystem really kicks into high gear.” A key insight from Robinson’s research is the rapid escalation of ETH burning as blob usage increases. “It’s interesting how quickly blobs go from being free to burning a ton of ETH. It seems almost everyone doesn’t understand this tipping point. It also makes me think there might be a better pricing mechanism,” he observed. Robinson provides a simulation tool illustrating the ETH burn rate‘s exponential growth as TPS scales from the current ~180 TPS to 400 TPS. The data shows burned ETH increasing from roughly 4 ETH per day to 1,832 ETH per day. It’s interesting how quickly blobs go from being free to burning a ton of ETH. It seems almost everyone doesn’t understand this tipping point. It also makes me think there might be a better pricing mechanism. Here’s what it looks like increasing from today’s ~180TPS to 400TPS pic.twitter.com/fjuK19NL6y — Tim Robinson (@timjrobinson) October 29, 2024 The scalability potential is further enhanced by the implementation of Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS), which allows blob capacity to scale with the number of validators. “Because total blob capacity scales with total validators, after PeerDAS is implemented, blobs can scale as high as needed,” Robinson explained. “There are 10k+ nodes to shard the load between them. While other ecosystems struggle under load, Ethereum will supply the world with cheap, abundant block-space while being extremely deflationary.” Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For Potential Rally To $6,000, Analyst Says An intriguing feedback loop identified by Robinson is the inverse relationship between ETH price and the burn rate. “Another interesting feedback loop is the lower the ETH price, the higher the burn! As transaction prices are lower, more transactions are made, and the burn soars,” he noted. “See how different the burn is with ETH at $2k vs ETH at $10k”. Another interesting feedback loop is the lower the ETH price, the higher the burn! As transaction prices are lower, more transactions are made, and the burn soars. See how different the burn is with ETH at $2k vs ETH at $10k: pic.twitter.com/tbSbC6unwM — Tim Robinson (@timjrobinson) October 29, 2024 Addressing the question of value accrual for ETH, Robinson stated, “So how will ETH accrue value? Being the most useful, scarce, deflationary asset with 10,000+ teams using Ethereum to grow their products will probably do it. Long term, ETH has the best fundamentals in the world; it just takes time for them to play out.” The research sparked enthusiasm and discussions within the ETH community. Mat (@materkel) commented on X: “Will be extremely interesting once we hit blob capacity. My guess is a lot of L2s still need to figure out how to handle this case and properly fee their users. There will be a lot of inefficiencies to fix; we just didn’t really have multiple competing L2s in this scenario before. Once the dust settles, we’ll have proper price discovery both for fees on L2s together with blobs on L1.” Robinson responded, emphasizing the importance of proactive analysis: “Yeah, absolutely! I’m trying to bring the data so we can solve any problems before we get there. The market becomes more stable with more blobs, but in the early days, fees could be quite volatile.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,638.

OG, short for “original gangster” or “original gangsta,” is a slang expression for someone who is exceptional, unique, or “old-school.” The BTC supporter also suggested that the coin is moving in the direction that will allow the crypto to outshine gold, the US dollar, and other major assets soon. Related Reading: Tether’s $1 Billion USDT Mint On Tron: What’s Fueling The Demand Surge? Rising Over Gold, Greenback ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees, an early investor of Bitcoin, sees that the cryptocurrency would surpass the major assets in the upcoming months, saying that the coin has “high potential” to eclipse fundamental assets such as gold, the US dollar, and even oil. When demand for gold rises, more gold is produced. When demand for oil rises, more oil is produced. When demand for USD rises, more USD are produced. When demand for Bitcoin rises… — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) October 29, 2024 In a post, Voorhees pointed out that when the appetite for gold rises, gold production will surge while if the demand for oil rises, more oil will be extracted. He added that more US dollars are printed, once the demand for the greenbacks soar, saying that supply for these assets would not run out in the upcoming years. However, the founder of the Venice.AI project hinted that it is not the same case with Bitcoin when demand for it increases. It is an indication that additional BTC cannot be produced because Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, only designed the cryptocurrency not to exceed 21 million coins. Bitcoin-Gold Relationship Earlier, another Bitcoiner, Max Keiser, believed that there is a relationship between the price of gold and Bitcoin price, saying that BTC price could soar because of gold. Keiser explained that for every $1 increase in gold prices, BTC prices also experienced a hike of $20, adding that since gold prices hit a record amount, Bitcoin prices are more likely to follow suit. Expecting A Bitcoin Surge Voorhees is already telling the cryptocurrency community to keep an eye on Bitcoin because he predicts that all aspects of the coin will move upward including its price. The ShapeShift executive remarked that this attribute of Bitcoin would be the main factor why demand for the coin will soar quickly. In the past few days, several crypto experts have already projected the inevitable growth of Bitcoin, saying that its price will breach the six-figure level. Related Reading: Cardano To Soar 22X?
