Extreme fear dominates crypto markets, yet history shows such conditions often precede major price reversals. Steph IS CRYPTO highlights that this contrarian environment could create a favorable risk-to-reward scenario for investors ready to act. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently shows “extreme fear,” historically a strong signal for potential upside. Similar readings in June 2022, April 2023, and July 2024 preceded significant gains for XRP. Such patterns suggest that patient investors could benefit by positioning themselves against prevailing market sentiment. Institutional Demand Is Rising Institutional interest in XRP is accelerating, particularly through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Recent data indicate that inflows to these ETFs are approaching $1 billion, signaling substantial demand from large investors. Surprisingly, XRP’s price has not yet fully reflected this inflow, creating a temporary disconnect between supply and market valuation. You Have NO Idea What’s Coming for #XRP … Watch asap! https://t.co/i0toVaF6WK pic.twitter.com/wIQHyTALEj — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 5, 2025 ETF inflows matter because they reduce available XRP supply on exchanges . Coins are being moved into custody, likely off-market and away from short-term trading. This tightening of supply sets the stage for a potential price reaction once buying pressure intensifies. Whales and Long-Term Holders Are Accumulating On-chain data shows XRP whales steadily accumulating while short-term holders continue selling. This shift implies confidence among long-term investors, who are absorbing selling pressure and reinforcing key support levels. Steph notes that long-term holders are buying again for the first time since October, signaling renewed conviction in XRP’s prospects. This dynamic often precedes bullish trends. When major holders accumulate while smaller investors exit, the stage is set for structural market improvements. It also suggests that the bottoming process for XRP could be concluding, offering a foundation for potential upward momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical Analysis Supports a Bullish Thesis XRP is consolidating around significant support zones, indicating stability in the short term. On the daily chart, prices show consistent support, while the 4-hour timeframe hints at a possible double bottom pattern — a classic bullish reversal formation. Traders are anticipating higher highs as these technical patterns materialize. If realized, the combination of support stability, long-term accumulation, and institutional inflows could spark renewed buying interest, creating a favorable environment for price appreciation. Caution Remains Essential While the setup is compelling, investors must remain cautious. Extreme fear can persist longer than expected, and crypto markets are increasingly driven by institutions, which may alter traditional sentiment-based signals. Historical trends provide guidance, not guarantees, and risk management remains critical. Combining institutional ETF inflows, whale accumulation, and technical patterns suggests XRP could be on the brink of a significant move . For informed investors, the current environment may represent one of the rare opportunities in today’s crypto markets.

According to Buterin, while transaction fees are low today, users don't have a clear understanding of how fees will change over the next two years. Therefore, the market needs a new mechanism to generate expectations about future gas fees. Buterin explained that such a futures market could function like a prediction market built on BASEFEE, allowing users to see market signals about future gas prices more transparently and protect themselves against potential price increases. This structure would effectively allow users to purchase the amount of gas they will need within a specific timeframe, effectively “prepaying.” Related News: Experienced Economist Says, “The Fed Should Not Cut Interest Rates Next Week,” Explains Why Vitalik Buterin also noted that there are already startups working in this area, citing the Oiler project as an example. However, Buterin argued that the ecosystem is not yet mature, stating that the development and widespread adoption of such solutions would provide significant security and predictability for Ethereum users. *This is not investment advice.

Some come from meme coins, others from strong utility projects, and a few appear early before the market notices them. As analysts prepare for the next major upswing, attention is shifting to three altcoins that could play a big role. Two of them already proved their power in previous cycles, while the third is now entering a critical stage with 94% of Phase 6 sold out and strong momentum behind it. Pepecoin (PEPE) Pepecoin (PEPE) entered the market with no expectations, yet it quickly became one of the most talked-about meme tokens of its era. The token surged massively during its first major run as social interest exploded across the crypto community. Its market cap grew faster than analysts expected, driven almost entirely by online culture and community momentum. Today, PEPE still remains a recognizable name in meme-coin circles, but its growth curve has slowed. Large market caps tend to limit explosive gains, and analysts say PEPE may struggle to repeat its original breakout. While spikes may still appear, many traders are now exploring new entries that offer higher upside and clearer development roadmaps. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) also delivered one of the strongest rallies in meme-coin history. SHIB grew from near-zero levels to an asset that reached billions in market cap and built a global community. Early investors saw massive returns, and SHIB cemented itself as one of the top altcoins of the previous bull cycle. But like PEPE, SHIB now faces the same limitation: size. Its market cap is large, and the token’s growth has become slower compared to its early days. Analysts say SHIB may still move with the broader market, but the possibility of sharp, early-cycle gains is lower than before. Many traders now watching top crypto discussions are looking toward younger projects with more room to grow. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While PEPE and SHIB already had their explosive runs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is just beginning. The project is building a fully decentralized lending system with real utility, and its early progress has caught the attention of analysts tracking new crypto launches. Mutuum Finance opened its presale at $0.01 in early 2025. The token now trades at $0.035, marking a 250% rise from the first stage. The project has raised $19.1 million and passed 18,300 holders, with more than 810 million tokens already purchased. Out of the 4 billion total supply, 1.82 billion tokens were allocated for early backers. Phase 6 is now 94% sold out, and analysts say the shift from one stage to the next could happen without warning. Interest has been rising faster in recent days as traders search for DeFi projects with utility rather than meme-driven movement. The team confirmed through its official X account that the V1 testnet will launch on Sepolia in Q4 2025. This first version includes the liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tracking, and the liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be the first supported assets. This clear development roadmap is one of the reasons analysts expect MUTM to play a major role in the next market cycle. Price Outlook Mutuum Finance uses mtTokens to reward suppliers. When someone lends assets, they receive mtTokens that grow in value as borrowers repay interest. The yield depends on real usage, not set rewards. The platform also uses a buy-and-distribute model. A portion of revenue will be used to buy MUTM from the open market. Those purchased tokens are redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. Analysts say this creates long-term buying pressure that can support strong price movement once the platform gains active users. Accurate pricing is also important for lending markets, so the protocol will rely on Chainlink price feeds, fallback oracles, aggregated data, and on-chain DEX pricing when liquidity is strong. This ensures liquidations happen at the right time and keeps positions safe. Market analysts studying early DeFi cycles say that tokens with real lending utility tend to gain traction quickly once their first version is active. Some believe MUTM could rise 400% to 700% after V1, especially as long as borrowing markets grow at the pace seen in past DeFi expansions. L2 Expansion Mutuum Finance is preparing to introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin that will be minted and burned based on demand. The stablecoin will be backed by interest paid by borrowers, giving the protocol a stable internal asset for borrowing and lending. This is important because stablecoins have historically played a major role in the growth of DeFi ecosystems. The project also plans to expand to multiple layer-2 networks where fees are low and user activity is high. Analysts say this expansion could help Mutuum Finance enter a much larger market, with deeper liquidity pools and more borrowing demand. If the stablecoin and layer-2 rollout match expectations, some analysts believe MUTM could join lists of next crypto assets with strong growth potential heading into 2026. Strong Audits, Daily Incentives, and Presale Acceleration Security remains a strong focus for the team. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score. Halborn Security is reviewing the lending and borrowing contracts, while the project runs a $50K bug bounty to find vulnerabilities early. The project also has a 24-hour leaderboard where the top daily contributor receives $500 in MUTM. This feature has kept the community active and has helped push the treasury forward each day. With card payments available and increasing whale activity, the final section of Phase 6 is moving fast. Analysts say a recent $100K whale allocation is a strong signal that larger investors are entering before the next stage begins. PEPE and SHIB had their explosive moments, and both remain major names in the altcoin market. But analysts say their best days may be behind them. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, is in its early stages with real utility, rising demand, strong audits, and a confirmed V1 launch. With 94% of Phase 6 already sold out, this new DeFi project is now one of the top candidates for traders searching for the potential best crypto to buy now before the next cycle.

Earlier this week, the Polish President, Karol Nawrocki, vetoed a bill aimed at setting strict rules in the country’s digital assets market. Why Did The Polish President Veto The Digital Asset Bill? On Friday, December 5, Bloomberg reported that the lower house of the Polish parliament couldn’t secure the required three-fifths majority vote to override the President’s veto of the Crypto-Asset Market Act. This bill, introduced in June 2025, aimed to align Poland with the European Union’s MiCA framework for the digital asset markets. Related Reading: Key Updates On The US Crypto Market Structure Bill: What You Need To Know However, President Nawrocki decided against signing the crypto market legislation due to concerns that it may pose a real threat to the freedom of Poles, their property, and the stability of the country. According to the country’s leader, “overregulation” is one way to drive away new companies and investors, while seriously slowing innovation. As Bitcoinist earlier reported , the crypto community in Poland had already raised concerns about the regulation as early as September, especially as the bill surpassed the European Union (EU) minimum regulatory requirements. For instance, the bill’s messaging read that all Crypto Asset Service Providers are required to obtain a license from the Polish Financial Service Authority (KNF). Meanwhile, the bill proposed heavy fines and potential prison time for market participants who break the law. According to the Bloomberg report, supporters of the bill have also voiced out the need to provide regulatory oversight of Poland’s digital assets industry. Their belief is that clear, comprehensive rules are critical to fight fraud and avoid potential misuse of digital assets by bad actors. Poland’s Presidency Calls Crypto Bill A Legal Fiasco Rafael Leskiewicz, the press secretary of the President, took to the social media platform to react to the lawmakers’ failure to override the veto. The presidential spokesperson said the Crypto-Asset Market Act is a legal fiasco, while calling the attempt to overturn the president’s veto a political maneuver. Leskiewicz said in a statement: The President, by vetoing this act, exposed the low quality of the legislation being created. This market should be subject to monitoring and control, but certainly, bad law should not be created that restricts the freedom to conduct business activities. President Nawrocki, who was elected earlier in June, had always portrayed himself as a pro-Bitcoin leader who would rather veto regulatory restrictions than create new digital asset laws. According to market data, the adoption of crypto assets by Polish households has continued to grow in recent years, with the number of domestic users expected to hit 7.9 million by this year’s end.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Crypto-Asset Market Bill|Digital Assets|Karol Nawrocki|poland,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 20:30:42

The presale’s Phase 1 concluded in just over a week, a stunning achievement that saw 10 million tokens fly off the shelves and $500,000 raised. That momentum has only accelerated, with total funds now rocketing past the $1 million milestone from a rapidly expanding base of over 2,100 investors. As a decentralized ecosystem built on the principle of user ownership, GeeFi is capturing the attention of smart money. Analysts are now forecasting that the upcoming Phase 3 will last no more than 10 days, driven by strong rumors that the team is in advanced talks for major exchange listings. A Clear Upgrade From Legacy Coins While established altcoins show signs of weakness, with Ripple (XRP) currently trading around $2.06 and struggling with volatility, investors are seeking shelter and upside in GeeFi. This non-custodial ecosystem offers a solution to the centralization risks plaguing the industry. The GeeFi Wallet gives users 100% control over their private keys, providing a level of security that custodial platforms cannot match. The feature-rich mobile app is already available on Android, with an iOS version in development. The GeeFi ecosystem is far more than just a wallet. It integrates a powerful Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that supports over 14 networks, allowing for seamless asset swaps and bridging. The highly anticipated GeeFi Crypto Card is set to revolutionize crypto spending, enabling global transactions with both VISA and Mastercard. Developed since 2023, the GeeFi Team has built a platform focused on real-world utility and financial sovereignty, positioning it as a superior alternative to older, less secure networks. The Presale That Guarantees Explosive Returns The GeeFi presale is engineered to generate exceptional returns for its early supporters. Now in Phase 2, tokens are available for just $0.06 each. This incredibly low entry point is causing a surge in demand, as the confirmed listing price of $0.40 guarantees investors a massive 667% return. The potential for life-changing wealth is staggering: a $1,200 investment today could balloon to $40,000 if the token hits a $2 valuation, delivering a mind-blowing 3,233% ROI. With Phase 2 already 70% sold out, having raised over $570,000 from the sale of 9.4 million tokens, the window of opportunity is closing fast. Staking Rewards That Dominate the Market GeeFi is creating powerful incentives for long-term holders by offering some of the most competitive and sustainable yields available. Investors can lock their GEE tokens to earn an incredible 55% APR for 12 months. For those seeking greater flexibility, the platform also provides shorter-term options, including 22% APR for three months and 15% APR for just one month. Even better, users who prefer to keep their assets fully liquid can earn up to 10% APR without any lock-up period. The rewards don't end with staking. GeeFi’s innovative referral program gives users a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through their unique referral link. This approach encourages organic community growth and rewards early adopters for spreading the word. These high-yield passive income streams, all accessible within the secure GeeFi Wallet, make holding GEE a cornerstone of any serious wealth-building strategy. Your Final Call to Secure a 100x Gem This is a defining moment. Analysts are calling GeeFi a potential 100x gem, and its explosive presale performance in a shaky market validates that belief. While other investors are stuck waiting for legacy coins to recover, the smart money is moving into a project with a working product, a clear vision, and unprecedented ROI potential. The fear of missing out is justified. Phase 2 is selling out at a record pace, and a price increase is imminent. This is your final opportunity to secure a position in the next big crypto disruptor before it goes mainstream. Act now before this chance disappears forever.

GeeFi's presale has shown remarkable momentum, finishing its first phase in just over a week by selling 10 million tokens and raising $500,000. In total, the project has already raised over $1 million and established a strong community of more than 2,100 investors. GeeFi is a comprehensive non-custodial ecosystem, and experts predict its upcoming Phase 3 will sell out in under 10 days due to widespread talk of listings on major exchanges. Looking Past the Dogecoin Ride While Dogecoin (DOGE) investors are used to its frequent and often unpredictable price swings, many are now looking for a utility-driven asset. That search is leading them directly to GeeFi, a project many analysts believe will be 2026's 100x gem. It provides a single, intuitive platform where users can manage assets across more than 14 networks, swap tokens, and bridge chains without the usual complexity. This all-in-one solution addresses a major need for crypto users who require both security and convenience. The GeeFi Team began development in 2023 and went public in 2024, consistently delivering feature updates to its wallet. This dedication to building a functional product first is what separates it from other projects. The platform gives users full control over their private keys, ensuring their assets are always secure. With the Android app already live and an iOS version in development, GeeFi is demonstrating a commitment to tangible progress, reinforcing its potential to be 2026's 100x gem. The GeeFi Presale Opportunity GeeFi has now advanced to Phase 2 of its presale, with a token price of $0.06. By buying now, investors lock in a guaranteed return of 667% based on the planned $0.40 listing price. The potential for massive returns is substantial; an investment of just $1,800 at the current price could expand to $90,000 if the token reaches the analysts' forecast of a $3 valuation, achieving an incredible 4,900% ROI. Analysts have praised GeeFi's presale for its incredible performance. The momentum from Phase 1 has carried over, with Phase 2 already 70% complete in only 5 days, raising $570K from 9.4M tokens sold. Experts now believe Phase 3 will begin next week and will not last long, as rumors intensify about GeeFi preparing for listings on major exchanges. This is a key reason many see it as 2026's 100x gem. Powerful Staking and Referral Rewards One of the most compelling features driving demand for GeeFi is its robust staking program. Investors can generate significant passive income through multiple flexible options. By locking tokens, users can earn an impressive 15% APR for one month, 22% APR for three months, or a substantial 55% APR for a 12-month term. For those who prefer to keep their assets liquid, GeeFi offers a staking option with no locked funds that still provides returns of up to 10%. To further increase earnings, GeeFi has implemented a generous referral program. By sharing your personal link, you can earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made by your referrals. This system creates a strong incentive for community growth and allows early supporters to multiply their holdings. These features provide real, sustainable yield, attracting investors serious about maximizing their portfolio's performance. Your Final Chance for a Ground-Floor Entry The window of opportunity for life-changing investments in crypto is often small. GeeFi's presale represents one of those rare moments to get in on a project with massive potential before it becomes widely known. The combination of a deflationary token model, a working product, and a clear path to adoption with its upcoming crypto card positions GeeFi to become a significant force in the industry. The rapid pace of the presale signals strong market confidence. As the market prepares for the next major upswing, projects with strong fundamentals and real utility are set to lead the charge. Missing out on GeeFi now could be a major regret when the token launches on major exchanges and its full ecosystem is deployed, validating the belief that it is 2026's 100x gem. The time to act is now. Securing a position during the presale is the best way to capitalize on the explosive growth that experts are forecasting.

This comprehensive crypto platform completed its first phase in under two weeks, raising an impressive $500,000. The momentum has surged into Phase 2, which has already brought in over $570,000. Analysts are watching closely as the current phase is now more than 70% sold out. Projections suggest Phase 3 could start as early as next week, signaling that the window for early-stage investment is closing rapidly. Shifting Focus from Market Leaders to Real Utility Solana is showing resilience, holding a key support level at $135 with a remarkable $3.092B in DEX volume and a potential rally toward $150. While Solana’s performance is notable, many investors are looking for opportunities with higher growth ceilings. GeeFi is emerging as a prime candidate, offering a platform built on tangible, real-world utility. At its core is the GeeFi DEX, a decentralized exchange that provides a secure, non-custodial environment for trading digital assets with complete user control. The ecosystem’s utility extends far beyond just trading. GeeFi is set to launch its own Crypto Cards, integrated with VISA and Mastercard, to bridge the gap between digital finance and everyday global commerce. This real-world application is powered by the GEE token's deflationary design. Through a system of programmed token burns, the protocol is designed to methodically reduce the total supply, increasing scarcity and rewarding long-term holders with sustained value appreciation. A Financial Opportunity with Massive Growth Potential GeeFi's presale is currently in Phase 2, with tokens priced at just $0.06. This presents a compelling financial opportunity, as the token has a confirmed listing price of $0.40, locking in a guaranteed 667% return for presale investors. The long-term outlook is even more impressive. Based on analyst forecasts of the token reaching $2, an initial $1,600 investment could potentially grow to $60,000, delivering a staggering 3,233% ROI. The presale’s velocity supports this bullish sentiment. Over 9.5 million tokens have been sold in Phase 2 alone, raising over $570,000 in a short period. This intense demand has led experts to predict that the current phase will sell out within days. Excitement is further fueled by discussions from the GeeFi team about upcoming listings on several major exchanges, a development that often acts as a powerful catalyst for explosive price growth. Redefining Passive Income with Advanced Staking In addition to its capital growth potential, GeeFi offers a highly competitive staking program designed to generate passive income for its community. Accessible via the GeeFi Wallet, the platform provides flexible options for all investment strategies. Users can earn up to 10% APR on their tokens without any lock-up period. For those seeking higher yields, GeeFi offers 15% APR for a one-month term, 22% APR for three months, and an impressive 55% APR for a twelve-month commitment. The ecosystem also features a referral program, giving users a 5% bonus on all contributions from their referrals. Don't Miss the Next Breakout Success Market analysts are increasingly singling out GeeFi as a potential 100x project, a rare find in today's crowded crypto space. The current presale phase offers a limited-time opportunity to secure a position in a high-utility project before it hits the public market and gains widespread attention. With Phase 2 selling out fast and a price increase scheduled for Phase 3, the window for achieving maximum returns is closing. The fear of missing out is driving investors to act now before this opportunity is gone.

Despite the growing concern among Americans regarding inflation, President Trump continues to claim that prices are falling and the economy is recovering. President Donald Trump’s verbal attacks continue Financial commentator Peter Schiff publicly challenged President Donald Trump on Saturday after the president attacked him on Truth Social for appearing on Fox & Friends Weekend. The president’s attack on Schiff was in response to his discussing the affordability crisis facing Americans during his morning television appearance on December 6, 2025. Trump posted on Truth Social, questioning why Fox & Friends would host Schiff. The president described Schiff as a “Trump hating loser who has already proven to be wrong.” Trump insisted that prices are substantially reducing and blamed former President Joe Biden for creating the affordability crisis. He claimed gasoline hit $1.99 per gallon in certain states and that other prices are almost all down. Hours later, Schiff responded on X, challenging Trump or his designee to a debate on the U.S. economy and the effectiveness of his policies. In a separate post, Schiff suggested Trump should change the name of his social media platform to “Lie Social,” considering his dislike for the truth. During his Fox & Friends appearance, Schiff explained that the inflation rate is going to accelerate as Trump’s term progresses and that the policies continue to impact pricing. He told the show’s host, Griff Jenkins, that Biden had a lot of help in causing the affordability crisis, including from Trump during his first term. Schiff stated that Trump is not fixing the problem but making it worse. The President has continued to dismiss concerns about affordability as a Democrat con job. During a cabinet meeting this week, the president said that the word affordability is a Democrat scam. He argued that Democrats just say the word, but it doesn’t mean anything to anybody. However, Google search data shows that searches for affordability are up 110% compared to a year ago. How did Schiff and Binance’s CZ go? Prior to his exchange with the President, Schiff was in Dubai at Binance Blockchain Week, where he had a debate with Changpeng Zhao , known as CZ, the founder of Binance and Giggle Academy. The debate centered on Bitcoin versus tokenized gold as forms of money. During the Dubai debate , Schiff argued that Bitcoin is backed by nothing and has no inherent value. He stated that Bitcoin is a speculative asset with no utility beyond transferring it to someone else. Schiff also promoted his TGold platform, which allows users to purchase physical gold through a mobile app and store it in secure vaults while transferring or redeeming it digitally. CZ’s defense was Bitcoin’s widespread adoption and its practical advantages. He noted that 300 million people on Binance alone all have some kind of Bitcoin. He pulled a piece of gold from his pocket and explained the difficulty in transporting gold to demonstrate the benefits of Bitcoin’s portability. Schiff insisted that money requires physical backing to be credible and that Bitcoin’s price is driven primarily by speculation. CZ dismissed this notion, comparing Bitcoin’s value to tech platforms like Google or X, stating that many virtual things have value not tied to physical properties. President Trump recently granted a full pardon to CZ, who had faced legal issues related to his role at Binance. Trump said CZ wasn’t guilty and was persecuted by the Biden administration.

GeeFi has demonstrated incredible market strength with its explosive presale, concluding Phase 1 in just over a week. This initial stage saw 10 million tokens completely sell out, raising $500,000 in record time. The momentum has only grown, with total funds now surging past the $1 million milestone, backed by a loyal and expanding community of over 2,100 holders. GeeFi is a complete decentralized ecosystem built on the principle of user ownership, and this vision is attracting serious attention. Analysts are now forecasting that the upcoming Phase 3 will last no more than 10 days, fueled by rumors of advanced talks for major exchange listings. A Tangible Ecosystem in a Speculative Market The market for meme coins remains highly volatile, with Dogecoin (DOGE) trading between $0.14-$0.15 and holding a $23 billion market cap based on hype. For investors seeking real-world utility over speculation, GeeFi offers a powerful alternative. The GeeFi Wallet, a non-custodial mobile application, gives users complete control over their private keys, a level of security that centralized platforms cannot match. The app is already live on Android, with an iOS version in active development to expand its reach. GeeFi’s ecosystem is far more than just a secure wallet. It features a built-in Decentralized Exchange (DEX) with support for over 14 networks, allowing for effortless cross-chain swaps and bridging. The upcoming GeeFi Crypto Card will further connect digital assets to everyday life, enabling users to spend their holdings globally via the VISA and Mastercard networks. The GeeFi Team, which has been developing the project since 2023, has delivered a platform focused on tangible utility and financial freedom. An Unmissable Presale with Guaranteed Returns The GeeFi presale is structured to provide early investors with phenomenal returns. The project is currently in Phase 2, offering tokens at just $0.06 each. This incredibly low entry point has ignited a buying frenzy, as the confirmed listing price of $0.40 guarantees a 667% return for presale participants. An investment of just $1,200 today could transform into $40,000 if the token reaches a conservative $2 valuation, delivering a mind-blowing 3,233% ROI. The urgency is palpable, as Phase 2 is already 70% sold out, with over 9.4 million tokens sold, raising an additional $570,000. Rumors of the team considering listings on top-tier exchanges are only intensifying the demand. Unlock Powerful Passive Income with GeeFi Staking GeeFi offers some of the most attractive and sustainable yields in the crypto space, creating compelling incentives for long-term holding. Investors can earn an impressive 55% APR by locking their GEE tokens for 12 months. For those who need more flexibility, the platform also provides a 22% APR for a three-month lock and 15% APR for one month. In a standout feature, users who prefer to keep their assets liquid can still earn up to 10% APR without any lock-up period. The earning potential is further amplified by GeeFi’s referral program, which offers a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through a user's personal link. This smart growth mechanism rewards community builders and accelerates the expansion of the ecosystem. These high-yield passive income streams, all managed within the secure GeeFi Wallet, make holding GEE a powerful strategy for wealth generation. Your Final Chance to Secure a 100x Opportunity In the crypto world, timing is everything. The explosive growth of GeeFi's presale during a period of market uncertainty is a clear indicator of its massive potential. While others are distracted by the unpredictable nature of meme coins, savvy investors are securing their position in a project with a functioning product, a clear roadmap, and staggering ROI potential. Analysts are calling GeeFi a potential 100x gem, and with Phase 2 selling out fast, the fear of missing out is very real. This is your chance to invest in the next big thing before it goes mainstream. Secure your GEE tokens now before this opportunity disappears.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level. In September, the price saw high volatility reaching as high as $0.0260 but failed to stay at the level and ended the month below the $0.02200 mark. In October, the price declined further and ended the month below the $0.01500 mark as bears dominated the crypto markets during the later half of the month. in November, the downtrend continued with VET ending the month below the $0.130 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|VET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-06 21:00:00

It Was Overlooked in Yesterday’s Headlines,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-this-be-the-reason-behind-bitcoins-recent-drop-it-was-overlooked-in-yesterdays-headlines/,"The National Security Strategy published yesterday by US President Donald Trump increased geopolitical risks and created severe unease in the cryptocurrency markets. Following the document, the Bitcoin price fell to the $89,000 level, and the possibility of a new “crypto winter” was brought to the agenda among market participants. The strategy document released by the White House conveys the message that the US will no longer carry a significant portion of the global defense burden alone. Reminiscent of Trump's speech at the United Nations last year, the text states, “The days of the US carrying the entire world order on its back like an Atlas are over.” The document states that developed countries allied with the US must assume greater responsibility in their own regions. Although the strategy document is not legally binding, analysts note that it increases uncertainty in the market, putting downward pressure on crypto assets. Related News: What Do Current Options in Bitcoin (BTC) Indicate? The crypto market's strong reaction stems from expectations that a potential increase in defense spending could delay interest rate cuts by central banks. The strategy document advocates for NATO countries to increase their defense budgets from 2% to 5% of GDP. The possibility of governments borrowing to fund such an increase could increase inflationary pressures. Rising inflation puts pressure on risky assets because it could lead central banks to delay interest rate cuts. Low interest rates typically drive investors into riskier assets, particularly cryptocurrencies. Therefore, any delays in rate cuts could weaken Bitcoin's bullish potential. Despite this, markets are still anticipating a rate cut at next week's Fed meeting. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch tool puts the probability of a 25 basis point cut at 86%. A Reuters survey of 100 economists similarly suggests a high probability of a rate cut. Forecasts on the Polymarket platform put the probability as high as 94%. *This is not investment advice.

She made the statement on X in response to a user who seemed to imply that Binance’s official X account is being run like a group controlled by a “bunch of KOLs.” A quick run through the page will show nothing but official updates and occurrences, but the statement was enough to put He Yi on the defensive. He Yi’s response He Yi did not like the implications of the statement the user made on X. According to her, the official Binance X account is run by competent staff who have the freedom to choose the style of posts. However, that freedom is restricted to their work and the level of creativity they are allowed to apply while doing it. He Yi drew the line at the participation of said employees in the launching or promotion of any tokens. She acknowledged the fact that the BNB memecoin space getting active again has encouraged the community to start tokenizing words excerpted from posts made by the official Binance X account, or by her. But none of that has anything to do with Binance itself. She also insisted that the increased frequency does not mean they will stop posting. She clarified that her statement regarding “encouraging employees to innovate and try” has to do with only their daily work and not “coin issuance projects.” Her post comes at a time when tokenization has taken center stage in crypto discussions, and memecoins have become a fixture in the patchwork. Binance brass preach accountability It is not the first time He Yi has spoken up about the current token trend. In the past, she has urged users to take responsibility for their actions and start actively trying to protect themselves from pump and dump schemes by doing better research and being more vigilant. Chanpeng Zhao has also sounded similar warnings several times in the past. As recently as last month, he took action against people he claimed were selling X accounts he was following by unfollowing many of them. Those accounts have reportedly been used for a laundry list of bad acts. Zhao urged users on X to avoid buying those handles, promising to “unfollow any sold accounts,” and asking his followers to report any account they see on sale. “Let me know,” he wrote . “DM, tweet, notify interns,” adding that he follows accounts randomly because they are “supportive, informative, positive energy people in the community.” Regardless of their warnings, the crypto trenches tend to defy logic and warnings. It only took one photo of CZ’s dog before countless meme tokens named for the Broccoli went viral. CZ’s tweet about the upcoming release of the BNB Chain’s Four.meme token launch at the time also set off a frenzy for meme coins, so-named too. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This follows a Wednesday appeal in which a court overturned a previous dismissal. Florida Ruling Revives Binance Lawsuit A Bloomberg report reveals that a judge has determined that the crypto exchange can be sued locally for allegedly failing to prevent the stolen funds from being transferred. The plaintiff, Jonny Chen, says he fell victim to a 2022 scam that drained 1,000 Bitcoin from his account. He further claims that he immediately notified Binance at the time and requested that the platform freeze the assets, but alleges the company did not act quickly enough, allowing the money to disappear. The victim had initially filed a negligence lawsuit in Florida, but the trial court dismissed the case on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction because Binance is headquartered overseas. However, the recent appeal has now reopened the door for it to proceed. The decision said that Binance’s digital presence and business activity in Florida, including marketing to local users and offering services through its platform, were sufficient to establish legal jurisdiction. The court wrote that Chen “will have a fresh opportunity to show he can sue Binance Holdings Inc. in state court over an alleged theft of eighty million dollars’ worth of Bitcoin.” It also said the lower tribunal had made an error when it decided it could not hear the case. Jurisdiction Disputes This is not the first time a crypto company has delayed or contested legal action by raising jurisdictional challenges. Several large platforms have postponed or escaped litigation by arguing that regulators lacked authority over them due to their overseas registration. For instance, in the case of BitMEX, American investors had accused the firm of market manipulation and operating without proper licensing. However, the company countered that it was beyond U.S. reach because it was incorporated in the Seychelles and had no physical footprint in the country, which led to delays and partial dismissals in the proceedings. KuCoin, another foreign-based operator, faced action in New York for allegedly offering unregistered securities. The company had initially disputed the case by insisting it had no major ties to the United States. Despite this, New York’s Attorney General later relied on the Martin Act to move forward despite the firm’s objections. Bitfinex and its affiliate Tether have also dealt with multiple claims involving alleged market manipulation and transparency shortcomings, with the two initially challenging U.S. authority, citing foreign incorporation. Despite this, some litigation eventually moved forward and resulted in settlements.

Although the recovery of ETH is promising, focus is being placed more on new projects that can provide early-stage opportunity and actual utility. A new crypto with a great potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on the verge of completing an important milestone with Phase 6 about to be fully allocated, having attracted more than 18,350 investors and having raised almost $19.15 million. Mutuum Finance is a well-priced, decentralized lending and borrowing, interest-bearing and yield-driven token, with a well-developed roadmap, culminating with the V1 Sepolia testnet release, making it the best crypto to invest in to be exposed to high potential, utility-driven token early in 2025. Investors searching for the next big crypto and the top crypto to buy are increasingly turning toward MUTM due to its strong fundamentals. Ethereum Recovers $3000 in a Bullish Frenzy Ethereum (ETH) has moved back up to the $3,000 level and it is backed by a big bull divergence that most analysts see this as the indicator of all-time highs. It is predicted that there may be a potential increase to $4,958.75 and some analysts believe that the potential of ETH increase to $5,000 may be achievable as long as the momentum and the market environment continue to be conducive. This newfound confidence in ETH has redirected investor interest to projects with high early potential, and innovative tokens, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), have found themselves attracting more and more investor attention. This rising attention reinforces MUTM’s position as the next big crypto and a top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance Presale The presale of Mutuum Finance is constantly picking up pace with Phase 6 filling up. Starting at $0.01 when the sale was initiated in 2025, MUTM has since taken a steady increase to $0.035 in its present phase, which is an increase of 250% reported even prior to exchange listing. All previous rounds were sold out quickly, which highlights the long-term attention to the utility of the project with its DeFi focus. Phase 6 is nearly emptied, so investors are moving as fast as possible to get tokens before the next price increase puts MUTM even nearer to its established launch price of $0.06. So far, the presale has raised over $19.15 million in contributions and has made MUTM one of the best early-stage crypto projects of the year. In addition to its powerful fundraising trend, Mutuum Finance stands out among most altcoins due to its execution of useful features in a fully developed DeFi system, a feature that is an attractive entry point to early adopters who may be interested in long-term usability. With this level of traction, traders label MUTM as the next big crypto and among the absolute top crypto to buy before its price increases. Growth indicates the extent to which MUTM tokens have been adopted by first time entrants. The project has been attracting interest in the world of crypto due to the growth and advancement of the platform and presale. A total amount of 1.82 billion tokens has been assigned to the presale. Over 800 million tokens are already sold. Since the current stage is nearing its limit and the price is drawing nearer to the $0.06 listing value, the urgency has been increasing. This is coupled with the lending and borrowing led, yield oriented DeFi structure of the platform, which contributes to making MUTM a prospective early stage asset to accumulate. Such adoption further strengthens its reputation as the next big crypto for long-term growth and a top crypto to buy during its presale window. Roadmap Development Mutuum Finance is in Phase 2 of its roadmap, which is core protocol development. This stage comprises smart-contract engineering, integration of the backend system, revised risk-management systems, liquidation operations, and sophisticated analytics. Frequent development team updates are indicators of a serious dedication to the provision of secure, efficient, and scalable DeFi environment. With these elements approaching their completion, the expectation grows more and more regarding the upcoming Version 1 release of the protocol, a move that would go a long way in increasing platform adoption and solidifying MUTM as a newcomer in the decentralized finance industry. Mutuum Finance has received almost 18,350 investors who have invested almost $19.15 million, with Phase 6 almost sold out at $0.035. Its price is up by 250% since, with this being the last opportunity to purchase the token before Phase 7 raises its price to $0.04. As V1 Sepolia testnet is just a few days away, MUTM will be providing a fully operational DeFi platform where lending and borrowing are possible with interest rates on yields. Before this discounted phase dies off, early investors will be able to get tokens at the official presale. This opportunity positions MUTM as the next big crypto and the top crypto to buy.

The account ties early, small bets to later services now offered to advisors and clients. Early Interest Turned Practical Around 2013, a small group inside Fidelity began meeting to learn what Bitcoin might mean for the firm. They mapped out 52 possible uses. Most ideas did not survive testing. One early result — accepting Bitcoin donations for charity — gave the team credibility outside the company and opened doors for deeper work. That early credibility made it easier for the firm to test bigger ideas without waiting for orders from the top. A Bold Mining Bet Paid Off Johnson pushed for a $200,000 purchase of Antminer hardware at a time many inside opposed the move. Reports say that mining effort became “probably the single highest IRR business” Fidelity has had. The decision put staff into Bitcoin’s technical layers, giving them real experience with wallets, security, and the plumbing of the network long before many rivals caught up. Company Moves Into Custody Based on reports, demand from financial advisors drove Fidelity toward custody services. Advisors wanted secure ways to help clients hold and pass on Bitcoin, and Fidelity responded by building custody, custody-adjacent products, and support across asset management and research. Johnson told the audience she owns Bitcoin personally and described it as a core digital asset that could play a role in people’s savings plans. She calls it crypto’s “gold standard.” Exchange Supply Drops As Accumulation Continues Market data referenced in the session showed Bitcoin trading above $89,000 while balances on centralized exchanges fell to roughly 1.8 million BTC — a level not seen since 2017, according to aggregated CryptoQuant and Glassnode figures cited by BRN Research. Realized-cap growth stayed positive on a monthly basis, which analysts interpret as fresh capital entering the market even when price moves stay contained. Shark Wallets And Network Growth For Ethereum Reports also pointed to Ethereum strength. ETH climbed past $3,200 as so-called shark wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH resumed accumulation. Daily new addresses briefly neared 190,000 following the Fusaka upgrade, a spike that analysts say often lines up with stronger demand for ETH. Market Signals And What’s Missing Analysts quoted in the briefing noted that supply leaving exchanges and steady accumulation point to longer-term holders taking control. What the market lacks, they said, is a decisive push into the roughly $96K to $106K band that would signal a broader breakout. For now, accumulation continues while prices trade in a tighter range. Based on reports from the conference, Fidelity’s crypto path reads like a slow build: small internal experiments grew into real operations, and a handful of early bets — including a $200,000 mining play — gave the firm practical know-how. Combined with current on-chain signs of accumulation, the picture suggests established players and patient holders are shaping market supply even as price momentum waits for a clearer trigger.

With key support levels holding and bullish patterns forming, the market may be setting up for a notable upside. Golden Pocket Rejection: Confirming The High-Risk Scenario In a recent update on X, analyst Luca referenced his recent market commentary, noting that Ethereum price action unfolded exactly as he had anticipated, with the price tapping into the lost high-timeframe support range. This range aligned with the golden pocket between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels, and the price rejected there, confirming the high-risk scenario he had highlighted in advance. Related Reading: Ethereum Coils For A Breakout As IH&S + Heavy Accumulation Emerges Since that rejection, the price has broken below the key 0.618 Fibonacci Point of Interest (POI). However, the asset is still managing to hold above the crucial 1-Day Bull Market Support Band. Luca stressed that this band has historically served as a strong reversal spot over the last couple of months. Thus, he believes the current low-timeframe market structure is not yet fully invalidated. Despite this technical hold, the analyst reiterated his cautious approach, stating that until he sees clear signs of strength on the low-timeframes, signs that can durably confirm the bottom is in and that key support levels are properly reclaimed, he won’t scale out of his edges. Luca concluded that until that concrete bullish confirmation materializes, the most likely outcome for the immediate future remains further consolidation. The market needs time to absorb the recent volatility and build a new base before a more durable reversal to the upside can take hold. ETH/BTC Trendline Breakout: Market Risk Appetite Returns Crypto analyst Paramatik outlined that a major structural event has occurred on the ETH/BTC charts: a falling trend breakout. This is a highly significant development, although Paramatik suggests that a retest of this broken trendline may occur before the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Sitting On Its Most Critical On-Chain Support Level — A Rally Emerging? The analyst provided clarity on what this breakout means for the broader market. First and foremost, this situation is interpreted as a strengthening signal for Ethereum. When ETH begins to gain value relative to Bitcoin, it typically indicates that the market’s overall risk appetite is returning, as investors shift capital from BTC to ETH. Secondly, the gained strength in Ethereum is often the key trigger for the start of the much-anticipated altcoin season. This is because investors first shift funds from BTC to ETH, and then move capital into the riskier, smaller altcoins in hopes of achieving higher returns. Paramatik summarized his findings by stating that this breakout in the ETH/BTC pair is not merely a technical line break; it is a harbinger of a market direction change. The analyst concluded with an analogy that the market has reached a state where every external event, even humorously irrelevant ones, could affect crypto prices.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $573.15, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,327.46 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we’ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question “How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?” and we’ll try to answer that.

Overall the altcoin has gained 0.58% of its value across the last 24-hours as SOL stabilizes at the price level. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL holds above $130 The one-day price chart of the Solana shows that the decline is continuing with the drop below the $125 mark before the bulls found support enabling recovery. However, after failing to climb past $140 the price is now headed back towards $130. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is narrow, leading to low volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $145.58 The indicator’s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $125.68. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the neutral area but is quite close to the oversold region. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 42.03, and its downwards curve signifies a dominance of sellers. If selling activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows strong bearish activity at the current price level as bears erase last few days progress. The altcoin’s price has decreased to $133 as bears continue to dominate the price action. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a higher volatility level. This level of volatility signifies increased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $146.80, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $133.08, indicating support. The RSI indicator is in the oversold region. Currently at 40.32 the RSI curve is pointing down, confirming an increase in selling activities. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph indicates support from the buying side of the market at the current price level. We can expect further decline if selling activities persist for a few more hours.

If selling pressure continues, we might see the price fall to $130. On the other hand, if buyers return to control the price chart, we might see a price increase to retest the resistance level at $140. Is SOL a good investment?

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170. In November, the decline continued with SOL ending the month below the $130 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-06 22:15:00

The ETF, which is the first pure spot-based product focused on XRP, recorded strong activity on its opening day, hitting $58 million . Even with this positive event, the overall market environment has remained weak, placing downward pressure on XRP. Current Market Performance A market-wide pullback has affected most major assets. Bitcoin dropped below the important $100,000 level, and this shift put pressure on XRP as well. Since the decline started in early November, XRP’s market value has fallen by $14.63 billion, bringing its total valuation to $137.12 billion. This represents a large drop from its highest market cap of $216.69 billion, set on July 18 when XRP’s price reached $3.66. Compared to that peak, XRP is now short by almost $80 billion. If the market recovers, XRP could regain the value it has lost. However, with ETF inflows rising rapidly , some projections go further. These explore what could happen if XRP gains up to $1 trillion or more, going far beyond its previous highs. Can XRP Add $1 Trillion to its Market Cap? Much of the current speculation centers on what would happen if XRP’s market cap expanded by an additional $1 trillion . This level of growth is rare in the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin remains the only digital asset to have crossed that threshold. It reached a trillion-dollar valuation in early 2021, increased further during the peak of that cycle, then dropped sharply during the 2022 bear market. It has since recovered and now holds a valuation of about $1.92 trillion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If XRP adds $1 trillion to its present market cap, the new total would stand at $1.137 trillion. Based on the current supply of about 60 billion tokens, this would place XRP close to $18.95. This price would exceed its previous highs and move it into the double-digit range that analysts have discussed for years. Expectations for Future Levels Several analysts have mentioned the possibility of XRP climbing above $18. One analyst, Dr. Cat, has suggested that this range becomes possible if the XRP-to-Bitcoin ratio rises to a specific zone and Bitcoin reaches a much higher price. A separate view from Changelly projects that XRP could reach $19.62. However, Changelly’s timeline places this several years from now, with 2030 as the target period. If XRP ever reached a valuation of $1.137 trillion, it would rank among the most valuable companies in the world, higher than Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan, Walmart, and Visa. While this scenario is hypothetical, it reflects ongoing discussions about XRP’s long-term potential . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $88,951.1. This sudden movement has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting urgent questions about market stability and future direction. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters for your portfolio. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Fall Below $89,000? Market corrections are a normal part of any asset’s lifecycle, and Bitcoin is no exception. The drop below $89,000 is likely a confluence of several factors. First, profit-taking by short-term traders after a recent rally can create immediate selling pressure. Second, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as interest rate fears or geopolitical tensions, often trigger risk-off sentiment, impacting high-volatility assets like crypto. Finally, large sell orders on major exchanges can trigger automated stop-losses, accelerating a downward move. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for navigating volatility. What Does This Price Action Mean for Traders? For active traders, this dip presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Key support and resistance levels are now being tested. The immediate focus will be on whether the Bitcoin price can hold above $88,000 or if further downside is imminent. Here are actionable insights for different trading styles: For Swing Traders: Monitor the $88,000 level closely. A strong bounce could signal a buying opportunity, while a break below may indicate a trend reversal. For Long-Term Holders (HODLers): Short-term fluctuations are often noise. This dip could be a chance to dollar-cost average if you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term thesis. For New Investors: Volatility is standard. Never invest more than you can afford to lose and consider this a live lesson in market cycles. How Should Investors React to Bitcoin’s Volatility? Emotional decisions are the enemy of sound investment. When the Bitcoin price moves sharply, it’s vital to stick to your pre-defined strategy. Did you have a plan for a 5% or 10% drop? If not, now is the time to create one. Diversification remains a cornerstone of risk management. Furthermore, consider the source of your information. Rely on data from reputable exchanges and trusted analysts rather than social media hype. This disciplined approach separates successful investors from reactive speculators. What’s the Future Outlook for the Bitcoin Price? Predicting the exact future Bitcoin price is impossible, but we can assess the landscape. On-chain data, such as exchange flows and whale wallet activity, provides clues about investor sentiment. Additionally, institutional adoption trends and regulatory developments will play a significant long-term role. While today’s drop is notable, it’s a single data point in Bitcoin’s broader journey. The fundamental narrative around digital scarcity and decentralized finance remains unchanged for many proponents. In conclusion, the break below $89,000 is a significant market event that demands attention but not panic. It underscores the inherently volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets. By focusing on data, maintaining a clear strategy, and understanding the underlying causes, investors can navigate these waves with greater confidence. The key takeaway is to use such movements as learning experiences to refine your approach to the dynamic world of crypto investing. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the Bitcoin price drop a sign of a bear market? A: Not necessarily. A single drop below a support level is a correction, not a confirmed bear market. A bear market is typically defined by a sustained downtrend over a longer period. Q2: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A: This depends entirely on your investment goals and risk tolerance. Selling based on fear often leads to buying back at higher prices. Consult your investment plan before making emotional decisions. Q3: What is a good entry point after this dip? A: There is no perfect entry. Strategies like dollar-cost averaging (investing a fixed amount regularly) can help mitigate timing risk instead of trying to “catch the bottom.” Q4: Could the Bitcoin price go lower than $88,000? A: Yes, it is possible. Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. The next major support levels are often watched, but nothing is guaranteed in these markets. Q5: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies (altcoins)? A> Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. A significant drop in BTC’s price usually leads to larger percentage drops in most altcoins, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” Q6: Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price data? A> Use established tracking websites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, and verify prices directly on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase for the most accurate real-time data.

55442403,https://timestabloid.com/?p=91621,1765065645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Crypto Analyst: XRP Flash Crash Imminent. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-analyst-xrp-flash-crash-imminent-heres-why/,"Market commentator ExtraVod has issued a new warning about XRP, stating that a flash crash is imminent. According to him, current conditions suggest the asset may face a sharp downward move before any meaningful recovery. His remarks follow several days of price weakness, as XRP has gradually retreated from the rebound that pushed it to $2.21 on December 4. Since then, the asset has slipped to about $2.03, a decline that may only represent the early stage of a broader correction. Market Liquidations and Volatility In his video , ExtraVod highlighted rising liquidations across the crypto market. Citing The Kobeissi Letter, he noted that $200 million in positions were wiped out within four hours on December 5 after Bitcoin briefly fell below $90,000. XRP FLASH CRASH IMMINENT — ExtraVOD (@ExtraVOD_) December 5, 2025 Although BTC later steadied near $89,500, Coinglass data showed liquidations climbing to $412.6 million over 24 hours, mostly from long positions. ExtraVod said this sharp increase reflects a stressed market and creates conditions where a sudden, disruptive move becomes more likely as liquidity clusters and traders remain overexposed. Is a Flash Crash Coming? A central part of ExtraVod’s argument comes from the recent behavior of XRP’s price structure. He highlighted that since April 2025, the asset has formed a sequence of higher lows during each corrective phase. XRP bottomed near $1.61 in early April, around $1.77 in October , then near $1.81 in late November, and finally at approximately $1.98 at the start of December. While this pattern may appear constructive, ExtraVod believes these levels have become too narrow and have attracted an excessive number of stop-loss orders. He contends that this cluster of liquidity below each successive bottom creates an incentive for market makers to drive the price downward in order to clear these positions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He warned that such a move could happen quickly and forcefully, which is why he characterizes it as a potential flash crash. Even so, he does not view the scenario as entirely negative. He maintains that once this liquidity is removed, XRP could break free and establish a more stable foundation for upward momentum . Additional Bullish Signals ExtraVod also highlighted XRP’s weekly RSI, noting what he considers a hidden bullish divergence . He explained that XRP formed a higher low on price after its November 2024 bottom near $0.5, while the RSI set a lower low, falling from about 44 and potentially dropping below 30 if a flash crash occurs. He believes this pattern suggests the broader uptrend remains intact. If a flash crash pushes the RSI into oversold territory, XRP could rebound from that level and eventually move toward new highs once volatility settles.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.25 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility. 2025 has been a defining stress test: Pi surged to about $2.98 in February, crashed to a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, and now trades near $0.22 in early December, highlighting extreme volatility as the year closes. But basic building blocks continue to keep investor interest alive, including the Passkey security improvement to Pi Wallet, Pi DEX, and AMM on Testnet, Pi Network Ventures pushing towards decentralization and AI with OpenMind, and millions of new KYC verifications and continuing projects such as the 2025 Pi Hackathon and Sign Protocol partnership. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2025–2031 favors a sustained recovery or further downside. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.2269 Price Change 24h 1.8% Market Cap $1.89B Circulating Supply 8.34B PI Trading Volume 24h $14.07M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.2269 Price Prediction $ 0.1692(-25.01%) Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 5.14% (High) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2348 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 48.50 (Neutral) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Pi trades around $0.2269, up about 1.8% in the past 24 hours after bouncing off intraday lows near $0.221. Daily RSI is near 45, still below the neutral 50 line, while MACD is around zero with a slightly negative histogram, suggesting weak upside momentum in a wider downtrend. Key resistance remains at $0.240 and $0.250, with support clustered at $0.220, then deeper around $0.205–$0.200. As of December 6, 2025, Pi Network is posting a modest recovery after earlier December weakness. PI network is currently changing hands near $0.2267, with a market cap at roughly $1.89 billion and 24-hour volume down to about $14 million, signaling that the latest bounce is happening on lighter trading activity. Price is holding above the $0.22 floor but has not yet shown the strength needed to challenge the major resistance band just below $0.25. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows a small green candle following several sessions of sideways-to-lower action since the late-November peak near $0.28 and $0.29. Today’s candle trades between $0.2237 and $0.2325, with a close around $0.2269, which reflects stabilization rather than a decisive reversal. Pi remains well below its November top and still trades under the key $0.24 and $0.25 resistance zone, meaning the larger 2025 downtrend is intact. The RSI (14) stands near 45.17, with its signal baseline around 52.32. This places momentum slightly below neutral but off the more depressed levels seen earlier in the week, showing that selling pressure has eased even though buyers have not fully taken back control. A sustained push above the 50 midpoint would be an early sign that bulls are regaining momentum. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26), the histogram is about -0.0025, while the MACD and signal lines sit close to -0.0010 and 0.0015. All three readings are very close to the zero line, but the negative histogram tells us the MACD line is just under the signal line again. This configuration signals fading upside momentum: the prior bullish impulse has largely run out of steam, yet the market has not rolled into a sharp new down-leg. Immediate resistance is still concentrated around $0.240, where several November rallies stalled, followed by a heavier ceiling in the $0.260and $0.280 area. First support remains at $0.220, with stronger backing at $0.205 and $0.200. A 24-hour close below $0.220 would revive the risk of retesting the October capitulation lows, while a decisive break and hold above $0.240–$0.250 would suggest that December’s volatility is beginning to resolve into a more constructive base. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi is trading around $0.2266, almost flat on the session after failing to build on its earlier intraday bounce. Price continues to move in a tight band between roughly $0.22 and $0.24, with the structure since late November still showing lower highs from the peak near $0.28, which keeps the short-term bias mildly bearish to sideways. The RSI (14) is at about 42.47, with its signal line near 40.02, meaning momentum is still below the neutral 50 mark but no longer oversold. This points to weak but improving buying interest: bulls are defending the $0.22 area, yet they have not mustered enough strength to flip the trend. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the three readings sit close to zero around 0.0002, –0.0025, –0.0028, indicating that both MACD lines and the histogram are clustered around the baseline. This shows a very flat momentum profile, with neither side in clear control and no strong follow-through after the recent bounce. For a convincing bullish reversal on this 4-hour timeframe, Pi would need to break above the $0.235–$0.240 zone with a clear MACD turn higher; otherwise, the market remains vulnerable to another dip back toward $0.22 if sellers reassert themselves. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2984 SELL SMA 5 $0.2746 SELL SMA 10 $0.2590 SELL SMA 21 $0.2456 SELL SMA 50 $0.2348 SELL SMA 100 $0.2800 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2383 SELL EMA 5 $0.2426 SELL EMA 10 $0.2650 SELL EMA 21 $0.3013 SELL EMA 50 $0.3603 SELL EMA 100 $0.4533 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to stay range-bound between $0.22 and $0.24 in the short term, with weak but stabilizing momentum as buyers and sellers balance out. A daily close above $0.24 and $0.25 with RSI pushing back over 50 and a clean bullish MACD crossover could open room toward $0.26 and $0.28. If $0.22 breaks on strong volume instead, focus will quickly shift to the deeper $0.205 and $0.200 support zone and a possible retest of October’s lows. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price up today? Pi is up today mainly because Pi Network rolled out AI-powered KYC tools that speed up verification for millions of users, boosting confidence ahead of December’s 190M PI token unlock. Technically, the price also bounced from key Fibonacci and support levels near $0.223–$0.225 after RSI left oversold territory, attracting short-term dip buyers. However, gains are capped by ongoing regulatory worries, especially China’s “air coin” warning and thin liquidity that could be pressured once the $43M unlock hits the market. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network is traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-07 00:15:00

While the premier cryptocurrency has been on something resembling a recovery path since the market bloodbath, some sectors believe that the bear season has already kicked off. With BTC sitting beneath its opening price of 2025, it is becoming increasingly difficult to make a bullish case for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Moreover, an interesting data point about a relevant class of Bitcoin investors has emerged, further adding credence to the beginning of a possible bear market. Are Bitcoin Treasury Firms Offloading Their Coins? In a new post on X, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, shared an on-chain insight to support the hypothesis that the Bitcoin bear market has started. This conclusion is based on the Balance Growth of an investor group known as the “dolphins.” Dolphins refer to a group of crypto investors holding substantial amounts of a coin, placing them between small investors (shrimps) and the largest investors (whales). Specifically, Moreno described dolphins as wallet addresses with significant BTC holdings between 100 – 1,000 coins. According to the latest data from CryptoQuant, the growth in the Dolphins’ BTC holdings has slowed down in the past year and appears to be in a downward trend. Moreno believes that this negative change points to the emergence of a Bitcoin bear market . Moreno revealed that these Dolphin addresses had increased year-over-year by roughly 965,000 BTC when the BTC price hit its current all-time high around $125,000. Now that the BTC price is nearly 30% below its record high, the Bitcoin Dolphins’ balance stands at around 694,000 coins. Moreno wrote on X: This address cohort includes ETFs and Treasury companies, which have also stopped buying. More interestingly, the CryptoQuant Head of Research revealed that this investor group consists of ETF issuers and Treasury companies, which have stopped purchasing Bitcoin. According to data from SoSoValue, the US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have posted net outflows in five out of the last six weeks. Meanwhile, BTC and crypto treasury companies have struggled in the past few months, with retail investors losing tens of billions to the hype. While there have been rarely reports of crypto treasury sell-offs, this decline in these Dolphins’ holdings tells an entirely different story. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,151, reflecting an over 3% decline in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin dolphins|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-07 00:30:36

Pat Gelsinger, the former Intel CEO who spent 35 years at the chip giant, is now leading a startup called xLight that just secured a preliminary deal for up to $150 million from the US Commerce Department. This isn’t just another funding round—it’s a bold attempt to solve the semiconductor industry’s most critical bottleneck and potentially resurrect Moore’s Law from its perceived slowdown. Why Pat Gelsinger Bet His Reputation on xLight A year after his departure from Intel, Pat Gelsinger hasn’t slowed down. Now a general partner at Playground Global, he’s working with 10 startups, but xLight has captured his primary attention. “I have this long-term mission to continue to see Moore’s law in the semiconductor industry,” Gelsinger said at a recent StrictlyVC event. “We think this is the technology that will wake up Moore’s law.” What makes xLight so special? The startup is developing massive “free electron lasers” powered by particle accelerators that could revolutionize semiconductor lithography —the process of etching microscopic patterns onto silicon wafers. Gelsinger explains the significance: “About half of the capital goes into lithography. In the middle of a lithography machine is light… this ability to keep innovating for shorter wavelength, higher power light is the essence of being able to continue to innovate for more advanced semiconductors.” The Government’s Unprecedented Role in Semiconductor Innovation The xLight deal represents a significant shift in how the US approaches technological competitiveness. The Commerce Department is set to become xLight’s largest shareholder through funding from the Chips and Science Act. This arrangement has raised eyebrows in Silicon Valley, where free-market principles have long been sacred. California Governor Gavin Newsom captured the industry’s unease: “What the hell happened to free enterprise?” But Gelsinger remains unapologetic about the government partnership. “I measure it by the results,” he said. “Does it drive the results that we want and that we need to reinvigorate our industrial policies? Many of our competitive countries don’t have such debates. They’re moving forward with the policies that are necessary to accomplish their competitive outcomes.” Key Aspect Traditional Approach xLight’s Innovation Light Source Integrated into each machine External utility-scale system Scale Machine-sized components Football field-sized facilities Wavelength 13.5 nanometers (current EUV) Targeting 2 nanometers Power Source Conventional lasers Free electron lasers with particle accelerators How xLight’s Technology Challenges ASML’s Dominance The ASML competition represents one of xLight’s biggest challenges. ASML, the Dutch company, currently dominates the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) market with near-total control. xLight’s approach fundamentally differs from ASML’s integrated systems. Nicholas Kelez, xLight’s founder and CEO, explains their revolutionary concept: “We go away from building an integrated light source with the tool, which is what ASML does now and that fundamentally constrains you to make it smaller and less powerful. We treat light the same way you treat electrical power or HVAC. We build outside the fab at utility scale and then distribute in.” The company plans to build machines roughly 100 meters by 50 meters—about the size of a football field—that will sit outside semiconductor fabrication plants. These free electron lasers would generate extreme ultraviolet light at wavelengths as precise as 2 nanometers, far more powerful than the 13.5 nanometer wavelengths currently used by ASML. The Road Ahead: Can This xLight Startup Deliver? xLight faces significant hurdles on its path to commercialization. The company aims to produce its first silicon wafers by 2028 and have its first commercial system online by 2029. However, several critical questions remain unanswered: Customer commitments: No major chipmakers have committed to purchasing xLight’s technology yet ASML integration: While discussions are ongoing, ASML hasn’t formally committed to buying the technology Competition: Other startups like Substrate (backed by Peter Thiel) are pursuing similar approaches Technical challenges: Building football field-sized laser facilities presents unprecedented engineering challenges Gelsinger acknowledges the uncertainty: “We’ve agreed in principle on the terms, but like any of these contracts, there’s still work to get done.” When asked whether the $150 million funding could end up being double the announced amount—or potentially not materialize at all—he remained candid about the ongoing negotiations. FAQs: Understanding the xLight Revolution Who is Pat Gelsinger and why is he involved with xLight? Pat Gelsinger spent 35 years across two stints at Intel, eventually serving as CEO before his departure in late 2023. He’s now a general partner at Playground Global and serves as xLight’s executive chairman, bringing his semiconductor expertise to the startup. What makes xLight’s technology different from ASML’s? While ASML builds integrated lithography machines with built-in light sources, xLight treats light as a utility. They plan to build massive free electron laser facilities outside fabs and distribute the light to multiple machines, potentially achieving shorter wavelengths and higher power. How does this relate to Moore’s Law? Moore’s Law predicts that computing power should double every two years. As chip features shrink, better lithography technology becomes essential. xLight’s potentially more powerful light sources could enable continued miniaturization, thus sustaining Moore’s Law. What role does the US government play? The Commerce Department is providing up to $150 million through the Chips and Science Act, becoming xLight’s largest shareholder. This represents a shift toward more direct government involvement in strategic technologies. Who is Nicholas Kelez? Nicholas Kelez founded xLight after leading quantum computer development at PsiQuantum and spending two decades building large-scale X-ray science facilities at national labs including SLAC and Lawrence Berkeley. The Bottom Line: A Calculated Gamble with National Implications Pat Gelsinger’s bet on xLight represents more than just another venture investment—it’s a strategic move with implications for national competitiveness, technological sovereignty, and the future of computing. The partnership between a Silicon Valley veteran and the US government signals a new era in industrial policy, where the lines between public and private sector innovation are blurring. For Gelsinger, this is personal. “My mind is so stretched here, and I’m just grateful that the Playground team would have me to join them and let me make them smarter and be a rookie venture capitalist,” he said. Then he added with a grin: “And I gave my wife back her weekends.” Whether xLight succeeds or fails, its story illuminates the changing dynamics of technological innovation in an era of geopolitical competition. The semiconductor wars have entered a new phase, and the battlefield now includes government boardrooms as well as research laboratories.

Some of the names that are making the most noise in the new cycle are Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and the new up-and-coming player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , three very different players but sharing the same commonality, the potential for high returns. ADA remains one of the assets that many people are banking on for the long term, as the growth of the ecosystem sends the message for potential re-pricing, and DOGE, as it always does, remains one of the most volatile assets that can easily spark off explosions and rallies based on the evergreen factor of the community. But the new kid on the block, MUTM, has already put itself into the frame as the best crypto to buy, based on the break-out presale and the quick-growing demand that’s available for the crypto, which is priced at $0.035. Investors are increasingly seeing MUTM as the next big crypto to watch. Cardano Rebounds Sharply as Buyers Support Crucial Demand Area Cardano (ADA) had finally exhibited some kind of reaction as it fell as low as $0.37, but ever since, the traders had initiated strong buy signals that raised the prices from $0.37 to $0.45, showing an improvement of over 20%, which again perceives the region of $0.32-$0.36 as an important area where the demand for ADA resides. On the basis of the performance above $0.42, the short-term trend for ADA looks more favorable, opening gates for potential targets such as $0.48, $0.52, and $0.57. As ADA tries to sustain this upsurge, the focus of investors is shifting towards the new DeFi platforms developing rapid network effects, which gives increasing attention to the potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the next big crypto in 2026. Dogecoin Attempts Rebound as Buyers Defend Key Support Levels Dogecoin (DOGE) had been falling for the last few weeks, but it appears that the price movements are now coming alive as it rebounds from the major support area, which had previously acted as the same area that initiated many rallies. Market players are slowly making their entrance again, and if the trend continues, it looks like it could make an attempt to re-enter the upper levels, thus igniting the bull run again. As different coins start showing some activity despite the turbulent marketplace, the focus of the investors is drifting towards the new possibilities that are coming alive, thus naturally leading to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), considered the best crypto to buy for its early-stage potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Nearly Finished in Phase 6 Mutuum Finance enters the last leg of the Phase 6 presale as the interest and demand for the project show no signs of slowing. Created to promote multi-level pricing, the ongoing presale offers the best crypto to buy entry levels for the earliest investors. Started off initially at $0.01 during the Phase 1, MUTM is now up to $0.035 during Phase 6, which marks a 250% increase. The total amount raised during the presale thus far is well over $19.18 million, and it has accumulated support from above 18,350 holders. Since Phase 6 is already over 95% subscribed, the supply available for the same price would not be much. Once Phase 7 starts, the cost for the token will increase by 20%, and it will be $0.04, which makes Phase 6 one of the last chances for such cheap investment for MUTM. This presale phase clearly indicates the potential for the next big crypto. Investors that participated during the early levels of the presale are guaranteed some of the cheapest entry costs, and the potential for returns could reach 500% during launch. Apart from the benefit of cost, Mutuum Finance stands out as it offers a two-level lending model, an extended lending model based on the stablecoin, completely auditable smart contracts, and tokenomics that promote growth. These elements make MUTM the best crypto to buy for investors interested in utility and growth potential. Effective Risk Management Serves as the Foundation for Safety Mutuum Finance implements the dynamic risk management system as an integral component of the Mutuum protocol. Loan-to-Value ratios and Liquidation thresholds are determined based on the volatility of the respective collateral, which means that stronger, less volatile collateral gets to support higher LTV ratios, while tougher ratios are required for less reliable collateral. Other reserve multipliers factor into the equation, ranging between 10%, which applies to less risky groups, and 35% for the higher-risk pools. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has seen $19.18M raised from 18,350+ investors, and Phase 6 is over 95% sold for $0.035. The V1 Sepolia testnet launch event is close, providing an entire DeFi platform. This provides one of the last opportunities to acquire the best crypto to buy before the price increase to $0.04 during Phase 7, confirming MUTM as the next big crypto to watch in 2026.

In a video posted on X, Claver revealed that his firm has been in recent conversations with large family offices that are now making significant allocations into XRP. His comments arrive at a moment when XRP’s long-term narrative is witnessing increased interest due to ETFs, and they highlight a shift happening among investors who have always avoided cryptocurrencies altogether. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says Wealthy Families Quietly Accumulating XRP Claver explained that XRP ownership is currently extremely limited relative to the global population, noting that only around 8 million wallets exist on the XRPL. Half of those wallets contain fewer than 100 XRP, which makes existing holders far more uncommon than they may think. He contrasted this with Bitcoin’s widespread ownership, arguing that XRP is still early in its adoption curve. He said the wealthy families showing interest are not looking for quick profits. According to him, they have already built their fortunes and instead see XRP as a form of insurance. According to his post, these families are buying crypto, not to get richer, but to protect the wealth they already have. He described their interest in cryptocurrencies as a hedge. These investors want something uncorrelated in their portfolios ahead of any potential shock in traditional markets. Claver’s $10K Price Target And The Conditions He Outlined When asked where he sees the price of XRP going, Claver stated that he believes the cryptocurrency could be trading at $10,000 by late 2026 or early 2027. He tied this prediction to how much ecosystem infrastructure becomes active on the XRPL over the next two years. He said the network would need substantial institutional-grade utilities, including XRP treasury systems, Evernorth’s launch, on-chain borrowing mechanisms, and new amendments to the XRP Ledger that will bring in additional compliance layers and smart-contract features. His projection assumes that rising network volume will require higher liquidity levels and that price stability at four- and five-figure ranges will only be achievable if the ledger is handling large-scale financial flows. He also pointed to ETFs as a major factor in shaping supply and demand, noting that as ETF adoption grows, more XRP will be locked away in long-term institutional products. Speaking of ETFs, Spot XRP ETFs are now approaching $1 billion in total net assets and could cross that threshold within the next few days. Since their debut, these funds have taken in about $897.35 million worth of XRP from exchanges and OTC desks, and they have yet to record a single day of outflows.

With its weak performance over the past few months and price action showing signs of exhaustion , the analyst has predicted that the next major support level lies more than 33% below all-time highs. Analyst Breaks Down Chart Signaling Bitcoin Price Crash TradingView crypto expert ‘EliteGoldAnalysis’ has released a fresh chart study on Bitcoin’s next selling move, warning that the cryptocurrency’s downtrend may not be over yet. The analyst’s breakdown highlights a key support level he believes Bitcoin could crash to if its current downward momentum persists. EliteGoldAnalysis outlines a price structure on the chart that begins with a weak high, a technical condition that often reflects a liquidity grab before a reversal. The appearance of a weak high near the top of Bitcoin’s most recent rally indicates that buyers may have been swept out before the momentum fully shifted. This pattern is accompanied by a steadily forming lower high, hinting at a developing bearish structure . From his perspective, the analyst explains that a short bias becomes relevant only after a clear confirmation of a bearish trend. Based on the Bitcoin price chart, such confirmation could include a break of minor support beneath the weak high, followed by a retest of that level. EliteGoldAnalysis also noted that a bearish rejection through wick actions or a strong bearish close would strengthen the case for a temporary Bitcoin price crash . While the analyst’s breakdown is just an interpretation of the chart rather than a trading call, Bitcoin’s price structure still hints at a possible retracement amid strengthening sell-side pressure . How Low Bitcoin Price Could Decline In his TradingView chart, EliteGoldAnalysis outlined critical zones that could dictate Bitcoin’s next bearish moves . The first region to watch is the potential “target level” marked in the purple zone above $85,000. The analyst views this level as a demand or imbalance area. Should Bitcoin reach and hold this target, it may act as the first checkpoint before the market decides whether to correct downwards or push higher. Just beneath the $85,000 region lies a “strong support level” highlighted in blue at $84,000 on the chart. EliteGoldAnalysis predicts that Bitcoin could decline to as low as this $84,000 support area. The analyst suggests that this level is the final retracement target, potentially representing a significant liquidity pool that could attract buyers if the price declines. A decisive drop toward this level would reflect a more than 6% decline from current levels above $89,000. Such a move would also mark the completion of the downside move implied by the chart structure. Over the past 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin has fallen roughly 3%, meaning a crash to $84,000 would further prolong the ongoing downtrend .

Meme assets often return during optimistic market phases, and FLOKI’s large community makes it a familiar starting point for conversation. Analysts at CoinDesk point out that user-driven tokens often outperform when retail interest rises. This sets the stage for a deeper evaluation of the best crypto to invest in 2025 as traders balance stability with early-stage opportunity. The market is now shifting toward ecosystems that combine transparent tokenomics, structured reward systems, and long-term utility. Projects with clear presale frameworks gain notable traction as buyers look for predictable scaling models rather than hype alone. While several assets demonstrate solid growth potential, one project is now gaining record attention for its strong mechanics, early-stage upside, and rapid token demand. This lineup highlights six assets shaping the broader conversation around the best crypto to invest in 2025 . 1. BullZilla (BZIL): The Best Crypto To Invest In 2025 With A High Velocity Presale Model BullZilla progresses through Stage 13, known as Zilla Sideways Smash, at a presale price of $0.00033238, and has already raised over $1 million. More than 32 billion tokens have been sold to over 3,600 holders, reflecting strong demand. Early participants in Stage 13B secured returns exceeding 5,680.52% as the token moves toward its projected listing value of $0.00527. Current participants still achieve approximately 1,485.95% projected ROI. A one-thousand-dollar purchase equals about 3.008 million tokens today. The next stage lifts pricing from $0.00033238 to $0.00033905, continuing BullZilla’s fast-moving upward valuation curve. A Roaring ROI Path That Pushes Early Gains Higher BullZilla ‘s structure creates a rising price floor, as each stage locks in previous levels and reduces the available supply. A three-thousand-dollar entry today secures more than nine million tokens. If the price reaches its projected listing of 0.00527, that position could exceed fifty thousand dollars. The model attracts early participants because it combines predictable price growth with transparent on-chain mechanics. Join BullZilla now at $0.00033238 before the next 2.006 percent price surge pushes early gains out of reach. 2. Sui (SUI): A High-Performance Chain Redefining User Experience Sui continues to gain attention for its parallel execution model, which improves speed and supports complex applications without network strain. Developers use Sui to build features that require low latency and high reliability. Its resource ownership system gives users unique control over assets while enabling advanced digital identity and gaming functions. Recent integrations highlight extended interoperability as Sui strengthens its developer environment. Analysts note its appeal among builders seeking predictable performance without high fees. As adoption grows across consumer applications, Sui positions itself as a strong contender in the evolving landscape of advanced blockchain ecosystems. 3. MoonBull (MOBU): A High APY Staking Ecosystem Built For Long-Term Growth MoonBull merges entertainment with a structured scarcity system that rewards steady participation. Built on Ethereum, the project uses reflections, auto liquidity support, and a multi-stage supply model that pushes value higher as the ecosystem grows. Its 95% APY staking pool attracts users seeking long-term returns backed by locked-in liquidity. The team uses AI-driven reward optimization to maintain balance during market volatility. Verified contracts and community governance reinforce transparency, helping MoonBull grow into one of the most trusted emerging assets for 2025. 4. La Culex (CULEX): A Multi-Stage Scarcity Engine With Strong Community Incentives La Culex presents a balanced token structure built for long-term resilience. The 200 billion supply is divided into presale, liquidity, staking, and community pools. Liquidity remains locked for 18 months, providing users with strong protection. Staking rewards reach eighty percent APY through the Hive Vault, while the Bite Chain referral system boosts network expansion. Each of the thirty-two presale stages reduces supply and pushes value closer to its projected 0.007 listing. Its audited contracts and zero-tax design strengthen trust among new participants seeking reliable early-stage growth. 5. APEMARS: A Mission Styled Ecosystem Built For Creative Expansion APEMARS is a story-centered memecoin designed as a community-driven mission to Mars, built on the ERC 20 standard to offer an experience that feels like an evolving expedition rather than a standard presale. The journey progresses through 23 weekly stages, each symbolizing a segment of Commander Ape’s 225 million-kilometer voyage, with narrative and pricing moving forward together. Mars-themed mechanics shape the project, including burn checkpoints at Stages 6, 12, 18, and 23 to strengthen scarcity. After launch, the APE Yield Station delivers 63 percent APY with rewards locked for two months, while the Orbital Boost referral system offers 9.34 percent rewards once a holder contributes 22 dollars, forming the core of Operation RED BANANA. 6. FLOKI: A Meme Giant Preparing For Another Cycle FLOKI’s large global community continues driving attention toward its broader utility features. The project develops metaverse experiences, educational platforms, and decentralized finance tools that extend beyond typical meme narratives. FLOKI’s marketing strength helps maintain visibility across major markets, and several institutions follow its ecosystem due to strong branding. Analysts from Messari highlight FLOKI’s cross-chain expansion as a core driver of renewed interest. As the market shifts toward 2025, FLOKI remains well-positioned for strong participation, driven by community energy and upcoming utility upgrades. Conclusion Sui, MoonBull, and La Culex show strong technical discipline with systems built for steady growth, while APEMARS and FLOKI highlight creative communities shaping fresh narratives within the market. These projects attract different types of traders as adoption rises and new features strengthen their long-term appeal. Together, they form a diverse group of emerging ecosystems that continue gaining attention from users seeking stability, utility, and innovative design across expanding blockchain networks. BullZilla stands at the center of the discussion as the best crypto to invest in 2025 thanks to its structured presale system, strong early returns, and rapid community expansion. Its rising holder count and predictable stage-based valuation path make it a standout option for traders positioning ahead of the next cycle. As markets move toward higher engagement in 2025, many follow BullZilla closely because it offers transparent mechanics, reliable token flow, and a clear roadmap supporting future growth. Buy BullZilla today and catch the surge early.

MSTY consistently underperforms MSTR during rallies while only marginally mitigating downside, making it unattractive compared to direct MSTR exposure. Recent dividend reductions and high return of capital indicate the payout is shrinking and not supported by true income generation. I maintain a Hold rating on MSTY, as upside is capped and downside protection is minimal; direct MSTR ownership is preferable if bullish. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) is liked by some investors for its high dividend yield of 100%+, which it partially achieves by generating income from Strategy ( MSTR ) options. But oftentimes, if something seems too good to be true, it is. On February 27, I wrote about the MSTY ETF, and the article was titled ""MSTY: 100%+ Dividend Yield, But There's A Catch."" In that article, I highlighted several risks to note for investors considering a position in MSTY. Those risks included BTC potentially falling by another 10%+ (which is what it did shortly after the article was published), the potential for smaller dividends over time, Strategy's premium over its mNAV, and the fact that MSTY can underperform when MSTR performs very well but still capture a lot of the downside when MSTR performs badly. I think it's safe to say that those things have played out. The price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was around $84,000 when I wrote that article and is actually a bit higher now at around $89,000. However, MSTY's total return since then -- which includes dividends -- has been -30.27%. A lot of this has to do with MSTR's poor performance and mNAV premium erosion lately. MSTY's Performance Since My Last Article (Seeking Alpha) At the same time, MSTY's dividends have shrunk considerably. The only reason the yield is still high is because the share price has fallen. So, what's next? While MSTY is surely a much better Buy now than it was a few months ago, I still don't think this is an investment vehicle worth pursuing -- compared to MSTR stock -- for the long term for many of the same reasons as before. This is despite me not being bearish on BTC. Therefore, I'm staying on the sidelines with a Hold rating. A Brief Overview of MSTY's Strategy MSTY indirectly invests in MSTR stock. Its main goal is to generate income, and its secondary goal is to capture the share price movements of MSTR stock. I went over MSTY's strategy in my last article on the ETF, and I suggest reading that for more context, but here's a refresher. Previously, I wrote: MSTY is an options-based ETF. Instead of buying MSTR shares, MSTY gains its exposure to MSTR through the purchase of call options. To help finance these purchases, MSTY also sells puts on MSTR. The fund doesn't just sell puts, though. Particularly, the fund's prospectus states the following: On a monthly basis or more frequently, the Fund will sell call option contracts on the Underlying Security with expiration dates of approximately one month or less in the future at strike prices that are approximately equal to 0%-15% above the then-current share price of the Underlying Security. And when MSTY's management team is more confident that MSTR stock will rise, it can choose to employ a call credit spread (which it calls a covered call spread strategy) instead of covered calls to seek greater upside potential. Further, the fund invests in US Treasuries with target maturities of 6 months to 2 years. Its 6 main types of holdings can be seen below. MSTY's Portfolio Strategy (MSTY's Prospectus) MSTY's Prospectus MSTY ETF's Performance Problem MSTY's strategy leaves it with a performance issue. It tends to underperform greatly when MSTR stock rallies, and it still captures a lot of the downside when MSTR does poorly. That's because its covered call and call credit spread strategies limit upside potential. I'm sure most readers of this article are familiar with these options strategies, so I'll spare you the details. The strategies may sound great on the surface (generating income from MSTR's volatility), but they often just don't do that well. Here's how MSTY has performed compared to MSTR -- dividends included. In the chart below, the candlesticks represent MSTY, while the bars represent Strategy stock. Since its inception in February 2024, MSTY has returned 102.4%, while MSTR has returned 151.8%. You can also tell how much better MSTR's outperformance is during bullish periods. MSTY's Performance vs. MSTR's Performance (TradingView) Here's another thing to consider. During the most recent drawdown starting in July, MSTY has fallen by 55.6%. MSTY's Performance Starting From July 18, 2025 (TradingView) At the same time, MSTR has fallen by 60.4%. MSTR's Performance Starting From July 18, 2025 (TradingView) Sure, MSTR performed worse during this period, but not by much. The income generated from MSTY's options strategy only spared the fund a few percentage points of drawdown while sparing it many percentage points of upside during good times. That's quite the opposite of a strategy I'd want to be exposed to. The Dividend Problem The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF has a variable dividend that can fluctuate greatly. When I wrote my previous MSTY article, the most recent dividend was $2.0216 per share, paid 13 times a year, for an annualized dividend of $26.28 per share. Of course, that ""annualized"" dividend would only come to fruition if the dividend held steady, which it didn't. I previously noted that factors like implied volatility and MSTR's stock price can impact the dividend. All else being equal, a higher MSTR stock price and higher implied volatility for its options will lead to greater premiums, which can help sustain the dividend. The same principle applies if MSTR and its IV fall. Since the implied volatility was low and the stock price had fallen in February, I argued that the March distribution could be lower. The March distribution then came out to $1.3775 per share -- a big drop. All the dividends after that, except a $2.3734 per share dividend in May, were much lower than February's dividend. It's worth noting that the fund started paying its dividends weekly in October. MSTY's Dividend History (yieldmaxetfs.com) And for reference, volatility in Strategy's options chain is at around the same level as it was in February, but it had dropped off in a big way in the middle of the year. Strategy's Historical Volatility (Interactive Brokers) There's also another thing that affects MSTY's dividends -- the amount of money it has invested. Here's the problem, though: MSTY has been using ""return of capital"" ((ROC)) to fund large portions of its dividend payments since May. You can see that in the ""ROC"" section of the chart above. For example, 92.88% of the most recent dividend of $0.1388 per share came from a return of capital, meaning that only about 7% came from income the fund generated. This isn't true income. It's just the fund giving your money back to you. The less money the fund has (because it's just giving you your money back), the less it can invest, and the less income it will make. This certainly doesn't help the dividend. So, yes, the fund yields over 100% right now if you annualize the most recent dividend, but that's not a guaranteed dividend. It depends on several factors. The annualized dividend right now is around $7.22 per share. Recall that in February, it was $26.28 per share, and some people were bashing me for not being bullish despite a high yield. However, I do recognize that the dividend can increase from here if MSTR stock recovers. But as we've seen, MSTY tends to underperform during upswings. If you're bullish on MSTR, you might as well buy MSTR then, not MSTY. At Least Bitcoin is Well Off Its Highs The MSTY ETF has something going for it. Bitcoin is well off its all-time high and is close to a trendline support area. Bitcoin can potentially bounce back, helping Strategy stock recover, which would then help MSTY. BTC-USD Daily Chart (TradingView) Even the CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index shows that the crypto market is in fear territory (21 out of 100), and buying when the market is fearful can sometimes translate to nice gains. CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index (coinmarketcap.com) Strategy's Premium to mNAV Has Eroded Strategy stock's premium to its mNAV used to be much higher, sometimes above 2x or 3x. It's now 1.16x. To be honest, I don't even think it should be trading above mNAV, and I prefer the ETH treasury company SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ), but that's another argument for another article. The point is that the downside risk at 1.16x is much lower for MSTR and, in turn, MSTY. Strategy's Premium To mNAV (strategy.com) Therefore, one can make the argument that MSTR is relatively cheap, making MSTY worth buying. But at that point, why not just buy MSTR? The Bottom Line on MSTY ETF The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is a great ETF if you want high dividends, but that doesn't make it a great ETF overall. In recent months, your ""dividends"" would mostly have been your capital being returned to you. It looks nice to receive large dividends until you realize that these dividends are getting smaller and smaller over time and will only get bigger if MSTR stock rises or if its implied volatility rises sharply. But if you think MSTR stock will rise, you'd likely see better performance buying MSTR. In a crypto bull market, MSTR stock will rise, and its premium to mNAV (which is relatively low now) would likely rise as well, amplifying the gains. While MSTY would capture some of those gains, it wouldn't capture all of them, and that's by design. You can see that play out in its past performance. In most scenarios, buying MSTY is like capping the upside on MSTR stock while barely offsetting the downside. It's just not an attractive investment, relatively speaking. Therefore, I don't suggest that anyone buy it. The main reason I don't rate it as an outright Sell is because of Bitcoin's potential to bounce back after its recent fall.",MSTR|MSTR:CA|MSTY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-07 02:20:06

Buyers and sellers are locked in a tight battle, and the market now waits for a decisive break. A push above key resistance could open the door to $107,000, while weakness at support risks a deeper slide toward $71,000. Bounce Scenario: A Return Toward The Pink Box And Descending Trendline Kamile Uray, in her latest update on Bitcoin, noted that BTC failed to hold above the $90,720 level on the hourly chart, triggering the expected decline. The first immediate support now sits at $87,644, while the deeper support range lies between $83,822 and $82,477. If buyers defend this zone successfully, Bitcoin could attempt another climb toward the pink box region and retest the descending trendline overhead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Echoes 2022 Bear Start, Glassnode Warns Uray explained that a sustained move above the pink box resistance on the daily timeframe would open the door for Bitcoin to challenge the descending blue trendline. A confirmed breakout from this area could strengthen bullish momentum, pushing the price toward the next major resistance levels at $98,200 and $107,500. A break above $107,500 alongside the descending trendline would serve as a strong signal that the broader uptrend is ready to continue. However, she warned that a daily close below $82,477 would shift the market structure toward further weakness, placing Bitcoin at risk of revisiting lower levels. Even so, Uray highlighted one critical area of strength: the $74,496–$71,237 zone. This region represents the key breakout top from November 2024 and is considered a strong historical support. In this area, buyers may step in aggressively, potentially setting the stage for an upward reversal. Bitcoin Price Rejection At $93,000–$95,000 Zone According to Crypto Candy, Bitcoin’s latest price action has been unfolding precisely in line with expectations. After facing rejection in the $93,000–$95,000 resistance zone, BTC dipped sharply and nearly touched the anticipated support range at $86,000–$87,500. This move reflects the broader market’s reaction to heavy selling pressure near the upper resistance band. Related Reading: Reversal Loading? Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Build Powerful High-Time-Frame Structures Crypto Candy emphasized that the $86,000–$87,500 zone now serves as a crucial pivot area. If buyers successfully defend this support and the price stabilizes above it, Bitcoin could once again revisit the $93,000–$95,000 range, or even push beyond it. Such a rebound would signal renewed bullish momentum and set the stage for another attempt at breaking higher resistance levels. However, the analyst also warned that failure to hold the $86,000–$87,500 support could trigger deeper downside movement.

The company, by far the largest corporate holder of Ether in the world, has accumulated the figure in just the last two days, according to new blockchain tracking data. The acquisitions were made in two large purchases : the first on Friday for $130.7 million, and another for $68 million on Saturday. These purchases bring the total of Ether held by BitMine to approximately $11.3 billion, which is about 3.08% of all ETH in existence at the time of this press release. The company is now edging closer to its long-time goal of capturing 5% of the Ethereum network. BitMine’s aggressive buying spree pushes forward against the current backdrop – a space where most top-calibre traders and institutional participants are short-term bearish on Ether. BitMine speeds up acquisitions, despite an industry slowdown The broader corporate Ethereum market has cooled sharply. Among the largest companies, net treasury savings, excluding its flagship company product, reached a seven-quarter high of $67.5 billion. Digital asset treasury activity – that segment that monitors corporate purchases of large cryptos has decreased 81% in just 3 months. In August, businesses combined accumulated 1.97 million ETH, but that number dropped significantly in November to just 370,000 ETH. BitMine, meanwhile, has taken the opposite approach. The firm has purchased 679,000 ETH (valuing $2.13 billion) in the past month alone. This purchase represented the vast majority of all corporate Ether purchased during that timeframe and demonstrated the company’s increasing dominance and confidence. BitMine management has consistently described its approach as one that invests in the Ethereum platform as a key feature of the emerging digital economy. Remaining bullish, BitMine has proven multiple times that the occasional bear market isn’t a signal of doom — it’s an opportunity for accumulation. The company also maintains a cash reserve of $882 million, which could be utilised to continue purchasing if market conditions remain favourable. However, as BitMine is betting big on Ethereum’s future, the most sophisticated traders in the market are now betting, at least in the short term, on something else. Smart money traders have accumulated a significant amount of short interest, according to data from the leading blockchain intelligence platform Nansen. Over the past 24 hours, ETH shorts have added a net notional amount of $2.8 million, resulting in a total short exposure of $21 million in combined notional value. They are a signal that managers expect prices to continue to fall. Institutional sentiment also appears subdued. Spot Ethereum ETFs, generally one of the heaviest drivers of liquidity for the asset, continue to experience outflows. Spot ETH ETFs on Friday reported $75.2 million in net outflows, marking its second consecutive day of outflows. That lukewarm demand comes on the heels of a sharp $1.4 billion outflow in November, indicating wariness among institutional investors. BitMine rises as a major force in the Ether ecosystem BitMine’s rapid expansion into the Ethereum universe has larger implications. With the firm nearing ownership of 5% of available ETH, it now has a greater vested interest in a network where supply centralisation affects market structure, liquidity profiles, and staking dynamics. At 5% BitMine would have more ETH than every large decentralised staking pool combined, possibly setting a threshold on the amount of assets a corporation controls from an Ethereum perspective. It also raises questions about how traditional treasuries could evolve as cryptocurrencies increasingly integrate into mainstream financial systems. BitMine’s approach, for now, is obvious: pile in like mad and stay liquid to become a major player in Ethereum in the long run. However, market concerns aside, the firm’s recent activity demonstrates unabated conviction in Ethereum’s growth prospects and a willingness to continue buying until its target of 5% is achieved.

While the global financial system is accelerating its transition to real-time settlement, XRP is emerging as a contender for enterprise-level treasury flows. As Ripple’s institutional network continues to expand, the altcoin is stepping into a role where digital assets can enhance liquidity management and power the next generation of global value transfer. Why RippleNet’s Expanding Network Drives Enterprise Confidence The bearish view of XRP is clouding the bigger transformation happening behind the scenes. Analyst Xfinancebull has mentioned on X that XRP is embedding itself into the financial engines where global treasury systems teams move trillions. With the GTreasury acquisition, Ripple gains access to the operational layer where $12.5 trillion in enterprise liquidity flows. This is about the altcoin becoming a native rail inside the financial command centers of over 1,000 multinational giants where trillions move. Treasury teams move real money, not just $100 payments, but payroll, supply chain financing, and liquidity management across continents. The XRP niche is that it moves trillions fast, 24/7, across borders. Meanwhile, Ripple now controls the infrastructure platform that interacts with BNY Mellon to move trillions and automates finance at scale. According to Xfinancebull, the token goes from a speculative asset to invisible plumbing. This shift doesn’t make the front-page headlines, but it moves everything behind them. Most analysts won’t notice that this has unlocked the token to become a standard settlement rail in the GTreasury automation stack, making its utility broader, invisible, and massive. Founder of Lux Lions NFT and host of the crypto Blitz YouTube show, RipBullWinkle, stated that the Federal Reserve has officially halted its Quantitative Tightening (QT) measures, ending the two-year liquidity drain that weighed down the entire crypto sector. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager with $11 trillion in AUM, has reversed course and will now allow clients to have access to the regulated crypto ETFs. This single move clears the path for trillions in passive capital, a macro environment of liquidity, compliance, and global settlement that XRP is engineered for. How XRP Defies The Market Slump With A Rare Positive Performance While the crypto market has been struggling to find its footing, an observer and researcher of the current tech shift, SMQKE, has noted that WisdomTree data shows that XRP is the only major cryptocurrency posting positive year-to-date returns in 2025. On a year-to-date basis, where the broader markets were pulling back, the altcoin has stood out as the lone performer, holding onto a modest +4% gain year-to-date. In a challenging year for most large-cap digital assets, it has emerged as the top-tier asset with a positive year-to-date performance. Even after experiencing drawdowns in line with the broader market during Q4, XRP has demonstrated remarkable relative resilience and remains up +4% YTD and +12% over the past 12 months.",XRP|BNY Mellon|Crypto Blitz|crypto ETFs|GTreasury|Lux Lions NFT|QT|Quantitative Tightening|RipBullWinkle|ripple|SMQKE|Vanguard|wisdomtree|Xfinancebull|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT|Year-To-Date|Youtube|YTD,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-07 03:30:49

Jamie Dimon stated that a “weak” Europe is not just a European problem, but one with serious implications for global growth, trade flows, and ultimately, the US economy. “If Europe goes down, we all go down,” Dimon warned, underlining that sluggish growth, burdensome regulation, and sluggish productivity on the continent represent a systemic risk for transatlantic and global prosperity. He made these remarks during the Reagan National Defence Forum, which was held on Saturday, December 6. At this time, Dimon insisted that “Europe has a real problem.” To elaborate on his claim, the CEO began by acknowledging that the continent has implemented some considerable safety measures. However, he voiced concerns about Europe’s approach, which pushes businesses away, chases off investment, and stifles innovation. This finding ignited heated debates among individuals. To address this controversy, Dimon highlighted a positive aspect of the continent. According to him, the continent is making a comeback. Dimon calls on the urgency to address the challenges that make Europe weak Earlier, Dimon raised concerns about Europe’s split status. As the head of the largest bank in the US, he explained that this division presents a substantial challenge that the world encounters. This statement was revealed after the CEO shared his letter to shareholders earlier this year, noting that Europe has s ome critical issues that need to be addressed as soon as possible. Even with these challenges in place, Dimon expressed his excitement about the launch of the euro, a significant accomplishment for the region. He also acknowledged Europe’s efforts to establish peace among its trading partners, primarily with Ukraine. Nonetheless, he urged the continent to work on its agreements within the European Union (EU) since this challenge poses a risk to Europe. “If they fall apart, then you can say that America first will not exist anymore,” Dimon said. Notably, analysts discovered that the EU and the US are each other’s largest and most important trading partners. Therefore, Dimon emphasized that the United States should assist because this situation will affect it more than any other nation. Apart from conducting trade, the US and the EU have also shared values which matter greatly. “We need a long-term plan to make them stronger,” Dimon stated while still highlighting that a weak Europe has negative impacts on the US. Meanwhile, reports dated October of this year mentioned that JPMorgan released a statement confirming its plans to make a substantial investment worth $1.5 trillion in industries that play a crucial role in enhancing the US’s economic security and strength over the next decade. This amounts to $500 billion more than what the bank would have otherwise contributed. Dimon cautioned on the US’s habit of relying on unreliable sources JPMorgan CEO admitted that it was crystal clear that the US has increasingly relied on unreliable sources for key minerals, products, and manufacturing. Jay Horine, an investment banker, leads this recently initiated project, which Dimon refers to as “100% commercial.” Sources close to the situation hinted that this initiative will focus on four main areas. This includes supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defence and aerospace, energy independence and resilience, and frontier and strategic technologies. On the other hand, another report from a reliable source highlighted that the bank intends to allocate $10 billion of its own funds to aid certain firms in expansion, innovation , or accelerate key manufacturing processes. Dimon also complimented US President Donald Trump’s efforts to lower bureaucracy in the government on Saturday this week. According to him, this is a smart move that they can achieve while ensuring that safety measures are effective in sectors such as food and banking.

In an interview, he explained why the timing of the launch mattered. His comments arrive at a point when XRP seeks a larger role in global finance, and investors want clarity on its long-term path. A Positive Change in Conditions Hougan described a simple reason for Bitwise’s decision. He said Ripple has a strong community. He also referred to XRP as a Lindy asset that has been in existence for a long time. He then addressed the central issue. He said XRP faced an “existential regulatory threat” during the SEC’s lawsuit . He noted that no major institution wanted to build real-world products on a network that faced that level of risk. He said the lawsuit froze adoption. His point was clear. The barrier was not technology, but uncertainty. Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, says the reason they launched a Ripple ETF is simple: the playing field has finally changed. For years, Ripple and XRP were held back by an existential regulatory threat. The SEC lawsuit froze real-world adoption and made major partnerships nearly… https://t.co/szyM53PQiM pic.twitter.com/Ho42F9EAts — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) December 4, 2025 This legal battle ended in August , and Hougan stated that this development changed the landscape. He said the blockchain now has “a chance” to compete on a level playing field. He pointed out that this change does not guarantee success. It does, however, enable XRP to gain the use cases that its supporters have long discussed. Xaif reinforced this point in his caption when he said the lawsuit held back adoption and stopped partnerships at scale. His comments aligned with Hougan’s reasoning. A Strategic ETF Launch Hougan highlighted the ETF structure as a key step for investors who want exposure through regulated markets. He said Bitwise launched the product to give the community “high-quality exposure” through a simple ticker. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He also said Bitwise reserved the ticker XRP in advance. The firm moved as soon as the regulatory landscape allowed it. This decision gives institutions a direct path to allocate capital. It also strengthens XRP’s position among other approved digital asset funds. Rising Institutional Interest in XRP The Bitwise XRP ETF entered the market with strong interest from investors. It had a trading volume of $25.7 million on the first day , with $107.6 million in assets under management (AUM). ETFs often attract traditional firms that need compliance-ready exposure. Bitwise’s ETF launch shows that institutions are interested in XRP. Greater regulatory clarity tends to support long-term confidence. With the lawsuit now over, access through an ETF increases market depth. XRP now competes for institutional flow that once excluded it. If new partnerships and enterprise use appear, XRP could gain a stronger position in global finance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The company handles a large share of global corporate activity. Its clients process $12.5 trillion in annual payment volume. It also manages $250 billion in operational accounts. The platform links to BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirect, which supports over $6.5 trillion in yearly transaction flow. GTreasury shared this information in its public summary. X Finance Bull focused on the size of these flows. He said that “XRP is becoming part of enterprise treasury systems, where trillions move .” He said that treasury teams within global firms move large amounts each day through key systems. These actions operate at all hours because companies function in many regions. He believes this type of activity fits XRP’s design. Ripple Gains a Direct Link to Core Finance Tools GTreasury said that it now gives customers the option to use real-time settlement and institutional-grade infrastructure . It linked this change to Ripple’s plan to offer custody, liquidity, treasury tools, payments, and real-time settlement on a single platform. X Finance Bull said, “Ripple now controls the infrastructure that talks to BNY Mellon”. He sees this as a major step because treasury platforms guide how large companies transfer money. He argued that this position could help Ripple offer fast settlement rails to corporate clients.

He also said that many people will not notice this shift because it happens deep inside enterprise systems. The scale of these flows gives XRP a stronger future in global finance . Automation Could Boost XRP’s Use GTreasury said that the future of corporate treasury has no friction and no boundaries. X Finance Bull linked this to Ripple’s plan to build a full digital asset platform. He believes that more automation inside these tools will lead to active settlement. He wrote that XRP gains “continuous, invisible, and massive” utility as it enters GTreasury’s automation stack. Ripple’s deal puts XRP inside tools used by major global firms, and this pipeline could change everything for XRP, as it moves trillions of dollars.

Reports indicate it was caused by a technician who made an error while performing maintenance work in Aurora, Illinois. The breakdown , on November 28, brought business to a standstill at some of the world’s most critical financial markets and underscored vulnerabilities in the infrastructure that supports derivative trading globally. CyrusOne said the incident originated from on-site staff and contractors not following “standard procedures for draining cooling towers” that cool internal infrastructure before lower temperatures set in. As the temperature outside dropped, so did the temperature inside the facility when its cooling system stopped working. This failed several key cooling units, leading to higher room temperatures in the server rooms. The servers that host CME’s Globex trading platform began to overheat. Robotic safety systems then shut down the equipment to avoid damage. With core servers offline, CME’s markets for futures, options, and products tied to commodities, currencies, and the Treasury spectrum abruptly ceased processing trades. The pause reverberated around the global financial system. Traders in Asia, Europe, and the United States were cut off from live prices or unable to manage their positions. At a few of the largest markets, liquidity vanished altogether, as in gold and Treasury futures, leaving some traders unprotected as they waited for systems to come back online. Markets shudder as the shutdown reverberates around the world The outage occurred in the early morning hours in the United States, prompting traders to assess the situation. Markets had already opened for many traders in Europe and Asia by the time prices on CME-connected products suddenly stopped moving. Futures on prominent U.S. stock indexes ceased updating. On the commodity markets, including the crude oil and gold markets, there was only eerie silence. U.S. Treasury futures, a global fixed-income trading lynchpin, were offline for several hours. Currency trading markets were also thrown into disarray as CME’s electronic brokering system for currency trading, Globex, went offline. Traders were unable to avoid exposure or take profits. Institutional desks faced similar woes, with some stating that their standard risk management tools have become ineffective. The disruption showed how dependent modern markets have become on a small number of data centres. With CME’s primary engine offline, there was virtually no corner of global trading able to access one of its most critical pricing feeds. Some firms reported minor internal delays as activity surged on alternative platforms, while others warned that the inability to exit positions posed significant danger. Had equities sharply sold off during the halt, they said, the resulting losses could have been devastating. CME’s long delay before returning to Black Friday trading was caused by the venue being disconnected so that its cooling systems could be stabilized and servers brought back online. CME rethinks data center strategy after human error After a human error was determined to be the primary cause of the circumstances, CyrusOne stated that it has already implemented more stringent cold-weather procedures. These include increasing the number of personnel on duty during periods of extreme weather, enhancing cooling infrastructure, hardening systems, and improving redundant systems to prevent the simultaneous failure of multiple units. The incident has reignited debate over CME’s move to depend on a data centre it no longer owns. CME sold the Aurora site in 2016. Since then, it has relied on CyrusOne to run the infrastructure that supports much of its electronic trading . The outage has also prompted questions over whether such an arrangement affords CME sufficient control over its essential systems. And questions arose about CME’s decision not to relocate to its backup facility. Emergency plans called for relocating operations at a second location, but CME declined to activate that site, as it received early indications that the outage would be short-lived. However, the few hours of cooling loss proved far more serious, and the delay ensured that the outage would last more than ten hours. Industry analysts say the episode should serve as a wake-up call. Modern markets aren’t just software—they’re also hardware, with power supply and cooling systems. A breakdown in any of them can halt global markets. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Yet a recent post by BD (@DiepSanh) offered a clearer view. He highlighted comments from Vet (@VetX_0), a validator on the XRP Ledger, focusing on a simple contrast of how both assets entered the market. That contrast now shapes how each network grows. Different Distribution Models Create Different Outcomes Vet noted that Bitcoin enjoyed an early advantage because it had an “amazing distribution phase through mining.” The mining model enabled BTC to reach a wide base of early users. It rewarded those who supplied computing power at a time when the network needed it most. This model helped Bitcoin gain recognition during its first years. The situation shifted once distribution began to taper off. Vet stated that Bitcoin then faced “high miner costs, rising fees, no true finality, and constant sell pressure from miners.” The comment reflects a structural issue. Miners must sell BTC to cover their expenses. This creates steady selling pressure during every market cycle. It also forces the network to rely on higher fees as block rewards shrink. These factors reduce efficiency and place friction on growth. XRP took a different path. Vet said XRP was “harder to distribute at the start” because it did not use mining. That choice removed the long-term burden of ongoing production costs. The supply model stays fixed . Validators do not earn XRP through block creation. The ledger can run without the need for rising transaction fees. This structure makes the network easier to scale and maintain. It also reduces forced selling because there is no mining treasury. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Matters for XRP’s Price Growth BD highlighted these points because they affect the future performance of both assets. Bitcoin must push fees higher to support miners. Rising fees can limit activity during peak periods. It also makes everyday payments less practical. This weakens long-term demand for BTC as a utility asset. XRP does not face those limits. The absence of mining gives the network a cost advantage. Firms can move value at speed without fear of fee spikes. This supports stronger use in payments and settlement . It adds a base layer of demand that does not rely on speculation. More stable utility can help XRP form a steady growth curve when market activity increases. Vet also noted that XRP “is actually the closest realization of Bitcoin’s original peer-to-peer payments vision.” Bitcoin moved further into the store-of-value role . XRP continued to focus on efficient transfer of value. This focus appeals to enterprises and financial platforms. It offers a clearer path for adoption that can support price strength during future cycles. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

55453977,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=874268,1765093344,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55453977.jpeg,"Ripple (XRP) Wins Regulatory Expansion, yet Analysts Suggest GeeFi (GEE) For Life-Changing Returns",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-xrp-wins-regulatory-expansion-yet-analysts-suggest-geefi-gee-for-life-changing-returns/,"While established tokens dominate headlines, GeeFi is capturing investor attention with a presale performance that defies current market expectations. This comprehensive crypto ecosystem has shattered early targets , concluding Phase 1 in less than two weeks and successfully raising $500,000 . The momentum has only accelerated, Phase 2 has quickly added another $570,000 , bringing the total raised to over $1 million . Phase 2 is already more than 70% complete , and analysts predict that Phase 3 will likely commence as early as next week . With this rapid absorption rate, the opportunity to join at current levels is closing faster than anticipated. Utility That Outperforms Speculation Ripple is currently making waves with XRP ETFs approaching $1 billion in assets and the company finalizing its $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury . However, smart money is rapidly pivoting toward GeeFi to capture higher growth potential. Unlike projects that rely solely on market sentiment, GeeFi delivers a suite of essential tools designed for the modern crypto user. At the heart of this ecosystem lies the GeeFi DEX, a high-performance decentralized exchange. This platform empowers traders with total control over their assets, removing the need for third-party custodians and ensuring that security remains in the hands of the user. The ecosystem’s utility extends far beyond trading, bridging the gap between digital assets and everyday spending. GeeFi is preparing to launch its specialized Crypto Cards, integrated with VISA and Mastercard networks, allowing users to spend their holdings globally. This real-world application is supported by the GEE token’s deflationary model. Through systematic burns and supply reduction mechanisms, the protocol is designed to increase token scarcity over time. This economic structure rewards long-term participants, creating a sustainable cycle of value appreciation that stands in stark contrast to the inflationary models of many competitors. A Financial Opportunity with Massive Upside GeeFi has now entered Phase 2, presenting a lucrative entry point with tokens priced at just $0.06 . The financial mathematics of this offer are compelling: with a confirmed listing price of $0.40 when the token launches, investors buying today lock in a guaranteed return of 667% . The long-term projections are even more staggering. By investing $1,600 now , based on a forecasted evaluation of $2 per token , your investment could potentially surge to $60,000 , achieving a remarkable 3,233% ROI . The velocity of the sale supports these bullish projections. Phase 2 has already seen 9.5 million tokens sold and raised over $570,000 in just a few days. Analysts have praised GeeFi’s presale structure, predicting that Phase 2 will conclude within the next few days due to this explosive momentum. This optimism is further fueled by leaked talks from the GeeFi Team regarding incoming listings on several major exchanges, which typically serve as a catalyst for parabolic price action. Passive Income Redefined In addition to capital appreciation, GeeFi offers one of the most aggressive staking programs in the industry to reward its community. Users can generate passive income directly through the GeeFi Wallet with flexible options suited to any strategy. For those who prefer liquidity, the platform offers up to 10% APR with no lock-up period . However, the true value lies in committed staking: investors can earn 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and an industry-leading 55% APR for a 12-month commitment . Furthermore, the ecosystem encourages community growth through a referral feature, allowing users to earn a 5% bonus on contributions made by their referrals. The Next 100x Gem is Here Market analysts are increasingly identifying GeeFi as a potential 100x Gem project, a rarity in the current landscape. This presale offers a unique opportunity to secure a position in a high-utility ecosystem before it hits the public markets. With Phase 2 rapidly reaching capacity and the price scheduled to increase when Phase 3 begins, the potential for maximum returns is time-sensitive. Investors are moving quickly to secure their stake, driven by the fear of missing out on what could be the year’s most significant launch. The momentum is undeniable, and the time to act is now before the next phase begins.

It featured Paul Barron speaking with Sandy Kaul, the Head of Digital Asset and Industry Advisory Services at Franklin Templeton. Referencing the video, Xaif revealed that as much as $2.3 trillion in liquidity could move into XRP. He also said demand from Wall Street and retail is rising while XRP ETFs enter the market . Xaif added that XRP is now part of the same conversation as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. $2.3T in liquidity could flow into $XRP , says Franklin Templeton. XRP ETFs are here and institutions are finally waking up. Demand from Wall Street + retail is surging, and XRP is leveling up to the same narrative as Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs. pic.twitter.com/kF21v9cAua — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 5, 2025 Progress in XRP’s Market Position Barron asked Kaul if the rise in demand from retail and institutions has started to push XRP toward the same level as Bitcoin and ETH ETF activity. Kaul said, “I think that we’re moving in that direction,” and pointed to the role of stablecoins. She said stablecoins now drive a major part of the digital asset space. She noted that the XRP Ledger holds a unique position because “XRP is one of the only chains that also has its own stablecoin.” Kaul said RLUSD gives the company a chance to build new business lines. She added that XRP works on a public chain with an independent validation network. She described this structure as “a pretty interesting business case,” which she said is one reason Franklin Templeton has increased its work with Ripple in recent years. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Global Growth Kaul said Ripple faced challenges in the U.S. during the SEC lawsuit but kept building in other countries and continents. She said Franklin Templeton worked with Ripple in Asia for some time and that Ripple’s reach in other regions continues to grow. Kaul also spoke about the rise of computer-to-computer transactions. She expects this rise to continue as more groups adopt Web3 systems. She said new digital rails will support a much larger volume of automated activity. This increases the need for networks that settle transactions at scale and with clear trust models. Outlook for XRP Xaif’s comment about major liquidity moving toward XRP matches the themes seen in Kaul’s remarks. Institutions seeking assets with strong settlement tools, clear global reach, and a stablecoin that works within the same ecosystem. XRP now holds these features while also gaining new ETF products. Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF is making waves in the market as demand for the digital asset surges. Kaul’s comments reflect a growing view that XRP may play a larger role as new digital financial systems expand.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $5,243.05 and a minimum price of $4,587.67. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $8,519.96 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond?

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s price also increased to $893.4 as buying interest surged once again. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and break above $921. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $881. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $893.4, as bulls target $921. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.94 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction , BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark.

Peterson particularly highlighted the pressure on the price from fund flows coming from spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. According to Peterson's analysis, approximately 51,000 BTC have been sold from US ETFs since October 9th. These sales total approximately $4.6 billion, based on a period when Bitcoin was trading around $90,000. The analyst noted that average weekly inflows into ETFs through 2025 were around $450 million, and that the market recovery will take time due to the high correlation between price and fund flows. Related News: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Explains What the Cryptocurrency Market “Needs Right Now” and Names a Project Based on this data, Peterson said it could take at least 10 weeks for Bitcoin to reach its ATH again, or more realistically, closer to 14 weeks as the price enters an uptrend again. He added that ETF inflows have been nearly flat over the past two weeks, indicating weakness on the demand side. Peterson also noted that Bitcoin has fallen below a key threshold for its long-term network value (Metcalfe). The price has fallen below the Metcalfe for the first time in almost two years. While this isn't necessarily a bottom signal, it does indicate that leveraged positions have largely been cleared and the previous bubble effect has faded, according to the analyst. *This is not investment advice.

ChatGPT Challenges Massive Bullish Predictions,https://cryptopotato.com/can-xrp-realistically-hit-10-chatgpt-challenges-massive-bullish-predictions/,"Ripple’s cross-border token is among the most popular in the cryptocurrency community, with a massive fanbase referred to as the XRP Army. They are known for making bold claims, and one of the most popular participants, John Squire, has outlined numerous mind-blowing price targets for XRP’s future. In the latest, he wondered on X whether the asset could rocket to $10 by the end of the year. Given the short timeframe left of just a few weeks, we decided to ask ChatGPT about its opinion on how viable this prediction is. XRP at $10 in 2025? — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 3, 2025 Close to Impossible Since XRP would need to skyrocket by nearly 400% in just over three weeks to reach Squire’s number, ChatGPT was quick to determine that such a move would be “close to impossible” for 2025. After all, XRP is the second-largest altcoin, not some small-cap that can surge by double- or even triple-digits within days or weeks. Moreover, if this rather far-fetched target is reached, the asset’s market cap would soar to $520-$550 billion, making it much more valuable than ETH and placing it “close to or above some of the largest companies in the world.” “Achieving this in the current liquidity and market environment is a massive challenge,” said ChatGPT. It also noted that XRP has underperformed since the mid-July all-time high of $3.65, losing more than 40% of its value since then. It even dipped below $2.00 on several occasions. Lastly, OpenAI’s platform mentioned the XRP ETF inflows, which, albeit still in the green for weeks, are “relatively modest” and have declined in the past several days. $10 Ever? After noting that there’s a very, very slim chance of hitting $10 this year, ChatGPT provided a broader and more optimistic look for the long run. It believes the spot XRP ETF inflows are key to determining whether the underlying asset can reach such heights, especially if major issuers, like BlackRock and Fidelity, enter the field. Additionally, it brought up XRP’s utility potential, which could also boost its price for the next few years. “Cross-border settlement, liquidity provisioning, and remittance infrastructure remain XRP’s core value propositions. If Ripple secures additional large-scale banking integrations, utility-driven demand could support a multi-dollar valuation.” It reiterated a previous statement that Ripple’s token tends to outperform in the latter stages of bull cycles. As such, it noted that if BTC resumes a strong uptrend or “enters a new macro bull phase in 2026,” the subsequent capital rotation into larger-cap alts such as XRP can push it “dramatically higher.” In conclusion, the AI chatbot said it’s possible for XRP to hit $10 eventually, but it’s highly unlikely to happen soon, and added: “XRP can reach $10 in the long run — especially in a supercycle scenario or if multiple ETFs attract billions in inflows. But based on current momentum, liquidity, and market structure, achieving that target within the next 12 months appears highly ambitious.” The post Can XRP Realistically Hit $10?

Its presale is a testament to the power of true innovation, with Phase 1 concluding in just over a week after selling 10 million tokens and raising $500,000 . The momentum has only intensified, with total contributions now soaring past the $1 million milestone from a rapidly expanding base of over 2,100 investors . As a fully decentralized ecosystem prioritizing user ownership, GeeFi is capturing widespread attention. Analysts are watching closely, predicting the upcoming Phase 3 will sell out in under 10 days amid growing rumors of imminent listings on major exchanges. Unmatched Utility in a Volatile Landscape While major cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) trade around $132.19 and face market headwinds, investors are seeking projects with stronger fundamentals and real-world utility. GeeFi provides a compelling alternative with its robust, non-custodial ecosystem. The GeeFi Wallet gives users complete sovereignty over their private keys, delivering a level of security that centralized services cannot guarantee. The feature-rich mobile app is already available on Android , with a dedicated iOS version currently in development. The GeeFi ecosystem is more than just a wallet. It integrates a powerful Decentralized Exchange (DEX) supporting over 14 networks , which allows for seamless cross-chain swaps and bridging. The forthcoming GeeFi Crypto Card is set to revolutionize daily spending by enabling global transactions through the VISA and Mastercard networks. Developed by a dedicated team since 2023 , GeeFi has built a platform centered on utility and financial freedom, setting it apart from its competitors. An Unprecedented Presale Opportunity The GeeFi presale is structured to reward early believers with exceptional returns. Currently in Phase 2 , tokens are priced at an incredibly low $0.06 . This entry point is creating a buying frenzy, especially since the confirmed listing price of $0.40 guarantees early investors a remarkable 667% return . The potential for astronomical growth is undeniable: a $1,200 investment at the current price could surge to $40,000 if the token reaches a conservative $2 valuation , delivering a 3,233% ROI . With Phase 2 already 70% sold out , having raised over $570,000 from 9.4 million tokens sold, time is running out. Rumors that the team is considering listings on major exchanges only add to the urgency. Supercharge Your Portfolio with Elite Staking Rewards GeeFi offers some of the most attractive and sustainable yields in the crypto space, creating powerful incentives for long-term holders. Investors can earn a massive 55% APR by locking their GEE tokens for 12 months. For those who prefer more flexibility, the platform also provides options for 22% APR over three months and 15% APR for a one-month lock. Even better, users who want to maintain full liquidity can still earn up to 10% APR with no lock-up period, allowing them to grow their assets while staying agile in the market. The earning potential is further enhanced by a lucrative referral program . By sharing a unique personal link, users can earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made by their referrals. This community-focused approach incentivizes organic growth and rewards early adopters for expanding the ecosystem. Seize the Chance to Invest in a 100x Gem This is the kind of ground-floor opportunity that can define a portfolio. While legacy coins struggle, GeeFi is demonstrating unstoppable momentum with a product that is already live and delivering value. Analysts are increasingly pointing to GeeFi as a potential 100x gem , citing its impressive presale performance, clear utility, and staggering ROI potential. The window to get in at this low price is closing fast. With Phase 2 selling out at a record pace and a guaranteed price increase just around the corner, the fear of missing out is warranted. Secure your GEE tokens now before this project takes off and this life-changing opportunity is gone for good.

Jason pointed out that Trump has not announced a decision yet but argued that if Trump selects Kevin, it would align with the way markets are already behaving. As you can see below, Jason shared alongside his post a Kalshi chart showing Kevin’s rising odds paired with softer future inflation pricing, fueled by the platform’s gamblers. Source : Jason Miller/X Kevin, who directs the National Economic Council, climbed fast to the front of the race in the past week. The odds on Polymarket moved from about 30% at the end of November to 73% by Friday, putting him well ahead of any other rumored candidate. Cryptopolitan had reported that Trump said during a White House event on Wednesday:- “I guess a potential Fed Chair is here too, I don’t know, are we allowed to say that? Potential. He’s a respected person, that I can tell you. Thank you, Kevin.” Bond traders respond as Hassett leads Naturally, Treasury markets reacted as Kevin’s chances went up. Since Bloomberg reported last Tuesday that he was the top contender, the 10-year yield has surged by 14 basis points as of press time, showing investors adjusting to the idea of a Fed chair who has publicly pushed for sharp rate cuts in the past. The jump in yields came even though Kevin is known for arguing for lower borrowing costs, meaning the trading floor sees the possibility of inflation returning if cuts come too fast. That view showed up in comments from Michael Brown, who serves as senior research strategist at Pepperstone. Michael said, “That’s basically because we know that Kevin Hassett is very, very loyal to President Trump. It is almost solely on the back of Hassett, given that we’ve had nothing really else to trade on this week.” His point was also mirrored in the currency market, where the U.S. Dollar Index dropped from 99 to 98 after the Bloomberg report, even though stronger Treasury yields typically support the dollar. The combination of a weaker dollar and higher yields has become part of the market’s judgment of what Kevin at the Fed could mean. It also fed into the call from Ryan Swift, the chief bond strategist at BCA Research, who wrote, “We continue to recommend Treasury curve steepeners as a high conviction trade heading into 2026,” adding that he expected long-term yields to keep climbing on the back of the current expectations. Some investors are reading Kevin’s rise as an early signal that inflation may sit above the Fed’s target for longer. Art Hogan, who works as chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, said, “I think that investors are looking at the whole picture and saying, ‘well, inflation is certainly going to be reported above the Fed’s target for quite some time.’” There is also the structural limit on how much a Fed chair can do without support. The chair holds only one vote out of twelve on the Federal Open Market Committee, which means Kevin would still need agreement from officials who lean more hawkish. Cryptopolitan predicts that convincing those members to back fast or deep rate cuts would not be guaranteed, even with Trump’s backing.

TRX is the native token of the Tron network used to govern and settle transaction fees. In retrospect, Tron (TRX) has performed better than most mega-altcoins. Over the long term, TRX is set to trend higher. Is TRX a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in three years? Let’s get into the TRX price prediction to answer these questions and more.

Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.291, whereby its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.270. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is currently hovering in the neutral region as it moves upward. The indicator’s value has increased to index 52 in the past 24 hours. The upward curve on the RSI graph reflects a balanced market setup. If the bulls persist, we can expect a further upturn in coin value. TRX/USD 4-hour chart analysis In contrast with the daily chart, the four-hour price analysis of Tron indicates a decreasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The TRX/USD price has decreased to $0.286 in the past few hours. Immediate support is also present just below the current price level at $0.285, as the recovery also started just below that point a few hours ago. Simultaneously, the increasing volatility suggests a higher chance of a price reversal. TRX/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: Tradingview The Bollinger Bands are slowly widening due to increasing volatility levels. This level of volatility signals more market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.291, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.277, securing the support. The RSI indicator has returned to the neutral region. The indicator’s score has decreased to 57 in the past four hours. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph signifies bearish presence; if the bears succeed in continuing their lead, a further downtick in the coin’s value can be expected.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022, as per crypto market data. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May, while it observed its yearly high price of $0.370 on August 14. In October, Tron started its descent and fell below $0.30 by the end of the month. At the start of December, Tron is trending below the $0.30 range, maintaining its price above $0.28, as the current Tron sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX|USDT|RESEARCH|BNB|USDD|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-07 09:00:00

After a rough start to the year, things started to look up for the price of Bitcoin in the second and third quarters, as it set multiple all-time highs across the six-month period. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has largely struggled in the final months of 2025, looking set to end the year in the red. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data and historical patterns suggest that the price of Bitcoin might be set for a fairly stronger yearly close than expected. No Negative Days Left In 2025, But 2026 Could Feature A Deep Correction On Saturday, December 6, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson took to the X platform to share what to expect from the Bitcoin price in the last days of 2025. According to the on-chain expert, the market leader is likely to close the year in a sideways price range. The relevant metric here is the Yearly Accumulated Negative Days, which tracks market resilience by measuring the number of days in a year where an asset’s daily price candlestick closed in the red. According to historical data and patterns, Bitcoin typically witnesses an average of 170 days of negative price movement in a year. This mean figure or level provides insight into the stress threshold for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. When the number of negative days is approaching or exceeds this threshold of 170 days, as Bitcoin already has in 2025, the selling pressure in the market tends to wane as fatigue sets in among the bears. Wedson revealed that the premier cryptocurrency has already accumulated 171 negative days so far in 2025. The on-chain expert noted that exceeding this threshold “strongly suggests” that the price of Bitcoin might not witness any more negative days in the final few weeks of 2025. Wedson said that if a deeper correction is imminent for the market leader, it will most likely happen in the next year. However, as the Alphractal founder highlighted, the Bitcoin price is more likely to end the year within a consolidation range. Adding further credence to this postulation is the lack of market demand, as seen with reduced capital influx into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,397, reflecting a mere 0.3% drop in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT|crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-07 09:00:16

However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the premier cryptocurrency might be readying for its next healthy upward move. BTC SOPR Drops To Lowest Level Since Early 2024 In a December 6 post on the X platform, CryptoOnchain hypothesized that a local bottom appears to be forming for the price of Bitcoin. According to the market pundit, the selling pressure, especially amongst long-term holders, seems to be fading off at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Tightens: One Break Above This Zone Could Ignite A Run To $107,000 This market observation centers on the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric, which evaluates the profitability ratio of spent outputs for both long-term and short-term holders. This on-chain indicator evaluates whether market participants are selling their assets at a profit or at a loss. Typically, when the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio has a value greater than 1, it indicates that the investors are selling at a profit. On the flip side, an SOPR value less than 1 implies that the market participants are offloading their coins while in the red. According to CryptoOnchain, the Bitcoin SOPR has now fallen to 1.35, its lowest level since early 2024. The market analyst noted that this metric’s latest movement suggests a complete reset in market profitability, especially as the price of BTC slid beneath the $90,000 mark. Furthermore, CryptoOnchain highlighted that the heavy profit-taking phase by long-term holders appears to be coming to an end, as exhaustion and fatigue increasingly spread among the bears. From a historical perspective, the SOPR metric falling to this low signals a local bottom is forming for the BTC price, especially as the market cools down. Ultimately, CryptoOnchain revealed that a price rebound at this point could set the stage for Bitcoin’s next healthy upward rally. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,500, reflecting no significant changes in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is down by nearly 2% in the last seven days.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-this-boat-has-not-yet-sailed-heres-why/,"XRP trades in a tight range with traders studying each move in a complex market structure. Many investors wait for a clear signal, and ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) has highlighted a crucial one. The current pattern aligns with the Wyckoff structure, a well-known reaccumulation model. This model guides traders when an asset pauses after a prior advance and prepares for its next phase. ChartNerd pointed to one critical point that could dictate XRP’s next trend. $XRP : This boat has not yet sailed —however, if we fail to create a double bottom in this territory and lose macro support. The first thing we look for is the 'Spring' formation in this Wyckoff reaccumulation schematic. https://t.co/BEq0pnLxku pic.twitter.com/BxBEfo3kbH — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 5, 2025 Wyckoff Structure Takes Shape The analyst posted a detailed chart that maps XRP’s price action onto a Wyckoff reaccumulation schematic . This model divides the market into phases. Each phase tracks how price reacts to support zones, resistance zones, and volume behavior. XRP now sits in a zone that matches the model’s lower boundary. ChartNerd stated that “this boat has not yet sailed,” but warned that traders need a clear reaction at current levels to maintain the structure. The chart displays phases A through E, with XRP moving at the center of the range for most of the year. Phase A captured the initial stop of the prior decline. Phase B built the core of the range as sellers and buyers tested each other. Phase C holds the most importance now because it often includes the “Spring”, a sharp dip that clears the range before a strong move higher. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Support Faces a Test XRP trades near macro support on the chart. This support defines the lower boundary of the reaccumulation range. The analyst has tracked this pattern for some time and noted that XRP must form a double bottom in this region to keep the current structure. If the price loses this level, traders then look for a Spring event. The Spring sits below the support line on the schematic. It forces price into a final shakeout before strong buyers step in. The chart he posted shows a possible drop into the Spring, followed by a quick recovery and a Test. Another prominent analyst has highlighted a similar structure and believes it will send XRP upward. A successful Test sets the stage for a move into Phase D, where the asset’s price will start showing strength. Possible Path Forward If XRP holds support or completes a Spring, the structure points to a Test followed by a move toward resistance. The chart marks this as a “Jump across the creek”, then an SOS phase with higher support levels. ChartNerd’s layout shows a possible breakout in early 2026 . XRP now sits in Phase C, where its next move defines the trend. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The Korean government is seeking to impose bank-level, no-fault compensation rules on exchanges, noting that the development was prompted by the breach. According to market watchers, the new development will also be a result of the lack of a regulatory framework in the country’s digital asset industry. With the move, crypto exchanges would be treated the same way traditional finance is treated, with the Korean government applying the same scrutiny to compliance, consumer protection standards, and the overall regulatory guidelines for the Korean crypto industry. Korean government wants to improve oversight in the crypto industry According to the reports , the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is looking into provisions that will require Korean virtual assets providers or exchanges to compensate users for losses caused by hacks or system failures. The new development is coming regardless of whether the exchange is at fault. This no-fault standard is currently applied to financial firms and electronic payments firms under the law governing financial transactions. The new development, according to the report, was propelled by the November 27 hack incident involving Upbit. The incident saw more than 104 billion Solana-based tokens, which were roughly about 44.5 billion won ($30.1 million), moved to external wallets within minutes. The scammers stole several tokens, including Bonk, Solana, Pudgy Penguins, and the Official Trump token. However, despite the breach, the exchange has faced little to no penalties. This is because regulators cannot order the exchange to compensate victims of the hack under the current law. With the new update, the FSC would have the power to make crypto exchanges liable for compensating victims, following the same obligations that financial entities face if they become victims of hacks or system failures. The move is also coming amid several system failures across the crypto sector. Lawmakers set to release updated draft regulations In data submitted by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) to lawmakers, the five major Korean crypto exchanges, Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, recorded a cumulative 20 system failures from 2023 through September 2025. The incidents affected more than 900 users, with a combined 5 billion won recorded as losses from the incidents. Upbit accounted for six of the incidents, with more than 600 victims affected in a combined 3 billion won worth of losses. The draft legislation is expected to include requirements that will strengthen security, including mandatory IT security infrastructure plans, significantly stronger penalties, and upgraded standards for systems and personnel. Lawmakers are currently looking into a revision that would allow firms to pay fines of up to 3% of their annual revenues for hacking incidents at crypto exchanges, the same standards that traditional financial institutions follow. Currently, the maximum fine for crypto exchanges is capped at 5 billion won. Meanwhile, the Upbit incident has also raised issues related to delayed reporting. According to reports, the hack was detected around 5 AM on November 27, but Upbit failed to report it to the FSS until 10:58 AM, a difference of six hours. As a result, some Korean lawmakers claimed that the exchange deliberately withheld the information until after a scheduled merger of Dunamu and Naver Financial was finalized. As a result, the FSS is looking into the breach, but reports noted that the exchange may not be sanctioned heavily. FSS Governor Lee Chan-Jin noted the seriousness of the incidents and the limits of current oversight. “The hacking is not something we can overlook. However, regulatory oversight clearly has limits in imposing penalties,” he said.

As the project enters a crucial stage in late Q4 and an increasing number of buyers start to emerge day by day, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) becomes one of the hottest top crypto opportunities that are priced below $0.05. Quick Presale Acceleration and Growing Measures Mutuum Finance opened the offering in early 2025 at $0.01. Now the price of the token is at $0.035, which is a 250% growth in the development. It has already accumulated over $19.2M in the project, surpassed 18,300 holders and sold over 810M tokens. This is at phase 6 now, and they are over 95% so that a few tokens at this stage remain. Its official launching price is $0.06 which has assisted in hastening the participation because the contrast between the two prices is even more eminent. Activity has continued at a high level because of a 24 hour leaderboard, which awards the best contributor with $500 in MUTM. The ease of using the card payment has also ensured a new user joins in fewer steps. These factors added together have driven up demand since the stage has reached an almost completion stage. The Process behind What Mutuum Finance Is Building Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending protocol that will be used to facilitate structured borrowing and lending. The platform enables the participants to provide assets such as ETH or USDC. When they do they get mtTokens. These mtTokens are valued with the borrowers paying back the interest. A buy-and-distribute model is also provided in the design of the protocol. Part of the platform revenue is purchased to acquire MUTM in the market. Bought tokens are subsequently given to the users who stake the mtTokens. This protocol brings perpetual purchasing pressure as the protocol expands. Security remains a priority. Mutuum Finance was audited by CertiK falling short to 90/100 on Token Scan and Halborn Security is auditing the contract suite. There is a $50K bug bounty reward which is offered to address any remaining code problems up to the point of testnet release. Stablecoin and Oracle Framework Mutuum Finance plans to launch a USD-backed interest-backed stablecoin. Stablecoins enable lending markets to scale in terms of predictable value and greater liquidity. They also ensure that borrowing is made more effective since users are not facing volatility in managing the collateral. Chainlink feeds will be used as the primary oracle layer in the protocol according to the official roadmap. The additional data sources and aggregated prices are utilized to avoid liquidation errors. Consistent oracles are needed in the lending systems since they dictate the valuation of collateral in case of quick market moves. These characteristics have prompted other analysts to project significant expansion to MUTM when the protocol would be activated. The initial predictions indicate that there may be a growth rate of 5x to 7x on the condition that in the near future, lending demand may grow once more after V1 and the integration of stablecoins throughout the platform. Whale Activity and Why this Moment Matters On their official X-account, Mutuum Finance promised that the launch of the V1 testnet will happen in Q4 2025. V1 encompasses the lending pool, mtTokens, the liquidation module as well as the debt system. At launch, available will be ETH and USDT. This milestone is supposed to push the project to the stage of development to active testing which usually results in new interest in the market. Phase 6 is currently accelerating due to the increased number of users attempting to get tokens prior to the timeframe ending. Recent whale purchase of over $120K served to deplete the remainance supply and increase the publicity of the project. This behavior of whales is also considered as a show of confidence as bigger investors tend to become part of it when they think that they are going to make good strides in the next milestones. As the launch price is $0.06, and increasing demand, audited contracts and a nearby testnet, Mutuum Finance is getting more mainstream as one of the potential best crypto to buy now under the $0.05 mark. With the growing interest and remaining days until 2026, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a new cryptocurrency opportunity.

Is Bittensor TAO a good investment? TAO coin continues to trade higher, indicating growing adoption among crypto investors. Despite this, the coin faces uncertainties and volatility like all other cryptocurrencies. Our Cryptopolitan price prediction explores its expected movements from 2025 to 2031. Why is TAO down? TAO is down primarily due to sell pressure from validators and weak market sentiment surrounding speculative AI tokens. Recent breakdowns below key support levels also accelerated the decline.

However, Bittensor (TAO) tokens can be purchased and traded on different exchanges, including Binance, Bitget, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken.

Bittensor (TAO) historic price sentiment TAO price history by Coingecko TAO launched on March 6, 2023, at $93.4, but fell below its opening price within a week, sliding into the $76 range. By early April, it had lost half its value, dropping to $47, and continued downward to its $30.83 low in May before slowly recovering to $63 by the end of the month.

A brief rebound to $357 faded again as the token slipped back toward the mid-$200s by late summer. Momentum returned in October, pushing TAO into the $660 range before cooling to $468. It climbed once more to $679 in November but ultimately closed 2024 at $440.69. TAO opened 2025 at $439.73, peaked at $565 in January, and its price decreased to the $324 level in February.

This comprehensive crypto ecosystem concluded its first phase in less than two weeks, raising an impressive $500,000 . The momentum has only accelerated in Phase 2, which has already secured over $570,000 . Analysts are watching closely as this phase is now more than 70% sold out. Predictions suggest Phase 3 could launch as early as next week, indicating that the window for early entry is closing much faster than anticipated. Historical Trends vs. Tangible Utility Cardano is eyeing a bullish December with a massive $70M ADA treasury push and a historical setup favoring gains, though it faces stiff resistance at $0.4597 . While ADA aims for a breakout, smart investors are turning their focus to GeeFi, a platform built on concrete utility rather than historical patterns. GeeFi is designed as a complete ecosystem for the modern crypto user, anchored by the GeeFi DEX, a decentralized exchange offering secure, non-custodial trading with full user control. The platform’s utility goes beyond simple trading. GeeFi is preparing to roll out its own Crypto Cards, supported by VISA and Mastercard, bridging the gap between digital assets and real-world spending. This ecosystem is powered by the GEE token’s deflationary model, which employs systematic burns to reduce supply over time. This mechanism is engineered to increase scarcity, directly rewarding long-term holders by fostering sustained value appreciation as the platform grows. Massive Upside Potential for Early Adopters GeeFi’s presale is currently in Phase 2, offering tokens at the highly attractive price of $0.06 . This entry point provides a significant advantage, as the token is confirmed to list at $0.40 , locking in a guaranteed 667% return for presale participants. The long-term outlook is even more compelling, with analysts forecasting a potential price of $2 per token. At this valuation, a $1,600 investment today could grow to $60,000 , delivering a staggering 3,233% ROI . The speed of the presale validates these high expectations. Over 9.5 million tokens have already been sold in Phase 2, raising more than $570,000 . This intense demand has led experts to predict a swift end to the current phase, fueled further by circulating reports of upcoming listings on major exchanges. Such listings typically act as powerful catalysts for price appreciation, driving significant growth immediately following the public launch. Industry-Leading Staking and Referral Rewards Beyond capital appreciation, GeeFi offers a robust passive income structure through its versatile staking program. Accessible directly within the GeeFi Wallet, users can choose from options tailored to their strategy. A flexible staking plan offers up to 10% APR with no lock-up period. For those seeking higher yields, fixed-term options provide 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and a market-leading 55% APR for twelve months . Additionally, the platform incentivizes community growth with a referral program offering a 5% bonus on all contributions made through unique referral links. A Rare Chance to Catch the Next 100x Project Market analysts are increasingly identifying GeeFi as a potential 100x opportunity, a rarity in the current market cycle. The ongoing presale phase represents a fleeting chance to invest in a high-utility project before it reaches the broader public market. With Phase 2 selling out rapidly and a price increase scheduled for Phase 3, the opportunity to maximize returns is shrinking by the hour. Investors are moving quickly to secure their GEE tokens before the next price hike, driven by the fear of missing out on what could be the year’s breakout success.

Traders and active investors are watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) closely as inflows test the $0.035 level. This article explains why MUTM is at the center of these movements, highlighting presale momentum, product readiness, and buy-and-distribute mechanics that are expected to drive further demand. Understanding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Its Lending Models Total supply of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at 4B tokens. Combined presale funds raised are approximately $19.20 million while total holders across all phases exceed 18,400. The current presale price in Phase 6 is $0.035, with an allocation of 170M tokens — 95% of these are already sold. The next phase price is projected at $0.040, representing a 15% step. Phase 6 is nearly complete — this is the current buying window at $0.035 before the next phase price step. An investor who bought $3,000 in Phase 1 at $0.01 would hold 300,000 MUTM tokens. Today, at $0.035, this position is valued at $10.5K. At the projected listing price of $0.06, the same tokens would reach $18K. If the token reaches the $1 milestone, holdings would be valued $300,000, and at $2, $600,000. These scenarios illustrate the upside potential for early buyers in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Early entry in Phase 6 positions investors to benefit from both product adoption and upcoming price steps. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a presale-stage on-chain lending and borrowing protocol. It focuses on practical lending products designed to generate ongoing protocol activity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has confirmed via its official X handle that the V1 release of its protocol is scheduled to go live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This initial deployment will introduce the protocol’s foundational components, including the liquidity pool, the mtToken and debt token systems, along with an automated liquidator bot that safeguards collateral and maintains operational stability. During this phase, users will be able to lend, borrow, and leverage ETH or USDT as collateral. Mutuum is being built on two lending models. The first, Peer-to-Contract (P2C), pools liquidity in audited smart contracts. Lenders receive mtTokens representing their share of the pool and any yield earned. Rates adjust automatically based on pool usage. The second, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), allows direct agreements between two parties for less liquid or higher-risk tokens. Terms are negotiated individually, isolating volatility from core pools. Together, these models are expected to generate continuous activity and strengthen token demand. Utility and Platform Activity Driving Post Launch Growth Every lending, borrowing, and staking action on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates protocol revenue and demand for MUTM. mtTokens, staking rewards, and platform incentives are all tied to the token. Real product usage makes demand repeatable rather than one-off speculation. Lending markets, collateral utilization, and staking flows will drive continuous activity. Traders and early investors will find that every transaction encourages more token circulation and strengthens platform engagement. This activity reinforces MUTM’s status as a best crypto to invest for future gains. The team has planned to launch a beta near the time the token goes live. This beta will include working lending, borrowing, and staking features. Early users, liquidity providers, and content creators will test these functionalities, producing on-chain flows. Organic word-of-mouth and early adoption will naturally translate into buying interest. The beta’s timing aligns with the current presale phase, further pushing the $0.035 price level as investors anticipate real usage. This demonstrates why crypto is a good investment in tokens linked to live products. Depositors on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) receive mtTokens representing their principal plus accrued yield. mtTokens can be staked to earn MUTM rewards. A portion of platform revenue will buy MUTM from the market, which is then distributed to stakers. This creates a loop: revenue leads to market buys, rewarding stakers, encouraging more staking, and driving further platform activity. This cycle connects protocol usage directly to token demand. It ensures that as the platform grows, token inflows remain consistent. Buyers entering Phase 6 will see their actions contributing to this momentum, reinforcing why MUTM is actively sought. Community Momentum from Giveaways and Leaderboards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has built community-driven mechanisms to increase engagement. The project has over 12,000 Twitter followers. An ongoing $100K giveaway rewards ten winners with $10,000 each in MUTMs. The dashboard is live for users to track holdings and calculate ROIs. The top 50 leaderboard grants bonus MUTM to the largest investors. A daily leaderboard awards $500 MUTM to the top-ranked user performing at least one transaction, resetting at 00:00 UTC. These features create transaction volume and social traction, contributing to increased buy-side activity at the $0.035 level. Mutuum Finance’s finalized lending and borrowing contracts are now under an independent audit by Halborn Security. The team is performing a deep formal review of the code to ensure its robustness, correctness, and overall security before it goes live. Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is 95% sold, and the current price is $0.035. The next phase moves to $0.040, representing a 15% step. Early buyers will have a unique opportunity to participate before the price increase. This is the last practical moment to buy at the current price.

Market watchers are eyeing a significant price level, hinting at possible gains. Could the cryptocurrency be on the verge of a breakout towards $90? An analysis reveals which coins might be poised for growth amidst this trend. Powered by Outset PR, this analysis reflects the agency’s commitment to strategic, data-driven communication for the crypto industry. Litecoin Holds Steady Amid Market Fluctuations Source: tradingview Litecoin (LTC) prices currently range between $80 and $86. The coin is navigating a cautious path near its 10-day average of about $83. While the value has dipped around 5% over the week, its steady position above $80 suggests resilience. The nearest hurdle lies at $89, but if surpassed, LTC could aim for the $95 mark, representing a potential 10% increase from the lower end of its range. However, a dip below the $78 support might signal further decline. With an RSI below 35, LTC hints at being oversold, indicating a possible bounce.

Crypto enthusiast Skipper addressed this subject by sharing a video that outlines the core reasoning behind the current pace of adoption. The video focuses on the structural, technical, and institutional steps required for a digital asset to function at the center of global financial systems. Skipper’s post centers on these foundational elements, presenting them as the key to understanding the broader trajectory of XRP’s intended role. PART 1 THE TRUTH ABOUT XRP AND WHY BANKS AREN'T YET USING IT. THIS VIDEO EXPLAINS IT CLEARLY, AND THE HATERS WILL SURELY HATE THE FACT THAT THE #XRP LEDGER, RIPPLE, AND XRP ARE BUILT TO DOMINATE GLOBAL FINANCE. pic.twitter.com/lfYwtphLov — Skipper | XRPL (@skipper_xrp) December 5, 2025 Infrastructure as the First Phase According to the explanation provided in the video, the absence of widespread institutional settlement with XRP is not a sign of failure or hesitation. Instead, it reflects a planned sequence of development. The speaker detailed that Ripple’s initial objective was not immediate asset usage, but rather the creation of a resilient and scalable financial architecture. This stage involved building the XRP Ledger , a system engineered to support high-speed, cost-efficient, secure settlement of institutional value . The protocol was designed to move large sums globally, meeting operational demands that exceed typical retail activity. The video emphasized that institutional adoption can only begin once the foundation demonstrates consistent reliability. Establishing Trust with Key Institutions The second stage outlined in the video focused on integration. This step involved building trust with central banks, regulated financial institutions, payment companies, and other entities that influence global monetary processes. The speaker noted that these partnerships were never meant to force immediate XRP settlement. Instead, the purpose was to embed Ripple’s technology within existing financial infrastructure. By integrating the ledger and related systems directly into traditional financial rails, Ripple established a level of familiarity and operational confidence that institutions require before transitioning to new settlement standards. Why Adoption Cannot Be Instant The video also underscored that no major financial system will adopt a new protocol overnight. Large-scale institutional use depends on proven reliability, compliance, interoperability, and assurance that the technology can operate seamlessly at a global scale. The speaker explained that this is why Ripple focused first on technological refinement and institutional alignment rather than early XRP implementation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The process involves ensuring speed, efficiency, scalability, and environmental sustainability, all of which the XRP Ledger was built to address. For global institutions, these assurances are prerequisites rather than optional features. Outlook on Future Usage Skipper’s post highlights a perspective that portrays XRP’s adoption path as progressing through defined phases rather than sudden deployment. The explanation given in the video suggests that the groundwork being laid is intended to support eventual large-scale settlement once trust, infrastructure, and integration are fully aligned. Observers who monitor institutional movements often focus on short-term indicators. However, the video positions the current stage as part of a longer-term strategy where widespread usage follows the completion of foundational requirements.

Source: Bloomberg More than 100 publicly traded companies transformed themselves into cryptocurrency-holding vehicles in the first half of 2025, borrowing billions to buy digital tokens while their stock prices initially soared past the value of the underlying assets they purchased. The strategy seemed unstoppable until market reality delivered a harsh correction. Strategy’s Model Spawns Industry-Wide Collapse Strategy Inc.’s Michael Saylor pioneered the approach of converting corporate cash into Bitcoin holdings, transforming his software company into a publicly traded cryptocurrency treasury. The model worked spectacularly through the mid-2025, attracting high-profile investors, including the Trump family . SharpLink Gaming epitomized the frenzy. The company pivoted from traditional gaming operations , appointed an Ethereum co-founder as chairman, and announced massive token purchases. Sharplink Gaming added $80M in Ether to its reserves, lifting total holdings to $3.6B and cementing its spot as the second-largest corporate holder of ETH. #Sharplink #Ether https://t.co/ADz76OeiCn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 27, 2025 Its stock exploded 2,600% within days before crashing 86% from peak levels, leaving total market capitalization below the value of its Ethereum holdings at just 0.9 times crypto reserves. Bloomberg data tracking 138 U.S. and Canadian digital asset treasuries shows the median share price has fallen 43% year-to-date, dramatically underperforming Bitcoin’s modest 7% decline. In comparison, the S&P 500 gained 6% and the Nasdaq 100 rose 10%. Strategy shares have dropped 60% from their July highs, even as they have risen by more than 1,200% since the company began buying Bitcoin in August 2020. Source: Bloomberg “ Investors took a look and understood that there’s not much yield from these holdings rather than just sitting on this pile of money, ” B. Riley Securities analyst Fedor Shabalin told Bloomberg. Debt Obligations Expose Structural Flaws The fundamental problem plaguing these companies stems from how they fund cryptocurrency purchases. Strategy and its imitators issued massive amounts of convertible bonds and preferred shares, raising over $45 billion across the industry to acquire digital tokens that generate no cash flow. These debt instruments carry substantial interest and dividend obligations that cryptocurrency holdings cannot service, creating a structural mismatch between liabilities that require regular payments and assets that produce zero income. Strategy faces annual fixed obligations of approximately $750 million to $800 million tied to preferred shares. Companies that avoided Bitcoin for smaller, more volatile cryptocurrencies suffered the steepest losses. Alt5 Sigma, backed by two Trump sons and planning to purchase over $1 billion in World Liberty Financial’s WLFI token, has crashed more than 85% from its June peak. Strategy attempted to address funding concerns by raising $1.44 billion in dollar reserves through stock sales , covering 21 months of dividend payments. Saylor Admits Potential Bitcoin Sales The industry now faces its defining moment. Strategy CEO Phong Le acknowledged the company would sell Bitcoin if needed to fund dividend payments, specifically if the firm’s market value falls below its cryptocurrency holdings. Those comments sent shockwaves through the digital asset treasury sector, given Saylor’s repeated insistence that Strategy would never sell, famously joking in February to “ sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin. “ At December’s Binance Blockchain Week, Saylor outlined the revised approach, stating that “ when our equity is trading above the net asset value of the Bitcoin, we just sell the equity, ” but “ when the equity’s trading below the value of the Bitcoin, we would either sell Bitcoin derivatives, or we would just sell the Bitcoin. “ The reversal raises fears of a downward spiral where forced crypto sales push token prices lower, further pressuring treasury company valuations and potentially triggering additional selling. Strategy’s monthly Bitcoin accumulation has collapsed from 134,000 BTC at the 2024 peak to just 9,100 BTC in November, with only 135 BTC added so far in December. The company now holds approximately 650,000 BTC , valued at over $56 billion, representing more than 3% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply. Market participants worry that leveraged traders using borrowed money to invest in these companies could face margin calls, forcing broader market selloffs. Strategy has created a $1.4 billion reserve fund to cover near-term dividend payments, but shares remain on track for a 38% decline this year despite the company’s massive Bitcoin holdings.
