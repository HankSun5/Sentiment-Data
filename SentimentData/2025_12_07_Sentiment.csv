Extreme fear dominates crypto markets, yet history shows such conditions often precede major price reversals. Steph IS CRYPTO highlights that this contrarian environment could create a favorable risk-to-reward scenario for investors ready to act. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently shows “extreme fear,” historically a strong signal for potential upside. Similar readings in June 2022, April 2023, and July 2024 preceded significant gains for XRP. Such patterns suggest that patient investors could benefit by positioning themselves against prevailing market sentiment. Institutional Demand Is Rising Institutional interest in XRP is accelerating, particularly through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Recent data indicate that inflows to these ETFs are approaching $1 billion, signaling substantial demand from large investors. Surprisingly, XRP’s price has not yet fully reflected this inflow, creating a temporary disconnect between supply and market valuation. You Have NO Idea What’s Coming for #XRP … Watch asap! https://t.co/i0toVaF6WK pic.twitter.com/wIQHyTALEj — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 5, 2025 ETF inflows matter because they reduce available XRP supply on exchanges . Coins are being moved into custody, likely off-market and away from short-term trading. This tightening of supply sets the stage for a potential price reaction once buying pressure intensifies. Whales and Long-Term Holders Are Accumulating On-chain data shows XRP whales steadily accumulating while short-term holders continue selling. This shift implies confidence among long-term investors, who are absorbing selling pressure and reinforcing key support levels. Steph notes that long-term holders are buying again for the first time since October, signaling renewed conviction in XRP’s prospects. This dynamic often precedes bullish trends. When major holders accumulate while smaller investors exit, the stage is set for structural market improvements. It also suggests that the bottoming process for XRP could be concluding, offering a foundation for potential upward momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical Analysis Supports a Bullish Thesis XRP is consolidating around significant support zones, indicating stability in the short term. On the daily chart, prices show consistent support, while the 4-hour timeframe hints at a possible double bottom pattern — a classic bullish reversal formation. Traders are anticipating higher highs as these technical patterns materialize. If realized, the combination of support stability, long-term accumulation, and institutional inflows could spark renewed buying interest, creating a favorable environment for price appreciation. Caution Remains Essential While the setup is compelling, investors must remain cautious. Extreme fear can persist longer than expected, and crypto markets are increasingly driven by institutions, which may alter traditional sentiment-based signals. Historical trends provide guidance, not guarantees, and risk management remains critical. Combining institutional ETF inflows, whale accumulation, and technical patterns suggests XRP could be on the brink of a significant move . For informed investors, the current environment may represent one of the rare opportunities in today’s crypto markets.

According to Buterin, while transaction fees are low today, users don't have a clear understanding of how fees will change over the next two years. Therefore, the market needs a new mechanism to generate expectations about future gas fees. Buterin explained that such a futures market could function like a prediction market built on BASEFEE, allowing users to see market signals about future gas prices more transparently and protect themselves against potential price increases. This structure would effectively allow users to purchase the amount of gas they will need within a specific timeframe, effectively “prepaying.” Related News: Experienced Economist Says, “The Fed Should Not Cut Interest Rates Next Week,” Explains Why Vitalik Buterin also noted that there are already startups working in this area, citing the Oiler project as an example. However, Buterin argued that the ecosystem is not yet mature, stating that the development and widespread adoption of such solutions would provide significant security and predictability for Ethereum users. *This is not investment advice.

Some come from meme coins, others from strong utility projects, and a few appear early before the market notices them. As analysts prepare for the next major upswing, attention is shifting to three altcoins that could play a big role. Two of them already proved their power in previous cycles, while the third is now entering a critical stage with 94% of Phase 6 sold out and strong momentum behind it. Pepecoin (PEPE) Pepecoin (PEPE) entered the market with no expectations, yet it quickly became one of the most talked-about meme tokens of its era. The token surged massively during its first major run as social interest exploded across the crypto community. Its market cap grew faster than analysts expected, driven almost entirely by online culture and community momentum. Today, PEPE still remains a recognizable name in meme-coin circles, but its growth curve has slowed. Large market caps tend to limit explosive gains, and analysts say PEPE may struggle to repeat its original breakout. While spikes may still appear, many traders are now exploring new entries that offer higher upside and clearer development roadmaps. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) also delivered one of the strongest rallies in meme-coin history. SHIB grew from near-zero levels to an asset that reached billions in market cap and built a global community. Early investors saw massive returns, and SHIB cemented itself as one of the top altcoins of the previous bull cycle. But like PEPE, SHIB now faces the same limitation: size. Its market cap is large, and the token’s growth has become slower compared to its early days. Analysts say SHIB may still move with the broader market, but the possibility of sharp, early-cycle gains is lower than before. Many traders now watching top crypto discussions are looking toward younger projects with more room to grow. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While PEPE and SHIB already had their explosive runs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is just beginning. The project is building a fully decentralized lending system with real utility, and its early progress has caught the attention of analysts tracking new crypto launches. Mutuum Finance opened its presale at $0.01 in early 2025. The token now trades at $0.035, marking a 250% rise from the first stage. The project has raised $19.1 million and passed 18,300 holders, with more than 810 million tokens already purchased. Out of the 4 billion total supply, 1.82 billion tokens were allocated for early backers. Phase 6 is now 94% sold out, and analysts say the shift from one stage to the next could happen without warning. Interest has been rising faster in recent days as traders search for DeFi projects with utility rather than meme-driven movement. The team confirmed through its official X account that the V1 testnet will launch on Sepolia in Q4 2025. This first version includes the liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tracking, and the liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be the first supported assets. This clear development roadmap is one of the reasons analysts expect MUTM to play a major role in the next market cycle. Price Outlook Mutuum Finance uses mtTokens to reward suppliers. When someone lends assets, they receive mtTokens that grow in value as borrowers repay interest. The yield depends on real usage, not set rewards. The platform also uses a buy-and-distribute model. A portion of revenue will be used to buy MUTM from the open market. Those purchased tokens are redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. Analysts say this creates long-term buying pressure that can support strong price movement once the platform gains active users. Accurate pricing is also important for lending markets, so the protocol will rely on Chainlink price feeds, fallback oracles, aggregated data, and on-chain DEX pricing when liquidity is strong. This ensures liquidations happen at the right time and keeps positions safe. Market analysts studying early DeFi cycles say that tokens with real lending utility tend to gain traction quickly once their first version is active. Some believe MUTM could rise 400% to 700% after V1, especially as long as borrowing markets grow at the pace seen in past DeFi expansions. L2 Expansion Mutuum Finance is preparing to introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin that will be minted and burned based on demand. The stablecoin will be backed by interest paid by borrowers, giving the protocol a stable internal asset for borrowing and lending. This is important because stablecoins have historically played a major role in the growth of DeFi ecosystems. The project also plans to expand to multiple layer-2 networks where fees are low and user activity is high. Analysts say this expansion could help Mutuum Finance enter a much larger market, with deeper liquidity pools and more borrowing demand. If the stablecoin and layer-2 rollout match expectations, some analysts believe MUTM could join lists of next crypto assets with strong growth potential heading into 2026. Strong Audits, Daily Incentives, and Presale Acceleration Security remains a strong focus for the team. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score. Halborn Security is reviewing the lending and borrowing contracts, while the project runs a $50K bug bounty to find vulnerabilities early. The project also has a 24-hour leaderboard where the top daily contributor receives $500 in MUTM. This feature has kept the community active and has helped push the treasury forward each day. With card payments available and increasing whale activity, the final section of Phase 6 is moving fast. Analysts say a recent $100K whale allocation is a strong signal that larger investors are entering before the next stage begins. PEPE and SHIB had their explosive moments, and both remain major names in the altcoin market. But analysts say their best days may be behind them. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, is in its early stages with real utility, rising demand, strong audits, and a confirmed V1 launch. With 94% of Phase 6 already sold out, this new DeFi project is now one of the top candidates for traders searching for the potential best crypto to buy now before the next cycle.

Earlier this week, the Polish President, Karol Nawrocki, vetoed a bill aimed at setting strict rules in the country’s digital assets market. Why Did The Polish President Veto The Digital Asset Bill? On Friday, December 5, Bloomberg reported that the lower house of the Polish parliament couldn’t secure the required three-fifths majority vote to override the President’s veto of the Crypto-Asset Market Act. This bill, introduced in June 2025, aimed to align Poland with the European Union’s MiCA framework for the digital asset markets. Related Reading: Key Updates On The US Crypto Market Structure Bill: What You Need To Know However, President Nawrocki decided against signing the crypto market legislation due to concerns that it may pose a real threat to the freedom of Poles, their property, and the stability of the country. According to the country’s leader, “overregulation” is one way to drive away new companies and investors, while seriously slowing innovation. As Bitcoinist earlier reported , the crypto community in Poland had already raised concerns about the regulation as early as September, especially as the bill surpassed the European Union (EU) minimum regulatory requirements. For instance, the bill’s messaging read that all Crypto Asset Service Providers are required to obtain a license from the Polish Financial Service Authority (KNF). Meanwhile, the bill proposed heavy fines and potential prison time for market participants who break the law. According to the Bloomberg report, supporters of the bill have also voiced out the need to provide regulatory oversight of Poland’s digital assets industry. Their belief is that clear, comprehensive rules are critical to fight fraud and avoid potential misuse of digital assets by bad actors. Poland’s Presidency Calls Crypto Bill A Legal Fiasco Rafael Leskiewicz, the press secretary of the President, took to the social media platform to react to the lawmakers’ failure to override the veto. The presidential spokesperson said the Crypto-Asset Market Act is a legal fiasco, while calling the attempt to overturn the president’s veto a political maneuver. Leskiewicz said in a statement: The President, by vetoing this act, exposed the low quality of the legislation being created. This market should be subject to monitoring and control, but certainly, bad law should not be created that restricts the freedom to conduct business activities. President Nawrocki, who was elected earlier in June, had always portrayed himself as a pro-Bitcoin leader who would rather veto regulatory restrictions than create new digital asset laws. According to market data, the adoption of crypto assets by Polish households has continued to grow in recent years, with the number of domestic users expected to hit 7.9 million by this year’s end.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Crypto-Asset Market Bill|Digital Assets|Karol Nawrocki|poland,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 20:30:42

The presale’s Phase 1 concluded in just over a week, a stunning achievement that saw 10 million tokens fly off the shelves and $500,000 raised. That momentum has only accelerated, with total funds now rocketing past the $1 million milestone from a rapidly expanding base of over 2,100 investors. As a decentralized ecosystem built on the principle of user ownership, GeeFi is capturing the attention of smart money. Analysts are now forecasting that the upcoming Phase 3 will last no more than 10 days, driven by strong rumors that the team is in advanced talks for major exchange listings. A Clear Upgrade From Legacy Coins While established altcoins show signs of weakness, with Ripple (XRP) currently trading around $2.06 and struggling with volatility, investors are seeking shelter and upside in GeeFi. This non-custodial ecosystem offers a solution to the centralization risks plaguing the industry. The GeeFi Wallet gives users 100% control over their private keys, providing a level of security that custodial platforms cannot match. The feature-rich mobile app is already available on Android, with an iOS version in development. The GeeFi ecosystem is far more than just a wallet. It integrates a powerful Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that supports over 14 networks, allowing for seamless asset swaps and bridging. The highly anticipated GeeFi Crypto Card is set to revolutionize crypto spending, enabling global transactions with both VISA and Mastercard. Developed since 2023, the GeeFi Team has built a platform focused on real-world utility and financial sovereignty, positioning it as a superior alternative to older, less secure networks. The Presale That Guarantees Explosive Returns The GeeFi presale is engineered to generate exceptional returns for its early supporters. Now in Phase 2, tokens are available for just $0.06 each. This incredibly low entry point is causing a surge in demand, as the confirmed listing price of $0.40 guarantees investors a massive 667% return. The potential for life-changing wealth is staggering: a $1,200 investment today could balloon to $40,000 if the token hits a $2 valuation, delivering a mind-blowing 3,233% ROI. With Phase 2 already 70% sold out, having raised over $570,000 from the sale of 9.4 million tokens, the window of opportunity is closing fast. Staking Rewards That Dominate the Market GeeFi is creating powerful incentives for long-term holders by offering some of the most competitive and sustainable yields available. Investors can lock their GEE tokens to earn an incredible 55% APR for 12 months. For those seeking greater flexibility, the platform also provides shorter-term options, including 22% APR for three months and 15% APR for just one month. Even better, users who prefer to keep their assets fully liquid can earn up to 10% APR without any lock-up period. The rewards don't end with staking. GeeFi’s innovative referral program gives users a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through their unique referral link. This approach encourages organic community growth and rewards early adopters for spreading the word. These high-yield passive income streams, all accessible within the secure GeeFi Wallet, make holding GEE a cornerstone of any serious wealth-building strategy. Your Final Call to Secure a 100x Gem This is a defining moment. Analysts are calling GeeFi a potential 100x gem, and its explosive presale performance in a shaky market validates that belief. While other investors are stuck waiting for legacy coins to recover, the smart money is moving into a project with a working product, a clear vision, and unprecedented ROI potential. The fear of missing out is justified. Phase 2 is selling out at a record pace, and a price increase is imminent. This is your final opportunity to secure a position in the next big crypto disruptor before it goes mainstream. Act now before this chance disappears forever.

GeeFi's presale has shown remarkable momentum, finishing its first phase in just over a week by selling 10 million tokens and raising $500,000. In total, the project has already raised over $1 million and established a strong community of more than 2,100 investors. GeeFi is a comprehensive non-custodial ecosystem, and experts predict its upcoming Phase 3 will sell out in under 10 days due to widespread talk of listings on major exchanges. Looking Past the Dogecoin Ride While Dogecoin (DOGE) investors are used to its frequent and often unpredictable price swings, many are now looking for a utility-driven asset. That search is leading them directly to GeeFi, a project many analysts believe will be 2026's 100x gem. It provides a single, intuitive platform where users can manage assets across more than 14 networks, swap tokens, and bridge chains without the usual complexity. This all-in-one solution addresses a major need for crypto users who require both security and convenience. The GeeFi Team began development in 2023 and went public in 2024, consistently delivering feature updates to its wallet. This dedication to building a functional product first is what separates it from other projects. The platform gives users full control over their private keys, ensuring their assets are always secure. With the Android app already live and an iOS version in development, GeeFi is demonstrating a commitment to tangible progress, reinforcing its potential to be 2026's 100x gem. The GeeFi Presale Opportunity GeeFi has now advanced to Phase 2 of its presale, with a token price of $0.06. By buying now, investors lock in a guaranteed return of 667% based on the planned $0.40 listing price. The potential for massive returns is substantial; an investment of just $1,800 at the current price could expand to $90,000 if the token reaches the analysts' forecast of a $3 valuation, achieving an incredible 4,900% ROI. Analysts have praised GeeFi's presale for its incredible performance. The momentum from Phase 1 has carried over, with Phase 2 already 70% complete in only 5 days, raising $570K from 9.4M tokens sold. Experts now believe Phase 3 will begin next week and will not last long, as rumors intensify about GeeFi preparing for listings on major exchanges. This is a key reason many see it as 2026's 100x gem. Powerful Staking and Referral Rewards One of the most compelling features driving demand for GeeFi is its robust staking program. Investors can generate significant passive income through multiple flexible options. By locking tokens, users can earn an impressive 15% APR for one month, 22% APR for three months, or a substantial 55% APR for a 12-month term. For those who prefer to keep their assets liquid, GeeFi offers a staking option with no locked funds that still provides returns of up to 10%. To further increase earnings, GeeFi has implemented a generous referral program. By sharing your personal link, you can earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made by your referrals. This system creates a strong incentive for community growth and allows early supporters to multiply their holdings. These features provide real, sustainable yield, attracting investors serious about maximizing their portfolio's performance. Your Final Chance for a Ground-Floor Entry The window of opportunity for life-changing investments in crypto is often small. GeeFi's presale represents one of those rare moments to get in on a project with massive potential before it becomes widely known. The combination of a deflationary token model, a working product, and a clear path to adoption with its upcoming crypto card positions GeeFi to become a significant force in the industry. The rapid pace of the presale signals strong market confidence. As the market prepares for the next major upswing, projects with strong fundamentals and real utility are set to lead the charge. Missing out on GeeFi now could be a major regret when the token launches on major exchanges and its full ecosystem is deployed, validating the belief that it is 2026's 100x gem. The time to act is now. Securing a position during the presale is the best way to capitalize on the explosive growth that experts are forecasting.

This comprehensive crypto platform completed its first phase in under two weeks, raising an impressive $500,000. The momentum has surged into Phase 2, which has already brought in over $570,000. Analysts are watching closely as the current phase is now more than 70% sold out. Projections suggest Phase 3 could start as early as next week, signaling that the window for early-stage investment is closing rapidly. Shifting Focus from Market Leaders to Real Utility Solana is showing resilience, holding a key support level at $135 with a remarkable $3.092B in DEX volume and a potential rally toward $150. While Solana’s performance is notable, many investors are looking for opportunities with higher growth ceilings. GeeFi is emerging as a prime candidate, offering a platform built on tangible, real-world utility. At its core is the GeeFi DEX, a decentralized exchange that provides a secure, non-custodial environment for trading digital assets with complete user control. The ecosystem’s utility extends far beyond just trading. GeeFi is set to launch its own Crypto Cards, integrated with VISA and Mastercard, to bridge the gap between digital finance and everyday global commerce. This real-world application is powered by the GEE token's deflationary design. Through a system of programmed token burns, the protocol is designed to methodically reduce the total supply, increasing scarcity and rewarding long-term holders with sustained value appreciation. A Financial Opportunity with Massive Growth Potential GeeFi's presale is currently in Phase 2, with tokens priced at just $0.06. This presents a compelling financial opportunity, as the token has a confirmed listing price of $0.40, locking in a guaranteed 667% return for presale investors. The long-term outlook is even more impressive. Based on analyst forecasts of the token reaching $2, an initial $1,600 investment could potentially grow to $60,000, delivering a staggering 3,233% ROI. The presale’s velocity supports this bullish sentiment. Over 9.5 million tokens have been sold in Phase 2 alone, raising over $570,000 in a short period. This intense demand has led experts to predict that the current phase will sell out within days. Excitement is further fueled by discussions from the GeeFi team about upcoming listings on several major exchanges, a development that often acts as a powerful catalyst for explosive price growth. Redefining Passive Income with Advanced Staking In addition to its capital growth potential, GeeFi offers a highly competitive staking program designed to generate passive income for its community. Accessible via the GeeFi Wallet, the platform provides flexible options for all investment strategies. Users can earn up to 10% APR on their tokens without any lock-up period. For those seeking higher yields, GeeFi offers 15% APR for a one-month term, 22% APR for three months, and an impressive 55% APR for a twelve-month commitment. The ecosystem also features a referral program, giving users a 5% bonus on all contributions from their referrals. Don't Miss the Next Breakout Success Market analysts are increasingly singling out GeeFi as a potential 100x project, a rare find in today's crowded crypto space. The current presale phase offers a limited-time opportunity to secure a position in a high-utility project before it hits the public market and gains widespread attention. With Phase 2 selling out fast and a price increase scheduled for Phase 3, the window for achieving maximum returns is closing. The fear of missing out is driving investors to act now before this opportunity is gone.

Despite the growing concern among Americans regarding inflation, President Trump continues to claim that prices are falling and the economy is recovering. President Donald Trump’s verbal attacks continue Financial commentator Peter Schiff publicly challenged President Donald Trump on Saturday after the president attacked him on Truth Social for appearing on Fox & Friends Weekend. The president’s attack on Schiff was in response to his discussing the affordability crisis facing Americans during his morning television appearance on December 6, 2025. Trump posted on Truth Social, questioning why Fox & Friends would host Schiff. The president described Schiff as a “Trump hating loser who has already proven to be wrong.” Trump insisted that prices are substantially reducing and blamed former President Joe Biden for creating the affordability crisis. He claimed gasoline hit $1.99 per gallon in certain states and that other prices are almost all down. Hours later, Schiff responded on X, challenging Trump or his designee to a debate on the U.S. economy and the effectiveness of his policies. In a separate post, Schiff suggested Trump should change the name of his social media platform to “Lie Social,” considering his dislike for the truth. During his Fox & Friends appearance, Schiff explained that the inflation rate is going to accelerate as Trump’s term progresses and that the policies continue to impact pricing. He told the show’s host, Griff Jenkins, that Biden had a lot of help in causing the affordability crisis, including from Trump during his first term. Schiff stated that Trump is not fixing the problem but making it worse. The President has continued to dismiss concerns about affordability as a Democrat con job. During a cabinet meeting this week, the president said that the word affordability is a Democrat scam. He argued that Democrats just say the word, but it doesn’t mean anything to anybody. However, Google search data shows that searches for affordability are up 110% compared to a year ago. How did Schiff and Binance’s CZ go? Prior to his exchange with the President, Schiff was in Dubai at Binance Blockchain Week, where he had a debate with Changpeng Zhao , known as CZ, the founder of Binance and Giggle Academy. The debate centered on Bitcoin versus tokenized gold as forms of money. During the Dubai debate , Schiff argued that Bitcoin is backed by nothing and has no inherent value. He stated that Bitcoin is a speculative asset with no utility beyond transferring it to someone else. Schiff also promoted his TGold platform, which allows users to purchase physical gold through a mobile app and store it in secure vaults while transferring or redeeming it digitally. CZ’s defense was Bitcoin’s widespread adoption and its practical advantages. He noted that 300 million people on Binance alone all have some kind of Bitcoin. He pulled a piece of gold from his pocket and explained the difficulty in transporting gold to demonstrate the benefits of Bitcoin’s portability. Schiff insisted that money requires physical backing to be credible and that Bitcoin’s price is driven primarily by speculation. CZ dismissed this notion, comparing Bitcoin’s value to tech platforms like Google or X, stating that many virtual things have value not tied to physical properties. President Trump recently granted a full pardon to CZ, who had faced legal issues related to his role at Binance. Trump said CZ wasn’t guilty and was persecuted by the Biden administration.

GeeFi has demonstrated incredible market strength with its explosive presale, concluding Phase 1 in just over a week. This initial stage saw 10 million tokens completely sell out, raising $500,000 in record time. The momentum has only grown, with total funds now surging past the $1 million milestone, backed by a loyal and expanding community of over 2,100 holders. GeeFi is a complete decentralized ecosystem built on the principle of user ownership, and this vision is attracting serious attention. Analysts are now forecasting that the upcoming Phase 3 will last no more than 10 days, fueled by rumors of advanced talks for major exchange listings. A Tangible Ecosystem in a Speculative Market The market for meme coins remains highly volatile, with Dogecoin (DOGE) trading between $0.14-$0.15 and holding a $23 billion market cap based on hype. For investors seeking real-world utility over speculation, GeeFi offers a powerful alternative. The GeeFi Wallet, a non-custodial mobile application, gives users complete control over their private keys, a level of security that centralized platforms cannot match. The app is already live on Android, with an iOS version in active development to expand its reach. GeeFi’s ecosystem is far more than just a secure wallet. It features a built-in Decentralized Exchange (DEX) with support for over 14 networks, allowing for effortless cross-chain swaps and bridging. The upcoming GeeFi Crypto Card will further connect digital assets to everyday life, enabling users to spend their holdings globally via the VISA and Mastercard networks. The GeeFi Team, which has been developing the project since 2023, has delivered a platform focused on tangible utility and financial freedom. An Unmissable Presale with Guaranteed Returns The GeeFi presale is structured to provide early investors with phenomenal returns. The project is currently in Phase 2, offering tokens at just $0.06 each. This incredibly low entry point has ignited a buying frenzy, as the confirmed listing price of $0.40 guarantees a 667% return for presale participants. An investment of just $1,200 today could transform into $40,000 if the token reaches a conservative $2 valuation, delivering a mind-blowing 3,233% ROI. The urgency is palpable, as Phase 2 is already 70% sold out, with over 9.4 million tokens sold, raising an additional $570,000. Rumors of the team considering listings on top-tier exchanges are only intensifying the demand. Unlock Powerful Passive Income with GeeFi Staking GeeFi offers some of the most attractive and sustainable yields in the crypto space, creating compelling incentives for long-term holding. Investors can earn an impressive 55% APR by locking their GEE tokens for 12 months. For those who need more flexibility, the platform also provides a 22% APR for a three-month lock and 15% APR for one month. In a standout feature, users who prefer to keep their assets liquid can still earn up to 10% APR without any lock-up period. The earning potential is further amplified by GeeFi’s referral program, which offers a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through a user's personal link. This smart growth mechanism rewards community builders and accelerates the expansion of the ecosystem. These high-yield passive income streams, all managed within the secure GeeFi Wallet, make holding GEE a powerful strategy for wealth generation. Your Final Chance to Secure a 100x Opportunity In the crypto world, timing is everything. The explosive growth of GeeFi's presale during a period of market uncertainty is a clear indicator of its massive potential. While others are distracted by the unpredictable nature of meme coins, savvy investors are securing their position in a project with a functioning product, a clear roadmap, and staggering ROI potential. Analysts are calling GeeFi a potential 100x gem, and with Phase 2 selling out fast, the fear of missing out is very real. This is your chance to invest in the next big thing before it goes mainstream. Secure your GEE tokens now before this opportunity disappears.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level. In September, the price saw high volatility reaching as high as $0.0260 but failed to stay at the level and ended the month below the $0.02200 mark. In October, the price declined further and ended the month below the $0.01500 mark as bears dominated the crypto markets during the later half of the month. in November, the downtrend continued with VET ending the month below the $0.130 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|VET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-06 21:00:00

It Was Overlooked in Yesterday’s Headlines,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-this-be-the-reason-behind-bitcoins-recent-drop-it-was-overlooked-in-yesterdays-headlines/,"The National Security Strategy published yesterday by US President Donald Trump increased geopolitical risks and created severe unease in the cryptocurrency markets. Following the document, the Bitcoin price fell to the $89,000 level, and the possibility of a new “crypto winter” was brought to the agenda among market participants. The strategy document released by the White House conveys the message that the US will no longer carry a significant portion of the global defense burden alone. Reminiscent of Trump's speech at the United Nations last year, the text states, “The days of the US carrying the entire world order on its back like an Atlas are over.” The document states that developed countries allied with the US must assume greater responsibility in their own regions. Although the strategy document is not legally binding, analysts note that it increases uncertainty in the market, putting downward pressure on crypto assets. Related News: What Do Current Options in Bitcoin (BTC) Indicate? The crypto market's strong reaction stems from expectations that a potential increase in defense spending could delay interest rate cuts by central banks. The strategy document advocates for NATO countries to increase their defense budgets from 2% to 5% of GDP. The possibility of governments borrowing to fund such an increase could increase inflationary pressures. Rising inflation puts pressure on risky assets because it could lead central banks to delay interest rate cuts. Low interest rates typically drive investors into riskier assets, particularly cryptocurrencies. Therefore, any delays in rate cuts could weaken Bitcoin's bullish potential. Despite this, markets are still anticipating a rate cut at next week's Fed meeting. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch tool puts the probability of a 25 basis point cut at 86%. A Reuters survey of 100 economists similarly suggests a high probability of a rate cut. Forecasts on the Polymarket platform put the probability as high as 94%. *This is not investment advice.

She made the statement on X in response to a user who seemed to imply that Binance’s official X account is being run like a group controlled by a “bunch of KOLs.” A quick run through the page will show nothing but official updates and occurrences, but the statement was enough to put He Yi on the defensive. He Yi’s response He Yi did not like the implications of the statement the user made on X. According to her, the official Binance X account is run by competent staff who have the freedom to choose the style of posts. However, that freedom is restricted to their work and the level of creativity they are allowed to apply while doing it. He Yi drew the line at the participation of said employees in the launching or promotion of any tokens. She acknowledged the fact that the BNB memecoin space getting active again has encouraged the community to start tokenizing words excerpted from posts made by the official Binance X account, or by her. But none of that has anything to do with Binance itself. She also insisted that the increased frequency does not mean they will stop posting. She clarified that her statement regarding “encouraging employees to innovate and try” has to do with only their daily work and not “coin issuance projects.” Her post comes at a time when tokenization has taken center stage in crypto discussions, and memecoins have become a fixture in the patchwork. Binance brass preach accountability It is not the first time He Yi has spoken up about the current token trend. In the past, she has urged users to take responsibility for their actions and start actively trying to protect themselves from pump and dump schemes by doing better research and being more vigilant. Chanpeng Zhao has also sounded similar warnings several times in the past. As recently as last month, he took action against people he claimed were selling X accounts he was following by unfollowing many of them. Those accounts have reportedly been used for a laundry list of bad acts. Zhao urged users on X to avoid buying those handles, promising to “unfollow any sold accounts,” and asking his followers to report any account they see on sale. “Let me know,” he wrote . “DM, tweet, notify interns,” adding that he follows accounts randomly because they are “supportive, informative, positive energy people in the community.” Regardless of their warnings, the crypto trenches tend to defy logic and warnings. It only took one photo of CZ’s dog before countless meme tokens named for the Broccoli went viral. CZ’s tweet about the upcoming release of the BNB Chain’s Four.meme token launch at the time also set off a frenzy for meme coins, so-named too. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This follows a Wednesday appeal in which a court overturned a previous dismissal. Florida Ruling Revives Binance Lawsuit A Bloomberg report reveals that a judge has determined that the crypto exchange can be sued locally for allegedly failing to prevent the stolen funds from being transferred. The plaintiff, Jonny Chen, says he fell victim to a 2022 scam that drained 1,000 Bitcoin from his account. He further claims that he immediately notified Binance at the time and requested that the platform freeze the assets, but alleges the company did not act quickly enough, allowing the money to disappear. The victim had initially filed a negligence lawsuit in Florida, but the trial court dismissed the case on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction because Binance is headquartered overseas. However, the recent appeal has now reopened the door for it to proceed. The decision said that Binance’s digital presence and business activity in Florida, including marketing to local users and offering services through its platform, were sufficient to establish legal jurisdiction. The court wrote that Chen “will have a fresh opportunity to show he can sue Binance Holdings Inc. in state court over an alleged theft of eighty million dollars’ worth of Bitcoin.” It also said the lower tribunal had made an error when it decided it could not hear the case. Jurisdiction Disputes This is not the first time a crypto company has delayed or contested legal action by raising jurisdictional challenges. Several large platforms have postponed or escaped litigation by arguing that regulators lacked authority over them due to their overseas registration. For instance, in the case of BitMEX, American investors had accused the firm of market manipulation and operating without proper licensing. However, the company countered that it was beyond U.S. reach because it was incorporated in the Seychelles and had no physical footprint in the country, which led to delays and partial dismissals in the proceedings. KuCoin, another foreign-based operator, faced action in New York for allegedly offering unregistered securities. The company had initially disputed the case by insisting it had no major ties to the United States. Despite this, New York’s Attorney General later relied on the Martin Act to move forward despite the firm’s objections. Bitfinex and its affiliate Tether have also dealt with multiple claims involving alleged market manipulation and transparency shortcomings, with the two initially challenging U.S. authority, citing foreign incorporation. Despite this, some litigation eventually moved forward and resulted in settlements.

Although the recovery of ETH is promising, focus is being placed more on new projects that can provide early-stage opportunity and actual utility. A new crypto with a great potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on the verge of completing an important milestone with Phase 6 about to be fully allocated, having attracted more than 18,350 investors and having raised almost $19.15 million. Mutuum Finance is a well-priced, decentralized lending and borrowing, interest-bearing and yield-driven token, with a well-developed roadmap, culminating with the V1 Sepolia testnet release, making it the best crypto to invest in to be exposed to high potential, utility-driven token early in 2025. Investors searching for the next big crypto and the top crypto to buy are increasingly turning toward MUTM due to its strong fundamentals. Ethereum Recovers $3000 in a Bullish Frenzy Ethereum (ETH) has moved back up to the $3,000 level and it is backed by a big bull divergence that most analysts see this as the indicator of all-time highs. It is predicted that there may be a potential increase to $4,958.75 and some analysts believe that the potential of ETH increase to $5,000 may be achievable as long as the momentum and the market environment continue to be conducive. This newfound confidence in ETH has redirected investor interest to projects with high early potential, and innovative tokens, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), have found themselves attracting more and more investor attention. This rising attention reinforces MUTM’s position as the next big crypto and a top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance Presale The presale of Mutuum Finance is constantly picking up pace with Phase 6 filling up. Starting at $0.01 when the sale was initiated in 2025, MUTM has since taken a steady increase to $0.035 in its present phase, which is an increase of 250% reported even prior to exchange listing. All previous rounds were sold out quickly, which highlights the long-term attention to the utility of the project with its DeFi focus. Phase 6 is nearly emptied, so investors are moving as fast as possible to get tokens before the next price increase puts MUTM even nearer to its established launch price of $0.06. So far, the presale has raised over $19.15 million in contributions and has made MUTM one of the best early-stage crypto projects of the year. In addition to its powerful fundraising trend, Mutuum Finance stands out among most altcoins due to its execution of useful features in a fully developed DeFi system, a feature that is an attractive entry point to early adopters who may be interested in long-term usability. With this level of traction, traders label MUTM as the next big crypto and among the absolute top crypto to buy before its price increases. Growth indicates the extent to which MUTM tokens have been adopted by first time entrants. The project has been attracting interest in the world of crypto due to the growth and advancement of the platform and presale. A total amount of 1.82 billion tokens has been assigned to the presale. Over 800 million tokens are already sold. Since the current stage is nearing its limit and the price is drawing nearer to the $0.06 listing value, the urgency has been increasing. This is coupled with the lending and borrowing led, yield oriented DeFi structure of the platform, which contributes to making MUTM a prospective early stage asset to accumulate. Such adoption further strengthens its reputation as the next big crypto for long-term growth and a top crypto to buy during its presale window. Roadmap Development Mutuum Finance is in Phase 2 of its roadmap, which is core protocol development. This stage comprises smart-contract engineering, integration of the backend system, revised risk-management systems, liquidation operations, and sophisticated analytics. Frequent development team updates are indicators of a serious dedication to the provision of secure, efficient, and scalable DeFi environment. With these elements approaching their completion, the expectation grows more and more regarding the upcoming Version 1 release of the protocol, a move that would go a long way in increasing platform adoption and solidifying MUTM as a newcomer in the decentralized finance industry. Mutuum Finance has received almost 18,350 investors who have invested almost $19.15 million, with Phase 6 almost sold out at $0.035. Its price is up by 250% since, with this being the last opportunity to purchase the token before Phase 7 raises its price to $0.04. As V1 Sepolia testnet is just a few days away, MUTM will be providing a fully operational DeFi platform where lending and borrowing are possible with interest rates on yields. Before this discounted phase dies off, early investors will be able to get tokens at the official presale. This opportunity positions MUTM as the next big crypto and the top crypto to buy.

55439732,641281,1765058420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55439732.jpeg,"Bitcoin Boost: Fidelity CEO Confirms Personal Holdings, Hails BTC As ‘Gold Standard’",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-boost-fidelity-ceo-confirms-personal-holdings-hails-btc-as-gold-standard/,"According to remarks made at the Founders Summit , Fidelity’s chief executive Abigail Johnson offered a rare look at how the firm moved from curiosity to a full crypto business and why she keeps a personal stake in Bitcoin. The account ties early, small bets to later services now offered to advisors and clients. Early Interest Turned Practical Around 2013, a small group inside Fidelity began meeting to learn what Bitcoin might mean for the firm. They mapped out 52 possible uses. Most ideas did not survive testing. One early result — accepting Bitcoin donations for charity — gave the team credibility outside the company and opened doors for deeper work. That early credibility made it easier for the firm to test bigger ideas without waiting for orders from the top. A Bold Mining Bet Paid Off Johnson pushed for a $200,000 purchase of Antminer hardware at a time many inside opposed the move. Reports say that mining effort became “probably the single highest IRR business” Fidelity has had. The decision put staff into Bitcoin’s technical layers, giving them real experience with wallets, security, and the plumbing of the network long before many rivals caught up. Company Moves Into Custody Based on reports, demand from financial advisors drove Fidelity toward custody services. Advisors wanted secure ways to help clients hold and pass on Bitcoin, and Fidelity responded by building custody, custody-adjacent products, and support across asset management and research. Johnson told the audience she owns Bitcoin personally and described it as a core digital asset that could play a role in people’s savings plans. She calls it crypto’s “gold standard.” Exchange Supply Drops As Accumulation Continues Market data referenced in the session showed Bitcoin trading above $89,000 while balances on centralized exchanges fell to roughly 1.8 million BTC — a level not seen since 2017, according to aggregated CryptoQuant and Glassnode figures cited by BRN Research. Realized-cap growth stayed positive on a monthly basis, which analysts interpret as fresh capital entering the market even when price moves stay contained. Shark Wallets And Network Growth For Ethereum Reports also pointed to Ethereum strength. ETH climbed past $3,200 as so-called shark wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH resumed accumulation. Daily new addresses briefly neared 190,000 following the Fusaka upgrade, a spike that analysts say often lines up with stronger demand for ETH. Market Signals And What’s Missing Analysts quoted in the briefing noted that supply leaving exchanges and steady accumulation point to longer-term holders taking control. What the market lacks, they said, is a decisive push into the roughly $96K to $106K band that would signal a broader breakout. For now, accumulation continues while prices trade in a tighter range. Based on reports from the conference, Fidelity’s crypto path reads like a slow build: small internal experiments grew into real operations, and a handful of early bets — including a $200,000 mining play — gave the firm practical know-how. Combined with current on-chain signs of accumulation, the picture suggests established players and patient holders are shaping market supply even as price momentum waits for a clearer trigger.

With key support levels holding and bullish patterns forming, the market may be setting up for a notable upside. Golden Pocket Rejection: Confirming The High-Risk Scenario In a recent update on X, analyst Luca referenced his recent market commentary, noting that Ethereum price action unfolded exactly as he had anticipated, with the price tapping into the lost high-timeframe support range. This range aligned with the golden pocket between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels, and the price rejected there, confirming the high-risk scenario he had highlighted in advance. Related Reading: Ethereum Coils For A Breakout As IH&S + Heavy Accumulation Emerges Since that rejection, the price has broken below the key 0.618 Fibonacci Point of Interest (POI). However, the asset is still managing to hold above the crucial 1-Day Bull Market Support Band. Luca stressed that this band has historically served as a strong reversal spot over the last couple of months. Thus, he believes the current low-timeframe market structure is not yet fully invalidated. Despite this technical hold, the analyst reiterated his cautious approach, stating that until he sees clear signs of strength on the low-timeframes, signs that can durably confirm the bottom is in and that key support levels are properly reclaimed, he won’t scale out of his edges. Luca concluded that until that concrete bullish confirmation materializes, the most likely outcome for the immediate future remains further consolidation. The market needs time to absorb the recent volatility and build a new base before a more durable reversal to the upside can take hold. ETH/BTC Trendline Breakout: Market Risk Appetite Returns Crypto analyst Paramatik outlined that a major structural event has occurred on the ETH/BTC charts: a falling trend breakout. This is a highly significant development, although Paramatik suggests that a retest of this broken trendline may occur before the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Sitting On Its Most Critical On-Chain Support Level — A Rally Emerging? The analyst provided clarity on what this breakout means for the broader market. First and foremost, this situation is interpreted as a strengthening signal for Ethereum. When ETH begins to gain value relative to Bitcoin, it typically indicates that the market’s overall risk appetite is returning, as investors shift capital from BTC to ETH. Secondly, the gained strength in Ethereum is often the key trigger for the start of the much-anticipated altcoin season. This is because investors first shift funds from BTC to ETH, and then move capital into the riskier, smaller altcoins in hopes of achieving higher returns. Paramatik summarized his findings by stating that this breakout in the ETH/BTC pair is not merely a technical line break; it is a harbinger of a market direction change. The analyst concluded with an analogy that the market has reached a state where every external event, even humorously irrelevant ones, could affect crypto prices.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $573.15, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,327.46 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we’ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question “How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?” and we’ll try to answer that.

Overall the altcoin has gained 0.58% of its value across the last 24-hours as SOL stabilizes at the price level. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL holds above $130 The one-day price chart of the Solana shows that the decline is continuing with the drop below the $125 mark before the bulls found support enabling recovery. However, after failing to climb past $140 the price is now headed back towards $130. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is narrow, leading to low volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $145.58 The indicator’s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $125.68. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the neutral area but is quite close to the oversold region. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 42.03, and its downwards curve signifies a dominance of sellers. If selling activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows strong bearish activity at the current price level as bears erase last few days progress. The altcoin’s price has decreased to $133 as bears continue to dominate the price action. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a higher volatility level. This level of volatility signifies increased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $146.80, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $133.08, indicating support. The RSI indicator is in the oversold region. Currently at 40.32 the RSI curve is pointing down, confirming an increase in selling activities. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph indicates support from the buying side of the market at the current price level. We can expect further decline if selling activities persist for a few more hours.

If selling pressure continues, we might see the price fall to $130. On the other hand, if buyers return to control the price chart, we might see a price increase to retest the resistance level at $140. Is SOL a good investment?

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170. In November, the decline continued with SOL ending the month below the $130 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-06 22:15:00

The ETF, which is the first pure spot-based product focused on XRP, recorded strong activity on its opening day, hitting $58 million . Even with this positive event, the overall market environment has remained weak, placing downward pressure on XRP. Current Market Performance A market-wide pullback has affected most major assets. Bitcoin dropped below the important $100,000 level, and this shift put pressure on XRP as well. Since the decline started in early November, XRP’s market value has fallen by $14.63 billion, bringing its total valuation to $137.12 billion. This represents a large drop from its highest market cap of $216.69 billion, set on July 18 when XRP’s price reached $3.66. Compared to that peak, XRP is now short by almost $80 billion. If the market recovers, XRP could regain the value it has lost. However, with ETF inflows rising rapidly , some projections go further. These explore what could happen if XRP gains up to $1 trillion or more, going far beyond its previous highs. Can XRP Add $1 Trillion to its Market Cap? Much of the current speculation centers on what would happen if XRP’s market cap expanded by an additional $1 trillion . This level of growth is rare in the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin remains the only digital asset to have crossed that threshold. It reached a trillion-dollar valuation in early 2021, increased further during the peak of that cycle, then dropped sharply during the 2022 bear market. It has since recovered and now holds a valuation of about $1.92 trillion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If XRP adds $1 trillion to its present market cap, the new total would stand at $1.137 trillion. Based on the current supply of about 60 billion tokens, this would place XRP close to $18.95. This price would exceed its previous highs and move it into the double-digit range that analysts have discussed for years. Expectations for Future Levels Several analysts have mentioned the possibility of XRP climbing above $18. One analyst, Dr. Cat, has suggested that this range becomes possible if the XRP-to-Bitcoin ratio rises to a specific zone and Bitcoin reaches a much higher price. A separate view from Changelly projects that XRP could reach $19.62. However, Changelly’s timeline places this several years from now, with 2030 as the target period. If XRP ever reached a valuation of $1.137 trillion, it would rank among the most valuable companies in the world, higher than Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan, Walmart, and Visa. While this scenario is hypothetical, it reflects ongoing discussions about XRP’s long-term potential . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $88,951.1. This sudden movement has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting urgent questions about market stability and future direction. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters for your portfolio. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Fall Below $89,000? Market corrections are a normal part of any asset’s lifecycle, and Bitcoin is no exception. The drop below $89,000 is likely a confluence of several factors. First, profit-taking by short-term traders after a recent rally can create immediate selling pressure. Second, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as interest rate fears or geopolitical tensions, often trigger risk-off sentiment, impacting high-volatility assets like crypto. Finally, large sell orders on major exchanges can trigger automated stop-losses, accelerating a downward move. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for navigating volatility. What Does This Price Action Mean for Traders? For active traders, this dip presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Key support and resistance levels are now being tested. The immediate focus will be on whether the Bitcoin price can hold above $88,000 or if further downside is imminent. Here are actionable insights for different trading styles: For Swing Traders: Monitor the $88,000 level closely. A strong bounce could signal a buying opportunity, while a break below may indicate a trend reversal. For Long-Term Holders (HODLers): Short-term fluctuations are often noise. This dip could be a chance to dollar-cost average if you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term thesis. For New Investors: Volatility is standard. Never invest more than you can afford to lose and consider this a live lesson in market cycles. How Should Investors React to Bitcoin’s Volatility? Emotional decisions are the enemy of sound investment. When the Bitcoin price moves sharply, it’s vital to stick to your pre-defined strategy. Did you have a plan for a 5% or 10% drop? If not, now is the time to create one. Diversification remains a cornerstone of risk management. Furthermore, consider the source of your information. Rely on data from reputable exchanges and trusted analysts rather than social media hype. This disciplined approach separates successful investors from reactive speculators. What’s the Future Outlook for the Bitcoin Price? Predicting the exact future Bitcoin price is impossible, but we can assess the landscape. On-chain data, such as exchange flows and whale wallet activity, provides clues about investor sentiment. Additionally, institutional adoption trends and regulatory developments will play a significant long-term role. While today’s drop is notable, it’s a single data point in Bitcoin’s broader journey. The fundamental narrative around digital scarcity and decentralized finance remains unchanged for many proponents. In conclusion, the break below $89,000 is a significant market event that demands attention but not panic. It underscores the inherently volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets. By focusing on data, maintaining a clear strategy, and understanding the underlying causes, investors can navigate these waves with greater confidence. The key takeaway is to use such movements as learning experiences to refine your approach to the dynamic world of crypto investing. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the Bitcoin price drop a sign of a bear market? A: Not necessarily. A single drop below a support level is a correction, not a confirmed bear market. A bear market is typically defined by a sustained downtrend over a longer period. Q2: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A: This depends entirely on your investment goals and risk tolerance. Selling based on fear often leads to buying back at higher prices. Consult your investment plan before making emotional decisions. Q3: What is a good entry point after this dip? A: There is no perfect entry. Strategies like dollar-cost averaging (investing a fixed amount regularly) can help mitigate timing risk instead of trying to “catch the bottom.” Q4: Could the Bitcoin price go lower than $88,000? A: Yes, it is possible. Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. The next major support levels are often watched, but nothing is guaranteed in these markets. Q5: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies (altcoins)? A> Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. A significant drop in BTC’s price usually leads to larger percentage drops in most altcoins, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” Q6: Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price data? A> Use established tracking websites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, and verify prices directly on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase for the most accurate real-time data.

55442403,https://timestabloid.com/?p=91621,1765065645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Crypto Analyst: XRP Flash Crash Imminent. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-analyst-xrp-flash-crash-imminent-heres-why/,"Market commentator ExtraVod has issued a new warning about XRP, stating that a flash crash is imminent. According to him, current conditions suggest the asset may face a sharp downward move before any meaningful recovery. His remarks follow several days of price weakness, as XRP has gradually retreated from the rebound that pushed it to $2.21 on December 4. Since then, the asset has slipped to about $2.03, a decline that may only represent the early stage of a broader correction. Market Liquidations and Volatility In his video , ExtraVod highlighted rising liquidations across the crypto market. Citing The Kobeissi Letter, he noted that $200 million in positions were wiped out within four hours on December 5 after Bitcoin briefly fell below $90,000. XRP FLASH CRASH IMMINENT — ExtraVOD (@ExtraVOD_) December 5, 2025 Although BTC later steadied near $89,500, Coinglass data showed liquidations climbing to $412.6 million over 24 hours, mostly from long positions. ExtraVod said this sharp increase reflects a stressed market and creates conditions where a sudden, disruptive move becomes more likely as liquidity clusters and traders remain overexposed. Is a Flash Crash Coming? A central part of ExtraVod’s argument comes from the recent behavior of XRP’s price structure. He highlighted that since April 2025, the asset has formed a sequence of higher lows during each corrective phase. XRP bottomed near $1.61 in early April, around $1.77 in October , then near $1.81 in late November, and finally at approximately $1.98 at the start of December. While this pattern may appear constructive, ExtraVod believes these levels have become too narrow and have attracted an excessive number of stop-loss orders. He contends that this cluster of liquidity below each successive bottom creates an incentive for market makers to drive the price downward in order to clear these positions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He warned that such a move could happen quickly and forcefully, which is why he characterizes it as a potential flash crash. Even so, he does not view the scenario as entirely negative. He maintains that once this liquidity is removed, XRP could break free and establish a more stable foundation for upward momentum . Additional Bullish Signals ExtraVod also highlighted XRP’s weekly RSI, noting what he considers a hidden bullish divergence . He explained that XRP formed a higher low on price after its November 2024 bottom near $0.5, while the RSI set a lower low, falling from about 44 and potentially dropping below 30 if a flash crash occurs. He believes this pattern suggests the broader uptrend remains intact. If a flash crash pushes the RSI into oversold territory, XRP could rebound from that level and eventually move toward new highs once volatility settles.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.25 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility. 2025 has been a defining stress test: Pi surged to about $2.98 in February, crashed to a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, and now trades near $0.22 in early December, highlighting extreme volatility as the year closes. But basic building blocks continue to keep investor interest alive, including the Passkey security improvement to Pi Wallet, Pi DEX, and AMM on Testnet, Pi Network Ventures pushing towards decentralization and AI with OpenMind, and millions of new KYC verifications and continuing projects such as the 2025 Pi Hackathon and Sign Protocol partnership. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2025–2031 favors a sustained recovery or further downside. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.2269 Price Change 24h 1.8% Market Cap $1.89B Circulating Supply 8.34B PI Trading Volume 24h $14.07M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.2269 Price Prediction $ 0.1692(-25.01%) Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 5.14% (High) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2348 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 48.50 (Neutral) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Pi trades around $0.2269, up about 1.8% in the past 24 hours after bouncing off intraday lows near $0.221. Daily RSI is near 45, still below the neutral 50 line, while MACD is around zero with a slightly negative histogram, suggesting weak upside momentum in a wider downtrend. Key resistance remains at $0.240 and $0.250, with support clustered at $0.220, then deeper around $0.205–$0.200. As of December 6, 2025, Pi Network is posting a modest recovery after earlier December weakness. PI network is currently changing hands near $0.2267, with a market cap at roughly $1.89 billion and 24-hour volume down to about $14 million, signaling that the latest bounce is happening on lighter trading activity. Price is holding above the $0.22 floor but has not yet shown the strength needed to challenge the major resistance band just below $0.25. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows a small green candle following several sessions of sideways-to-lower action since the late-November peak near $0.28 and $0.29. Today’s candle trades between $0.2237 and $0.2325, with a close around $0.2269, which reflects stabilization rather than a decisive reversal. Pi remains well below its November top and still trades under the key $0.24 and $0.25 resistance zone, meaning the larger 2025 downtrend is intact. The RSI (14) stands near 45.17, with its signal baseline around 52.32. This places momentum slightly below neutral but off the more depressed levels seen earlier in the week, showing that selling pressure has eased even though buyers have not fully taken back control. A sustained push above the 50 midpoint would be an early sign that bulls are regaining momentum. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26), the histogram is about -0.0025, while the MACD and signal lines sit close to -0.0010 and 0.0015. All three readings are very close to the zero line, but the negative histogram tells us the MACD line is just under the signal line again. This configuration signals fading upside momentum: the prior bullish impulse has largely run out of steam, yet the market has not rolled into a sharp new down-leg. Immediate resistance is still concentrated around $0.240, where several November rallies stalled, followed by a heavier ceiling in the $0.260and $0.280 area. First support remains at $0.220, with stronger backing at $0.205 and $0.200. A 24-hour close below $0.220 would revive the risk of retesting the October capitulation lows, while a decisive break and hold above $0.240–$0.250 would suggest that December’s volatility is beginning to resolve into a more constructive base. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi is trading around $0.2266, almost flat on the session after failing to build on its earlier intraday bounce. Price continues to move in a tight band between roughly $0.22 and $0.24, with the structure since late November still showing lower highs from the peak near $0.28, which keeps the short-term bias mildly bearish to sideways. The RSI (14) is at about 42.47, with its signal line near 40.02, meaning momentum is still below the neutral 50 mark but no longer oversold. This points to weak but improving buying interest: bulls are defending the $0.22 area, yet they have not mustered enough strength to flip the trend. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the three readings sit close to zero around 0.0002, –0.0025, –0.0028, indicating that both MACD lines and the histogram are clustered around the baseline. This shows a very flat momentum profile, with neither side in clear control and no strong follow-through after the recent bounce. For a convincing bullish reversal on this 4-hour timeframe, Pi would need to break above the $0.235–$0.240 zone with a clear MACD turn higher; otherwise, the market remains vulnerable to another dip back toward $0.22 if sellers reassert themselves. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2984 SELL SMA 5 $0.2746 SELL SMA 10 $0.2590 SELL SMA 21 $0.2456 SELL SMA 50 $0.2348 SELL SMA 100 $0.2800 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2383 SELL EMA 5 $0.2426 SELL EMA 10 $0.2650 SELL EMA 21 $0.3013 SELL EMA 50 $0.3603 SELL EMA 100 $0.4533 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to stay range-bound between $0.22 and $0.24 in the short term, with weak but stabilizing momentum as buyers and sellers balance out. A daily close above $0.24 and $0.25 with RSI pushing back over 50 and a clean bullish MACD crossover could open room toward $0.26 and $0.28. If $0.22 breaks on strong volume instead, focus will quickly shift to the deeper $0.205 and $0.200 support zone and a possible retest of October’s lows. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price up today? Pi is up today mainly because Pi Network rolled out AI-powered KYC tools that speed up verification for millions of users, boosting confidence ahead of December’s 190M PI token unlock. Technically, the price also bounced from key Fibonacci and support levels near $0.223–$0.225 after RSI left oversold territory, attracting short-term dip buyers. However, gains are capped by ongoing regulatory worries, especially China’s “air coin” warning and thin liquidity that could be pressured once the $43M unlock hits the market. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network is traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-07 00:15:00

While the premier cryptocurrency has been on something resembling a recovery path since the market bloodbath, some sectors believe that the bear season has already kicked off. With BTC sitting beneath its opening price of 2025, it is becoming increasingly difficult to make a bullish case for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Moreover, an interesting data point about a relevant class of Bitcoin investors has emerged, further adding credence to the beginning of a possible bear market. Are Bitcoin Treasury Firms Offloading Their Coins? In a new post on X, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, shared an on-chain insight to support the hypothesis that the Bitcoin bear market has started. This conclusion is based on the Balance Growth of an investor group known as the “dolphins.” Dolphins refer to a group of crypto investors holding substantial amounts of a coin, placing them between small investors (shrimps) and the largest investors (whales). Specifically, Moreno described dolphins as wallet addresses with significant BTC holdings between 100 – 1,000 coins. According to the latest data from CryptoQuant, the growth in the Dolphins’ BTC holdings has slowed down in the past year and appears to be in a downward trend. Moreno believes that this negative change points to the emergence of a Bitcoin bear market . Moreno revealed that these Dolphin addresses had increased year-over-year by roughly 965,000 BTC when the BTC price hit its current all-time high around $125,000. Now that the BTC price is nearly 30% below its record high, the Bitcoin Dolphins’ balance stands at around 694,000 coins. Moreno wrote on X: This address cohort includes ETFs and Treasury companies, which have also stopped buying. More interestingly, the CryptoQuant Head of Research revealed that this investor group consists of ETF issuers and Treasury companies, which have stopped purchasing Bitcoin. According to data from SoSoValue, the US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have posted net outflows in five out of the last six weeks. Meanwhile, BTC and crypto treasury companies have struggled in the past few months, with retail investors losing tens of billions to the hype. While there have been rarely reports of crypto treasury sell-offs, this decline in these Dolphins’ holdings tells an entirely different story. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,151, reflecting an over 3% decline in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin dolphins|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-07 00:30:36

Pat Gelsinger, the former Intel CEO who spent 35 years at the chip giant, is now leading a startup called xLight that just secured a preliminary deal for up to $150 million from the US Commerce Department. This isn’t just another funding round—it’s a bold attempt to solve the semiconductor industry’s most critical bottleneck and potentially resurrect Moore’s Law from its perceived slowdown. Why Pat Gelsinger Bet His Reputation on xLight A year after his departure from Intel, Pat Gelsinger hasn’t slowed down. Now a general partner at Playground Global, he’s working with 10 startups, but xLight has captured his primary attention. “I have this long-term mission to continue to see Moore’s law in the semiconductor industry,” Gelsinger said at a recent StrictlyVC event. “We think this is the technology that will wake up Moore’s law.” What makes xLight so special? The startup is developing massive “free electron lasers” powered by particle accelerators that could revolutionize semiconductor lithography —the process of etching microscopic patterns onto silicon wafers. Gelsinger explains the significance: “About half of the capital goes into lithography. In the middle of a lithography machine is light… this ability to keep innovating for shorter wavelength, higher power light is the essence of being able to continue to innovate for more advanced semiconductors.” The Government’s Unprecedented Role in Semiconductor Innovation The xLight deal represents a significant shift in how the US approaches technological competitiveness. The Commerce Department is set to become xLight’s largest shareholder through funding from the Chips and Science Act. This arrangement has raised eyebrows in Silicon Valley, where free-market principles have long been sacred. California Governor Gavin Newsom captured the industry’s unease: “What the hell happened to free enterprise?” But Gelsinger remains unapologetic about the government partnership. “I measure it by the results,” he said. “Does it drive the results that we want and that we need to reinvigorate our industrial policies? Many of our competitive countries don’t have such debates. They’re moving forward with the policies that are necessary to accomplish their competitive outcomes.” Key Aspect Traditional Approach xLight’s Innovation Light Source Integrated into each machine External utility-scale system Scale Machine-sized components Football field-sized facilities Wavelength 13.5 nanometers (current EUV) Targeting 2 nanometers Power Source Conventional lasers Free electron lasers with particle accelerators How xLight’s Technology Challenges ASML’s Dominance The ASML competition represents one of xLight’s biggest challenges. ASML, the Dutch company, currently dominates the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) market with near-total control. xLight’s approach fundamentally differs from ASML’s integrated systems. Nicholas Kelez, xLight’s founder and CEO, explains their revolutionary concept: “We go away from building an integrated light source with the tool, which is what ASML does now and that fundamentally constrains you to make it smaller and less powerful. We treat light the same way you treat electrical power or HVAC. We build outside the fab at utility scale and then distribute in.” The company plans to build machines roughly 100 meters by 50 meters—about the size of a football field—that will sit outside semiconductor fabrication plants. These free electron lasers would generate extreme ultraviolet light at wavelengths as precise as 2 nanometers, far more powerful than the 13.5 nanometer wavelengths currently used by ASML. The Road Ahead: Can This xLight Startup Deliver? xLight faces significant hurdles on its path to commercialization. The company aims to produce its first silicon wafers by 2028 and have its first commercial system online by 2029. However, several critical questions remain unanswered: Customer commitments: No major chipmakers have committed to purchasing xLight’s technology yet ASML integration: While discussions are ongoing, ASML hasn’t formally committed to buying the technology Competition: Other startups like Substrate (backed by Peter Thiel) are pursuing similar approaches Technical challenges: Building football field-sized laser facilities presents unprecedented engineering challenges Gelsinger acknowledges the uncertainty: “We’ve agreed in principle on the terms, but like any of these contracts, there’s still work to get done.” When asked whether the $150 million funding could end up being double the announced amount—or potentially not materialize at all—he remained candid about the ongoing negotiations. FAQs: Understanding the xLight Revolution Who is Pat Gelsinger and why is he involved with xLight? Pat Gelsinger spent 35 years across two stints at Intel, eventually serving as CEO before his departure in late 2023. He’s now a general partner at Playground Global and serves as xLight’s executive chairman, bringing his semiconductor expertise to the startup. What makes xLight’s technology different from ASML’s? While ASML builds integrated lithography machines with built-in light sources, xLight treats light as a utility. They plan to build massive free electron laser facilities outside fabs and distribute the light to multiple machines, potentially achieving shorter wavelengths and higher power. How does this relate to Moore’s Law? Moore’s Law predicts that computing power should double every two years. As chip features shrink, better lithography technology becomes essential. xLight’s potentially more powerful light sources could enable continued miniaturization, thus sustaining Moore’s Law. What role does the US government play? The Commerce Department is providing up to $150 million through the Chips and Science Act, becoming xLight’s largest shareholder. This represents a shift toward more direct government involvement in strategic technologies. Who is Nicholas Kelez? Nicholas Kelez founded xLight after leading quantum computer development at PsiQuantum and spending two decades building large-scale X-ray science facilities at national labs including SLAC and Lawrence Berkeley. The Bottom Line: A Calculated Gamble with National Implications Pat Gelsinger’s bet on xLight represents more than just another venture investment—it’s a strategic move with implications for national competitiveness, technological sovereignty, and the future of computing. The partnership between a Silicon Valley veteran and the US government signals a new era in industrial policy, where the lines between public and private sector innovation are blurring. For Gelsinger, this is personal. “My mind is so stretched here, and I’m just grateful that the Playground team would have me to join them and let me make them smarter and be a rookie venture capitalist,” he said. Then he added with a grin: “And I gave my wife back her weekends.” Whether xLight succeeds or fails, its story illuminates the changing dynamics of technological innovation in an era of geopolitical competition. The semiconductor wars have entered a new phase, and the battlefield now includes government boardrooms as well as research laboratories.

Some of the names that are making the most noise in the new cycle are Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and the new up-and-coming player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , three very different players but sharing the same commonality, the potential for high returns. ADA remains one of the assets that many people are banking on for the long term, as the growth of the ecosystem sends the message for potential re-pricing, and DOGE, as it always does, remains one of the most volatile assets that can easily spark off explosions and rallies based on the evergreen factor of the community. But the new kid on the block, MUTM, has already put itself into the frame as the best crypto to buy, based on the break-out presale and the quick-growing demand that’s available for the crypto, which is priced at $0.035. Investors are increasingly seeing MUTM as the next big crypto to watch. Cardano Rebounds Sharply as Buyers Support Crucial Demand Area Cardano (ADA) had finally exhibited some kind of reaction as it fell as low as $0.37, but ever since, the traders had initiated strong buy signals that raised the prices from $0.37 to $0.45, showing an improvement of over 20%, which again perceives the region of $0.32-$0.36 as an important area where the demand for ADA resides. On the basis of the performance above $0.42, the short-term trend for ADA looks more favorable, opening gates for potential targets such as $0.48, $0.52, and $0.57. As ADA tries to sustain this upsurge, the focus of investors is shifting towards the new DeFi platforms developing rapid network effects, which gives increasing attention to the potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the next big crypto in 2026. Dogecoin Attempts Rebound as Buyers Defend Key Support Levels Dogecoin (DOGE) had been falling for the last few weeks, but it appears that the price movements are now coming alive as it rebounds from the major support area, which had previously acted as the same area that initiated many rallies. Market players are slowly making their entrance again, and if the trend continues, it looks like it could make an attempt to re-enter the upper levels, thus igniting the bull run again. As different coins start showing some activity despite the turbulent marketplace, the focus of the investors is drifting towards the new possibilities that are coming alive, thus naturally leading to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), considered the best crypto to buy for its early-stage potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Nearly Finished in Phase 6 Mutuum Finance enters the last leg of the Phase 6 presale as the interest and demand for the project show no signs of slowing. Created to promote multi-level pricing, the ongoing presale offers the best crypto to buy entry levels for the earliest investors. Started off initially at $0.01 during the Phase 1, MUTM is now up to $0.035 during Phase 6, which marks a 250% increase. The total amount raised during the presale thus far is well over $19.18 million, and it has accumulated support from above 18,350 holders. Since Phase 6 is already over 95% subscribed, the supply available for the same price would not be much. Once Phase 7 starts, the cost for the token will increase by 20%, and it will be $0.04, which makes Phase 6 one of the last chances for such cheap investment for MUTM. This presale phase clearly indicates the potential for the next big crypto. Investors that participated during the early levels of the presale are guaranteed some of the cheapest entry costs, and the potential for returns could reach 500% during launch. Apart from the benefit of cost, Mutuum Finance stands out as it offers a two-level lending model, an extended lending model based on the stablecoin, completely auditable smart contracts, and tokenomics that promote growth. These elements make MUTM the best crypto to buy for investors interested in utility and growth potential. Effective Risk Management Serves as the Foundation for Safety Mutuum Finance implements the dynamic risk management system as an integral component of the Mutuum protocol. Loan-to-Value ratios and Liquidation thresholds are determined based on the volatility of the respective collateral, which means that stronger, less volatile collateral gets to support higher LTV ratios, while tougher ratios are required for less reliable collateral. Other reserve multipliers factor into the equation, ranging between 10%, which applies to less risky groups, and 35% for the higher-risk pools. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has seen $19.18M raised from 18,350+ investors, and Phase 6 is over 95% sold for $0.035. The V1 Sepolia testnet launch event is close, providing an entire DeFi platform. This provides one of the last opportunities to acquire the best crypto to buy before the price increase to $0.04 during Phase 7, confirming MUTM as the next big crypto to watch in 2026.

In a video posted on X, Claver revealed that his firm has been in recent conversations with large family offices that are now making significant allocations into XRP. His comments arrive at a moment when XRP’s long-term narrative is witnessing increased interest due to ETFs, and they highlight a shift happening among investors who have always avoided cryptocurrencies altogether. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says Wealthy Families Quietly Accumulating XRP Claver explained that XRP ownership is currently extremely limited relative to the global population, noting that only around 8 million wallets exist on the XRPL. Half of those wallets contain fewer than 100 XRP, which makes existing holders far more uncommon than they may think. He contrasted this with Bitcoin’s widespread ownership, arguing that XRP is still early in its adoption curve. He said the wealthy families showing interest are not looking for quick profits. According to him, they have already built their fortunes and instead see XRP as a form of insurance. According to his post, these families are buying crypto, not to get richer, but to protect the wealth they already have. He described their interest in cryptocurrencies as a hedge. These investors want something uncorrelated in their portfolios ahead of any potential shock in traditional markets. Claver’s $10K Price Target And The Conditions He Outlined When asked where he sees the price of XRP going, Claver stated that he believes the cryptocurrency could be trading at $10,000 by late 2026 or early 2027. He tied this prediction to how much ecosystem infrastructure becomes active on the XRPL over the next two years. He said the network would need substantial institutional-grade utilities, including XRP treasury systems, Evernorth’s launch, on-chain borrowing mechanisms, and new amendments to the XRP Ledger that will bring in additional compliance layers and smart-contract features. His projection assumes that rising network volume will require higher liquidity levels and that price stability at four- and five-figure ranges will only be achievable if the ledger is handling large-scale financial flows. He also pointed to ETFs as a major factor in shaping supply and demand, noting that as ETF adoption grows, more XRP will be locked away in long-term institutional products. Speaking of ETFs, Spot XRP ETFs are now approaching $1 billion in total net assets and could cross that threshold within the next few days. Since their debut, these funds have taken in about $897.35 million worth of XRP from exchanges and OTC desks, and they have yet to record a single day of outflows.

With its weak performance over the past few months and price action showing signs of exhaustion , the analyst has predicted that the next major support level lies more than 33% below all-time highs. Analyst Breaks Down Chart Signaling Bitcoin Price Crash TradingView crypto expert ‘EliteGoldAnalysis’ has released a fresh chart study on Bitcoin’s next selling move, warning that the cryptocurrency’s downtrend may not be over yet. The analyst’s breakdown highlights a key support level he believes Bitcoin could crash to if its current downward momentum persists. EliteGoldAnalysis outlines a price structure on the chart that begins with a weak high, a technical condition that often reflects a liquidity grab before a reversal. The appearance of a weak high near the top of Bitcoin’s most recent rally indicates that buyers may have been swept out before the momentum fully shifted. This pattern is accompanied by a steadily forming lower high, hinting at a developing bearish structure . From his perspective, the analyst explains that a short bias becomes relevant only after a clear confirmation of a bearish trend. Based on the Bitcoin price chart, such confirmation could include a break of minor support beneath the weak high, followed by a retest of that level. EliteGoldAnalysis also noted that a bearish rejection through wick actions or a strong bearish close would strengthen the case for a temporary Bitcoin price crash . While the analyst’s breakdown is just an interpretation of the chart rather than a trading call, Bitcoin’s price structure still hints at a possible retracement amid strengthening sell-side pressure . How Low Bitcoin Price Could Decline In his TradingView chart, EliteGoldAnalysis outlined critical zones that could dictate Bitcoin’s next bearish moves . The first region to watch is the potential “target level” marked in the purple zone above $85,000. The analyst views this level as a demand or imbalance area. Should Bitcoin reach and hold this target, it may act as the first checkpoint before the market decides whether to correct downwards or push higher. Just beneath the $85,000 region lies a “strong support level” highlighted in blue at $84,000 on the chart. EliteGoldAnalysis predicts that Bitcoin could decline to as low as this $84,000 support area. The analyst suggests that this level is the final retracement target, potentially representing a significant liquidity pool that could attract buyers if the price declines. A decisive drop toward this level would reflect a more than 6% decline from current levels above $89,000. Such a move would also mark the completion of the downside move implied by the chart structure. Over the past 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin has fallen roughly 3%, meaning a crash to $84,000 would further prolong the ongoing downtrend .

Meme assets often return during optimistic market phases, and FLOKI’s large community makes it a familiar starting point for conversation. Analysts at CoinDesk point out that user-driven tokens often outperform when retail interest rises. This sets the stage for a deeper evaluation of the best crypto to invest in 2025 as traders balance stability with early-stage opportunity. The market is now shifting toward ecosystems that combine transparent tokenomics, structured reward systems, and long-term utility. Projects with clear presale frameworks gain notable traction as buyers look for predictable scaling models rather than hype alone. While several assets demonstrate solid growth potential, one project is now gaining record attention for its strong mechanics, early-stage upside, and rapid token demand. This lineup highlights six assets shaping the broader conversation around the best crypto to invest in 2025 . 1. BullZilla (BZIL): The Best Crypto To Invest In 2025 With A High Velocity Presale Model BullZilla progresses through Stage 13, known as Zilla Sideways Smash, at a presale price of $0.00033238, and has already raised over $1 million. More than 32 billion tokens have been sold to over 3,600 holders, reflecting strong demand. Early participants in Stage 13B secured returns exceeding 5,680.52% as the token moves toward its projected listing value of $0.00527. Current participants still achieve approximately 1,485.95% projected ROI. A one-thousand-dollar purchase equals about 3.008 million tokens today. The next stage lifts pricing from $0.00033238 to $0.00033905, continuing BullZilla’s fast-moving upward valuation curve. A Roaring ROI Path That Pushes Early Gains Higher BullZilla ‘s structure creates a rising price floor, as each stage locks in previous levels and reduces the available supply. A three-thousand-dollar entry today secures more than nine million tokens. If the price reaches its projected listing of 0.00527, that position could exceed fifty thousand dollars. The model attracts early participants because it combines predictable price growth with transparent on-chain mechanics. Join BullZilla now at $0.00033238 before the next 2.006 percent price surge pushes early gains out of reach. 2. Sui (SUI): A High-Performance Chain Redefining User Experience Sui continues to gain attention for its parallel execution model, which improves speed and supports complex applications without network strain. Developers use Sui to build features that require low latency and high reliability. Its resource ownership system gives users unique control over assets while enabling advanced digital identity and gaming functions. Recent integrations highlight extended interoperability as Sui strengthens its developer environment. Analysts note its appeal among builders seeking predictable performance without high fees. As adoption grows across consumer applications, Sui positions itself as a strong contender in the evolving landscape of advanced blockchain ecosystems. 3. MoonBull (MOBU): A High APY Staking Ecosystem Built For Long-Term Growth MoonBull merges entertainment with a structured scarcity system that rewards steady participation. Built on Ethereum, the project uses reflections, auto liquidity support, and a multi-stage supply model that pushes value higher as the ecosystem grows. Its 95% APY staking pool attracts users seeking long-term returns backed by locked-in liquidity. The team uses AI-driven reward optimization to maintain balance during market volatility. Verified contracts and community governance reinforce transparency, helping MoonBull grow into one of the most trusted emerging assets for 2025. 4. La Culex (CULEX): A Multi-Stage Scarcity Engine With Strong Community Incentives La Culex presents a balanced token structure built for long-term resilience. The 200 billion supply is divided into presale, liquidity, staking, and community pools. Liquidity remains locked for 18 months, providing users with strong protection. Staking rewards reach eighty percent APY through the Hive Vault, while the Bite Chain referral system boosts network expansion. Each of the thirty-two presale stages reduces supply and pushes value closer to its projected 0.007 listing. Its audited contracts and zero-tax design strengthen trust among new participants seeking reliable early-stage growth. 5. APEMARS: A Mission Styled Ecosystem Built For Creative Expansion APEMARS is a story-centered memecoin designed as a community-driven mission to Mars, built on the ERC 20 standard to offer an experience that feels like an evolving expedition rather than a standard presale. The journey progresses through 23 weekly stages, each symbolizing a segment of Commander Ape’s 225 million-kilometer voyage, with narrative and pricing moving forward together. Mars-themed mechanics shape the project, including burn checkpoints at Stages 6, 12, 18, and 23 to strengthen scarcity. After launch, the APE Yield Station delivers 63 percent APY with rewards locked for two months, while the Orbital Boost referral system offers 9.34 percent rewards once a holder contributes 22 dollars, forming the core of Operation RED BANANA. 6. FLOKI: A Meme Giant Preparing For Another Cycle FLOKI’s large global community continues driving attention toward its broader utility features. The project develops metaverse experiences, educational platforms, and decentralized finance tools that extend beyond typical meme narratives. FLOKI’s marketing strength helps maintain visibility across major markets, and several institutions follow its ecosystem due to strong branding. Analysts from Messari highlight FLOKI’s cross-chain expansion as a core driver of renewed interest. As the market shifts toward 2025, FLOKI remains well-positioned for strong participation, driven by community energy and upcoming utility upgrades. Conclusion Sui, MoonBull, and La Culex show strong technical discipline with systems built for steady growth, while APEMARS and FLOKI highlight creative communities shaping fresh narratives within the market. These projects attract different types of traders as adoption rises and new features strengthen their long-term appeal. Together, they form a diverse group of emerging ecosystems that continue gaining attention from users seeking stability, utility, and innovative design across expanding blockchain networks. BullZilla stands at the center of the discussion as the best crypto to invest in 2025 thanks to its structured presale system, strong early returns, and rapid community expansion. Its rising holder count and predictable stage-based valuation path make it a standout option for traders positioning ahead of the next cycle. As markets move toward higher engagement in 2025, many follow BullZilla closely because it offers transparent mechanics, reliable token flow, and a clear roadmap supporting future growth. Buy BullZilla today and catch the surge early.

MSTY consistently underperforms MSTR during rallies while only marginally mitigating downside, making it unattractive compared to direct MSTR exposure. Recent dividend reductions and high return of capital indicate the payout is shrinking and not supported by true income generation. I maintain a Hold rating on MSTY, as upside is capped and downside protection is minimal; direct MSTR ownership is preferable if bullish. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) is liked by some investors for its high dividend yield of 100%+, which it partially achieves by generating income from Strategy ( MSTR ) options. But oftentimes, if something seems too good to be true, it is. On February 27, I wrote about the MSTY ETF, and the article was titled ""MSTY: 100%+ Dividend Yield, But There's A Catch."" In that article, I highlighted several risks to note for investors considering a position in MSTY. Those risks included BTC potentially falling by another 10%+ (which is what it did shortly after the article was published), the potential for smaller dividends over time, Strategy's premium over its mNAV, and the fact that MSTY can underperform when MSTR performs very well but still capture a lot of the downside when MSTR performs badly. I think it's safe to say that those things have played out. The price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was around $84,000 when I wrote that article and is actually a bit higher now at around $89,000. However, MSTY's total return since then -- which includes dividends -- has been -30.27%. A lot of this has to do with MSTR's poor performance and mNAV premium erosion lately. MSTY's Performance Since My Last Article (Seeking Alpha) At the same time, MSTY's dividends have shrunk considerably. The only reason the yield is still high is because the share price has fallen. So, what's next? While MSTY is surely a much better Buy now than it was a few months ago, I still don't think this is an investment vehicle worth pursuing -- compared to MSTR stock -- for the long term for many of the same reasons as before. This is despite me not being bearish on BTC. Therefore, I'm staying on the sidelines with a Hold rating. A Brief Overview of MSTY's Strategy MSTY indirectly invests in MSTR stock. Its main goal is to generate income, and its secondary goal is to capture the share price movements of MSTR stock. I went over MSTY's strategy in my last article on the ETF, and I suggest reading that for more context, but here's a refresher. Previously, I wrote: MSTY is an options-based ETF. Instead of buying MSTR shares, MSTY gains its exposure to MSTR through the purchase of call options. To help finance these purchases, MSTY also sells puts on MSTR. The fund doesn't just sell puts, though. Particularly, the fund's prospectus states the following: On a monthly basis or more frequently, the Fund will sell call option contracts on the Underlying Security with expiration dates of approximately one month or less in the future at strike prices that are approximately equal to 0%-15% above the then-current share price of the Underlying Security. And when MSTY's management team is more confident that MSTR stock will rise, it can choose to employ a call credit spread (which it calls a covered call spread strategy) instead of covered calls to seek greater upside potential. Further, the fund invests in US Treasuries with target maturities of 6 months to 2 years. Its 6 main types of holdings can be seen below. MSTY's Portfolio Strategy (MSTY's Prospectus) MSTY's Prospectus MSTY ETF's Performance Problem MSTY's strategy leaves it with a performance issue. It tends to underperform greatly when MSTR stock rallies, and it still captures a lot of the downside when MSTR does poorly. That's because its covered call and call credit spread strategies limit upside potential. I'm sure most readers of this article are familiar with these options strategies, so I'll spare you the details. The strategies may sound great on the surface (generating income from MSTR's volatility), but they often just don't do that well. Here's how MSTY has performed compared to MSTR -- dividends included. In the chart below, the candlesticks represent MSTY, while the bars represent Strategy stock. Since its inception in February 2024, MSTY has returned 102.4%, while MSTR has returned 151.8%. You can also tell how much better MSTR's outperformance is during bullish periods. MSTY's Performance vs. MSTR's Performance (TradingView) Here's another thing to consider. During the most recent drawdown starting in July, MSTY has fallen by 55.6%. MSTY's Performance Starting From July 18, 2025 (TradingView) At the same time, MSTR has fallen by 60.4%. MSTR's Performance Starting From July 18, 2025 (TradingView) Sure, MSTR performed worse during this period, but not by much. The income generated from MSTY's options strategy only spared the fund a few percentage points of drawdown while sparing it many percentage points of upside during good times. That's quite the opposite of a strategy I'd want to be exposed to. The Dividend Problem The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF has a variable dividend that can fluctuate greatly. When I wrote my previous MSTY article, the most recent dividend was $2.0216 per share, paid 13 times a year, for an annualized dividend of $26.28 per share. Of course, that ""annualized"" dividend would only come to fruition if the dividend held steady, which it didn't. I previously noted that factors like implied volatility and MSTR's stock price can impact the dividend. All else being equal, a higher MSTR stock price and higher implied volatility for its options will lead to greater premiums, which can help sustain the dividend. The same principle applies if MSTR and its IV fall. Since the implied volatility was low and the stock price had fallen in February, I argued that the March distribution could be lower. The March distribution then came out to $1.3775 per share -- a big drop. All the dividends after that, except a $2.3734 per share dividend in May, were much lower than February's dividend. It's worth noting that the fund started paying its dividends weekly in October. MSTY's Dividend History (yieldmaxetfs.com) And for reference, volatility in Strategy's options chain is at around the same level as it was in February, but it had dropped off in a big way in the middle of the year. Strategy's Historical Volatility (Interactive Brokers) There's also another thing that affects MSTY's dividends -- the amount of money it has invested. Here's the problem, though: MSTY has been using ""return of capital"" ((ROC)) to fund large portions of its dividend payments since May. You can see that in the ""ROC"" section of the chart above. For example, 92.88% of the most recent dividend of $0.1388 per share came from a return of capital, meaning that only about 7% came from income the fund generated. This isn't true income. It's just the fund giving your money back to you. The less money the fund has (because it's just giving you your money back), the less it can invest, and the less income it will make. This certainly doesn't help the dividend. So, yes, the fund yields over 100% right now if you annualize the most recent dividend, but that's not a guaranteed dividend. It depends on several factors. The annualized dividend right now is around $7.22 per share. Recall that in February, it was $26.28 per share, and some people were bashing me for not being bullish despite a high yield. However, I do recognize that the dividend can increase from here if MSTR stock recovers. But as we've seen, MSTY tends to underperform during upswings. If you're bullish on MSTR, you might as well buy MSTR then, not MSTY. At Least Bitcoin is Well Off Its Highs The MSTY ETF has something going for it. Bitcoin is well off its all-time high and is close to a trendline support area. Bitcoin can potentially bounce back, helping Strategy stock recover, which would then help MSTY. BTC-USD Daily Chart (TradingView) Even the CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index shows that the crypto market is in fear territory (21 out of 100), and buying when the market is fearful can sometimes translate to nice gains. CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index (coinmarketcap.com) Strategy's Premium to mNAV Has Eroded Strategy stock's premium to its mNAV used to be much higher, sometimes above 2x or 3x. It's now 1.16x. To be honest, I don't even think it should be trading above mNAV, and I prefer the ETH treasury company SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ), but that's another argument for another article. The point is that the downside risk at 1.16x is much lower for MSTR and, in turn, MSTY. Strategy's Premium To mNAV (strategy.com) Therefore, one can make the argument that MSTR is relatively cheap, making MSTY worth buying. But at that point, why not just buy MSTR? The Bottom Line on MSTY ETF The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is a great ETF if you want high dividends, but that doesn't make it a great ETF overall. In recent months, your ""dividends"" would mostly have been your capital being returned to you. It looks nice to receive large dividends until you realize that these dividends are getting smaller and smaller over time and will only get bigger if MSTR stock rises or if its implied volatility rises sharply. But if you think MSTR stock will rise, you'd likely see better performance buying MSTR. In a crypto bull market, MSTR stock will rise, and its premium to mNAV (which is relatively low now) would likely rise as well, amplifying the gains. While MSTY would capture some of those gains, it wouldn't capture all of them, and that's by design. You can see that play out in its past performance. In most scenarios, buying MSTY is like capping the upside on MSTR stock while barely offsetting the downside. It's just not an attractive investment, relatively speaking. Therefore, I don't suggest that anyone buy it. The main reason I don't rate it as an outright Sell is because of Bitcoin's potential to bounce back after its recent fall.",MSTR|MSTR:CA|MSTY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-07 02:20:06

Buyers and sellers are locked in a tight battle, and the market now waits for a decisive break. A push above key resistance could open the door to $107,000, while weakness at support risks a deeper slide toward $71,000. Bounce Scenario: A Return Toward The Pink Box And Descending Trendline Kamile Uray, in her latest update on Bitcoin, noted that BTC failed to hold above the $90,720 level on the hourly chart, triggering the expected decline. The first immediate support now sits at $87,644, while the deeper support range lies between $83,822 and $82,477. If buyers defend this zone successfully, Bitcoin could attempt another climb toward the pink box region and retest the descending trendline overhead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Echoes 2022 Bear Start, Glassnode Warns Uray explained that a sustained move above the pink box resistance on the daily timeframe would open the door for Bitcoin to challenge the descending blue trendline. A confirmed breakout from this area could strengthen bullish momentum, pushing the price toward the next major resistance levels at $98,200 and $107,500. A break above $107,500 alongside the descending trendline would serve as a strong signal that the broader uptrend is ready to continue. However, she warned that a daily close below $82,477 would shift the market structure toward further weakness, placing Bitcoin at risk of revisiting lower levels. Even so, Uray highlighted one critical area of strength: the $74,496–$71,237 zone. This region represents the key breakout top from November 2024 and is considered a strong historical support. In this area, buyers may step in aggressively, potentially setting the stage for an upward reversal. Bitcoin Price Rejection At $93,000–$95,000 Zone According to Crypto Candy, Bitcoin’s latest price action has been unfolding precisely in line with expectations. After facing rejection in the $93,000–$95,000 resistance zone, BTC dipped sharply and nearly touched the anticipated support range at $86,000–$87,500. This move reflects the broader market’s reaction to heavy selling pressure near the upper resistance band. Related Reading: Reversal Loading? Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Build Powerful High-Time-Frame Structures Crypto Candy emphasized that the $86,000–$87,500 zone now serves as a crucial pivot area. If buyers successfully defend this support and the price stabilizes above it, Bitcoin could once again revisit the $93,000–$95,000 range, or even push beyond it. Such a rebound would signal renewed bullish momentum and set the stage for another attempt at breaking higher resistance levels. However, the analyst also warned that failure to hold the $86,000–$87,500 support could trigger deeper downside movement.

The company, by far the largest corporate holder of Ether in the world, has accumulated the figure in just the last two days, according to new blockchain tracking data. The acquisitions were made in two large purchases : the first on Friday for $130.7 million, and another for $68 million on Saturday. These purchases bring the total of Ether held by BitMine to approximately $11.3 billion, which is about 3.08% of all ETH in existence at the time of this press release. The company is now edging closer to its long-time goal of capturing 5% of the Ethereum network. BitMine’s aggressive buying spree pushes forward against the current backdrop – a space where most top-calibre traders and institutional participants are short-term bearish on Ether. BitMine speeds up acquisitions, despite an industry slowdown The broader corporate Ethereum market has cooled sharply. Among the largest companies, net treasury savings, excluding its flagship company product, reached a seven-quarter high of $67.5 billion. Digital asset treasury activity – that segment that monitors corporate purchases of large cryptos has decreased 81% in just 3 months. In August, businesses combined accumulated 1.97 million ETH, but that number dropped significantly in November to just 370,000 ETH. BitMine, meanwhile, has taken the opposite approach. The firm has purchased 679,000 ETH (valuing $2.13 billion) in the past month alone. This purchase represented the vast majority of all corporate Ether purchased during that timeframe and demonstrated the company’s increasing dominance and confidence. BitMine management has consistently described its approach as one that invests in the Ethereum platform as a key feature of the emerging digital economy. Remaining bullish, BitMine has proven multiple times that the occasional bear market isn’t a signal of doom — it’s an opportunity for accumulation. The company also maintains a cash reserve of $882 million, which could be utilised to continue purchasing if market conditions remain favourable. However, as BitMine is betting big on Ethereum’s future, the most sophisticated traders in the market are now betting, at least in the short term, on something else. Smart money traders have accumulated a significant amount of short interest, according to data from the leading blockchain intelligence platform Nansen. Over the past 24 hours, ETH shorts have added a net notional amount of $2.8 million, resulting in a total short exposure of $21 million in combined notional value. They are a signal that managers expect prices to continue to fall. Institutional sentiment also appears subdued. Spot Ethereum ETFs, generally one of the heaviest drivers of liquidity for the asset, continue to experience outflows. Spot ETH ETFs on Friday reported $75.2 million in net outflows, marking its second consecutive day of outflows. That lukewarm demand comes on the heels of a sharp $1.4 billion outflow in November, indicating wariness among institutional investors. BitMine rises as a major force in the Ether ecosystem BitMine’s rapid expansion into the Ethereum universe has larger implications. With the firm nearing ownership of 5% of available ETH, it now has a greater vested interest in a network where supply centralisation affects market structure, liquidity profiles, and staking dynamics. At 5% BitMine would have more ETH than every large decentralised staking pool combined, possibly setting a threshold on the amount of assets a corporation controls from an Ethereum perspective. It also raises questions about how traditional treasuries could evolve as cryptocurrencies increasingly integrate into mainstream financial systems. BitMine’s approach, for now, is obvious: pile in like mad and stay liquid to become a major player in Ethereum in the long run. However, market concerns aside, the firm’s recent activity demonstrates unabated conviction in Ethereum’s growth prospects and a willingness to continue buying until its target of 5% is achieved.

While the global financial system is accelerating its transition to real-time settlement, XRP is emerging as a contender for enterprise-level treasury flows. As Ripple’s institutional network continues to expand, the altcoin is stepping into a role where digital assets can enhance liquidity management and power the next generation of global value transfer. Why RippleNet’s Expanding Network Drives Enterprise Confidence The bearish view of XRP is clouding the bigger transformation happening behind the scenes. Analyst Xfinancebull has mentioned on X that XRP is embedding itself into the financial engines where global treasury systems teams move trillions. With the GTreasury acquisition, Ripple gains access to the operational layer where $12.5 trillion in enterprise liquidity flows. This is about the altcoin becoming a native rail inside the financial command centers of over 1,000 multinational giants where trillions move. Treasury teams move real money, not just $100 payments, but payroll, supply chain financing, and liquidity management across continents. The XRP niche is that it moves trillions fast, 24/7, across borders. Meanwhile, Ripple now controls the infrastructure platform that interacts with BNY Mellon to move trillions and automates finance at scale. According to Xfinancebull, the token goes from a speculative asset to invisible plumbing. This shift doesn’t make the front-page headlines, but it moves everything behind them. Most analysts won’t notice that this has unlocked the token to become a standard settlement rail in the GTreasury automation stack, making its utility broader, invisible, and massive. Founder of Lux Lions NFT and host of the crypto Blitz YouTube show, RipBullWinkle, stated that the Federal Reserve has officially halted its Quantitative Tightening (QT) measures, ending the two-year liquidity drain that weighed down the entire crypto sector. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager with $11 trillion in AUM, has reversed course and will now allow clients to have access to the regulated crypto ETFs. This single move clears the path for trillions in passive capital, a macro environment of liquidity, compliance, and global settlement that XRP is engineered for. How XRP Defies The Market Slump With A Rare Positive Performance While the crypto market has been struggling to find its footing, an observer and researcher of the current tech shift, SMQKE, has noted that WisdomTree data shows that XRP is the only major cryptocurrency posting positive year-to-date returns in 2025. On a year-to-date basis, where the broader markets were pulling back, the altcoin has stood out as the lone performer, holding onto a modest +4% gain year-to-date. In a challenging year for most large-cap digital assets, it has emerged as the top-tier asset with a positive year-to-date performance. Even after experiencing drawdowns in line with the broader market during Q4, XRP has demonstrated remarkable relative resilience and remains up +4% YTD and +12% over the past 12 months.",XRP|BNY Mellon|Crypto Blitz|crypto ETFs|GTreasury|Lux Lions NFT|QT|Quantitative Tightening|RipBullWinkle|ripple|SMQKE|Vanguard|wisdomtree|Xfinancebull|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT|Year-To-Date|Youtube|YTD,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-07 03:30:49

Jamie Dimon stated that a “weak” Europe is not just a European problem, but one with serious implications for global growth, trade flows, and ultimately, the US economy. “If Europe goes down, we all go down,” Dimon warned, underlining that sluggish growth, burdensome regulation, and sluggish productivity on the continent represent a systemic risk for transatlantic and global prosperity. He made these remarks during the Reagan National Defence Forum, which was held on Saturday, December 6. At this time, Dimon insisted that “Europe has a real problem.” To elaborate on his claim, the CEO began by acknowledging that the continent has implemented some considerable safety measures. However, he voiced concerns about Europe’s approach, which pushes businesses away, chases off investment, and stifles innovation. This finding ignited heated debates among individuals. To address this controversy, Dimon highlighted a positive aspect of the continent. According to him, the continent is making a comeback. Dimon calls on the urgency to address the challenges that make Europe weak Earlier, Dimon raised concerns about Europe’s split status. As the head of the largest bank in the US, he explained that this division presents a substantial challenge that the world encounters. This statement was revealed after the CEO shared his letter to shareholders earlier this year, noting that Europe has s ome critical issues that need to be addressed as soon as possible. Even with these challenges in place, Dimon expressed his excitement about the launch of the euro, a significant accomplishment for the region. He also acknowledged Europe’s efforts to establish peace among its trading partners, primarily with Ukraine. Nonetheless, he urged the continent to work on its agreements within the European Union (EU) since this challenge poses a risk to Europe. “If they fall apart, then you can say that America first will not exist anymore,” Dimon said. Notably, analysts discovered that the EU and the US are each other’s largest and most important trading partners. Therefore, Dimon emphasized that the United States should assist because this situation will affect it more than any other nation. Apart from conducting trade, the US and the EU have also shared values which matter greatly. “We need a long-term plan to make them stronger,” Dimon stated while still highlighting that a weak Europe has negative impacts on the US. Meanwhile, reports dated October of this year mentioned that JPMorgan released a statement confirming its plans to make a substantial investment worth $1.5 trillion in industries that play a crucial role in enhancing the US’s economic security and strength over the next decade. This amounts to $500 billion more than what the bank would have otherwise contributed. Dimon cautioned on the US’s habit of relying on unreliable sources JPMorgan CEO admitted that it was crystal clear that the US has increasingly relied on unreliable sources for key minerals, products, and manufacturing. Jay Horine, an investment banker, leads this recently initiated project, which Dimon refers to as “100% commercial.” Sources close to the situation hinted that this initiative will focus on four main areas. This includes supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defence and aerospace, energy independence and resilience, and frontier and strategic technologies. On the other hand, another report from a reliable source highlighted that the bank intends to allocate $10 billion of its own funds to aid certain firms in expansion, innovation , or accelerate key manufacturing processes. Dimon also complimented US President Donald Trump’s efforts to lower bureaucracy in the government on Saturday this week. According to him, this is a smart move that they can achieve while ensuring that safety measures are effective in sectors such as food and banking.

In an interview, he explained why the timing of the launch mattered. His comments arrive at a point when XRP seeks a larger role in global finance, and investors want clarity on its long-term path. A Positive Change in Conditions Hougan described a simple reason for Bitwise’s decision. He said Ripple has a strong community. He also referred to XRP as a Lindy asset that has been in existence for a long time. He then addressed the central issue. He said XRP faced an “existential regulatory threat” during the SEC’s lawsuit . He noted that no major institution wanted to build real-world products on a network that faced that level of risk. He said the lawsuit froze adoption. His point was clear. The barrier was not technology, but uncertainty. Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, says the reason they launched a Ripple ETF is simple: the playing field has finally changed. For years, Ripple and XRP were held back by an existential regulatory threat. The SEC lawsuit froze real-world adoption and made major partnerships nearly… https://t.co/szyM53PQiM pic.twitter.com/Ho42F9EAts — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) December 4, 2025 This legal battle ended in August , and Hougan stated that this development changed the landscape. He said the blockchain now has “a chance” to compete on a level playing field. He pointed out that this change does not guarantee success. It does, however, enable XRP to gain the use cases that its supporters have long discussed. Xaif reinforced this point in his caption when he said the lawsuit held back adoption and stopped partnerships at scale. His comments aligned with Hougan’s reasoning. A Strategic ETF Launch Hougan highlighted the ETF structure as a key step for investors who want exposure through regulated markets. He said Bitwise launched the product to give the community “high-quality exposure” through a simple ticker. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He also said Bitwise reserved the ticker XRP in advance. The firm moved as soon as the regulatory landscape allowed it. This decision gives institutions a direct path to allocate capital. It also strengthens XRP’s position among other approved digital asset funds. Rising Institutional Interest in XRP The Bitwise XRP ETF entered the market with strong interest from investors. It had a trading volume of $25.7 million on the first day , with $107.6 million in assets under management (AUM). ETFs often attract traditional firms that need compliance-ready exposure. Bitwise’s ETF launch shows that institutions are interested in XRP. Greater regulatory clarity tends to support long-term confidence. With the lawsuit now over, access through an ETF increases market depth. XRP now competes for institutional flow that once excluded it. If new partnerships and enterprise use appear, XRP could gain a stronger position in global finance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The company handles a large share of global corporate activity. Its clients process $12.5 trillion in annual payment volume. It also manages $250 billion in operational accounts. The platform links to BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirect, which supports over $6.5 trillion in yearly transaction flow. GTreasury shared this information in its public summary. X Finance Bull focused on the size of these flows. He said that “XRP is becoming part of enterprise treasury systems, where trillions move .” He said that treasury teams within global firms move large amounts each day through key systems. These actions operate at all hours because companies function in many regions. He believes this type of activity fits XRP’s design. Ripple Gains a Direct Link to Core Finance Tools GTreasury said that it now gives customers the option to use real-time settlement and institutional-grade infrastructure . It linked this change to Ripple’s plan to offer custody, liquidity, treasury tools, payments, and real-time settlement on a single platform. X Finance Bull said, “Ripple now controls the infrastructure that talks to BNY Mellon”. He sees this as a major step because treasury platforms guide how large companies transfer money. He argued that this position could help Ripple offer fast settlement rails to corporate clients.

He also said that many people will not notice this shift because it happens deep inside enterprise systems. The scale of these flows gives XRP a stronger future in global finance . Automation Could Boost XRP’s Use GTreasury said that the future of corporate treasury has no friction and no boundaries. X Finance Bull linked this to Ripple’s plan to build a full digital asset platform. He believes that more automation inside these tools will lead to active settlement. He wrote that XRP gains “continuous, invisible, and massive” utility as it enters GTreasury’s automation stack. Ripple’s deal puts XRP inside tools used by major global firms, and this pipeline could change everything for XRP, as it moves trillions of dollars.

Reports indicate it was caused by a technician who made an error while performing maintenance work in Aurora, Illinois. The breakdown , on November 28, brought business to a standstill at some of the world’s most critical financial markets and underscored vulnerabilities in the infrastructure that supports derivative trading globally. CyrusOne said the incident originated from on-site staff and contractors not following “standard procedures for draining cooling towers” that cool internal infrastructure before lower temperatures set in. As the temperature outside dropped, so did the temperature inside the facility when its cooling system stopped working. This failed several key cooling units, leading to higher room temperatures in the server rooms. The servers that host CME’s Globex trading platform began to overheat. Robotic safety systems then shut down the equipment to avoid damage. With core servers offline, CME’s markets for futures, options, and products tied to commodities, currencies, and the Treasury spectrum abruptly ceased processing trades. The pause reverberated around the global financial system. Traders in Asia, Europe, and the United States were cut off from live prices or unable to manage their positions. At a few of the largest markets, liquidity vanished altogether, as in gold and Treasury futures, leaving some traders unprotected as they waited for systems to come back online. Markets shudder as the shutdown reverberates around the world The outage occurred in the early morning hours in the United States, prompting traders to assess the situation. Markets had already opened for many traders in Europe and Asia by the time prices on CME-connected products suddenly stopped moving. Futures on prominent U.S. stock indexes ceased updating. On the commodity markets, including the crude oil and gold markets, there was only eerie silence. U.S. Treasury futures, a global fixed-income trading lynchpin, were offline for several hours. Currency trading markets were also thrown into disarray as CME’s electronic brokering system for currency trading, Globex, went offline. Traders were unable to avoid exposure or take profits. Institutional desks faced similar woes, with some stating that their standard risk management tools have become ineffective. The disruption showed how dependent modern markets have become on a small number of data centres. With CME’s primary engine offline, there was virtually no corner of global trading able to access one of its most critical pricing feeds. Some firms reported minor internal delays as activity surged on alternative platforms, while others warned that the inability to exit positions posed significant danger. Had equities sharply sold off during the halt, they said, the resulting losses could have been devastating. CME’s long delay before returning to Black Friday trading was caused by the venue being disconnected so that its cooling systems could be stabilized and servers brought back online. CME rethinks data center strategy after human error After a human error was determined to be the primary cause of the circumstances, CyrusOne stated that it has already implemented more stringent cold-weather procedures. These include increasing the number of personnel on duty during periods of extreme weather, enhancing cooling infrastructure, hardening systems, and improving redundant systems to prevent the simultaneous failure of multiple units. The incident has reignited debate over CME’s move to depend on a data centre it no longer owns. CME sold the Aurora site in 2016. Since then, it has relied on CyrusOne to run the infrastructure that supports much of its electronic trading . The outage has also prompted questions over whether such an arrangement affords CME sufficient control over its essential systems. And questions arose about CME’s decision not to relocate to its backup facility. Emergency plans called for relocating operations at a second location, but CME declined to activate that site, as it received early indications that the outage would be short-lived. However, the few hours of cooling loss proved far more serious, and the delay ensured that the outage would last more than ten hours. Industry analysts say the episode should serve as a wake-up call. Modern markets aren’t just software—they’re also hardware, with power supply and cooling systems. A breakdown in any of them can halt global markets. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Yet a recent post by BD (@DiepSanh) offered a clearer view. He highlighted comments from Vet (@VetX_0), a validator on the XRP Ledger, focusing on a simple contrast of how both assets entered the market. That contrast now shapes how each network grows. Different Distribution Models Create Different Outcomes Vet noted that Bitcoin enjoyed an early advantage because it had an “amazing distribution phase through mining.” The mining model enabled BTC to reach a wide base of early users. It rewarded those who supplied computing power at a time when the network needed it most. This model helped Bitcoin gain recognition during its first years. The situation shifted once distribution began to taper off. Vet stated that Bitcoin then faced “high miner costs, rising fees, no true finality, and constant sell pressure from miners.” The comment reflects a structural issue. Miners must sell BTC to cover their expenses. This creates steady selling pressure during every market cycle. It also forces the network to rely on higher fees as block rewards shrink. These factors reduce efficiency and place friction on growth. XRP took a different path. Vet said XRP was “harder to distribute at the start” because it did not use mining. That choice removed the long-term burden of ongoing production costs. The supply model stays fixed . Validators do not earn XRP through block creation. The ledger can run without the need for rising transaction fees. This structure makes the network easier to scale and maintain. It also reduces forced selling because there is no mining treasury. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Matters for XRP’s Price Growth BD highlighted these points because they affect the future performance of both assets. Bitcoin must push fees higher to support miners. Rising fees can limit activity during peak periods. It also makes everyday payments less practical. This weakens long-term demand for BTC as a utility asset. XRP does not face those limits. The absence of mining gives the network a cost advantage. Firms can move value at speed without fear of fee spikes. This supports stronger use in payments and settlement . It adds a base layer of demand that does not rely on speculation. More stable utility can help XRP form a steady growth curve when market activity increases. Vet also noted that XRP “is actually the closest realization of Bitcoin’s original peer-to-peer payments vision.” Bitcoin moved further into the store-of-value role . XRP continued to focus on efficient transfer of value. This focus appeals to enterprises and financial platforms. It offers a clearer path for adoption that can support price strength during future cycles. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

55453977,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=874268,1765093344,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55453977.jpeg,"Ripple (XRP) Wins Regulatory Expansion, yet Analysts Suggest GeeFi (GEE) For Life-Changing Returns",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-xrp-wins-regulatory-expansion-yet-analysts-suggest-geefi-gee-for-life-changing-returns/,"While established tokens dominate headlines, GeeFi is capturing investor attention with a presale performance that defies current market expectations. This comprehensive crypto ecosystem has shattered early targets , concluding Phase 1 in less than two weeks and successfully raising $500,000 . The momentum has only accelerated, Phase 2 has quickly added another $570,000 , bringing the total raised to over $1 million . Phase 2 is already more than 70% complete , and analysts predict that Phase 3 will likely commence as early as next week . With this rapid absorption rate, the opportunity to join at current levels is closing faster than anticipated. Utility That Outperforms Speculation Ripple is currently making waves with XRP ETFs approaching $1 billion in assets and the company finalizing its $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury . However, smart money is rapidly pivoting toward GeeFi to capture higher growth potential. Unlike projects that rely solely on market sentiment, GeeFi delivers a suite of essential tools designed for the modern crypto user. At the heart of this ecosystem lies the GeeFi DEX, a high-performance decentralized exchange. This platform empowers traders with total control over their assets, removing the need for third-party custodians and ensuring that security remains in the hands of the user. The ecosystem’s utility extends far beyond trading, bridging the gap between digital assets and everyday spending. GeeFi is preparing to launch its specialized Crypto Cards, integrated with VISA and Mastercard networks, allowing users to spend their holdings globally. This real-world application is supported by the GEE token’s deflationary model. Through systematic burns and supply reduction mechanisms, the protocol is designed to increase token scarcity over time. This economic structure rewards long-term participants, creating a sustainable cycle of value appreciation that stands in stark contrast to the inflationary models of many competitors. A Financial Opportunity with Massive Upside GeeFi has now entered Phase 2, presenting a lucrative entry point with tokens priced at just $0.06 . The financial mathematics of this offer are compelling: with a confirmed listing price of $0.40 when the token launches, investors buying today lock in a guaranteed return of 667% . The long-term projections are even more staggering. By investing $1,600 now , based on a forecasted evaluation of $2 per token , your investment could potentially surge to $60,000 , achieving a remarkable 3,233% ROI . The velocity of the sale supports these bullish projections. Phase 2 has already seen 9.5 million tokens sold and raised over $570,000 in just a few days. Analysts have praised GeeFi’s presale structure, predicting that Phase 2 will conclude within the next few days due to this explosive momentum. This optimism is further fueled by leaked talks from the GeeFi Team regarding incoming listings on several major exchanges, which typically serve as a catalyst for parabolic price action. Passive Income Redefined In addition to capital appreciation, GeeFi offers one of the most aggressive staking programs in the industry to reward its community. Users can generate passive income directly through the GeeFi Wallet with flexible options suited to any strategy. For those who prefer liquidity, the platform offers up to 10% APR with no lock-up period . However, the true value lies in committed staking: investors can earn 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and an industry-leading 55% APR for a 12-month commitment . Furthermore, the ecosystem encourages community growth through a referral feature, allowing users to earn a 5% bonus on contributions made by their referrals. The Next 100x Gem is Here Market analysts are increasingly identifying GeeFi as a potential 100x Gem project, a rarity in the current landscape. This presale offers a unique opportunity to secure a position in a high-utility ecosystem before it hits the public markets. With Phase 2 rapidly reaching capacity and the price scheduled to increase when Phase 3 begins, the potential for maximum returns is time-sensitive. Investors are moving quickly to secure their stake, driven by the fear of missing out on what could be the year’s most significant launch. The momentum is undeniable, and the time to act is now before the next phase begins.

It featured Paul Barron speaking with Sandy Kaul, the Head of Digital Asset and Industry Advisory Services at Franklin Templeton. Referencing the video, Xaif revealed that as much as $2.3 trillion in liquidity could move into XRP. He also said demand from Wall Street and retail is rising while XRP ETFs enter the market . Xaif added that XRP is now part of the same conversation as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. $2.3T in liquidity could flow into $XRP , says Franklin Templeton. XRP ETFs are here and institutions are finally waking up. Demand from Wall Street + retail is surging, and XRP is leveling up to the same narrative as Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs. pic.twitter.com/kF21v9cAua — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 5, 2025 Progress in XRP’s Market Position Barron asked Kaul if the rise in demand from retail and institutions has started to push XRP toward the same level as Bitcoin and ETH ETF activity. Kaul said, “I think that we’re moving in that direction,” and pointed to the role of stablecoins. She said stablecoins now drive a major part of the digital asset space. She noted that the XRP Ledger holds a unique position because “XRP is one of the only chains that also has its own stablecoin.” Kaul said RLUSD gives the company a chance to build new business lines. She added that XRP works on a public chain with an independent validation network. She described this structure as “a pretty interesting business case,” which she said is one reason Franklin Templeton has increased its work with Ripple in recent years. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Global Growth Kaul said Ripple faced challenges in the U.S. during the SEC lawsuit but kept building in other countries and continents. She said Franklin Templeton worked with Ripple in Asia for some time and that Ripple’s reach in other regions continues to grow. Kaul also spoke about the rise of computer-to-computer transactions. She expects this rise to continue as more groups adopt Web3 systems. She said new digital rails will support a much larger volume of automated activity. This increases the need for networks that settle transactions at scale and with clear trust models. Outlook for XRP Xaif’s comment about major liquidity moving toward XRP matches the themes seen in Kaul’s remarks. Institutions seeking assets with strong settlement tools, clear global reach, and a stablecoin that works within the same ecosystem. XRP now holds these features while also gaining new ETF products. Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF is making waves in the market as demand for the digital asset surges. Kaul’s comments reflect a growing view that XRP may play a larger role as new digital financial systems expand.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $5,243.05 and a minimum price of $4,587.67. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $8,519.96 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond?

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s price also increased to $893.4 as buying interest surged once again. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and break above $921. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $881. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $893.4, as bulls target $921. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.94 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction , BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark.

Peterson particularly highlighted the pressure on the price from fund flows coming from spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. According to Peterson's analysis, approximately 51,000 BTC have been sold from US ETFs since October 9th. These sales total approximately $4.6 billion, based on a period when Bitcoin was trading around $90,000. The analyst noted that average weekly inflows into ETFs through 2025 were around $450 million, and that the market recovery will take time due to the high correlation between price and fund flows. Related News: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Explains What the Cryptocurrency Market “Needs Right Now” and Names a Project Based on this data, Peterson said it could take at least 10 weeks for Bitcoin to reach its ATH again, or more realistically, closer to 14 weeks as the price enters an uptrend again. He added that ETF inflows have been nearly flat over the past two weeks, indicating weakness on the demand side. Peterson also noted that Bitcoin has fallen below a key threshold for its long-term network value (Metcalfe). The price has fallen below the Metcalfe for the first time in almost two years. While this isn't necessarily a bottom signal, it does indicate that leveraged positions have largely been cleared and the previous bubble effect has faded, according to the analyst. *This is not investment advice.

ChatGPT Challenges Massive Bullish Predictions,https://cryptopotato.com/can-xrp-realistically-hit-10-chatgpt-challenges-massive-bullish-predictions/,"Ripple’s cross-border token is among the most popular in the cryptocurrency community, with a massive fanbase referred to as the XRP Army. They are known for making bold claims, and one of the most popular participants, John Squire, has outlined numerous mind-blowing price targets for XRP’s future. In the latest, he wondered on X whether the asset could rocket to $10 by the end of the year. Given the short timeframe left of just a few weeks, we decided to ask ChatGPT about its opinion on how viable this prediction is. XRP at $10 in 2025? — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 3, 2025 Close to Impossible Since XRP would need to skyrocket by nearly 400% in just over three weeks to reach Squire’s number, ChatGPT was quick to determine that such a move would be “close to impossible” for 2025. After all, XRP is the second-largest altcoin, not some small-cap that can surge by double- or even triple-digits within days or weeks. Moreover, if this rather far-fetched target is reached, the asset’s market cap would soar to $520-$550 billion, making it much more valuable than ETH and placing it “close to or above some of the largest companies in the world.” “Achieving this in the current liquidity and market environment is a massive challenge,” said ChatGPT. It also noted that XRP has underperformed since the mid-July all-time high of $3.65, losing more than 40% of its value since then. It even dipped below $2.00 on several occasions. Lastly, OpenAI’s platform mentioned the XRP ETF inflows, which, albeit still in the green for weeks, are “relatively modest” and have declined in the past several days. $10 Ever? After noting that there’s a very, very slim chance of hitting $10 this year, ChatGPT provided a broader and more optimistic look for the long run. It believes the spot XRP ETF inflows are key to determining whether the underlying asset can reach such heights, especially if major issuers, like BlackRock and Fidelity, enter the field. Additionally, it brought up XRP’s utility potential, which could also boost its price for the next few years. “Cross-border settlement, liquidity provisioning, and remittance infrastructure remain XRP’s core value propositions. If Ripple secures additional large-scale banking integrations, utility-driven demand could support a multi-dollar valuation.” It reiterated a previous statement that Ripple’s token tends to outperform in the latter stages of bull cycles. As such, it noted that if BTC resumes a strong uptrend or “enters a new macro bull phase in 2026,” the subsequent capital rotation into larger-cap alts such as XRP can push it “dramatically higher.” In conclusion, the AI chatbot said it’s possible for XRP to hit $10 eventually, but it’s highly unlikely to happen soon, and added: “XRP can reach $10 in the long run — especially in a supercycle scenario or if multiple ETFs attract billions in inflows. But based on current momentum, liquidity, and market structure, achieving that target within the next 12 months appears highly ambitious.” The post Can XRP Realistically Hit $10?

Its presale is a testament to the power of true innovation, with Phase 1 concluding in just over a week after selling 10 million tokens and raising $500,000 . The momentum has only intensified, with total contributions now soaring past the $1 million milestone from a rapidly expanding base of over 2,100 investors . As a fully decentralized ecosystem prioritizing user ownership, GeeFi is capturing widespread attention. Analysts are watching closely, predicting the upcoming Phase 3 will sell out in under 10 days amid growing rumors of imminent listings on major exchanges. Unmatched Utility in a Volatile Landscape While major cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) trade around $132.19 and face market headwinds, investors are seeking projects with stronger fundamentals and real-world utility. GeeFi provides a compelling alternative with its robust, non-custodial ecosystem. The GeeFi Wallet gives users complete sovereignty over their private keys, delivering a level of security that centralized services cannot guarantee. The feature-rich mobile app is already available on Android , with a dedicated iOS version currently in development. The GeeFi ecosystem is more than just a wallet. It integrates a powerful Decentralized Exchange (DEX) supporting over 14 networks , which allows for seamless cross-chain swaps and bridging. The forthcoming GeeFi Crypto Card is set to revolutionize daily spending by enabling global transactions through the VISA and Mastercard networks. Developed by a dedicated team since 2023 , GeeFi has built a platform centered on utility and financial freedom, setting it apart from its competitors. An Unprecedented Presale Opportunity The GeeFi presale is structured to reward early believers with exceptional returns. Currently in Phase 2 , tokens are priced at an incredibly low $0.06 . This entry point is creating a buying frenzy, especially since the confirmed listing price of $0.40 guarantees early investors a remarkable 667% return . The potential for astronomical growth is undeniable: a $1,200 investment at the current price could surge to $40,000 if the token reaches a conservative $2 valuation , delivering a 3,233% ROI . With Phase 2 already 70% sold out , having raised over $570,000 from 9.4 million tokens sold, time is running out. Rumors that the team is considering listings on major exchanges only add to the urgency. Supercharge Your Portfolio with Elite Staking Rewards GeeFi offers some of the most attractive and sustainable yields in the crypto space, creating powerful incentives for long-term holders. Investors can earn a massive 55% APR by locking their GEE tokens for 12 months. For those who prefer more flexibility, the platform also provides options for 22% APR over three months and 15% APR for a one-month lock. Even better, users who want to maintain full liquidity can still earn up to 10% APR with no lock-up period, allowing them to grow their assets while staying agile in the market. The earning potential is further enhanced by a lucrative referral program . By sharing a unique personal link, users can earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made by their referrals. This community-focused approach incentivizes organic growth and rewards early adopters for expanding the ecosystem. Seize the Chance to Invest in a 100x Gem This is the kind of ground-floor opportunity that can define a portfolio. While legacy coins struggle, GeeFi is demonstrating unstoppable momentum with a product that is already live and delivering value. Analysts are increasingly pointing to GeeFi as a potential 100x gem , citing its impressive presale performance, clear utility, and staggering ROI potential. The window to get in at this low price is closing fast. With Phase 2 selling out at a record pace and a guaranteed price increase just around the corner, the fear of missing out is warranted. Secure your GEE tokens now before this project takes off and this life-changing opportunity is gone for good.

Jason pointed out that Trump has not announced a decision yet but argued that if Trump selects Kevin, it would align with the way markets are already behaving. As you can see below, Jason shared alongside his post a Kalshi chart showing Kevin’s rising odds paired with softer future inflation pricing, fueled by the platform’s gamblers. Source : Jason Miller/X Kevin, who directs the National Economic Council, climbed fast to the front of the race in the past week. The odds on Polymarket moved from about 30% at the end of November to 73% by Friday, putting him well ahead of any other rumored candidate. Cryptopolitan had reported that Trump said during a White House event on Wednesday:- “I guess a potential Fed Chair is here too, I don’t know, are we allowed to say that? Potential. He’s a respected person, that I can tell you. Thank you, Kevin.” Bond traders respond as Hassett leads Naturally, Treasury markets reacted as Kevin’s chances went up. Since Bloomberg reported last Tuesday that he was the top contender, the 10-year yield has surged by 14 basis points as of press time, showing investors adjusting to the idea of a Fed chair who has publicly pushed for sharp rate cuts in the past. The jump in yields came even though Kevin is known for arguing for lower borrowing costs, meaning the trading floor sees the possibility of inflation returning if cuts come too fast. That view showed up in comments from Michael Brown, who serves as senior research strategist at Pepperstone. Michael said, “That’s basically because we know that Kevin Hassett is very, very loyal to President Trump. It is almost solely on the back of Hassett, given that we’ve had nothing really else to trade on this week.” His point was also mirrored in the currency market, where the U.S. Dollar Index dropped from 99 to 98 after the Bloomberg report, even though stronger Treasury yields typically support the dollar. The combination of a weaker dollar and higher yields has become part of the market’s judgment of what Kevin at the Fed could mean. It also fed into the call from Ryan Swift, the chief bond strategist at BCA Research, who wrote, “We continue to recommend Treasury curve steepeners as a high conviction trade heading into 2026,” adding that he expected long-term yields to keep climbing on the back of the current expectations. Some investors are reading Kevin’s rise as an early signal that inflation may sit above the Fed’s target for longer. Art Hogan, who works as chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, said, “I think that investors are looking at the whole picture and saying, ‘well, inflation is certainly going to be reported above the Fed’s target for quite some time.’” There is also the structural limit on how much a Fed chair can do without support. The chair holds only one vote out of twelve on the Federal Open Market Committee, which means Kevin would still need agreement from officials who lean more hawkish. Cryptopolitan predicts that convincing those members to back fast or deep rate cuts would not be guaranteed, even with Trump’s backing.

TRX is the native token of the Tron network used to govern and settle transaction fees. In retrospect, Tron (TRX) has performed better than most mega-altcoins. Over the long term, TRX is set to trend higher. Is TRX a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in three years? Let’s get into the TRX price prediction to answer these questions and more.

Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.291, whereby its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.270. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is currently hovering in the neutral region as it moves upward. The indicator’s value has increased to index 52 in the past 24 hours. The upward curve on the RSI graph reflects a balanced market setup. If the bulls persist, we can expect a further upturn in coin value. TRX/USD 4-hour chart analysis In contrast with the daily chart, the four-hour price analysis of Tron indicates a decreasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The TRX/USD price has decreased to $0.286 in the past few hours. Immediate support is also present just below the current price level at $0.285, as the recovery also started just below that point a few hours ago. Simultaneously, the increasing volatility suggests a higher chance of a price reversal. TRX/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: Tradingview The Bollinger Bands are slowly widening due to increasing volatility levels. This level of volatility signals more market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.291, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.277, securing the support. The RSI indicator has returned to the neutral region. The indicator’s score has decreased to 57 in the past four hours. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph signifies bearish presence; if the bears succeed in continuing their lead, a further downtick in the coin’s value can be expected.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022, as per crypto market data. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May, while it observed its yearly high price of $0.370 on August 14. In October, Tron started its descent and fell below $0.30 by the end of the month. At the start of December, Tron is trending below the $0.30 range, maintaining its price above $0.28, as the current Tron sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX|USDT|RESEARCH|BNB|USDD|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-07 09:00:00

After a rough start to the year, things started to look up for the price of Bitcoin in the second and third quarters, as it set multiple all-time highs across the six-month period. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has largely struggled in the final months of 2025, looking set to end the year in the red. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data and historical patterns suggest that the price of Bitcoin might be set for a fairly stronger yearly close than expected. No Negative Days Left In 2025, But 2026 Could Feature A Deep Correction On Saturday, December 6, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson took to the X platform to share what to expect from the Bitcoin price in the last days of 2025. According to the on-chain expert, the market leader is likely to close the year in a sideways price range. The relevant metric here is the Yearly Accumulated Negative Days, which tracks market resilience by measuring the number of days in a year where an asset’s daily price candlestick closed in the red. According to historical data and patterns, Bitcoin typically witnesses an average of 170 days of negative price movement in a year. This mean figure or level provides insight into the stress threshold for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. When the number of negative days is approaching or exceeds this threshold of 170 days, as Bitcoin already has in 2025, the selling pressure in the market tends to wane as fatigue sets in among the bears. Wedson revealed that the premier cryptocurrency has already accumulated 171 negative days so far in 2025. The on-chain expert noted that exceeding this threshold “strongly suggests” that the price of Bitcoin might not witness any more negative days in the final few weeks of 2025. Wedson said that if a deeper correction is imminent for the market leader, it will most likely happen in the next year. However, as the Alphractal founder highlighted, the Bitcoin price is more likely to end the year within a consolidation range. Adding further credence to this postulation is the lack of market demand, as seen with reduced capital influx into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,397, reflecting a mere 0.3% drop in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT|crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-07 09:00:16

However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the premier cryptocurrency might be readying for its next healthy upward move. BTC SOPR Drops To Lowest Level Since Early 2024 In a December 6 post on the X platform, CryptoOnchain hypothesized that a local bottom appears to be forming for the price of Bitcoin. According to the market pundit, the selling pressure, especially amongst long-term holders, seems to be fading off at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Tightens: One Break Above This Zone Could Ignite A Run To $107,000 This market observation centers on the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric, which evaluates the profitability ratio of spent outputs for both long-term and short-term holders. This on-chain indicator evaluates whether market participants are selling their assets at a profit or at a loss. Typically, when the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio has a value greater than 1, it indicates that the investors are selling at a profit. On the flip side, an SOPR value less than 1 implies that the market participants are offloading their coins while in the red. According to CryptoOnchain, the Bitcoin SOPR has now fallen to 1.35, its lowest level since early 2024. The market analyst noted that this metric’s latest movement suggests a complete reset in market profitability, especially as the price of BTC slid beneath the $90,000 mark. Furthermore, CryptoOnchain highlighted that the heavy profit-taking phase by long-term holders appears to be coming to an end, as exhaustion and fatigue increasingly spread among the bears. From a historical perspective, the SOPR metric falling to this low signals a local bottom is forming for the BTC price, especially as the market cools down. Ultimately, CryptoOnchain revealed that a price rebound at this point could set the stage for Bitcoin’s next healthy upward rally. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,500, reflecting no significant changes in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is down by nearly 2% in the last seven days.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-this-boat-has-not-yet-sailed-heres-why/,"XRP trades in a tight range with traders studying each move in a complex market structure. Many investors wait for a clear signal, and ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) has highlighted a crucial one. The current pattern aligns with the Wyckoff structure, a well-known reaccumulation model. This model guides traders when an asset pauses after a prior advance and prepares for its next phase. ChartNerd pointed to one critical point that could dictate XRP’s next trend. $XRP : This boat has not yet sailed —however, if we fail to create a double bottom in this territory and lose macro support. The first thing we look for is the 'Spring' formation in this Wyckoff reaccumulation schematic. https://t.co/BEq0pnLxku pic.twitter.com/BxBEfo3kbH — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 5, 2025 Wyckoff Structure Takes Shape The analyst posted a detailed chart that maps XRP’s price action onto a Wyckoff reaccumulation schematic . This model divides the market into phases. Each phase tracks how price reacts to support zones, resistance zones, and volume behavior. XRP now sits in a zone that matches the model’s lower boundary. ChartNerd stated that “this boat has not yet sailed,” but warned that traders need a clear reaction at current levels to maintain the structure. The chart displays phases A through E, with XRP moving at the center of the range for most of the year. Phase A captured the initial stop of the prior decline. Phase B built the core of the range as sellers and buyers tested each other. Phase C holds the most importance now because it often includes the “Spring”, a sharp dip that clears the range before a strong move higher. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Support Faces a Test XRP trades near macro support on the chart. This support defines the lower boundary of the reaccumulation range. The analyst has tracked this pattern for some time and noted that XRP must form a double bottom in this region to keep the current structure. If the price loses this level, traders then look for a Spring event. The Spring sits below the support line on the schematic. It forces price into a final shakeout before strong buyers step in. The chart he posted shows a possible drop into the Spring, followed by a quick recovery and a Test. Another prominent analyst has highlighted a similar structure and believes it will send XRP upward. A successful Test sets the stage for a move into Phase D, where the asset’s price will start showing strength. Possible Path Forward If XRP holds support or completes a Spring, the structure points to a Test followed by a move toward resistance. The chart marks this as a “Jump across the creek”, then an SOS phase with higher support levels. ChartNerd’s layout shows a possible breakout in early 2026 . XRP now sits in Phase C, where its next move defines the trend. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The Korean government is seeking to impose bank-level, no-fault compensation rules on exchanges, noting that the development was prompted by the breach. According to market watchers, the new development will also be a result of the lack of a regulatory framework in the country’s digital asset industry. With the move, crypto exchanges would be treated the same way traditional finance is treated, with the Korean government applying the same scrutiny to compliance, consumer protection standards, and the overall regulatory guidelines for the Korean crypto industry. Korean government wants to improve oversight in the crypto industry According to the reports , the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is looking into provisions that will require Korean virtual assets providers or exchanges to compensate users for losses caused by hacks or system failures. The new development is coming regardless of whether the exchange is at fault. This no-fault standard is currently applied to financial firms and electronic payments firms under the law governing financial transactions. The new development, according to the report, was propelled by the November 27 hack incident involving Upbit. The incident saw more than 104 billion Solana-based tokens, which were roughly about 44.5 billion won ($30.1 million), moved to external wallets within minutes. The scammers stole several tokens, including Bonk, Solana, Pudgy Penguins, and the Official Trump token. However, despite the breach, the exchange has faced little to no penalties. This is because regulators cannot order the exchange to compensate victims of the hack under the current law. With the new update, the FSC would have the power to make crypto exchanges liable for compensating victims, following the same obligations that financial entities face if they become victims of hacks or system failures. The move is also coming amid several system failures across the crypto sector. Lawmakers set to release updated draft regulations In data submitted by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) to lawmakers, the five major Korean crypto exchanges, Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, recorded a cumulative 20 system failures from 2023 through September 2025. The incidents affected more than 900 users, with a combined 5 billion won recorded as losses from the incidents. Upbit accounted for six of the incidents, with more than 600 victims affected in a combined 3 billion won worth of losses. The draft legislation is expected to include requirements that will strengthen security, including mandatory IT security infrastructure plans, significantly stronger penalties, and upgraded standards for systems and personnel. Lawmakers are currently looking into a revision that would allow firms to pay fines of up to 3% of their annual revenues for hacking incidents at crypto exchanges, the same standards that traditional financial institutions follow. Currently, the maximum fine for crypto exchanges is capped at 5 billion won. Meanwhile, the Upbit incident has also raised issues related to delayed reporting. According to reports, the hack was detected around 5 AM on November 27, but Upbit failed to report it to the FSS until 10:58 AM, a difference of six hours. As a result, some Korean lawmakers claimed that the exchange deliberately withheld the information until after a scheduled merger of Dunamu and Naver Financial was finalized. As a result, the FSS is looking into the breach, but reports noted that the exchange may not be sanctioned heavily. FSS Governor Lee Chan-Jin noted the seriousness of the incidents and the limits of current oversight. “The hacking is not something we can overlook. However, regulatory oversight clearly has limits in imposing penalties,” he said.

As the project enters a crucial stage in late Q4 and an increasing number of buyers start to emerge day by day, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) becomes one of the hottest top crypto opportunities that are priced below $0.05. Quick Presale Acceleration and Growing Measures Mutuum Finance opened the offering in early 2025 at $0.01. Now the price of the token is at $0.035, which is a 250% growth in the development. It has already accumulated over $19.2M in the project, surpassed 18,300 holders and sold over 810M tokens. This is at phase 6 now, and they are over 95% so that a few tokens at this stage remain. Its official launching price is $0.06 which has assisted in hastening the participation because the contrast between the two prices is even more eminent. Activity has continued at a high level because of a 24 hour leaderboard, which awards the best contributor with $500 in MUTM. The ease of using the card payment has also ensured a new user joins in fewer steps. These factors added together have driven up demand since the stage has reached an almost completion stage. The Process behind What Mutuum Finance Is Building Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending protocol that will be used to facilitate structured borrowing and lending. The platform enables the participants to provide assets such as ETH or USDC. When they do they get mtTokens. These mtTokens are valued with the borrowers paying back the interest. A buy-and-distribute model is also provided in the design of the protocol. Part of the platform revenue is purchased to acquire MUTM in the market. Bought tokens are subsequently given to the users who stake the mtTokens. This protocol brings perpetual purchasing pressure as the protocol expands. Security remains a priority. Mutuum Finance was audited by CertiK falling short to 90/100 on Token Scan and Halborn Security is auditing the contract suite. There is a $50K bug bounty reward which is offered to address any remaining code problems up to the point of testnet release. Stablecoin and Oracle Framework Mutuum Finance plans to launch a USD-backed interest-backed stablecoin. Stablecoins enable lending markets to scale in terms of predictable value and greater liquidity. They also ensure that borrowing is made more effective since users are not facing volatility in managing the collateral. Chainlink feeds will be used as the primary oracle layer in the protocol according to the official roadmap. The additional data sources and aggregated prices are utilized to avoid liquidation errors. Consistent oracles are needed in the lending systems since they dictate the valuation of collateral in case of quick market moves. These characteristics have prompted other analysts to project significant expansion to MUTM when the protocol would be activated. The initial predictions indicate that there may be a growth rate of 5x to 7x on the condition that in the near future, lending demand may grow once more after V1 and the integration of stablecoins throughout the platform. Whale Activity and Why this Moment Matters On their official X-account, Mutuum Finance promised that the launch of the V1 testnet will happen in Q4 2025. V1 encompasses the lending pool, mtTokens, the liquidation module as well as the debt system. At launch, available will be ETH and USDT. This milestone is supposed to push the project to the stage of development to active testing which usually results in new interest in the market. Phase 6 is currently accelerating due to the increased number of users attempting to get tokens prior to the timeframe ending. Recent whale purchase of over $120K served to deplete the remainance supply and increase the publicity of the project. This behavior of whales is also considered as a show of confidence as bigger investors tend to become part of it when they think that they are going to make good strides in the next milestones. As the launch price is $0.06, and increasing demand, audited contracts and a nearby testnet, Mutuum Finance is getting more mainstream as one of the potential best crypto to buy now under the $0.05 mark. With the growing interest and remaining days until 2026, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a new cryptocurrency opportunity.

Is Bittensor TAO a good investment? TAO coin continues to trade higher, indicating growing adoption among crypto investors. Despite this, the coin faces uncertainties and volatility like all other cryptocurrencies. Our Cryptopolitan price prediction explores its expected movements from 2025 to 2031. Why is TAO down?

However, Bittensor (TAO) tokens can be purchased and traded on different exchanges, including Binance, Bitget, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken.

Bittensor (TAO) historic price sentiment TAO price history by Coingecko TAO launched on March 6, 2023, at $93.4, but fell below its opening price within a week, sliding into the $76 range. By early April, it had lost half its value, dropping to $47, and continued downward to its $30.83 low in May before slowly recovering to $63 by the end of the month.

A brief rebound to $357 faded again as the token slipped back toward the mid-$200s by late summer. Momentum returned in October, pushing TAO into the $660 range before cooling to $468. It climbed once more to $679 in November but ultimately closed 2024 at $440.69. TAO opened 2025 at $439.73, peaked at $565 in January, and its price decreased to the $324 level in February.

This comprehensive crypto ecosystem concluded its first phase in less than two weeks, raising an impressive $500,000 . The momentum has only accelerated in Phase 2, which has already secured over $570,000 . Analysts are watching closely as this phase is now more than 70% sold out. Predictions suggest Phase 3 could launch as early as next week, indicating that the window for early entry is closing much faster than anticipated. Historical Trends vs. Tangible Utility Cardano is eyeing a bullish December with a massive $70M ADA treasury push and a historical setup favoring gains, though it faces stiff resistance at $0.4597 . While ADA aims for a breakout, smart investors are turning their focus to GeeFi, a platform built on concrete utility rather than historical patterns. GeeFi is designed as a complete ecosystem for the modern crypto user, anchored by the GeeFi DEX, a decentralized exchange offering secure, non-custodial trading with full user control. The platform’s utility goes beyond simple trading. GeeFi is preparing to roll out its own Crypto Cards, supported by VISA and Mastercard, bridging the gap between digital assets and real-world spending. This ecosystem is powered by the GEE token’s deflationary model, which employs systematic burns to reduce supply over time. This mechanism is engineered to increase scarcity, directly rewarding long-term holders by fostering sustained value appreciation as the platform grows. Massive Upside Potential for Early Adopters GeeFi’s presale is currently in Phase 2, offering tokens at the highly attractive price of $0.06 . This entry point provides a significant advantage, as the token is confirmed to list at $0.40 , locking in a guaranteed 667% return for presale participants. The long-term outlook is even more compelling, with analysts forecasting a potential price of $2 per token. At this valuation, a $1,600 investment today could grow to $60,000 , delivering a staggering 3,233% ROI . The speed of the presale validates these high expectations. Over 9.5 million tokens have already been sold in Phase 2, raising more than $570,000 . This intense demand has led experts to predict a swift end to the current phase, fueled further by circulating reports of upcoming listings on major exchanges. Such listings typically act as powerful catalysts for price appreciation, driving significant growth immediately following the public launch. Industry-Leading Staking and Referral Rewards Beyond capital appreciation, GeeFi offers a robust passive income structure through its versatile staking program. Accessible directly within the GeeFi Wallet, users can choose from options tailored to their strategy. A flexible staking plan offers up to 10% APR with no lock-up period. For those seeking higher yields, fixed-term options provide 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and a market-leading 55% APR for twelve months . Additionally, the platform incentivizes community growth with a referral program offering a 5% bonus on all contributions made through unique referral links. A Rare Chance to Catch the Next 100x Project Market analysts are increasingly identifying GeeFi as a potential 100x opportunity, a rarity in the current market cycle. The ongoing presale phase represents a fleeting chance to invest in a high-utility project before it reaches the broader public market. With Phase 2 selling out rapidly and a price increase scheduled for Phase 3, the opportunity to maximize returns is shrinking by the hour. Investors are moving quickly to secure their GEE tokens before the next price hike, driven by the fear of missing out on what could be the year’s breakout success.

Traders and active investors are watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) closely as inflows test the $0.035 level. This article explains why MUTM is at the center of these movements, highlighting presale momentum, product readiness, and buy-and-distribute mechanics that are expected to drive further demand. Understanding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Its Lending Models Total supply of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at 4B tokens. Combined presale funds raised are approximately $19.20 million while total holders across all phases exceed 18,400. The current presale price in Phase 6 is $0.035, with an allocation of 170M tokens — 95% of these are already sold. The next phase price is projected at $0.040, representing a 15% step. Phase 6 is nearly complete — this is the current buying window at $0.035 before the next phase price step. An investor who bought $3,000 in Phase 1 at $0.01 would hold 300,000 MUTM tokens. Today, at $0.035, this position is valued at $10.5K. At the projected listing price of $0.06, the same tokens would reach $18K. If the token reaches the $1 milestone, holdings would be valued $300,000, and at $2, $600,000. These scenarios illustrate the upside potential for early buyers in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Early entry in Phase 6 positions investors to benefit from both product adoption and upcoming price steps. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a presale-stage on-chain lending and borrowing protocol. It focuses on practical lending products designed to generate ongoing protocol activity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has confirmed via its official X handle that the V1 release of its protocol is scheduled to go live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This initial deployment will introduce the protocol’s foundational components, including the liquidity pool, the mtToken and debt token systems, along with an automated liquidator bot that safeguards collateral and maintains operational stability. During this phase, users will be able to lend, borrow, and leverage ETH or USDT as collateral. Mutuum is being built on two lending models. The first, Peer-to-Contract (P2C), pools liquidity in audited smart contracts. Lenders receive mtTokens representing their share of the pool and any yield earned. Rates adjust automatically based on pool usage. The second, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), allows direct agreements between two parties for less liquid or higher-risk tokens. Terms are negotiated individually, isolating volatility from core pools. Together, these models are expected to generate continuous activity and strengthen token demand. Utility and Platform Activity Driving Post Launch Growth Every lending, borrowing, and staking action on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates protocol revenue and demand for MUTM. mtTokens, staking rewards, and platform incentives are all tied to the token. Real product usage makes demand repeatable rather than one-off speculation. Lending markets, collateral utilization, and staking flows will drive continuous activity. Traders and early investors will find that every transaction encourages more token circulation and strengthens platform engagement. This activity reinforces MUTM’s status as a best crypto to invest for future gains. The team has planned to launch a beta near the time the token goes live. This beta will include working lending, borrowing, and staking features. Early users, liquidity providers, and content creators will test these functionalities, producing on-chain flows. Organic word-of-mouth and early adoption will naturally translate into buying interest. The beta’s timing aligns with the current presale phase, further pushing the $0.035 price level as investors anticipate real usage. This demonstrates why crypto is a good investment in tokens linked to live products. Depositors on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) receive mtTokens representing their principal plus accrued yield. mtTokens can be staked to earn MUTM rewards. A portion of platform revenue will buy MUTM from the market, which is then distributed to stakers. This creates a loop: revenue leads to market buys, rewarding stakers, encouraging more staking, and driving further platform activity. This cycle connects protocol usage directly to token demand. It ensures that as the platform grows, token inflows remain consistent. Buyers entering Phase 6 will see their actions contributing to this momentum, reinforcing why MUTM is actively sought. Community Momentum from Giveaways and Leaderboards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has built community-driven mechanisms to increase engagement. The project has over 12,000 Twitter followers. An ongoing $100K giveaway rewards ten winners with $10,000 each in MUTMs. The dashboard is live for users to track holdings and calculate ROIs. The top 50 leaderboard grants bonus MUTM to the largest investors. A daily leaderboard awards $500 MUTM to the top-ranked user performing at least one transaction, resetting at 00:00 UTC. These features create transaction volume and social traction, contributing to increased buy-side activity at the $0.035 level. Mutuum Finance’s finalized lending and borrowing contracts are now under an independent audit by Halborn Security. The team is performing a deep formal review of the code to ensure its robustness, correctness, and overall security before it goes live. Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is 95% sold, and the current price is $0.035. The next phase moves to $0.040, representing a 15% step. Early buyers will have a unique opportunity to participate before the price increase. This is the last practical moment to buy at the current price.

Market watchers are eyeing a significant price level, hinting at possible gains. Could the cryptocurrency be on the verge of a breakout towards $90? An analysis reveals which coins might be poised for growth amidst this trend. Powered by Outset PR, this analysis reflects the agency’s commitment to strategic, data-driven communication for the crypto industry. Litecoin Holds Steady Amid Market Fluctuations Source: tradingview Litecoin (LTC) prices currently range between $80 and $86. The coin is navigating a cautious path near its 10-day average of about $83. While the value has dipped around 5% over the week, its steady position above $80 suggests resilience. The nearest hurdle lies at $89, but if surpassed, LTC could aim for the $95 mark, representing a potential 10% increase from the lower end of its range. However, a dip below the $78 support might signal further decline. With an RSI below 35, LTC hints at being oversold, indicating a possible bounce.

Crypto enthusiast Skipper addressed this subject by sharing a video that outlines the core reasoning behind the current pace of adoption. The video focuses on the structural, technical, and institutional steps required for a digital asset to function at the center of global financial systems. Skipper’s post centers on these foundational elements, presenting them as the key to understanding the broader trajectory of XRP’s intended role. PART 1 THE TRUTH ABOUT XRP AND WHY BANKS AREN'T YET USING IT. THIS VIDEO EXPLAINS IT CLEARLY, AND THE HATERS WILL SURELY HATE THE FACT THAT THE #XRP LEDGER, RIPPLE, AND XRP ARE BUILT TO DOMINATE GLOBAL FINANCE. pic.twitter.com/lfYwtphLov — Skipper | XRPL (@skipper_xrp) December 5, 2025 Infrastructure as the First Phase According to the explanation provided in the video, the absence of widespread institutional settlement with XRP is not a sign of failure or hesitation. Instead, it reflects a planned sequence of development. The speaker detailed that Ripple’s initial objective was not immediate asset usage, but rather the creation of a resilient and scalable financial architecture. This stage involved building the XRP Ledger , a system engineered to support high-speed, cost-efficient, secure settlement of institutional value . The protocol was designed to move large sums globally, meeting operational demands that exceed typical retail activity. The video emphasized that institutional adoption can only begin once the foundation demonstrates consistent reliability. Establishing Trust with Key Institutions The second stage outlined in the video focused on integration. This step involved building trust with central banks, regulated financial institutions, payment companies, and other entities that influence global monetary processes. The speaker noted that these partnerships were never meant to force immediate XRP settlement. Instead, the purpose was to embed Ripple’s technology within existing financial infrastructure. By integrating the ledger and related systems directly into traditional financial rails, Ripple established a level of familiarity and operational confidence that institutions require before transitioning to new settlement standards. Why Adoption Cannot Be Instant The video also underscored that no major financial system will adopt a new protocol overnight. Large-scale institutional use depends on proven reliability, compliance, interoperability, and assurance that the technology can operate seamlessly at a global scale. The speaker explained that this is why Ripple focused first on technological refinement and institutional alignment rather than early XRP implementation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The process involves ensuring speed, efficiency, scalability, and environmental sustainability, all of which the XRP Ledger was built to address. For global institutions, these assurances are prerequisites rather than optional features. Outlook on Future Usage Skipper’s post highlights a perspective that portrays XRP’s adoption path as progressing through defined phases rather than sudden deployment. The explanation given in the video suggests that the groundwork being laid is intended to support eventual large-scale settlement once trust, infrastructure, and integration are fully aligned. Observers who monitor institutional movements often focus on short-term indicators. However, the video positions the current stage as part of a longer-term strategy where widespread usage follows the completion of foundational requirements.

The government discussed these and other aspects of the industry during a high-level meeting with senior officials from the popular crypto exchange Binance, underscoring its commitment to building transparent regulations. The high-level meeting was attended by several top figures from Binance, including its Global CEO Richard Teng. In addition, there were also attendees from high-level officials in the country, with the country using the opportunity to inform the Binance executives about their plans for the industry. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Defence Forces, Field Marshal Asim Munir, were also present in the meeting. Pakistan discusses its commitment to the crypto industry The meeting was presided over by Bilal Bin Saqib, chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA). Bin Saqib outlined the recent progress and several initiatives that the authority has been carrying out. In an official statement, the Prime Minister’s office mentioned that the government remained committed to creating a transparent and secure regulatory framework for digital assets in Pakistan. In addition, the statement touched on innovation, noting that the country is doing its best to ensure that it promotes innovation while making sure the interests of investors are safeguarded. The engagement comes as Pakistan prepares to explore the digital finance industry through the creation of its stablecoin , a detail that was shared by Bin Saqib during the Binance Blockchain Week. The country sees it as part of a wider plan to integrate digital assets into its national economy. Bin Saqib also mentioned that Pakistan is looking into the creation of its Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). He made the comments during the panel discussion on market regulation hosted by the Pakistan Crypto Council. This update comes after the unveiling of Pakistan’s first Strategic Bitcoin Reserve at Las Vegas earlier this year. The effort is expected to be led by the government, even though other details concerning the development have not been shared. Pakistan remains one of the most active crypto markets. According to the Global Crypto Adoption Index for 2025 released by Chainalysis, the country ranks third globally, ahead of global powerhouses China, Germany, and Japan. In addition, Pakistan also ranked second in retail crypto transactions, while ranking in third place in terms of activities on centralized exchanges, a metric that represents increased transaction volumes. Momentum expected to power crypto regulations Bin Saqib mentioned that Pakistan plans to channel this momentum through a structured regulatory environment. “Pakistan is the world’s third-largest crypto market without any regulatory framework,” he said at Binance Blockchain Week Dubai. “Now we want to turn this momentum into a global case study.” However, he cautioned that the rankings measured crypto transaction volume, noting that it doesn’t specifically look into the number of people holding digital assets. According to estimates, there are about 20 to 40 million Pakistanis who hold crypto, although Bin Saqib believes that the number remains relatively unknown due to a lack of independent nationwide studies. Pakistan is now at a critical point, growing the crypto market that appeals to its youth population. The country is also working on regulations while adoption continues to rise, a mix that might look to benefit them in the long run. However, users are warned about the proliferation of scams in the industry and are urged to be careful. Experts also noted that aside from scams, risks rising from volatility and limited public awareness about digital assets may also provide enough challenge to early adopters. Bin Saqib noted that Pakistan has a high-growth future in the crypto market, noting that it will rely on how it balances regulation, protects investors, and ensures the long-term stability of the market.

Source: Bloomberg More than 100 publicly traded companies transformed themselves into cryptocurrency-holding vehicles in the first half of 2025, borrowing billions to buy digital tokens while their stock prices initially soared past the value of the underlying assets they purchased. The strategy seemed unstoppable until market reality delivered a harsh correction. Strategy’s Model Spawns Industry-Wide Collapse Strategy Inc.’s Michael Saylor pioneered the approach of converting corporate cash into Bitcoin holdings, transforming his software company into a publicly traded cryptocurrency treasury. The model worked spectacularly through the mid-2025, attracting high-profile investors, including the Trump family . SharpLink Gaming epitomized the frenzy. The company pivoted from traditional gaming operations , appointed an Ethereum co-founder as chairman, and announced massive token purchases. Sharplink Gaming added $80M in Ether to its reserves, lifting total holdings to $3.6B and cementing its spot as the second-largest corporate holder of ETH. #Sharplink #Ether https://t.co/ADz76OeiCn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 27, 2025 Its stock exploded 2,600% within days before crashing 86% from peak levels, leaving total market capitalization below the value of its Ethereum holdings at just 0.9 times crypto reserves. Bloomberg data tracking 138 U.S. and Canadian digital asset treasuries shows the median share price has fallen 43% year-to-date, dramatically underperforming Bitcoin’s modest 7% decline. In comparison, the S&P 500 gained 6% and the Nasdaq 100 rose 10%. Strategy shares have dropped 60% from their July highs, even as they have risen by more than 1,200% since the company began buying Bitcoin in August 2020. Source: Bloomberg “ Investors took a look and understood that there’s not much yield from these holdings rather than just sitting on this pile of money, ” B. Riley Securities analyst Fedor Shabalin told Bloomberg. Debt Obligations Expose Structural Flaws The fundamental problem plaguing these companies stems from how they fund cryptocurrency purchases. Strategy and its imitators issued massive amounts of convertible bonds and preferred shares, raising over $45 billion across the industry to acquire digital tokens that generate no cash flow. These debt instruments carry substantial interest and dividend obligations that cryptocurrency holdings cannot service, creating a structural mismatch between liabilities that require regular payments and assets that produce zero income. Strategy faces annual fixed obligations of approximately $750 million to $800 million tied to preferred shares. Companies that avoided Bitcoin for smaller, more volatile cryptocurrencies suffered the steepest losses. Alt5 Sigma, backed by two Trump sons and planning to purchase over $1 billion in World Liberty Financial’s WLFI token, has crashed more than 85% from its June peak. Strategy attempted to address funding concerns by raising $1.44 billion in dollar reserves through stock sales , covering 21 months of dividend payments. Saylor Admits Potential Bitcoin Sales The industry now faces its defining moment. Strategy CEO Phong Le acknowledged the company would sell Bitcoin if needed to fund dividend payments, specifically if the firm’s market value falls below its cryptocurrency holdings. Those comments sent shockwaves through the digital asset treasury sector, given Saylor’s repeated insistence that Strategy would never sell, famously joking in February to “ sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin. “ At December’s Binance Blockchain Week, Saylor outlined the revised approach, stating that “ when our equity is trading above the net asset value of the Bitcoin, we just sell the equity, ” but “ when the equity’s trading below the value of the Bitcoin, we would either sell Bitcoin derivatives, or we would just sell the Bitcoin. “ The reversal raises fears of a downward spiral where forced crypto sales push token prices lower, further pressuring treasury company valuations and potentially triggering additional selling. Strategy’s monthly Bitcoin accumulation has collapsed from 134,000 BTC at the 2024 peak to just 9,100 BTC in November, with only 135 BTC added so far in December. The company now holds approximately 650,000 BTC , valued at over $56 billion, representing more than 3% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply. Market participants worry that leveraged traders using borrowed money to invest in these companies could face margin calls, forcing broader market selloffs. Strategy has created a $1.4 billion reserve fund to cover near-term dividend payments, but shares remain on track for a 38% decline this year despite the company’s massive Bitcoin holdings.

Key Takeaways: The euro stablecoin market has doubled since MiCA’s rollout, reaching roughly $680 million in market cap. Growth is concentrated in major issuers like EURS, EURC and EURCV, with transaction volumes surging nearly ninefold. Public interest is rising across the EU, signaling growing adoption. According to Decta’s Euro Stablecoin Trends Report 2025 , the sector’s market capitalization has surged from last year’s slump, reversing a 48% contraction and outpacing the broader stablecoin market’s 26% growth rate. Euro Stablecoins Hit $680M After MiCA Decta’s report says euro-denominated stablecoins climbed to roughly $500 million by May 2025 following MiCA’s June 2024 rollout, a shift credited to clearer issuer obligations and standardized reserve rules. Today, the market sits at around $680 million, per CoinGecko. However, the market is still tiny compared with the nearly $300 billion locked in US dollar-backed tokens, a space dominated by USDT and USDC. Much of the growth came from a handful of standout issuers. Stasis’ EURS posted the strongest expansion, soaring 644% to $283.9 million as of October 2025. Circle’s EURC and Societe Generale’s EURCV also saw meaningful increases as regulated issuers began to capitalize on MiCA’s clarity around custody, reserves and public disclosures. Activity on-chain grew alongside market cap. Monthly transaction volume for euro stablecoins jumped nearly ninefold to $3.83 billion after MiCA implementation, the report found. JUST IN: Ten European banks are building a euro stablecoin under Dutch Central Bank oversight. They’re targeting regulatory approval in late 2026 pic.twitter.com/8zZv4d8Q5t — Futures (@FuturesDotNYC) December 3, 2025 EURC and EURCV led the surge, with volumes climbing 1,139% and 343%, supported by greater use in cross-border payments, fiat on-ramps and crypto trading pairs, areas previously dominated by dollar stablecoins. The regulatory shift also appears to be stimulating public interest. Decta recorded sharp spikes in search activity across EU markets, including a 400% jump in Finland and more than tripling in Italy. Interest rose across smaller economies as well, suggesting broader consumer awareness as euro-denominated tokens begin carving out a clearer role in Europe’s digital-asset landscape. Poland Remains Last EU State Without MiCA Rules As reported, Poland’s push to bring its crypto sector in line with the EU’s MiCA framework collapsed after lawmakers failed to overturn President Karol Nawrocki’s veto of a major digital-asset bill. The vote fell short of the required three-fifths majority, leaving Poland as the only EU member without a national MiCA-style regulatory regime and forcing the government to restart the legislative process. Prime Minister Donald Tusk had argued that the bill was necessary for national security, warning that unregulated crypto activity had become a channel for money laundering and foreign interference, including covert financing linked to Russia and Belarus. Authorities have connected these concerns to several recent security incidents, including alleged sabotage plots in Poland reportedly funded through cryptocurrencies. The veto has intensified political tensions between Nawrocki and Tusk’s pro-EU coalition. The president rejected the bill on grounds that it overreached EU requirements and posed risks to civil liberties and property rights.

Source: TradingView The downturn has been attributed to several factors, including broad weakness across the cryptocurrency market as investors shift away from risk assets amid renewed macroeconomic uncertainty. Heavy profit-taking by large XRP holders after the ETF launch added additional selling pressure, quickly outweighing early inflows. Notably, the ETF’s creation structure also slowed the translation of new investment into spot XRP purchases, delaying price support and creating a gap between expectations and market reality. To this end, the reaction mirrors past “sell-the-news” patterns seen with other crypto ETF launches, though some analysts believe institutional inflows could stabilize the fund if broader conditions improve. XRP price analysis XRPC’s performance has closely tracked XRP itself, which has experienced significant volatility in recent sessions. The token is struggling to hold the $2 support zone and, as of press time, was trading at $2.03 after plunging more than 7% over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart.

Indicators suggest that the cryptocurrency might be on the brink of a rebound. With technical metrics pointing to an oversold condition, traders are keeping a close eye on potential short-term gains. This article explores the factors behind this movement and highlights coins poised for growth. Traders study resistance and support zones to anticipate the next move, just as Outset PR monitors performance metrics of media outlets to align campaigns with market momentum. By tracking these shifts, Outset PR ensures that its stories fit the moment — much like investors searching for the assets that can break out in a cautious market. Solana Price Hints at Rebound with Potential Gains Ahead Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) hovers in a price range between roughly $126 and $143. The coin is currently under pressure, showing a 2.78% dip over a week, and nearly 12% down over a month. Despite this, the simple moving averages indicate some stability around $137. If Solana manages to break through the resistance at about $152, it could aim for a 20% rise to reach the next level near $168. However, it currently struggles with a low Relative Strength Index of 38.10 and weak momentum as indicated by a MACD of -1.2155. This suggests that while there's potential for growth, SOL needs more buyer interest to start climbing again. How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Conclusion SOL's RSI has entered oversold territory. This suggests that the coin may be due for a short-term rebound. Investors could see a possible price correction in the near future. Long-term trends remain uncertain, but short-term traders might find opportunities for gains. Monitoring market conditions and trading volume will be crucial to capitalize on any potential bounce.

According to The Korea Times , the Financial Services Commission is reviewing provisions that would require crypto exchanges to compensate users for losses caused by hacking or system failures, regardless of fault, mirroring rules currently applied only to banks and electronic payment firms under the country’s electronic financial transactions law. The push follows a Nov. 27 breach at Upbit that saw over 104 billion Solana -based tokens worth 44.5 billion won ($36M) transferred to external wallets in just 54 minutes. Despite the incident, the exchange faced minimal penalties since regulators cannot order compensation under existing laws. South Korea’s largest crypto exchange Upbit @Official_Upbit reported a $36m Solana network hack on Thursday, halting withdrawals on the spot and pledging to fully reimburse affected customers. The incident comes on the same date as its 2019 breach l… https://t.co/o0VLiqKin7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 27, 2025 Mounting System Failures Drive Regulatory Overhaul The planned reforms come amid a pattern of platform instability across Korea’s crypto sector. Financial Supervisory Service data shows the five major exchanges, Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, recorded 20 system failures between 2023 and September this year, affecting over 900 users with combined losses of 5 billion won. Upbit alone accounted for six incidents, with more than 600 victims suffering 3 billion won in damages. Draft legislation is expected to mandate IT security infrastructure plans, upgraded system standards, and significantly stronger penalties. Lawmakers are considering revisions that would allow fines of up to 3 percent of annual revenue for hacking incidents, matching standards for traditional financial institutions and replacing the current 5 billion won cap. The shift would fundamentally reshape accountability in Korea’s crypto industry by making exchanges liable to compensate victims, as banks must respond to security breaches or system failures. The Upbit breach also exposed reporting failures, with the exchange waiting over six hours after detecting the hack at 5 a.m. to notify regulators at 10:58 a.m. Ruling party lawmakers alleged that Dunamu deliberately delayed disclosure until after its scheduled merger with Naver Financial , which concluded at 10:50 a.m. Broader Compliance Crackdown Intensifies Across Industry The regulatory tightening extends beyond security requirements into comprehensive anti-money laundering enforcement. Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit is preparing sanctions against major exchanges following on-site inspections that examined compliance with Know Your Customer checks and suspicious transaction reporting. The unit has already disciplined Dunamu with a three-month suspension on new customer activity and a 35.2 billion won fine, setting a precedent for penalties expected to reach hundreds of billions of won across the sector. Authorities are simultaneously expanding the crypto travel rule to apply to transactions under 1 million won , closing a loophole that allowed users to evade identity checks by splitting transfers into smaller amounts. “ We will crack down on crypto money laundering, expanding the Travel Rule to transactions under 1 million won, ” Financial Services Commission Chairman Lee Eok-won said during a National Assembly briefing. The Financial Intelligence Unit will gain pre-emptive account-freezing powers in serious cases, while new rules will bar individuals with convictions for tax crimes or drug offenses from becoming major shareholders in licensed platforms. Legislative amendments are expected in the first half of 2026 as Korea aligns with global standards through expanded coordination with the Financial Action Task Force. South Korean crypto tax may face a fourth delay to 2027 as proposed amendments fail to address framework issues. #CryptoTax #SouthKorea https://t.co/L0vuIlvbSu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 18, 2025 The enforcement drive unfolds as Korea’s long-delayed crypto tax regime faces potential postponement beyond its January 2027 start date due to persistent infrastructure gaps, with no significant updates to the framework despite multiple deferrals since its 2020 approval. Recently, lawmakers also set a December 10 deadline for the government to deliver a stablecoin regulatory framework , or face legislative action, with debates centering on whether banks should lead issuance or whether fintech firms should participate more actively. Financial Supervisory Service Gov. Lee Chan-jin acknowledged the limits of current oversight despite the seriousness of the Upbit incident, stating that “ regulatory oversight clearly has limits in imposing penalties ” under existing law. However, with the planned reforms, it aims to close these gaps as Korea positions itself to compete with major economies that have already formalized comprehensive digital asset frameworks.

Outset PR shows how blockchain brands can build authority by shaping how AI systems describe them. AI systems have changed how people discover information. When users ask ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude for advice about crypto projects, the answers often come from models rather than from traditional search results. For blockchain brands, visibility inside these AI-generated summaries has become a new form of authority. To appear in that space, companies need more than media mentions or backlinks. They need LLM visibility — a clear presence in the data that language models learn from. Why AI Visibility Defines Modern PR Public relations once revolved around securing articles and coverage in media outlets. Today, models summarize those same outlets and present synthesized knowledge directly to users. When a person searches for “top crypto PR agencies” or “token presales”, the model’s answer often shapes their first impression. Being part of that context gives a brand two advantages: It becomes a reference point for the concept it represents. Its definitions and insights get repeated automatically as models generate new answers. For blockchain projects where reputation and precision matter, this is a measurable form of digital influence. How LLMs Choose What to Cite Large language models organize information around clarity and consistency. They rely on three main signals: Identity consistency – whether all public descriptions of a brand align Conceptual structure – whether content defines something clearly and factually Source authority – whether other reputable sources reference the same material Content that fits these patterns becomes reference material inside AI systems. It doesn’t need to be promotional. It needs to be definable, structured, and widely repeated. The Outset PR Case: Building LLM Visibility from the Ground Up To enhance its LLMs visibility , Outset PR has restructured every public channel — website, social media, listings, and review pages — around a unified message: data-driven crypto PR with a human touch. This alignment produced a coherent digital identity. AI systems began treating Outset PR as a single, distinct entity rather than a cluster of unrelated mentions.By explaining its methods and metrics in a structured way, the agency provided models with the detailed interpretation of data-driven PR in crypto. The agency’s materials appeared in Google and Gemini results for this term, and its language shaped how AI systems described the niche. This created a structural advantage: when users asked about data-driven PR, the models used the agency’s own frameworks to explain it. Scaling Through LLM Seeding Once the concept was established, Outset PR expanded its presence through seeding. Using its in-house Syndication Map , the agency has identified which content types LLMs absorb most effectively: Educational explainersGuides that describe how founders can manage communication challenges with data-backed PR methods. Industry lists and roundupsOutset PR contributed agency descriptions for curated “top” and “best” lists. Such lists often appear in AI-generated summaries because they define categories through concise descriptors. Original data Outset Data Pulse reports delivered exclusive insights about blockchain communications. Proprietary datasets create unique language patterns that models reuse when forming summaries. Together, these elements increased the frequency and accuracy of Outset PR’s appearance in AI-generated content. How Outset PR Supports LLM Visibility for Web3 Brands Outset PR now applies this framework to help Web3 companies shape how AI models represent them. It is launching PR for LLM Discovery, a service that helps brands secure presence inside AI-generated search results.This way, Outset PR moves traditional public relations into the new reality of AI-powered discovery, where visibility depends on both media credibility and algorithmic recognition. This approach combines verified coverage, contextual messaging, and technical discoverability. It ensures that when someone asks an AI system about your project, the answer includes your voice and your data. It involves building semantic consistency that helps LLMs anchor your brand to its category and distributing verified content through authoritative, AI-indexed sources. This service bridges PR and AI optimization, enabling blockchain and Web3 companies to move from competing for clicks to earning visibility through algorithmic understanding. Blockchain PR Adapts for New AI Reality LLM visibility extends public relations into a new dimension. It transforms a brand’s story into machine-readable knowledge that circulates through the information systems people already rely on. Outset PR has demonstrated how this process works. Its experience with data-driven crypto PR sets a clear example for blockchain projects seeking durable presence across AI platforms. AI visibility defines reputation in the new information landscape. Brands that treat language models as discovery engines will lead the next era of digital communications, and Outset PR can help them build that foundation.

Key Takeaways: ETH exchange balances have dropped to a record low of 8.7%, a 43% decline since July. Staking, L2 activity, DATs, and long-term custody are tightening liquid supply. Analysts see hidden buying strength, hinting at potential upward momentum. According to Glassnode , exchange balances dropped to 8.7% of total ETH supply last Thursday, the smallest share recorded since Ethereum’s launch in 2015. Levels remained near that low at 8.8% on Sunday. ETH Exchange Balances Plunge 43% as Supply Tightens to Record Levels The sharp decline represents a 43% drop in ETH exchange balances since early July, coinciding with the acceleration of digital asset treasury (DAT) purchases and growing activity across the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Macro research outlet Milk Road said ETH is “quietly entering its tightest supply environment ever,” noting that Bitcoin’s exchange balance remains significantly higher at 14.7%. Analysts attributed the shift to structural changes in how ETH is being used. More tokens are flowing into staking, restaking protocols, layer-2 networks, DAT balance sheets, collateralized DeFi positions, and long-term self-custody, destinations that historically do not circulate supply back onto exchanges. “Sentiment feels heavy right now, but sentiment doesn’t dictate supply,” Milk Road wrote. “When that gap closes, price follows.” Beyond supply metrics, market technicians are spotting signals that buyers may be gaining control. Analyst Sykodelic highlighted an On-Balance Volume (OBV) breakout above resistance late last week, even as price failed to follow. $ETH is quietly entering its tightest supply environment ever. Exchange balances just fell to 8.84% of total supply, a level we’ve never seen before. For context, $BTC is still sitting near 14.8%.

They added that overall price action “looks bullish,” suggesting ETH may revisit higher levels before any meaningful retracement. ETH Holds $3,000 as Momentum Builds Ether has held above the $3,000 mark for nearly a week but continues to face resistance near $3,200. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has consolidated around $3,050, mirroring the broader market’s indecision. The ETH/BTC pair also drew attention last week after breaking above a long-standing downtrend, a move some traders see as an early sign of capital rotating back into Ethereum. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies, already the largest corporate holder of Ether, has continued aggressively buying the dip even as top traders position for further declines. The firm purchased another $199 million in ETH over the past two days, adding to its rapidly expanding reserves. BitMine now controls $11.3 billion worth of Ether, roughly 3.08% of the total supply, and is closing in on its long-stated goal of reaching 5%. Last month, Tom Lee said Ether may be entering the early stages of the type of explosive growth cycle that propelled Bitcoin to a 100x rally since 2017. Lee said the current Ether market resembles Bitcoin’s setup eight years ago, a period marked by deep volatility that ultimately preceded one of the strongest bull cycles in crypto history.

Among the assets repeatedly appearing at the top of these models are Ozak AI, Bitcoin, and XRP — three projects positioned uniquely within their own narratives. Bitcoin remains the macro driver of the entire industry, XRP is gaining increased momentum from institutional and cross-border payment sectors, and Ozak AI stands out as the early-stage AI-native contender with the steepest projected growth curve. With interest surging around the Ozak AI Presale, analysts believe this trio could shape the core of the next major bull cycle. Bitcoin Builds Toward Its Next Macro Expansion Bitcoin, currently trading near $92,754, continues to display a strong long-term structure supported by deep liquidity and institutional interest. Its critical support zones at $91,200, $89,650, and $87,900 remain heavily defended, showing consistent accumulation from long-term holders and ETF-driven demand. For BTC to begin its next major leg upward, it must break through resistance at the $94,880, $97,200, and $99,500, levels that historically lead to high-volatility moves. As the leading store of value asset in the crypto market, Bitcoin is still expected to set fresh highs into 2026 — though large-cap dynamics mean its growth will be strong but not exponential. That’s where early-stage projects like Ozak AI begin to outshine traditional leaders. XRP Gains New Momentum as Adoption Strengthens XRP, trading around $2.17, continues to re-establish itself after years of regulatory pressure, with institutional demand steadily recovering. It maintains important support at $2.05, $1.96, and $1.88, areas where traders and long-term holders are accumulating ahead of expected network expansion. To accelerate higher, XRP must clear resistance at $2.31, $2.48, and $2.66, thresholds historically tied to major upside continuation. Analysts predict that increasing integrations with financial institutions, improved clarity around XRP’s legal environment, and expanding utility for global settlements could drive new capital into the asset heading into 2026. Still, XRP’s market size creates natural limitations on how far it can multiply compared to small-cap innovators. Ozak AI Takes Center Stage While Bitcoin and XRP both show strong structures for long-term growth, Ozak AI is consistently projected as the altcoin with the highest potential ROI heading into 2026. The project introduces a next-generation AI intelligence layer for Web3, integrating millisecond-speed prediction engines, cross-chain analytics modules, and ultra-fast 30 ms signal systems through its partnership with HIVE. SINT’s autonomous AI agents further elevate its utility by enabling automated strategies, voice command execution, data interpretation, and seamless multi-chain automation. The accelerating Ozak AI Presale , which has surpassed $4.8 million raised with more than one million tokens sold, is a major factor driving bullish predictions. Early adoption at this scale mirrors the initial phases of previous cycle-leading tokens that later delivered 50x–100x returns. With additional partnerships spanning Perceptron Network’s 700K+ node ecosystem and HIVE’s high-speed market infrastructure, Ozak AI enters the market with powerful fundamentals that have analysts placing it at the forefront of the 2025–26 AI narrative. Bitcoin remains the market’s foundation, XRP is regaining institutional momentum, and Ozak AI stands out as the most explosive growth candidate of the next cycle. Together, these three assets form a high-conviction lineup for investors preparing for what could become one of crypto’s most powerful bull markets to date. Bitcoin may lead the narrative. XRP may lead financial adoption. But Ozak AI is increasingly projected to lead ROI.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s “liveliness” metric is rising despite stagnant prices, signaling renewed underlying demand. Analysts say dormant coins are moving at unprecedented scale, suggesting a major capital rotation. The indicator’s breakout from a years-long range hints the current bull cycle may not be finished. Technical analyst TXMC said on Sunday that liveliness has been “marching higher despite lower prices,” a divergence that suggests steady underlying demand for spot Bitcoin even as market sentiment remains subdued. Bitcoin’s Rising “Liveliness” Metric Points to Renewed Bull-Market Demand The metric, described as an “elegant” long-term gauge of chain activity, measures the ratio of coins being transacted relative to those being held, weighted by their age. It increases when older coins are spent more frequently, and falls when long-term holders accumulate. “Liveliness usually rises in bull runs as supply changes hands at higher prices, indicating a flow of newly invested capital,” TXMC explained, noting that the latest upward trend contradicts the muted price action seen in recent weeks. Glassnode data shows liveliness pushing into a new peak range, breaking out of the corridor it remained stuck in from the 2017 all-time-high through earlier cycles. Analyst James Check said the current spike in liveliness reflects an unprecedented reactivation of dormant Bitcoin supply, surpassing patterns seen during the 2017 bull run, the first cycle characterized by “widespread participation” and a dramatic parabolic surge. Liveliness has been range bound since the 2017 peak, up until now. The 2017 Bull was special in that it was the first epic parabola with widespread participation, but was also when many old coins transacted to capture the BCH dividend. New Liveliness ATHs shows how extreme the… https://t.co/aoVFr2jOsR — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) December 6, 2025 This time, however, the scale is far larger. While 2017 typically saw transfers measured in the thousands of dollars, Check noted that today’s on-chain value flows often reach into the billions, signaling one of the largest capital rotations Bitcoin has experienced. “We have seen an extraordinary volume of coin days destroyed,” Check said. “I am of the view we have just watched one of the greatest capital rotations and changing of the guard in Bitcoin history.” BTC Price Stalls, Analysts Eye Breakout Levels Bitcoin’s price action remains subdued despite the on-chain strength. BTC briefly dipped below $89,000 early Sunday before recovering to around $89,500, largely unchanged over 24 hours. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe said the market is stuck in a consolidation band: “Anything between $86,000 and $92,000 is pretty much noise.” Anything between $86-92K is pretty much noise. Not much will happen for $BTC . If $92K gets tested, I think we'll break it, but if not, brace yourself for a test at the low $80K range for some sort of double-bottom pattern. Again, I don't think we're far off bottoming for… pic.twitter.com/6acTFBAZk4 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 6, 2025 He added that a test of $92,000 could lead to a breakout, while failure could push BTC toward the low $80,000s for a potential double-bottom formation. “I don’t think we’re far off bottoming for Bitcoin,” van de Poppe said, predicting a stronger rally heading into late Q4 and early Q1. Last week, Bitfinex said the market is showing “seller exhaustion” following a period of heavy deleveraging and panic-driven exits by short-term holders. “The combination of extreme deleveraging, capitulation among short-term holders, and early signs of seller exhaustion has created the conditions for a stabilisation phase and a relief bounce,” the firm wrote.

Analysts Say “There’s a Preparation Going On”,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/which-way-will-the-wind-blow-for-bitcoin-analysts-say-theres-a-preparation-going-on/,"The recent volatility seen in the Bitcoin options market suggests that investors are starting to believe that BTC will remain trapped within its current narrow price range. Options traders have become more cautious, even defensive, after a sharp decline in the fourth quarter that wiped more than $1 trillion of value from the digital asset market. Over the weekend, the price of Bitcoin fell as much as 4.4% to $88,135, falling below the midpoint of the $100,000-$80,000 channel it has held for the past three weeks. This reflects the weakening of risk appetite in the broader cryptocurrency market, which accounts for approximately 60% of cryptocurrency market capitalization. According to Coinbase's Deribit data, open interest in options futures at the end of December is significantly outpacing long-term contracts. This is primarily due to investors selling options to generate premium income in anticipation of low near-term volatility. “There's a clear near-term band trading trend in Bitcoin options, with volatility being sold and both the upper and lower wings fading,” said Wintermute strategist Jasper De Maere. However, the continued strong demand for long-term options suggests that “while stability is expected in the short term, the door is open for larger movements in the future,” De Maere said. Related News: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Explains What the Cryptocurrency Market “Needs Right Now” and Names a Project Bitcoin, which hit a record high above $126,000, has been depressed sharply over the past two months by forced liquidations and a collapse in retail interest. This has impacted not only prices but also institutional investor behavior. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust fund is recording its longest weekly outflow streak since its launch in January 2024. More than $2.7 billion in outflows were recorded in the five weeks leading up to November 28th, with an additional $113 million in outflows on Thursday alone, marking the fund’s sixth week of net negative inflows. This chart suggests that even as prices remain stable, institutional demand remains pent-up. Bitcoin's year-over-year lag behind the S&P 500 marks a rupture almost unprecedented in the last decade. While Trump's re-election is expected to usher in a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto, the market has yet to price in this momentum. The volatile nature of the sector has given rise to terms like “crypto winter”; the last major crypto winter lasted from late 2021 to 2023, with Bitcoin losing more than 70% of its value from peak to trough. The traditional correlation between stocks and Bitcoin has also weakened this year. Low interest rates had propelled both markets upward during the pandemic, but this correlation has been severely disrupted as we enter 2025. The futures picture is similarly bleak. Bitcoin futures funding rates have turned negative, suggesting that bearish positions are being forced to pay off long investors. Coinglass data confirms the market's short-term bearish bias. Pressure continues on the altcoin front. Investors are becoming more defensive in ETH options, with downside hedging interest remaining consistently strong, while the upside is only selectively demanded. *This is not investment advice.

In the case registered with the Indian police, the scammers introduced the man to a fake crypto trading platform, luring him from WhatsApp before eventually introducing him to their bogus application. According to the Indian police, the victim was a former employee in the public sector. He claimed that he was added to a WhatsApp group titled 531 DBS Stock Profit Growth Wealth Group. The victim claimed that the group administrator introduced himself as Professor Rajat Verma. He addressed them alongside an analyst who claimed to be Meena Bhatt. After the introductions, the criminals convinced the suspects to download the mobile application. Indian engineer loses $130k to scammers The victim claimed that the members of the group were directed to go to a domain named www(dot)ggtkss(dot)cc to download the application. He noted that the administrator claimed that once they downloaded the app, they would be able to gain access to block deals and high-value IPO allotments unavailable to regular investors. The Indian police claimed the victim deposited Rs. 1 lakh and was allowed to withdraw Rs. 5,000 to gain his trust. According to the police statement, over the next few weeks, between November and early December, he was persuaded to deposit higher funds. Heeding their counsel, he put larger sums to subscribe to the Capital Small Finance Bank IPO and to cover a share buyback. During the period, the police claimed that the victim made deposits of about Rs. 1.2 crore through several bank accounts and UPI. However, issues started when he tried to withdraw some of his balance. The scammers claimed he would have to pay a 20% commission before he was allowed to make any withdrawals. When they discovered that he was not ready to pay, they froze his account. Realizing he had been scammed, the Indian engineer approached the police station, reporting the crime to the Cyberabad cybercrime police. The police subsequently registered his complaint and kick-started investigations. Police warn residents amid rise in crypto-related crimes Crypto-related crimes in India have been on the rise since the start of the year, with the police proactively working to curb the menace. In a similar issue, the Indian police claimed that an artificial intelligence scientist was scammed in a crypto investment scam that was introduced to him on a matrimony website. He claimed that he started chatting with a woman he met on the website, who subsequently introduced him to a platform where he could make money off investments. Over the next three months, the victim claimed he transferred USDT across 14 transactions to the platform. Investigators attached to the Indian police claimed that some of the transactions were made to an account registered under Shankar Sahu, while more than Rs. 13 lakh were routed through an entity called RR Physiotherapy. Indian police say the remaining amount was converted into different digital assets and moved to wallets in the United Kingdom and Malaysia. Meanwhile, the Indian police have urged the wider population to be alert and watch out for signs that point to an investment being a scam. They warned that scams are presently at an all-time high in the country, a development that has become rampant during the run to the festive periods. They urged residents to seek advice from experienced and trustworthy financial experts if they want to make investments. They also urged them to report swiftly once they feel that they have become victims of a scam.

Most recently, market analyst Darkfost has observed a significant crash in Bitcoin spot trading volume, while highlighting potential long-term implications of such an event. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin Volatility Sparks Fresh Attention On MicroStrategy Binance Records $40B Loss In BTC Monthly Spot Trading The spot trading volume refers to the total amount of Bitcoin that is bought and sold for immediate delivery on exchanges within a specific time period. It is a key market indicator used to gauge participation, liquidity, and investor interest. According to Darkfost in an X post on December 6, the Bitcoin market, in November, experienced a major fall in spot trading volume across major crypto exchanges. This development has been attributed to the asset’s price struggles, wherein it recorded a 17.5% devaluation during this period. On Binance, which accounts for more than half of all Bitcoin spot trading activity, spot volume fell from $198 billion in October to $156 billion in November, representing a 21% decline. The downturn was mirrored across other major exchanges, with ByBit posting a 13.5% drop, Gate.io sliding 33%, and OKX down 18%. Interestingly, Darkfost explains that Bitcoin’s recent price action, the major negative catalyst, pales in comparison to previous corrections. However, another red reading in December could initiate a market deterioration marked by conditions such as continued selling pressure, low market confidence, and, importantly, further drops in spot activity. A continuous decline in spot trading volume primarily mirrors a lack of market interest and is accompanied by other concerning factors, such as a weaker demand, high vulnerability to price swings, and limited support for rallies as investors prefer to sit on the sidelines. This dynamic, in turn, weighs on price growth, creating a self-reinforcing bearish loop. Related Reading: The $13.5 Billion Liquidity Injection That Could Send Bitcoin And Crypto Prices Flying Spot Trading Volume Peak Sees Consistent Regression In related news, Darkfost also reports that the present market cycle has featured a consistent decline in spot trading volume peaks. Notably, the chart above shows a market high of $333.57 billion on Binance in March 2024, followed by the lower peak of $246.04 billion in November 2024, and then just $198.6 billion last October. This trend becomes even more concerning when looking at the spot-to-futures volume ratio, which currently sits at 0.23, meaning futures activity now accounts for more than 75% of overall trading. In essence, while the Bitcoin market remains active, investor enthusiasm on the spot side is fading. By contrast, traders appear increasingly willing to speculate in the futures market, likely driven by elevated uncertainty and short-term volatility. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $89,300, reflecting a 0.21% loss in the past day.

His commentary underscores a policy move that, in his view, may influence liquidity conditions across global markets. Rietveld’s Warning on Japan’s Monetary Stance In his video, Rietveld focused on Japan’s indication that it is preparing to begin quantitative tightening. He explained that such a shift would involve the country reducing liquidity by withdrawing funds from the markets. According to him, similar policy transitions in the past, both in Japan and in other leading economies, have often been followed by noticeable market reactions. Rietveld pointed out that these precedents provide context for understanding current market pressures, suggesting that price declines across assets may align with this anticipated tightening phase.

He stated that investors questioning the recent downward movement should consider the timeline of Japan’s announcement and its implications. He noted that major holders across various cryptocurrencies appear to be reducing exposure ahead of potential liquidity constraints. The suggestion is that these investors are positioning themselves ahead of what they believe will be reduced availability of capital in global markets once tightening begins. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Behavior and Anticipatory Selling Rietveld emphasized that this behavior from larger market participants illustrates a forward-looking approach to monetary shifts. He described how significant portfolios are being adjusted in advance of the policy change, with selling activity increasing across several high-capitalization crypto assets. He described this development as a reaction to historical patterns in which similar tightening cycles resulted in immediate market effects, reinforcing his view that the current downturn corresponds with expectations surrounding Japan’s next policy steps. Rietveld’s analysis centres on the argument that Japan’s likely transition into quantitative tightening may be a primary driver of the pressure observed across the crypto market. By drawing on historical comparisons and focusing on the actions of major investors, he presents a view that the current environment reflects preparations for reduced global liquidity. His comments highlight how macroeconomic policy shifts can influence digital asset performance, particularly when large holders react in advance of anticipated changes.

By 2028, ADAUSD could reach $1.45. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $4.54. Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.4164 Market Cap $14.94B Trading Volume (24-hour) $356.93 Circulating Supply 44.99B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.4208 24-hour Low $0.4116 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 13.25% (Very High) 50-day SMA $ 0.5317 14-Day RSI 39.80 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 20( Extreme Fear) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 200-day SMA $ 0.7257 Cardano (ADA) price analysis Cardano bounced from the 0.40 support level, with buyers stepping in at oversold conditions Price is trying to reclaim the mid-range but remains capped under resistance around 0.45 to 0.47 Momentum is improving, but ADA needs a strong close above 0.45 to confirm a sustained move higher Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: Cardano struggles below $0.43 as downtrend pressure persists Cardano’s 1-day chart shows continued weakness within a broad downtrend as price trades near $0.416 after failing to sustain a rebound earlier in December. The candles sit below the mid Bollinger Band at $0.425, indicating sellers remain in control. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView RSI at 39.43 shows lingering bearish momentum, though not deeply oversold. MACD is still negative with only a slight reduction in downside pressure. Support sits around $0.385, where the lower band aligns. A daily close above $0.425 would hint at early stabilization, while rejection at this level increases the risk of revisiting $0.39 to $0.38 in the coming sessions. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Cardano retreats toward $0.41 as bullish momentum weakens on 4-hour chart Cardano’s 4-hour chart shows fading bullish momentum after failing to break above $0.454, where the upper Bollinger Band capped the rally. Price has slipped back toward $0.416 and is hovering around the mid band at $0.426, signaling indecision. ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView MACD has turned slightly bearish with the histogram dipping below zero and both lines curling downward, reflecting weakening demand. Balance of Power also leans negative, suggesting sellers are regaining control. If ADA loses 0.410 support, it may revisit 0.399. A recovery requires a close above 0.440 to restore short-term upside momentum. Overall, ADA remains vulnerable within a broader downtrend. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.5598 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.5221 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.4800 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.4496 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.5317 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.6745 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.7257 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.4720 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.5263 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.6227 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.7172 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.7631 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.7544 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.7367 SELL What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next? Cardano is likely to remain in a cautious trading range as momentum indicators show weakening buyer strength. If ADA holds above 0.410, it may consolidate between $0.41 and $0.44 while waiting for a clearer direction. A push above 0.440 would signal renewed upside and could target 0.454 again. However, the MACD’s bearish turn and negative Balance of Power suggest downside risks remain elevated. A breakdown below 0.410 could send the price toward $0.399 or even $0.385, where the next support sits. Overall, expect choppy movement with a slight bearish tilt unless broader market sentiment improves. Why is Cardano up today? Cardano is up today due to the strong narrative boost from the Midnight mainnet launch, which introduced the NIGHT token and expanded Cardano’s privacy and institutional use cases. This catalyst aligned with a technical rebound from the $0.40 support level, where ADA bounced off a long-term trendline and triggered a bullish MACD crossover. Oversold conditions and wedge breakout expectations attracted short-term buyers. Market sentiment remains weak overall, but ADA outperformed as traders rotated into undervalued altcoins. Despite the recovery, ADA still trades below key resistance near $0.45 to $0.47, which must break for sustained upside. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Why is Cardano down today? Cardano is down today because both the 1-day and 4-hour charts show weakening bullish momentum and increasing seller pressure. On the 1-day chart, ADA failed to break above the $0.60 resistance, forming lower highs and slipping back into a declining channel. RSI is flattening near mid-range, showing fading buyer strength. On the 4-hour chart, ADA broke short-term support below around $0.58, triggering a bearish continuation as volume favored sellers. The Bollinger Bands are widening downward, confirming volatility to the downside. Until ADA reclaims $0.60 with strong volume, downside pressure is likely to persist in the short term. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely likely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano Cardano closed 2025 with major progress toward fully decentralized governance driven by the implementation of CIP-1694 and active community participation. The Cardano Foundation supported this transition through responsible voting power distribution, a complete tenure on the Interim Constitutional Committee, and extensive DRep activity. Delegation programs expanded with over 360 million ADA assigned to builder and adoption-focused DReps. Governance accessibility improved through open-source voting tools, educational resources, flow charts, and community events. Collaboration with Intersect strengthened committees across civics, technical steering, budget planning, and strategy. Overall 2025 marked a year of maturation and unity as Cardano advanced its long-term decentralized governance vision. 2025 was a monumental year for Cardano governance. From the transition to decentralized governance to deeper collaboration across the ecosystem as an Enterprise Member of @IntersectMBO , the year marked true progress.

Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history by Coingecko Cardano, founded in 2015 and launched in 2017, gained popularity for its eco-friendly Ouroboros Proof-of-Stake system and affordability. The 2021 Alonzo upgrade introduced smart contracts, boosting scalability and interoperability, driving ADA to its all-time high of $3.09 before dropping to $0.22 by mid-2023. In 2024, ADA showed volatility, peaking at $1.3264 in December before closing the year at $0.8451 after multiple corrections throughout the year. 2025 began with ADA near $1.09 but prices fell below $0.60 by March, then recovered above $0.70 by May and ranged between $0.51–$0.82 through July. From August to November 2025, ADA fluctuated between $0.74 and $0.96, showing brief rallies followed by pullbacks, with current consolidation around $0.80. In early October 2025, Cardano (ADA) traded around $0.78–$0.82, showing mild bullish momentum after September’s consolidation. Mid-October saw a decline toward $0.70, as selling pressure increased and market sentiment weakened. By early November, ADA stabilized between $0.68 and $0.72. In early November ADA traded around $0.61 — closing at about $0.609 on Nov 1 and $0.612 on Nov 2 . Over the next two weeks it held in the $0.58–0.61 range before gradually drifting lower. Mid-November saw modest strength, with ADA climbing to ~$0.53–0.56 before breaking lower around Nov 14. By Nov 20–22 the price dipped under $0.41–$0.43, reflecting broader downward pressure. In late November and early December ADA continued sliding — arriving near $0.38–0.44 by Dec 3–4, then trading close to $0.42–$0.43 around Dec 6–7.",Crypto Price Predictions|ADA,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-07 11:15:39

As new development progress is proven and the pace of developments builds up, an increasing number of the major crypto traders believe that this new token is about to take one of the most impressive runs in the industry. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with the current price of $0.035 is currently being considered as a potential breakout candidate. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum finance is creating a decentralized lending system that focuses on actual borrowing and lending. The system enables users to loan assets in ETH and USDT and earn an equivalent in the form of mtTokens. Such mtTokens appreciate borrowers paying interests. Liquidity-Based model is through which borrowing operates. With a healthy liquidity, borrowing will be cheap. When liquidity becomes restrained, rates increase. Loan to value regulations ensure safety of borrowing and also minimise the risk of liquidation. When collateral of a borrower is below there, liquidators repay some part of the cost and collect collateral in form of a discount. This maintains equilibrium in the system and defends the lenders. Mutuum Finance stated on its official X account that its V1 testnet will be running in Q4 2025. V1 is going to release the lending pool, mtTokens, liquidation features and the debt module. Halborn Security is discussing the smart contracts to demonstrate reliability of the system to be launched. Holder Growth and Early Price Action Early participation has already been good at Mutuum Finance. The project has raised an astonishing $19.1M and is currently having over 18,300 investors. These indicators are relevant in that they indicate widespread initial adoption other than the lone speculation. The high number of users is an aid to the borrowing activity when the site enters live testing. The token was issued at the end of early 2025, at a price of $0.01. Currently it is priced at a 250% higher price of $0.035 in the development cycle. Such initial performance is an indication of increasing confidence in future features of the protocol and demand following V1 activation. Community Accessibility and Activity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a supply of 4 billion tokens. A portion of this supply, 1.82 billion tokens or 45.5%, is distributed in the early years. Over 810 million tokens have already been purchased. This wide spread prevents concentration and assists in building a better long-term holder base. Daily participation is also ensured by Mutuum Finance with its 24-hour leaderboard with the winner gaining $500 each day in MUTM. This system assists in keeping the users on the move. There is also the ability to use card payment which makes onboarding easy to the new user and this factor has led to an increased daily engagement. Security and Stablecoin Plans One of the strongest areas of development has been on security of the project. Mutuum Finance passed a 90/100 CertiK audit. There is also the team-owned $50K bug bounty that is used to pinpoint potential code issues in advance of the testnet release. These steps are beneficial in creating trust in the project as it is ready to deal with borrowing, lending and liquidations. According to the Roadmap Mutuum Finance is also planning to issue USD-pegged stablecoin, which would have the interest of the borrowers. Stablecoins are important in the lending environment as they enhance liquidity by minimizing volatility and enhancing the borrowing environment. They also enable platforms to grow at a higher rate as the borrowers are able to borrow predictable value. Why The Urgency Is Growing Phase 6 is almost over, and now the allocation of the Mutuum Finance has reached more than 95%. A token number back in the present price of $0.035 is very minimal. In late stage allocation, there is always a rush-in-to-buy since users anticipate some change in price of goods and do not wish to miss the next crypto stage. The formal introduction is $0.06 and this has added urgency since the difference is more noticeable. As V1 approaches, its audited contracts are securing, more and more take part and the release that is nearly sold out is almost the last stage, Mutuum Finance is appearing as one of the potential best crypto prospects under $0.05. A few initial forecasts indicate the possible upside of 650% by 2027.

But experts say there's another question that's just as important as the price: What role does Bitcoin really play in portfolios, and when will it start behaving like a stable “store of value”? “It still has to prove itself as a digital store of value with performance over a longer period,” Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management, said on CNBC’s “ETF Edge” podcast. For years, Bitcoin has been frequently described as “digital gold.” This analogy is particularly appealing to institutional and individual investors, as gold is seen as a safe haven that protects portfolios during periods of sharp sell-offs in stocks and other risky assets, trading with low correlation to these assets. However, Bitcoin's behavior as a risk-on asset during stock sell-offs is the most significant factor undermining this “digital gold” narrative. Following two distinct periods of volatility in 2025, comments suggesting that Bitcoin has failed to provide a clear answer to this question of digital gold are gaining prominence. Geraci stated, “The track record so far is mixed.” Geraci highlighted Bitcoin's strong performance during the stock sell-off known as the “tariff tantrum,” which followed President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping global tariffs in April. He said that Bitcoin's strong performance during this period, while decoupling from stocks, caught the attention of many investors. However, he noted that more recently, with weakness in tech stocks dragging the market down, most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have sold off sharply along with the stock market. Geraci noted that Bitcoin, in particular, lost much more value than the stock market during the recent wave. “The jury is still out,” Geraci said, adding that a longer dataset is needed to clarify Bitcoin's role. In the long term, Geraci maintains his view that Bitcoin will increasingly evolve toward a behavior pattern more similar to physical gold. However, he believes its current movements are still “too young and volatile.” “Bitcoin is essentially like a 15-16-year-old asset,” he said. “It needs time to prove itself as a digital store of value.” In contrast, he emphasized that gold has a history stretching back thousands of years and a proven reputation. In a follow-up email to CNBC, he stated, “Bitcoin's story is still in its early stages.” Related News: Which Way Will the Wind Blow for Bitcoin? Analysts Say “There’s a Preparation Going On” Emphasizing the importance of maintaining perspective during short-term fluctuations, Geraci noted that Bitcoin has retreated over 25% since its record high in October, with a peak-to-trough loss of approximately 35%. Despite this, he noted that Bitcoin's price has still more than doubled since January 2024, following the SEC-approved launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also seen billions of dollars in outflows in the past month, with a total net inflow of approximately $22 billion since the beginning of the year. Geraci says the sell-off in tech stocks and risk aversion in the broader equity market were the primary drivers of the recent crash, but the high leverage levels in the crypto market played a significant role in deepening the move. “I think there was a lot of leverage in that category that needed to be cleared. That's what we're seeing now,” he added. Beyond Bitcoin, Geraci believes crypto index ETFs could be a promising option for investors, providing them with more diversified exposure to the crypto asset class. These products aim to spread risk by investing in a basket of digital assets rather than relying on a single coin. Still, Geraci singles out Bitcoin in the crypto market. He believes many other crypto assets will likely continue to behave like tech stocks: “Setting aside Bitcoin, I view most other crypto tokens as risk assets, much closer to high-growth tech stocks than stores of value. Their investment thesis is more closely tied to the future of stablecoins, tokenization, and the development of decentralized finance,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

At the same time, Bitget Wallet introduces TEE-secure social login, making self-custody simpler and safer for everyday users across the region. Binance Pay–Pix integration: a new era for everyday crypto use The integration of Binance Pay with Brazil’s Pix system is a significant step toward frictionless digital payments , particularly for Argentinians who visit or live in Brazil. The update converts cryptocurrencies into Brazilian reais instantly using the country’s most frequently used payment network, making digital assets a useful tool for daily purchases. It combines the global reach of blockchain with the familiarity and efficiency of Pix, resulting in a seamless experience in which crypto payments feel as natural as regular ones. This convergence indicates the maturation of the South American fintech sector. As Pix conducts billions of transactions every month and Brazil cements its position as one of the world’s leading crypto adopters, the agreement propels Binance Pay to the forefront of real-world crypto usefulness. For Argentinians, it eliminates long-standing restrictions such as currency complexities, hidden fees, and delays, enabling the use of cryptocurrency more regularly in businesses, services, and everyday financial transactions. Tokenised crowdfunding reaches a milestone on Brazil’s B3 exchange Fenynx completed its first fundraising round using tokenised shares listed directly on B3’s digital-asset infrastructure , propelling Brazil’s capital markets forward significantly. By allowing tokenised shares to be sold via an equity crowdfunding platform, the exchange creates new liquidity outlets for investors and provides small businesses with an alternative to traditional funding routes—particularly important given Brazil’s lengthy IPO drought. With many platforms currently partnering with B3 and billions of reais pouring through the sector, tokenisation is swiftly changing the way entrepreneurs receive finance. Fenynx’s own model demonstrates the revolutionary power of digital assets in financing. Backed by B3 tokens, the company raised R$1.555 million, valuing the company at over R$14 million, while its business of providing credit backed by cryptocurrencies and tokenised real-world assets represents a new frontier in collateralization. Fenynx intends to develop digital-asset-backed loans and integrate traditional and decentralised funding sources, signalling a bigger shift in Brazil’s financial innovation scene. Bitget Wallet introduces TEE-secure social login for Web3 newcomers According to a press release sent to Invezz , Bitget Wallet has introduced a social login functionality that allows users to establish and access a self-custodial cryptocurrency wallet via Google, Apple ID, or email, eliminating the need to memorise seed words and significantly lowering friction for Web3 newcomers. Powered by a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), the system produces and saves private keys within an isolated, safe zone of the device, ensuring users retain complete ownership while enjoying an onboarding flow as simple as logging into any other app. This strategy enables newbies to transition from installation to on-chain activity in seconds. Bitget Wallet provides speed and security in a mobile-first design by keeping all signature procedures inside the TEE and supporting major ecosystems, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Tron, Base, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Morph. Its architecture, created with AWS Nitro Enclaves, encrypts key material at all stages, providing a cleaner alternative to MPC-based wallets and easing device recovery. As subsequent updates include capabilities such as email-based transfers and multi-chain functionality, the wallet exemplifies a rising industry push for safe, hardware-isolated self-custody that is familiar to general consumers.

How Acquisitions Support the XRP Ecosystem Garlinghouse goes on to explain how Ripple evaluates its acquisitions. He notes that every deal, in one way or another, is designed to support XRP. Some acquisitions may appear obvious in their purpose, while others may not immediately show their link to Ripple’s objectives. He stresses that the company has a clear plan that allows it to understand how each move fits into its long-term structure.

However, he maintains that Ripple views opportunities with a detailed understanding of how they will help expand the XRP ecosystem over time. This includes actions that may seem indirect but ultimately help build trust, increase usage, and improve liquidity. A Planned, Multi-Step Vision for XRP’s Future Xaif Crypto emphasizes that Ripple’s vision extends further than many expect, with Garlinghouse presenting a consistent message about the importance of XRP. The key point reinforced in the post is that Ripple evaluates every step with a long-term lens, ensuring that product development, partnerships, and acquisitions align with XRP’s advancement. The message reflects a strategy that prioritizes XRP on every level, supporting Xaif Crypto’s conclusion that the company’s vision is significantly larger than what is often assumed.

According to reports, the banking group will allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana directly inside its Banque Populaire and Caisse d’Épargne mobile application starting on Monday. The development from BPCE means it is one of the first major traditional European banks to offer digital assets to its customers. The initial rollout is expected to cover BPCE clients of four regional banks, including Banque Populaire Île-de-France and Caisse d’Épargne Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, reaching about two million customers. BPCE plans to gradually extend the service in the coming year, expanding it to reach its remaining 25 regional entities in 2026. BPCE set to launch in-app crypto trading services According to the report , the motive of BPCE is to enable crypto trading for its full 12 million customers. A bank source mentioned to The Big Whale that the phased approach is intended by the bank to monitor how the service performs at launch before scaling. Crypto sales and purchases would be handled through a dedicated digital asset account within the banking apps. According to the report, it is expected to be managed by Hexard, a crypto subsidiary of BPCE. Users willing to sign up for an account must note that it carries a $3.48 monthly fee and 1.5% commission per trade, with a minimum of $1.16. In addition, the platform will be accessible to users without the need for an external exchange or third-party wallets. The development comes as competition continues to intensify across Europe between traditional banks and crypto-friendly fintechs like Revolut , deBlock, Trade Republic, and Bitstack, all of which currently offer access to crypto. Several European firms have also taken the same steps, with BBVA allowing its Spanish client base to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin and Ethereum directly within its applications. According to the firm, the custody is handled in-house and not outsourced to third parties. The firm noted that the integration was necessary because it wanted its users with existing BBVA accounts to be able to move funds easily on their mobile application, which supports only trading and storage services. Financial institutions move to integrate crypto Aside from BBVA , Santander’s digital arm Openbank also offers trading and custody for five digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Polygon, and Cardano. Santander claimed that the service, which was rolled out for German clients, would integrate crypto alongside the usual investment products offered by Openbank, removing the need for third-party platforms while operating under the European Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework. In addition, Raiffeisen Bank’s Vienna-based unit also partnered with Bitpanda to bring crypto services to its clients. “We have seen the demand from customers for easy, intuitive, digital investment platforms. Our main intention to take customer-centric decisions has triggered these efforts, which we are excited about bringing to market,” a spokesperson for the bank said at the time. Meanwhile, France has moved forward with its decision to tax crypto as unproductive wealth. Last month, lawmakers in the country approved an amendment that would update the country’s wealth tax to cover unproductive assets, including certain real estate, luxury items, and digital assets like crypto. Under the amendment, users holding more than $2.3 million in unproductive wealth will face a 1% tax, a shift from the present progressive real estate wealth tax. Speaking about the amendment, Eric Larchevêque, co–founder of crypto wallet Ledger , noted that the amendment punishes all savers who wish to financially anchor themselves to Bitcoin or gold in order to secure their financial future. He added that crypto holders may be asked to sell their assets to pay tax if there are no other liquid assets. However, the proposal is not set in stone as it needs to pass as part of the 2026 budget process before becoming law.

Polymarket traders are pricing in a 92% probability of a 25-basis-point cut, which has shifted Bitcoin price analysis from a bearish breakdown to a potential comeback. Powell Expected to Deliver 25bps Cut Despite Inflation Concerns Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to proceed with another quarter-point rate reduction this week, even as several policymakers express concern about persistent inflation. The Fed implemented its second consecutive cut in October, responding to unexpected weakness in the summer jobs data. Following that decision, hawkish voices emerged among officials, including five current voting members, who indicated reluctance to support further easing in December. The tide turned on November 21 when New York Fed President John Williams suggested conditions warranted a reduction in the “near term.” Recent Bitcoin price analysis from Cryptonews highlights a critical on-chain metric gaining momentum. Bitcoin “liveliness” is climbing again, a pattern that has historically coincided with bull market phases, suggesting the current cycle may have substantial upside remaining. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe outlined a bullish scenario, anticipating short-term volatility before a sustained rally. He expects pre-FOMC selling pressure today and Monday, potentially driving prices down to $87,000 to sweep liquidity at the lows. This would be my bullish scenario. Pre-FOMC and on Monday, correction to sweep the lows. Perhaps hitting $87K. After that, bounce back up, swiftly, in which the uptrend is confirmed for #Bitcoin and it's ready to break $92K and therefore the run towards $100K in the coming 1-2… pic.twitter.com/lQezKkQM5W — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 7, 2025 “After that, bounce back up, swiftly, in which the uptrend is confirmed for Bitcoin and it’s ready to break $92,000 And therefore the run towards $100,000 in the coming 1-2 weeks as the Fed is reducing QT, doing rate cuts and expanding the money supply to increase the business cycle,” van de Poppe stated. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Technical Setup Favors $94k Breakout Technical analysis shows Bitcoin breaking out of a long descending red channel, signalling that the strongest phase of the downtrend has likely ended. Price is currently hovering around the $89,000 zone, which sits just beneath a key resistance-turned-support area highlighted in orange. Until BTC closes decisively above this zone, sellers can still create short-term pressure. Source: TradingView The breakout attempt already shows early strength, as BTC bounced from the lower channel region near $79,000 and pushed back toward mid-trend. The next major resistance level is around $94,600, and clearing it would confirm bullish continuation. If that happens, the chart projects upside targets at $108,000 and eventually $116,000, which align with previous liquidity zones. Maxi Doge Presale Capitalizes on Market Momentum As Bitcoin positions for a potential comeback driven by Fed rate cuts, presale projects like Maxi Doge (MAXI) are attracting investor attention. MAXI is capturing the grassroots momentum that drove Dogecoin’s extraordinary 161,000x rally. The project has secured over $4.2 million in funding while building an active community focused on sharing trading strategies and market opportunities. Notably, 25% of capital raised will be invested in promising plays, with returns recycled into marketing initiatives and community rewards to accelerate growth. Investors can join the presale at $0.000272 by visiting the official Maxi Doge website . Then connect an Ethereum-compatible wallet like Best Wallet , and purchase MAXI with ETH, BNB, or USDT.

Co-founded by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman in 2014, Cosmos aims to create a decentralized network of blockchains that can communicate and transact seamlessly. Its main components include the Cosmos Hub, which serves as the central chain, and multiple “zones” that operate under their own rules while connecting to the Hub. The platform uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable fast, low-cost transactions. Fees average around $0.01, and confirmation times are approximately seven seconds. Cosmos employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, allowing users to stake their ATOM tokens for network security and transaction validation. Since its ICO in 2017, Cosmos has raised significant funding and established a growing ecosystem, including notable projects like Terra and Binance. With over 286 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a market cap exceeding $7.7 billion, Cosmos is positioned as a key player in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, often referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains” for its ambitious goal of connecting diverse blockchain networks.

The lower band around 2.13 has been tested several times signaling persistent selling pressure and little buyer follow-through. RSI at 33 shows near oversold conditions but momentum remains weak. MACD stays firmly negative with no sign of reversal. A daily close above $2.30 would signal early stabilization while slipping below $2.13 risks a drop toward the psychological $2.00 level. Overall ATOM remains bearish with limited signs of recovery. ATOM/USD 4-hour price chart ATOMUSD chart by TradingView Cosmos (ATOM) remains under sustained bearish pressure on the 4 hour chart with price slipping to $2.20 after repeated rejections near the mid Bollinger Band around $2.26. The lower band at $2.14 continues to act as soft support but constant tests signal weakening demand. MACD shows minimal bullish momentum with a flat histogram and both lines still below zero. Balance of Power is negative at -0.54 indicating sellers remain dominant. If ATOM loses $2.14 it risks a drop toward $2.10 or even $2.00. A recovery requires a close above $2.26 to shift momentum and target resistance near $2.38.

ATOM is likely to remain pressured in the near term as both the 1-day and 4-hour charts show persistent bearish momentum and repeated failures to break above the mid-range. If the price holds above 2.14, a period of sideways consolidation between $2.14 and $2.26 is likely, as markets wait for stronger direction. A breakdown below $2.14 could open the path toward $2.10 or even the psychological $2.00 support. Bulls need a close above $2.26 to signal a potential short-term rebound toward $2.38. Until then, ATOM remains vulnerable with limited signs of a decisive trend reversal. Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades, such as ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Why is Comsos Atom down today? Cosmos (ATOM) is down today due to a combination of tokenomics uncertainty and ongoing technical weakness. The community’s move to redesign ATOM’s inflation-heavy economic model has created short-term fear, as traders anticipate potential dilution and unclear timelines for new fee-based tokenomics. This uncertainty adds pressure to a token that has already lost 45% over 90 days. Technically, ATOM continues to trade inside a descending channel on both the 1-day and 4-hour charts, with price failing to hold the $2.40 support zone. Bearish MACD momentum, weak RSI, and proximity to key Fibonacci support ($2.36) reinforce downside sentiment. Failure to reclaim $2.60 keeps sellers in control. Is Cosmos a safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmos’ current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $17.16 by 2030. Will Cosmos reach $100? Current predictions suggest that Cosmos (ATOM) will likely reach $51.9 in 2033. Analysts estimate it would require a significant increase of over 900% to hit that price. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $33.53 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Thus, the cosmos network could expand to a wider user base. Recent news/opinion on Cosmos Cosmos announced a major push to expand Ethereum’s capabilities through its Cosmos EVM framework, enabling developers to deploy sovereign EVM chains with full customizability. Unlike traditional EVM environments, Cosmos EVM uses precompiles and ABCI to offer deep control over block execution, allowing advanced features such as MEV protection, oracle integration, and blocklist enforcement. Developers can modify chain behavior before, during, and after block production, unlocking design freedom beyond Ethereum’s constraints. Despite this flexibility, Cosmos EVM remains fully compatible with standard Ethereum tooling, including Foundry Ethers and Web3.js. The initiative positions Cosmos as a powerful hub for next-generation Ethereum-based innovation. It's time to unleash Ethereum. Cosmos doesn't just make it easy to deploy sovereign EVM chains. By harnessing the Cosmos EVM, you inherit the most powerful features of a Cosmos chain: full control over customizability and extensibility. Using precompiles, you can break free… https://t.co/D8KoZSr56Z — vlad (@vladjdk) October 13, 2025 Cosmos Price Prediction December 2025 As of December 2025, Cosmos (ATOM) is forecast to reach a low of $2.14, a high of $2.41, and an average of $2.34 Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High December 2025 $2.14 $2.34 $2.41 Cosmos Price Prediction 2025 According to our deep technical analysis on past price data of ATOM, in 2025 the price of Cosmos is forecasted to reach a minimum of $2.14, a maximum of $2.41, and an average trading value of $234.

Cosmos historic price sentiment Cosmos price history Cosmos launched after its 2017 ICO and mainnet release in 2019, reaching a peak of $44 during the 2021 bull market. After April 2022, ATOM entered a long consolidation phase, mostly trading between $6 and $16. Throughout 2024, the price weakened further, dropping to the $4–$6 range and reaching lows near $4 as bearish sentiment grew. Early 2025 saw continued volatility, with ATOM fluctuating mostly between $4 and $5 despite brief rebounds. From July to September 2025, ATOM traded narrowly between $4.30–$4.70, showing limited momentum and ongoing market indecision. ATOM was trading around $4.40–$4.70, but bearish pressure pushed the price downward as broader market sentiment weakened. The price declined further, moving into the $4.00–$4.30 range, with repeated failed attempts to break above resistance. From the beginning of November, ATOM continued to trade sideways between $3.90–$4.20, showing low momentum, weak buyer strength, and consolidation near support levels. Here’s a short history of Cosmos (ATOM) from November 1 to December 7, 2025 — summarized in three bullet points: At the start of November ATOM traded around $2.96–$3.05 with a high near $3.15 on Nov 11–12, before seeing a gradual downward drift. From mid-November onward, price slid steadily, reaching roughly $2.50–$2.55 by Nov 26–28. By December 3–4 ATOM settled into the $2.30–$2.40 range and hovered near $2.33–$2.37 as of early December, reflecting a roughly 20-25% drop over the month.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ATOM|BLOCKCHAIN|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-07 12:15:00

The pullback lands during a month already marked by volatile market swings, adding fresh signs that user engagement continues to thin even as institutional interest in Bitcoin grows. Adoption Metrics Show Broad Weakness in November According to Presto Research, the same three chains, Tron, BNB Chain, and Solana, have continued to dominate active users for seven months straight, with Tron once again holding the top spot. A similar pattern appeared in network and protocol TVL. The firm highlighted that price pressure across the market cut the dollar-denominated value of locked assets, with Bera Chain’s TVL dropping by more than half during the month. Many well-known DeFi platforms also saw their own TVL values shrink as token prices slid and user activity cooled. Sui and Sonic both saw a more than 40% drop, with Avalanche hit by a nearly 30% dip. However, not all metrics painted a bleak picture. Stablecoin balances on Ethereum climbed by more than $1.5 billion, according to Presto’s report, and the chain also led in bridged capital, taking in over $200 million. Still, these pockets of strength were outweighed by shrinking activity elsewhere. Solana, Ethereum, and Base, typically among the highest fee-generating networks, saw the steepest monthly fee declines, signaling a noticeable slowdown in transactions. DEX volumes told the same story, with Uniswap recording the largest month-on-month drop of more than $500 million, followed by Curve’s nearly $300 million dip. This downturn arrived during a turbulent week for markets. Earlier in the month, Bitcoin briefly dipped below $84,000 before rebounding to around $92,000 at the time of writing. Analysts such as CoinCare have linked the rebound to a rush of futures buying after Vanguard approved trading for several spot crypto ETFs, calling the shift the strongest buy-side futures activity since early 2023. Macro Strength, Institutional Interest, and a User Pullback Even with improving conditions in stocks and gold, crypto markets spent early December wrestling with lighter inflows, pushing Arca CIO Jeff Dorman to describe the downturn “one of the strangest crypto sell-offs ever,” and noting that pressures from interest rates or stablecoin fears were absent. Instead, he argued that crypto-native traders appear drained while new capital has been slow to appear. That backdrop could provide context for November’s weakening on-chain picture. Despite rising institutional involvement, amplified by ETF access for millions of Vanguard clients, retail and DeFi participation have not kept pace.

Balchunas stressed that Bitcoin has existed for nearly 17 years, during which it has weathered “six to seven haymakers” — multiple cycles of steep sell-offs and regulatory pressure , only to bounce back to new all-time highs. In a statement dated Sunday, December 7 , he stated th at he would not liken BTC to tulips, no matter how significant its price declines. Notably, critics of the industry use the term “Tulip Bubble” to compare the wild excitement and high price fluctuations of digital currencies to the Tulip Mania that occurred in the 17th century in the Netherlands. Balchunas argues that some people disapprove of Bitcoin’s existence Regarding the tulip market condition, the senior ETF analyst stated that the tulip market experienced a substantial rise followed by a sharp decline over nearly three years. He likened this situation to getting hit in the face and knocked out. Contrastingly, Balchunas noted that Bitcoin has recently recovered from numerous market difficulties . Some of the challenges the digital asset faced included about six to seven significant declines before attaining a new all-time high. Additionally, he noted that the cryptocurrency has been around for 17 years. “The fact that it has endured so long alone makes it unfit for comparison with tulips. Plus, it’s still up approximately 250% over the last three years and had a 122% increase last year,” Balchunas added. He also alleged that some individuals simply disapprove of Bitcoin’s existence and enjoy annoying those who support this cryptocurrency. According to him, there is a high likelihood that this sentiment will remain unchanged. Meanwhile, Michael Burry , a famous American investor widely recognized for a story that drew people’s attention through the movie “The Big Short”, weighed in on the topic. He referred to BTC as “the tulip bulb of their time.” On the other hand, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, described the digital asset as worse than tulip bulbs back in 2017, labeling it a fraud. As the situation intensified, reports indicated that the Dutch tulip mania was a period of speculative frenzy in the Netherlands during the Dutch Golden Age. At this time, tulip bulbs, which originated from Turkey, became a crucial signal of wealth among wealthy Dutch merchants. Following this perspective, prices began to increase rapidly at the beginning of 1634. In 1636, these prices recorded their highest peak. The situation occurred when some rare tulip bulbs were sold for prices higher than houses in Amsterdam. However, the market experienced a sudden crash in 1637, which impacted prices, leading to a decrease of more than 90% within just a few weeks. It is worth noting that several individuals consider the tulip mania as one of the first recorded speculative bubbles in history. They also believe that it contributed to the popular pump-and-dump chart pattern. Balchunas pushes back against claims that Bitcoin lacks productivity Earlier, Balchunas argued that this year, Bitcoin has only been adjusting from the extreme highs it recorded last year. According to him, even if 2025 turned out to be steady or slightly declined, the cryptocurrency is still performing at around 50% of its yearly average. Regarding the current situation, the senior ETF analyst attempted to explain that assets such as stocks sometimes need to take a break and that people are overthinking the situation. He also raised concerns about claims circulating in the cryptocurrency market that Bitcoin is unproductive. “Yes, both Bitcoin and tulips are assets that don’t produce anything. But gold, a Picasso painting, and rare stamps also fall into this category. Would you really compare those to tulips? Not every asset needs to create something to have value,” said the ETF analyst. Balchunas still insisted that tulips faced a lot of excitement but later encountered a significant drop, noting that Bitcoin’s case is a different kind of thing. Garry Krug, the head of strategy at German Bitcoin treasury company Aifinyo, agreed with Balchunas’s argument. Krug expressed his belief that bubbles cannot survive numerous ups and downs, regulatory issues, global challenges, halving events, and exchange problems, yet still attain a new all-time high.

The figure, sourced from CryptoQuant's on-chain tracking data , appears extraordinary at face value. However, a closer examination of market behaviour and supporting metrics suggests the number reflects a technical anomaly rather than genuine market activity. The sheer scale of the reported movement would typically trigger significant market reactions. Yet SHIB's price chart shows no corresponding volatility. The token continues to trade below its major moving averages, with no unusual price swings. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.000008416, indicating a 0.71% decline over the last 24 hours and a 9.5% weekly drop. This disconnect between reported volume and actual market behaviour points toward data misclassification rather than a real event. SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Market Shows No Signs of Massive Selling When billions of tokens actually reach exchanges and enter circulation, markets respond. Traders see expanded bid-ask spreads. Price charts display violent candlestick patterns. Liquidity pools show clear signs of strain. None of these indicators appear in SHIB's recent trading history. Trading volume remains within normal ranges. The price action shows typical consolidation patterns. No panic selling emerged. No sudden liquidity crunch occurred. The market is not pricing in a massive influx of new supply, which would be impossible to hide if trillions of tokens genuinely changed hands. Exchange metrics provide additional evidence against the headline figure. While CryptoQuant data shows both inflows and outflows spiking to extreme levels, 24.4 trillion SHIB flowing in and 25.2 trillion flowing out, these numbers contain red flags. The charts display vertical jumps that suggest technical glitches rather than organic market movements. Wallet Reorganization Explains the Numbers When both exchange inflows and outflows simultaneously register extreme values, internal wallet reorganization is usually the cause. Large holders regularly consolidate their positions across different wallets. Exchanges routinely move tokens between hot and cold storage. These internal transfers can trigger counting errors in blockchain tracking systems. API errors represent another common source of inflated volume figures. Data indexing bugs occasionally cause the same transaction to be counted multiple times. Consolidation events where multiple wallets merge into one can be misread as fresh market activity. Each scenario produces misleading volume statistics without actual tokens hitting the open market. Exchange reserve data supports this interpretation. The total amount of SHIB held on trading platforms has not shifted dramatically. If 23 trillion tokens genuinely moved to exchanges for selling, reserve balances would show a clear increase. They do not. Active address counts tell a similar story. The number of unique wallets interacting with SHIB has not spiked. A legitimate movement of this magnitude would involve thousands of active participants. The blockchain would show clear evidence of widespread activity. That evidence does not exist.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-07 12:53:47

Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, the founders of DOGE, celebrated the memecoin’s 12th anniversary on X. Markus wrote, “12 years ago I made something stupid and then a bunch of even stupider stuff happened and now I am posting about it on the internet to 2.15 million followers.” He closed the post saying, “happy 12th genesis day, dogecoin.” Palmer celebrated the anniversary, saying, “Happy Doge Day to every single one of you beautiful degens!” He added, “May your bags forever pump, may your vibes stay diamond-handed, and may this pack of lunatics never split. To the moon, together. Love y’all forever.” Dogecoin was created on December 6, 2013, by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. The memecoin was part of the altcoin bubble that took place during the 2013 bull market.

After the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, there were no alternative cryptocurrencies for two years. People were still learning about blockchain and mining, and at the time, Bitcoin was mined using CPUs. In 2011, the first altcoin was created, called Namecoin. Other altcoins like Litecoin, Peercoin, and Feathercoin were released in 2011–2012. Most altcoins were technical experiments. There was no real traction from retail investors. The cryptocurrency space was serious and filled with high technical jargon. In late 2013, BTC shot from $13 to $1,100, and altcoins gained real traction from retail investors. Billy and Jackson thought crypto was extremely serious, and there was no fun. The duo decided to create Dogecoin. Jackson worked on DOGE’s website while Billy developed the memecoin and released it to the public. The logo of Dogecoin is based on a photo of a Japanese Shiba Inu dog meme. The website of Dogecoin recorded 1 million visitors in the first month. DOGE grows instantly Surprisingly, DOGE gained instant traction. Redditors started using it as a tipping currency. After two weeks, DOGE surpassed BTC in terms of daily transactions. On December 19, 2013, DOGE climbed by ~300% in 72 hours. The memecoin jumped from $0.00026 to $0.00095. Dogecoin helped raise funds for a bunch of charity organizations. The Dogecoin community built clean water wells in Kenya, and they even helped the Jamaican Bobsled Team go to the Sochi Winter Olympics. In 2021, Dogecoin saw a massive run due to Elon Musk’s endorsement. The memecoin jumped to $0.7316 and was on the way to hit the $1 price point. Fast forward to 2024–2025, Elon Musk continued his push for Dogecoin through the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). DOGE helped curb overspending in the US government. At the time of writing, DOGE ranks in the tenth spot on CoinGecko with a market cap of $22.47 billion. The memecoin has a 24-hour trading volume of $596 million and stands at $0.1393.

This move lets enterprises access digital asset settlement and liquidity services through the treasury platforms they already use. It also removes the need for companies to handle crypto wallets or interact directly with blockchain processes. GTreasury brings over 40 years of expertise and supports more than 800 corporations across 160 countries, connecting with 13,000 banks. It processes approximately $12.5 trillion in payments annually, representing a substantial share of global cross-border transactions . Its integration gives XRP immediate access to a large and established corporate finance network. A Strategic Expansion This deal completes a key Ripple’s 2025 expansion strategy. Alongside other acquisitions such as Rail, Palisade, and Ripple Prime, GTreasury adds to a growing portfolio of services aimed at enterprises seeking to modernize their financial operations. These moves enable Ripple to provide institutions with a full range of XRP-powered solutions for liquidity, settlement, and risk management. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s goal is to deliver scalable infrastructure that minimizes friction, strengthens operational efficiency, and reduces risk for large organizations managing complex international flows. What’s Next for XRP? JackTheRippler stated that this move will make XRP the backbone of the new financial system . The company’s XRP-powered system now powers a wide range of institutional services. This will increase demand for the asset in the long term. By combining its digital asset infrastructure with GTreasury’s established enterprise network, Ripple is building a bridge between traditional treasury systems and blockchain-driven liquidity solutions. The outcome could reshape how corporations manage payments and further establish XRP as a key component in the emerging institutional financial landscape.

By 2028, CRO could reach a maximum value of $0.4, with an average trading price of $0.35. Cronos is expected to reach a maximum level of $1.13 in 2031. Cronos (CRO) is the native cryptocurrency token of the Cronos chain, a decentralized, open-source blockchain developed by the Crypto.com payment, trading, and financial services company. CRO aims to power the next generation of decentralized crypto assets and applications, serving as a utility token. And enable real-time, low-cost transactions globally. Cronos cross-bridge mainnet beta suggests a bright future for CRO. This feature aims to improve interoperability between significant blockchain ecosystems, potentially increasing CRO’s attractiveness to developers and users. CRO’s recent performance reflects robust market sentiment and confidence. These factors, combined, make Cronos a compelling investment opportunity within the dynamic crypto market, thereby increasing the demand for CRO. Eminem’s involvement comes as Crypto.com has been actively expanding its visibility through various high-profile partnerships, including those with actor Matt Damon, major sports teams, and even Trump Media. In this Cronos price prediction, we’ll focus on exploring the future market trends of CRO, its current price momentum, and its past performance, using in-depth technical analysis and a price prediction model.

Lower highs and weakening volume confirm a shift toward bearish momentum. Support at $0.102 is crucial, as a break could extend the decline, while a hold may allow a rebound toward $0.103. On December 7, 2025, Cronos (CRO) trades near $0.1028, down 1.04% decline over the past 24 hours. The token moved between $0.1027 and $0.1049, reflecting mixed sentiment on the daily chart. Activity on the Cronos chain stayed steady, supported by active contracts like 0xa0b7…34450b and continued use of popular wallets such as MetaMask and Crypto.com Wallet. The chart showed cautious investor behavior, with traders closely watching volume shifts and momentum changes. Cronos daily price chart: CRO faces persistent resistance as sellers take control The daily chart showed CRO losing altitude after failing to hold above $0.104, confirming weakening bullish pressure. Price action shifted from consolidation into a controlled pullback, with sellers gaining control as the session advanced. The move toward $0.102 signaled growing downside momentum after the price slipped below near-term support, while fading daily volume indicated that buyers were waiting for a clearer catalyst before re-entering the market. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The chart structure reflected a softening trend, with earlier intraday wicks unable to sustain upward continuation. Indicators pointed toward a neutral-to-bearish sentiment, supported by repeated rejection at the $0.104 supply zone. This resistance continued to cap upward attempts, and the slide toward the session’s lower boundary highlighted the need for stronger buying pressure to prevent a deeper decline below $0.102. Cronos 4-hour price chart: CRO Tests Support as Intraday Trend Weakens Further CRO showed a steady decline on the 4-hour chart after repeated failures to hold the mid-range zone at $0.103–$0.104, forming a clear sequence of lower highs that signaled weakening short-term momentum. Downward candles intensified toward the end of the session, confirming that sellers controlled the pace, and the close near $0.102 indicated that immediate support was likely to come under pressure if this momentum continued. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView Technical patterns indicated a tightening structure with a downward bias, suggesting that bearish pressure could persist unless buyers intervene decisively. A recovery would require reclaiming the $0.103 level to shift sentiment back toward neutral, as momentum indicators tied to this setup suggested weakening upside momentum. Traders watching this timeframe would view the current move as a controlled descent that requires confirmation before anticipating any reversal.

CRO is likely to remain sensitive to the $0.102 support level in the near term, as current momentum continues to lean toward sellers. A confirmed break below this area could extend the downside, especially with weakening volume and lower highs reinforcing the bearish structure. If buyers defend $0.102, the first sign of relief would be a move back toward $0.103, which remains the key level required to shift intraday sentiment back to neutral. Until that reclaim occurs, CRO is expected to trade within a pressured range, with resistance at $0.104 acting as the ceiling limiting any potential recovery attempts. Is Cronos a good investment? Cronos (CRO) trades near $0.1028 on December 7, 2025, down 1.04% over 24 hours, moving within a tight range of $0.1027–$0.1049. Activity on the Cronos chain remains steady, supported by active contracts and popular wallets. The daily chart shows CRO struggling to break above $0.104, with lower highs and fading volume signaling weakening bullish momentum. On the 4-hour chart, repeated failures to hold $0.103–$0.104 point to short-term bearish pressure, with $0.102 support crucial. A break below $0.102 could extend losses, while having this level may allow a rebound toward $0.103. Resistance at $0.104 caps upside, keeping intraday sentiment neutral-to-bearish, making CRO range-bound under cautious trading conditions. Why Is Cronos (CRO) Down Today? Cronos (CRO) is down 1.04% on December 7, 2025, trading near $0.1028 within a narrow range of $0.1027–$0.1049. The token faces strong resistance at $0.104, which has repeatedly blocked upward moves, while support at $0.102 is now crucial for near-term stability. The daily chart shows weakening bullish momentum as CRO fails to hold above $0.104, with lower highs and fading volume signaling cautious investor sentiment. On the 4-hour chart, repeated failures to maintain $0.103–$0.104 highlight short-term bearish pressure, and a break below $0.102 could extend losses. If buyers defend $0.102, CRO may rebound toward $0.103, but resistance at $0.104 remains capped upside potential. Overall, CRO is trading in a pressured, range-bound pattern with neutral-to-bearish sentiment, reflecting cautious trading conditions. Will Cronos reach $0.5?

The victim was added to a WhatsApp group called ”531 DBS Stock Profit Growth Wealth Group,” where criminals posing as financial experts gained his trust. The group administrator identified himself as Professor Rajat Verma, while another member claimed to be analyst Meena Bhatt. These individuals convinced group members to download a mobile application through a specific domain, promising exclusive access to block deals and high-value Initial Public Offering (IPO) allotments not available to ordinary investors. The Scam Unfolds Through Trusted Tactics The fraudsters employed a calculated approach to lure their target. They directed victims to download an application, presenting it as a gateway to premium investment opportunities. The engineer initially deposited Rs. 1 lakh into the platform. To establish credibility, the scammers allowed him to withdraw Rs. 5,000 without issues. This small withdrawal served its purpose. The victim believed the platform was legitimate and began investing larger amounts over the following weeks. Between November and early December, he was persuaded to make substantial deposits for what the scammers claimed were subscriptions to the Capital Small Finance Bank IPO and participation in share buyback programs. The victim transferred approximately Rs. 1.2 crore through multiple bank accounts and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions. Problems emerged when the engineer attempted to withdraw his profits. The scammers demanded a 20% commission payment before processing any withdrawal requests. When he refused to pay this additional fee, the fraudsters froze his account entirely. The victim then realized he had been scammed and filed a complaint with the Cyberabad cybercrime police, who have launched an investigation into the matter. Rising Trend of Crypto-Related Fraud in India Indian authorities report a sharp increase in cryptocurrency-related crimes throughout the country. Law enforcement agencies are working actively to combat these schemes, which have become increasingly sophisticated and widespread. Another recent case involved an artificial intelligence scientist who lost money through a crypto investment scam. The victim met a woman on a matrimony website who introduced him to an investment platform. Over three months, he transferred Tether (USDT) across 14 separate transactions. Investigators discovered that some funds went to an account registered under Shankar Sahu, while over Rs. 13 lakh were channeled through an entity named RR Physiotherapy. The remaining amount was converted into various digital assets and transferred to wallets in the United Kingdom and Malaysia. The Indian police have issued urgent warnings to residents about the proliferation of investment scams. Authorities note that fraudulent schemes have reached unprecedented levels, particularly during the festive season when people are more likely to make financial decisions.",News|Legal|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-07 13:54:36

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-big-xrp-price-rally-based-on-this-history-heres-why/,"XRP continues to hold above $2, and the market is taking note of this steady range. The price now behaves much like it did when it sat between $0.50 and $0.60 for an extended period. Crypto analyst Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) highlighted this new range in a recent post, sharing a chart that showed XRP trading at $2.04. He stated, “$2.00 is truly the new $0.60 for XRP.” His comment echoed the idea that XRP has entered a new stage. It signals a market that now treats $2 as a key level. Some analysts describe this level as a crucial buying opportunity , and Cobb expects a consolidation phase before a massive pump. $2.00 is truly the new $0.60 for XRP Consolidation and then big launch pic.twitter.com/I8itobP7IW — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) December 6, 2025 A New Support Level Forms The comparison to earlier consolidation invites a closer look. XRP held tight between $0.5 and $0.6 from early 2022 to late 2024. That range kept mounting pressure until the market broke out in late 2024. The breakout produced a surge of more than 500% and pushed XRP above $3 for the first time since 2018. That rally shifted long-term sentiment and created stronger expectations for similar behavior when the asset forms a new base. XRP has spent most of 2024 defending the $2 support after the initial wave of gains. Buyers have stepped in every time the price drifted close to that mark. A Repeating Pattern XRP’s behavior mirrors the earlier pattern between $0.50 and $0.60. Cobb pointed out this similarity to illustrate how the market could repeat previous performance. His post suggested a stable period that sets the stage for another large move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The structure around $2 now looks firm, and a strong base often leads to a clear path once momentum shifts. The previous breakout came after XRP held its ground for years. The current consolidation is shorter, which creates interest in whether the next move will follow the same scale or produce a variation of it. Historical Behavior Shapes Expectations The earlier breakout gave analysts a clear reference point. A surge of more than 500% from the old $0.6 ceiling took XRP above $3. To apply the same logic now, the calculation shifts to the new base at $2. A 500% surge from $2 produces a target of $12. Cryptoinsightuk, a well-respected analyst, recently set the $12 target for XRP . Hitting this target would send XRP’s market cap to approximately $724 billion, surpassing Ethereum to become the second-largest cryptocurrency.

One such example is the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which recently set a new record for network velocity. An analysis by CryptoQuant found that the XRPL saw a surge in on-chain activity, leading to a new high in velocity. XRPL Breaks Network Velocity Record The velocity metric measures the frequency of XRP circulation across the network. The indicator shows the state of economic activity and on-chain transactions during the specified period. On December 2, the metric suddenly spiked to a new high of 0.0324. The last time the velocity rallied close to this level was in September 2025. Such upticks in the velocity metric indicate that XRP is changing hands among investors, rather than remaining dormant in cold wallets. “Such a surge typically signifies high liquidity and substantial involvement from traders or significant movements by whales. Regardless of market direction, this data confirms that the network is experiencing one of its most active periods in 2025, with user engagement reaching a peak,” CryptoQuant stated. Rising On-chain Activity A recent CryptoPotato report substantiates CryptoQuant’s analysis – large XRP holders have been moving their assets. The XRPL has seen mixed shifts among investors, with contrasting movements in wallet numbers and balances. The cohort of wallets holding at least 100 million XRP has shrunk by 20.6% over the past eight weeks, signifying the exit of 569 large wallets. Amid the shrinking large wallet count, whale holdings have been on the rise. The remaining 100M+ wallets currently hold more than 48 billion XRP, a seven-year high. This indicates that other large holders who did not exit the 100M group accumulated more XRP. In fact, this accumulation trend began in 2023 and has progressed over the last two years regardless of market conditions. Meanwhile, a separate group of XRP holders has begun reducing their holdings. Between December 2 and 3, wallets holding 1 million to 10 million tokens moved or sold 150 million XRP. This group of investors has been selling their holdings in waves over the past few months, so their movement has become part of a broader pattern. These developments come as the United States spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETF) market continues to attract significant inflows compared to their Bitcoin and Ethereum counterparts.

Signed during Binance Week 2025 in Dubai, between Dr. Abdulla Busenad, Director General of Dubai Customs, and Stephanie Emile, General Manager of Binance FZE in Dubai, Binance, which offers payment solutions including Binance Pay , will work to enhance trade flow and accelerate investment cycles by offering its solutions to Dubai Customs. Dubai’s local logistics sector to benefit from digital payments As per the agreement, digital assets will be integrated into the commercial transactions and logistics sector, supporting innovative financial infrastructure using blockchain, which will reduce transaction time and costs. As per the announcement, the partnership will improve the efficiency of import–export operations, streamline customs procedures, and attract new investors—particularly SMEs—by offering modern payment options that help expand their businesses and access new global markets. Dubai Customs already uses Blockchain for tamper-proof data sharing In 2024, Dubai Customs launched a blockchain platform that would expedite customs clearance and commercial transactions. The Blockchain platform facilitates secure and tamper-proof data sharing to enhance trust and visibility across the supply chain. It was not the first time that Dubai Customs used blockchain technology. In 2023, Dubai Customs secured a second intellectual property certificate from the UAE’s Ministry of Economy for their groundbreaking “Blockchain System for Managing Intellectual Property and Knowledge Assets”. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Chairman and CEO of DP World and Chairman of Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation, noted that through partnerships such as this, Dubai is establishing a progressive economic model capable of meeting requirements of digital economy. He added, “We support initiatives that enhance Dubai’s position as a trade and logistics hub, invest in advanced digital solutions to improve business efficiency, and build a next-generation payment ecosystem that aligns with the D33 Economic Agenda.” Additionally, Dr. Abdulla Busenad, Director General of Dubai Customs, noted that Dubai Customs is accelerating its digital transformation, making procedures smart, and utilizing advanced technologies. He expresses that the collaboration with Binance “opens a new chapter in developing digital payments by integrating crypto assets.” SMEs will benefit from payment solutions and a modernized customs system He added, “By integrating digital payment solutions, we are moving toward a future with faster, more accurate, and more transparent processes, supported by a technological infrastructure capable of accommodating the rapid growth of digital trade and building a superior economy based on innovation and future readiness.” Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, said, “Through this MoU, we will jointly launch innovative solutions capable of making a tangible difference in the customs sector locally and globally, enhancing Dubai’s digital ecosystem and developing infrastructure that keeps pace with global trends toward a smarter and more sustainable economy.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

In a statement on social media, Balchunas argued that this comparison was both historically and financially inaccurate. According to Balchunas, the tulip craze was a speculation that lasted only three years and collapsed with a single blow. Bitcoin, by contrast, is an asset class that has managed to recover from countless sharp declines and reach new highs over the past 17 years. “Bitcoin has been hit hard six or seven times, but it has always bounced back,” the analyst said. “This resilience alone is enough to invalidate the tulip metaphor.” Balchunas highlighted Bitcoin's long-term performance, noting that it's still up over 250% over the past three years and 122% last year. According to the analyst, the primary motivation for some commentators is their antipathy towards the asset: “Some people hate this asset and want to anger those who love it. That's not going to change.” Related News: Which Way Will the Wind Blow for Bitcoin? Analysts Say “There’s a Preparation Going On” Balchunas, describing the price correction in 2025 as a normal cooling-off period, stated that the reversal of last year's extreme surge should not be exaggerated. “Assets cool down from time to time,” he said. “Even stocks do. People overanalyze this.” Balchunas also criticized the “non-productive asset” argument that has led to Bitcoin being likened to the tulip craze. He noted that many assets, such as gold, Picasso paintings, and rare stamps, are also non-productive, saying, “Are we going to compare these assets to tulips? Bitcoin is a completely different asset.” According to the analyst, the tulip mania was just a one-time bubble of “excessive enthusiasm and a sudden crash,” while Bitcoin, as a long-lived, cyclical and increasingly institutionalized asset class, doesn’t deserve that comparison. *This is not investment advice.

The memecoin, which started as a lighthearted project, has become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the market. Markus shared his thoughts with his 2.15 million followers on X, describing the journey as unexpected. He noted how something created as a joke had evolved into a significant cultural phenomenon. Palmer addressed the community with enthusiasm, referring to supporters as ”beautiful degens” and expressing hopes for continued success. The cryptocurrency currently holds the ninth position on CoinMarketCap with a market capitalization of $22.47 billion. Trading volume reached $596 million in the past 24 hours. The token is trading at $0.1384 at the time of writing. DOGE price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Origins of a Memecoin Sensation Software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer launched Dogecoin on December 6, 2013. The project emerged during a period of intense speculation in alternative cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin had surged from $13 to $1,100 that year, drawing retail investors into the space. The founders noticed the cryptocurrency community had become overly serious. Technical discussions dominated conversations, leaving little room for accessibility or humour. Markus and Palmer sought to change this dynamic by creating a coin that embraced fun and community engagement. Palmer handled the website development while Markus worked on the technical implementation. The logo featured a Shiba Inu dog from a popular internet meme. This choice proved strategic, as it made the cryptocurrency instantly recognizable and approachable. The response exceeded all expectations. The website attracted one million visitors within its first month of operation. Reddit users quickly adopted the coin as a tipping mechanism, rewarding quality content and comments across the platform. Rapid Growth and Community Impact Dogecoin's transaction volume surpassed Bitcoin's within two weeks of launch. On December 19, 2013, the memecoin experienced a 300% price increase over 72 hours. The value climbed from $0.00026 to $0.00095, demonstrating strong market interest. The token's most significant price movement occurred in 2021. Elon Musk's public endorsements drove substantial attention to the memecoin. Dogecoin reached an all-time high of $0.7316, approaching the $1 threshold that supporters had long anticipated. Musk's involvement continued through 2024 with the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency. The department, which shares Dogecoin's DOGE ticker symbol, aimed to reduce unnecessary government spending. This connection maintained public awareness of the cryptocurrency. Twelve years after its creation, Dogecoin maintains relevance in a crowded cryptocurrency market. The token has weathered multiple bear markets and increased competition from newer memecoins. Its sustained presence demonstrates the strength of its community and brand recognition.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-07 14:28:41

Developed to meet the requirements of transparency, regulatory alignment, and programmable functionality, MNEE aims to serve digital commerce, enterprise payments, and automated systems. Addressing Stablecoin Infrastructure Gaps The development of MNEE was initiated in response to longstanding challenges observed in existing stablecoin models, including limited reserve transparency, inconsistent compliance frameworks, and technical constraints in automated settlement workflows. MNEE is designed to maintain a 1:1 reserve ratio with U.S. dollars or USD-denominated assets, including short-term U.S. Treasury bills, cash, and cash equivalents. The supply adjusts dynamically based on verified issuance and redemption activity. The stablecoin follows a compliance-first framework that includes Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, identity verification, and ongoing financial crime monitoring. MNEE Limited operates under a Class A Digital Asset Business License from the Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC) of Antigua and Barbuda. Technical Architecture and Chain Support MNEE is currently available on two blockchain platforms. The ERC-20 version enables compatibility with Ethereum-based applications and exchanges, while the 1Sat Ordinals deployment allows for transactions without the need for gas tokens, enabling simplified user interaction. The stablecoin is designed to support future expansion to additional chains based on evolving infrastructure requirements. Applications in Payments and Automation MNEE is structured as a settlement asset for a range of operational environments, including enterprise payments, digital platforms, remittance services, and automated financial workflows. Its architecture supports high-frequency and micro-denominated use cases such as in-app payments, API metering, and backend system integration. Developers can utilize MNEE in programmable payment flows, recurring billing structures, and machine-triggered transactions. These capabilities position MNEE for potential future integration into automation and AI-adjacent systems, pending technical development and adoption. Listing on LBank On November 25, 2025, MNEE was officially listed on the LBank cryptocurrency exchange. This integration provides the stablecoin with broader access to global users and liquidity infrastructure. LBank supports fiat on-ramps and a wide user base across multiple jurisdictions. Governance and Transparency MNEE’s issuance and reserve reporting are designed to meet regulatory and operational integrity standards. Circulating supply and reserve composition are subject to verification and reporting. Internal controls, auditing procedures, and risk monitoring systems are part of the ongoing compliance protocol. Roadmap Overview MNEE’s development will proceed in phases: Phase 1: Core infrastructure deployment, transparency reporting, compliance system activation. Phase 2: Multi-chain expansion, exchange partnerships, and onboarding of enterprise and remittance providers. Phase 3: Advanced automation capabilities, API integrations, and exploratory work on machine-native transaction systems. MNEE Limited has clarified that it does not engage in algorithmic stabilization mechanisms and is not developing algorithmic or synthetic stablecoin models. About MNEE MNEE is a regulated USD stablecoin issued by MNEE Limited, a licensed entity headquartered in Antigua and Barbuda. The stablecoin is designed to offer transparent reserves, cross-chain interoperability, and programmable financial functionality for institutions, platforms, and developers.

The Jack Mallers-led firm joins a long list of Bitcoin companies going public, encouraged by President Trump’s favorable regulatory environment. Twenty One Capital is preparing for its debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol XXI this week by taking direct custody of its Bitcoin holdings. The Bitcoin-focused company announced it will transfer over 43,500 Bitcoins from escrow as part of closing its merger with Cantor Equity Partners. Why is Twenty One Capital moving its Bitcoin? Twenty One Capital’s merger with Cantor Equity Partners required that the 43,500 Bitcoins be held in escrow wallets during the approval process. The tokens came from multiple sources throughout 2025. Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank provided the initial holdings, and additional purchases were made through private investment financing. CEP shareholders approved the merger on December 4, and by December 8, the deal will be closed. Twenty One Capital’s CEO, Jack Mallers, announced the transfer publicly on X to get ahead of any concerns or speculation about the large on-chain movement. In crypto markets, major transfers often spark fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among traders who worry about potential sell-offs. The company will introduce a Bitcoin Per Share metric with real-time on-chain proof of reserves, allowing investors to track holdings transparently. Twenty One Capital’s entry into the stock market Twenty One Capital raised significant capital before going public. Cantor Equity Partners raised $585 million through private investment financing, while Twenty One Capital sold $100 million in convertible notes. If the December 9 listing succeeds, Twenty One Capital will become the first Bitcoin-native company to trade on the NYSE, joining several Bitcoin ETFs already listed on the exchange, including products from BlackRock and Fidelity. Bitcoin prices are currently volatile after the digital asset grew past $100,000 earlier this year. Now, the coin is back up to trading for about $95,000 after dropping below $90,000 in recent weeks. Despite this, Bitcoin and crypto companies are increasingly filing for listings as regulatory conditions improve under the Trump administration. Kraken, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, confidentially filed for an IPO with the SEC on November 19. A day before the filing, Cryptopolitan reported that Kraken announced an $800 million fundraise at a $20 billion valuation. The exchange reported $1.5 billion in revenue for 2024, and the company exceeded that amount in just the first nine months of 2025. Industry analysts expect Kraken to attempt a public debut in the first quarter of 2026. Bitcoin Infrastructure Acquisition Corp listed on Nasdaq on December 2 after pricing its special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) IPO at $10 per unit to raise $200 million. BTC Development Corp, another bitcoin-focused SPAC, opened on Nasdaq on September 30 after raising $220 million.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at approximately $87,870.96. This sudden move has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting urgent questions about the market’s immediate direction. Is this a minor correction or the start of a deeper trend? Let’s analyze the factors at play. What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Decline? Several interconnected factors are contributing to the downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Market sentiment often shifts due to a combination of macroeconomic signals and crypto-specific news. Firstly, broader financial markets have shown weakness, with investors becoming cautious. When traditional assets like stocks falter, capital often flows out of riskier investments like cryptocurrency. Secondly, there has been notable selling pressure from large holders, often called ‘whales,’ moving coins to exchanges. This activity is frequently interpreted as a precursor to selling. Furthermore, regulatory uncertainty continues to cast a long shadow. Any news or speculation about stricter regulations in major economies can trigger swift sell-offs. Finally, technical analysis plays a role. The failure to hold above $88,000 triggered automatic sell orders from traders, accelerating the drop. Understanding these drivers is crucial for navigating the volatility. How Should Investors React to This Volatility? Watching the Bitcoin price swing can be unnerving. However, seasoned investors know that volatility is inherent to the crypto market. The key is to have a strategy rather than react emotionally. Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Ensure your exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): For long-term believers, periodic investments during price dips can lower the average purchase price over time. Set Clear Stop-Losses: Define your risk management parameters in advance to protect your capital from severe downturns. Avoid Panic Selling: Historically, sharp sell-offs have often been followed by recoveries. Making decisions based on fear rarely leads to optimal outcomes. What Does the Technical Analysis Suggest? From a chart perspective, the break below $88,000 is a significant technical event. This level had acted as a support, and its breach opens the door for further testing of lower levels. Analysts are now watching key areas around $85,000 and $82,000 for potential buying interest. The trading volume accompanying this drop is also critical; high volume suggests strong conviction behind the move, while lower volume might indicate a temporary shakeout. Monitoring the Relative Strength Index (RSI) can help identify if Bitcoin is becoming oversold, which could signal a potential near-term bounce. Looking Beyond the Immediate Bitcoin Price Action It’s vital to maintain perspective. While daily price movements capture headlines, Bitcoin’s long-term narrative remains underpinned by its core value propositions: digital scarcity, decentralization, and its role as a potential hedge against inflation. Network fundamentals like hash rate and adoption metrics continue to show strength. Therefore, short-term price corrections, while challenging, do not necessarily invalidate the long-term thesis. They can, in fact, create opportunities for strategic entry points. In conclusion, the drop in the Bitcoin price below $88,000 is a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. It is driven by a mix of macroeconomic headwinds, technical breakdowns, and shifting investor sentiment. Navigating this environment requires a cool head, a solid strategy, and a focus on long-term fundamentals over short-term noise. By understanding the ‘why’ behind the price action, investors can make more informed decisions rather than emotional ones. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin’s price fall below $88,000? A1: The drop is likely due to a combination of factors including broader market weakness, selling pressure from large holders, regulatory concerns, and the triggering of technical sell orders after the support level broke. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A2: It depends on your investment strategy. Some see price dips as buying opportunities, especially for long-term holders practicing dollar-cost averaging. However, always conduct your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose. Q3: How low could the Bitcoin price go? A3> Predicting exact price levels is impossible. Analysts watch key support zones, but market sentiment and external news will ultimately determine the depth of the correction. Q4: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A4> Panic selling during a downturn is rarely advisable. Re-evaluate your original investment thesis. If the long-term fundamentals you believed in are still intact, selling at a loss may not be strategic. Q5: What is the best strategy during high volatility? A5> Sticking to a pre-defined plan is best. This includes proper portfolio diversification, using stop-loss orders for risk management, and avoiding making impulsive decisions based on fear or greed. Q6: Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price updates? A6> Use reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and exchanges for real-time prices. Always cross-reference information from multiple trusted sources. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin price movement helpful? Market insights are best when shared.

What Does “Futures Liquidated” Actually Mean? When we talk about futures being liquidated, we refer to the forced closure of a leveraged trading position. Traders use borrowed funds to amplify their bets on price movements. However, if the market moves against them and their collateral falls below a required level, the exchange automatically sells their position to prevent further loss. This event is a futures liquidation . The recent $144 million wipeout represents thousands of these forced trades happening almost simultaneously, creating a cascade of selling pressure. Breaking Down the Staggering Liquidation Numbers Let’s put these eye-watering figures into perspective. The $144 million in futures liquidated occurred in just 60 minutes. Zooming out, the past 24 hours saw a total of $251 million erased. This data reveals a critical pattern: Short vs. Long Liquidations: A significant portion likely involved long positions (bets on prices rising) being wiped out during a sudden price drop. Market Impact: Such concentrated selling can accelerate downward price movements, creating a feedback loop of more liquidations. Exchange Activity: Major platforms like Binance, Bybit, and OKX typically see the highest volume of these events. Why Do These Massive Liquidations Happen? Understanding the triggers is key to managing risk. A futures liquidation cascade isn’t random; it’s often the result of specific market conditions. High leverage is the primary fuel. When traders overextend with 10x, 50x, or even 100x leverage, even a small price swing against their position can trigger margin calls. Furthermore, low liquidity periods can exacerbate moves, causing prices to slip faster and hitting more stop-loss orders. These events are a stark reminder that the market can remain irrational longer than a trader can remain solvent. How Can Traders Protect Themselves from Liquidation? Surviving volatility requires discipline and smart strategies. First, manage your leverage wisely . Using lower leverage (e.g., 3x-5x instead of 20x) provides a much larger buffer against market swings. Second, always use stop-loss orders to define your maximum risk upfront. Third, never invest more than you can afford to lose in a leveraged product. Remember, the goal of futures trading is sustained profitability, not chasing monumental, high-risk gains that can lead to being liquidated . The Ripple Effect on the Broader Crypto Market These liquidation events don’t occur in a vacuum. A wave of futures liquidated can have a palpable impact on spot market prices. The forced selling creates immediate downward pressure, which can spark fear and prompt further selling from spot holders. This interplay between derivatives and spot markets is crucial for understanding overall market sentiment. Therefore, monitoring liquidation levels can serve as a valuable, albeit grim, gauge of market stress and potential turning points. Conclusion: Navigating the High-Stakes Futures Arena The loss of $144 million in one hour is a powerful lesson in crypto market volatility. Futures liquidation is an inherent risk of leveraged trading, acting as the market’s brutal mechanism for risk reset. While these events create opportunities for some, they devastate the portfolios of others. The key takeaway is unwavering risk management. By respecting leverage, using protective orders, and understanding the mechanics behind these sell-offs, traders can aim to participate in the futures market without becoming another statistic in the next liquidation report. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the difference between a futures liquidation and a stop-loss? A: A stop-loss is an order you place to sell at a specific price to limit your loss. A liquidation is forced by the exchange when your collateral can no longer cover your position’s loss, often happening faster and at a worse price than a planned stop-loss. Q: Who gets the money from liquidated futures positions? A: The exchange uses the remaining collateral from the liquidated position to cover the loss. If a deficit remains, some exchanges use an “insurance fund” filled by fees, while others may implement a process called “auto-deleveraging” on profitable traders. Q: Can liquidations cause a crypto price to crash? A: Yes, they can accelerate a move. A large cluster of long liquidations forces sell orders, pushing the price down, which can trigger more liquidations in a cascading effect, sometimes called a “long squeeze.” Q: Are futures liquidations more common in crypto than traditional markets? A: Yes, primarily due to the 24/7 market, higher typical leverage offered, and generally greater volatility in cryptocurrency prices compared to established traditional asset classes. Q: What tools can I use to track liquidation data? A: Websites like Coinglass and Bybit provide real-time liquidation heatmaps and charts, showing amounts, whether they are long or short positions, and across which exchanges. Q: Is it possible to profit from a liquidation event? A: Some experienced traders anticipate these events. They might open positions opposite the crowded trade (e.g., shorting if many are over-leveraged long) or look to buy assets at a discount after a liquidation-driven sell-off.

Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market continues to experience a widespread correction, weighing down the price growth of several assets. Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin: A Positive Sign For Altcoins? Ethereum has shown more resilience in the last month than Bitcoin, which is largely interpreted as a bullish signal for altcoin enthusiasts. In the last week alone, the prominent altcoin reported a slight market gain of 0.86% compared to Bitcoin’s loss of 1.95%. When Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin, it encourages increased altcoin activity, as investor confidence spreads beyond the market leader into the broader crypto ecosystem. However, a full altcoin market takeover only comes into effect after the following technical developments. Firstly, de Poppe explains that Bitcoin, as the market leader, must achieve a breakthrough above $92,000 resistance, potentially testing the $100,000 mark, to signal renewed market strength. Additionally, the analyst states the ETH/BTC ratio must stay above its 20-day moving average (MA), indicating Ethereum’s continued dominance and further encouraging altcoin accumulation. Together, these signals could set the technical bedrock for a significant altcoin rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break $97K To Restore Confidence Among Youngest Long-Term Holders – Details Macro Factors Could Amplify Altcoin Gains Beyond crypto-specific indicators, de Poppe also touches on broader financial market plays that could initiate the next altcoin move. The analyst suggests that a 5-10% correction in gold prices, coupled with a peak in silver, could encourage capital to flow into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies including cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a strong upward movement in the Nasdaq would indicate increased investor risk appetite, a development that often translates into heightened activity in the crypto markets. When combined with positive momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum, these macro signals could create an environment ripe for a substantial altcoin rally. According to de Poppe, the fulfillment of these conditions indicates that altcoins could achieve market gains of 200%-300% in the present market cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Signs Of Accumulation As CVD Strengthens And Correlation Stays Elevated Market Overview At the time of writing, the total cryptocurrency market is valued at $3.04 trillion, following a significant 15.5% decline over the past month. Meanwhile, the altcoin market cap stands at $1.26 trillion, accounting for 41.44% of all circulating digital assets. In tandem, data from CoinMarketCap shows the altseason index at 20/100, as Bitcoin still maintains a dominant grip on overall market performance, with a 58.6% dominance. In short, the conditions for a full-scale altcoin breakout have yet to materialize, but the key indicators highlighted above suggest that scenario may be approaching if momentum shifts decisively toward risk assets.

A DeFi Altcoin of $0.035 is beginning to surface in long-term models that have a strong upside potential. There are investors who declare that the following cycle can provide a unique form to the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and it is currently estimated that the expansion window will range between 550%t and 900% by 2027. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): How It Works, P2C, P2P and APY Mutuum Finance is developing the dual environment of lending, where it will be Peer to Contract first, and Peer to Peer second. When trading in the P2C market, the assets lent out by users include ETH or USDT and the returns in the form of the mtTokens increase as the borrowers pay the maturity rates. The borrowers in the P2P market enter into direct agreements with the lenders. Rates of interest induce movement with liquidity. Borrowing remains cheap when there is a high level of liquidity. When the pool becomes narrow, rates run higher. Lending to value ratios are used to determine the safety of borrowing. Liquidations can be the case when a collateral is less than a given point. The liquidators pay up some debt and get the discounted collateral to keep the system at par. Mutuum Finance started with the price of $0.01 at the beginning of the year 2025. It currently sells at $0.035 which is a 250% positive change throughout development. The project has been active and collected nearly $19.1M, received a total of over 18,300 holders, and sold over 810M tokens. Security Framework and V1 Timeline The official team account of the X confirmed that the V1 testnet will be launched in Q4 2025. V1 will launch the liquidation engine, debt module and lending pool, mtTokens. At launch, ETH and USDT will be supported. This step involves the change of planning to live testing. One of the emphasis areas has been on security. Mutuum Finance has passed an 90/100 Token Scan CertiK audit. The lending contracts are reviewed by Halborn Security . There is an open bug bounty of 50K, which will be granted to identify code problems prior to V1 launching. Depending on the initial growth, lending demand and the next coming launch, various analysts model a 4X to 6X increase in current lending demand levels. These assessments incorporate the framework of the protocol, increased activity as well as anticipated liquidity growth. MtTokens and Buy Pressure One of the most powerful drivers of values in the Mutuum Finance system is called mTokens. They appreciate the repayment of interest by the borrowers. There is an initiation cost to borrowing in ETH, which is that a user is given increasing with the growth of the activity. This model of reward is associated with utilization but not with inflation. Mutuum Finance is designed to use a buy-and-distribute model also. A fraction of the platform revenue purchases MUTM in the market. Users who stake mtTokens are given purchased tokens. This generates an aggressive purchase force because the protocol increases. The potential of 8x to 12x upside is present in models of the analyst, which also contain mtTokens, buy pressure, and reliable oracles, as soon as the lending system starts being scaled. The reason some analysts consider MUTM the next XRP Some analysts have compared Mutuum Finance to the initial stages of Ripple (XRP). The reason why XRP took off was that it was based on utility, speed and had a clear use case where the majority of tokens lacked any form. It expanded very fast after the users realized the functionality of the technology. The same trend is followed at Mutuum Finance. It is young and organized and framed on the actual economic activity. It is developing yield of mtTokens, a virtual based lending and controls of automatic liquidation. It has a stablecoin in its roadmap together with an extension of its layers 2 and security stack that is certified by CertiK and Halborn. These characteristics put MUTM in a better spot over most of the early-stage tokens. Due to it, certain long-term predictions of 2025-2028 indicate possible improvement of up to 550% to 900% at the prospect of adoption growth, borrowing settles and the stablecoin provides additional liquidity. Final Outlook Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has increased 250% and raised over $19.1M, has had good audit outcomes and gearing up to run to its Q4 V1 testnet. and with the developing of mtTokens, buys pressure, oracle, and comparing with early XRP growth structures, the project is getting attention in top crypto discourse circles going on the next round. In case the demand stays the same and the protocol achieves its future milestones, Mutuum Finance might turn into one of the most observed new crypto breakout contenders in the next 2026 and further.

Its Colocation Services now deliver higher gross margins of 26% compared to its mining operations and are expected to reach up to ~80% on new CRWV contracts. CORZ-CRWV's partnership notably reduces CORZ's capital/balance sheet burden and secures its AI growth opportunities over the next decade. Thanks to the recent double-digit meltdown, CORZ appears a lot more compelling here, significantly aided by the partial commencement of its backlog monetization from FY2026 onwards. It goes without saying that the stock is likely to remain volatile in the near term, attributed to its elevated short interest ratio and the fluctuating bitcoin spot prices. I previously covered CoreWeave, Inc. (CRWV) and TeraWulf Inc. (WULF) in November 2025, discussing how the market-wide AI-related correction had already triggered their cheaper valuations, with their expanding multi-year backlogs sustaining their high-growth theses. In this article, I shall discuss Core Scientific ( CORZ ) and share my findings about the stock, continuing the theme surrounding Bitcoin miners, which transitioned to High Performance Computing [HPC] providers during the ongoing multi-year cloud supercycle. CORZ Joins The AI Band Wagon For the uninitiated, CORZ is a company that was previously generating revenue as a Bitcoin miner for internal needs and third party customers, before diversifying to be an HPC provider from March 2024 onwards. This development may be attributed to the insatiable demand for compute power and the ongoing AI boom across the infrastructure/SaaS layers, as observed in the hyperscalers'/neoclouds' robust cloud-related revenues in the Q3 '25 earnings season and their guidance of higher data center/AI chip-related capex trends in 2026. As a result of the promising industry trends, it is unsurprising that CORZ has also jumped on the AI bandwagon while following in the footsteps of its digital asset mining peers, including CRWV and WULF , allowing them to better monetize their existing "" energy-intensive sites and power contracts."" Despite the nascency of CORZ's Colocation Services at 18.4% of its FQ3 '25 overall revenues, their ability to monetize the ongoing data center boom is undeniable indeed, based on the Colocation Services' richer gross profit margin of 26% in FQ3 '25 (+13.6 points YoY). This is compared to its digital asset self-mining margins of -3.4% (+6 points YoY) and digital asset hosted mining margins of 23.1% (-6.3 points YoY). Moving forward, CORZ has hinted at their ability to deliver Colocation Services gross margins of up to 80% as well, based on CRWV's 12Y commitment of up to ~590 MW in power infrastructure at an anticipated annualized revenue of ~$850M. Most importantly, the current CORZ-CRWV deal has been structured quite strategically, with CRWV funding most of the data center build costs at up to $1.5M per MW and CORZ only responsible for the additional 70MW expansion , with it naturally underscoring the latter's capex prudence thus far: From a capital perspective, CoreWeave is funding virtually all of the CapEx associated with these deployments . Our only direct capital outlay on the contract is the $104 million associated with the 70-megawatt expansion we announced during our last earnings call. That structure significantly reduces our capital burden, keeps our balance sheet leverage like compared to peers and gives us the flexibility to use debt more strategically for future growth . ( Seeking Alpha ) This is on top of the CORZ-CRWV ""take-or-pay fixed price contract,"" with CRWV ""contractually committed to paying for the capacity we deliver, regardless of utilization"" - with it mitigating the risks arising from any future changes in AI compute demand. These reasons are also why I am confident about CORZ's ability to report a relatively healthy balance sheet moving forward, compared to the current net debt of $605.5M (-173.2% YoY), once its capacity buildout is completed and the growing backlog is monetized. CORZ's High-Growth HPC Prospects As More Power Kicks In At the same time, CORZ has also hinted at the ""signing of at least one new colocation customer"" and the addition of a ""new major power contract and site in a top US market"" in the upcoming FQ4 '25 earnings call, allowing them to eventually diversify their customer concentration beyond CRWV. For example, the management has highlighted their existing 1GW client billable power capacity and the potential expansion opportunity to ~2.2GW in billable power capacity across bitcoin mining/HPC opportunities moving forward, up notably from the FY2025 HPC capacity of 250 MW . While the bitcoin mining operations may comprise the majority of CORZ's sales in FY2025, I expect things to change drastically in the near-term, as similarly observed in the consensus forward estimates above and the management's guidance: We employ our own fleet of computers (“miners”) to earn digital assets for our own account and we are in the process of converting most of our existing facilities to support artificial intelligence-related (“AI”) workloads and next generation colocation services ... in a manner designed to retain access to electrical power under our control, maximize the value of our digital asset mining equipment to third parties, and fulfill our existing obligations to suppliers and customers. ( Seeking Alpha ) These reasons are also why CORZ may very well deliver renewed HPC top/bottom-line growth opportunity beyond the prior bitcoin mining operations, thanks to the typically higher premium linked to HPC services, as similarly observed in the richer Colocation Services gross margins and that observed in its peers . The Conse nsus Forward Estimates Seeking Alpha With 250MW of the CORZ-CRWV capacity expected to kick in by the end of 2025 and another 350MW by early 2027, I am of the opinion that CORZ is likely to report an outsized FY2026 performance aided by the easier YoY comparison from FY2025 levels. Assuming that CORZ is able to obtain the additional power capacity over the next few years, I am of the opinion that they may report robust growth beyond the current CORZ-CRWV deal as well. CRWV's Failed Acquisition Tells A Promising Story CORZ Valuations Seeking Alpha CORZ has proven to be a beneficiary of the AI (gold) rush as well, with the now rejected acquisition deal by CRWV previously valuing the former at a hefty sum of $9B or the equivalent annualized FQ2 '25 EV/Sales valuations of 28.62x . These numbers do not appear to be overly aggressive as well, based on the projected expansion in its power capacity and the outsized monetization opportunities in its HPC/bitcoin mining operations over the next few years of the cloud supercycle. These reasons are also why I agree with CORZ's shareholders, in which the $9B sum appears relatively cheap at the long-term EV/sales valuations of 10.58x, based on the CORZ-CRWV deal's anticipated annualized revenue of ~$850M. For now, despite the relatively modest $270M breakup fee along with the bursting AI bubble by early November 2025 and thus rendering those valuations temporarily moot, CORZ has managed to settle at a notably decent FWD EV/Sales valuation of 15.69x compared to its direct peers, such as CRWV at 11.03x and WULF at 36.35x. Once part of its backlog kicks in from FY2026 onward, I am of the opinion that CORZ is likely to be cheaper at my estimated FY2026 EV/Sales valuations of 7.39x, based on the current Enterprise Value of $5.84B and the consensus FY2026 revenue estimates of $789.21M. When compared to its neocloud/hyperscaler peers, including: DigitalOcean ( DOCN ) at FWD EV/Sales valuations of 6.22x, Nebius ( NBIS ) at 44.36x, Amazon ( AMZN ) at 3.57x, Alphabet ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) at 9.52x, and Microsoft ( MSFT ) at 10.92x... ...it is apparent that CORZ remains compellingly valued for the immense growth opportunities over the next decade or so. CORZ Is A Compelling Buy After The Correction CORZ 1Y Stock Price Trading View For now, CORZ has already lost part of its Q4 '25 gains, albeit seemingly well supported at the November 2025 bottom of $14s as the stock also consolidates nearer to its 100 day moving averages by the time of writing. CORZ Technical Indicators Trading View Based on the technical indicators above, the bulls have seemingly defended a new trading floor as well, based on the oversold RSIs and the seemingly bottoming trading volumes since mid November 2025. Combined with the improved margin of safety arising from the deep correction from the 52-week heights/the recent sideways trading, the cheap valuations from its secure growth prospects over the next decade, and the likely to be rich bottom-lines as they monetize the growing backlog from FY2026 onwards, I am initiating a Buy rating for the CORZ stock here. Risks Tied To Its Investment Thesis It goes without saying that CORZ is likely to remain rather volatile in the intermediate term, attributed to its rather elevated short interest ratio of 20.59% by the time of writing despite the prior meltdown. This is on top of the risks arising from its volatile bitcoin mining operations, attributed to: The cryptocurrency's halving event in 2024 (typically reducing the reward for mining new blocks by 50%, which impacts the supply and speculatively the price of Bitcoin), The bitcoin trade/fluctuating spot prices, and The reduced supply to be mined at ~1.07M moving forward ( ~5% of overall supply at 21M), with the recent correction in the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) spot prices by -26.6% from the 52-week high likely to trigger near-term noise in its upcoming FQ4 '25 earnings call.",CRWV|CORZ,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-07 15:00:00

Bitcoin continues to dominate the market with a 59.6% share, and its recent struggle to hold bullish momentum has not translated into any meaningful boost for altcoins. Related Reading: Italy’s Market Watchdog Gives Crypto Firms A Clear Order: Act Or Exit Broader sentiment has weakened as well, with the CMC Altcoin Season Index registering just 20, which still places the entire market in a Bitcoin-favored phase. Meanwhile, a critical indication has been detected from on-chain data that suggests this may be a rare moment to accumulate strong altcoin positions before conditions eventually turn. Altcoins Stay Subdued As Market Sentiment Worsens Altcoin performance has really been lagging behind Bitcoin throughout this year, and the persistent weakness is now being reflected across multiple market indicators. Bitcoin’s dominance has only increased, meaning the capital rotation that typically sparks an altcoin season has yet to begin. The wait for an altcoin breakout has now stretched far longer than many anticipated. Even as the Bitcoin price is struggling, traders have not redirected liquidity toward altcoins. The leading cryptocurrency is now down by 28.9% from its October all-time high of $126,080. Instead, altcoins have also stayed muted, and their combined market cap shows no signs of outperforming the leading cryptocurrency. Data from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index shows the reading is currently at 20. The low reading shows that altcoins are still losing ground relative to Bitcoin. To put this into context, the index was at a reading of 83 this time last year. CMC Altcoin Season Index The sentiment is also evident in CoinMarketCap’s Fear and Greed Index, which is now at 22. Readings this low signal hesitation across the market, as investors shy away from taking new positions, and this environment makes an altcoin season much harder to materialize. CMC crypto fear and greed index CryptoQuant Data Signals A High-Value Accumulation Window Technical analysis using data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows that altcoin traders may be entering another window that has frequently been favorable for accumulation. The data compares the 30-day trading volume of altcoins against their yearly average and finds that current volumes have slipped back below that long-term line. Each time this pattern has appeared in past cycles, it marked a period when activity was unusually quiet and traders were hesitant, but it also tended to show up just before the market picked up again. Related Reading: A New Era Begins: CFTC Approves Spot Bitcoin On Regulated US Markets According to the analysis, this drop in volume can be called a “buying zone,” which is a phase where dollar-cost averaging into selective altcoins has often paid off over time. These low-volume stretches can last for weeks or even months, giving investors enough room to build their positions gradually.

His comments were based on an argument claiming that Bitcoin’s properties could be copied by simply recreating its code. This, in turn, was based on comments regarding a debate between Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff. Inside The Zhao-Schiff Debate On Bitcoin’s Value During their discussion at the Binance Blockchain Week , Schiff stated that a token backed by gold is grounded in physical utility because the token merely represents ownership of a scarce commodity used by industries across the world. He contrasted this with Bitcoin, which he claimed derives its value from faith and has no practical use. Zhao countered by pointing out that even physical gold is difficult to divide or verify without additional processes, noting that he once received a gold bar as a gift but could not break it or confirm its purity without specialized tools. He contrasted this directly with Bitcoin, which can be transferred and verified instantly through the blockchain. Again, Schiff responded by insisting that Bitcoin remains worthless to him because you can’t do anything with it, while gold carries intrinsic industrial demand. Zhao pushed back by highlighting that Bitcoin’s utility is tied to its transparent network, fixed supply, and verifiable ownership. He argued that unlike gold, whose total global reserves are uncertain, Bitcoin offers perfect clarity about supply and movement. The debate eventually escalated into a broader argument over value, with Schiff insisting Bitcoin has only speculative worth, while Zhao maintained that its network and transparency serve as the foundation for its trillion-dollar market capitalization. “We’ll agree to disagree,” Zhao said . Comment Raises Question: Can Bitcoin Be Replicated? Following the debate, a viewer commented that Bitcoin’s uniqueness is overstated because someone could simply replicate it. The comment noted , “How long would it take to replicate Bitcoin? Create a new one, exactly the same. How much would it cost?” It was this claim, rooted in Schiff’s argument that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic qualities, that led to David Schwartz entering the conversation. Schwartz responded with a rhetorical question that cuts through the idea entirely. He asked how the new Bitcoin could be new and exactly the same as the original one. He continued, “And how would the existence of replicas of Bitcoin affect Bitcoin?” His point echoed Zhao’s argument about verifiability. A replica may copy Bitcoin’s code, but it cannot copy the network of users, miners, institutions, and real-time validation that give Bitcoin its identity. The existence of another chain does not dilute Bitcoin’s legitimacy any more than counterfeit gold reduces the value of real gold when proper verification exists. It also goes back to the comment by Changpeng Zhao that Bitcoin can be easily verified in multiple ways, unlike gold.

He cautions that the private key must never leave the device under any circumstances. In an X post replying to an executive, CZ praised a particular hardware wallet he reviewed in a social media post for adhering to that standard — but emphasised that the on-device isolation of private keys was not a “nice to have,” it was the “decisive criterion” for security-minded users. CZ also pointed out that any wallet should be viewed sceptically if it is unable to ensure that the private key never leaves the device. The comments follow CZ’s and gold advocate Peter Schiff’s sparring over what should back digital money during a headline debate at Binance Blockchain Week on Thursday in Dubai. CZ highlights hardware wallets as the frontline defense against hacks For many crypto users and traders, hardware wallets — sometimes referred to as “cold wallets” — are the gold standard of security, as they store private keys offline, away from internet-connected devices that are susceptible to hacking. Under CZ’s definition , this isolation must be absolute, meaning the key must remain inside the hardware device at all times. The CZ’s focus reflects how the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem is increasingly concerned about such security threats, alongside the security hurdles posed by phishing, malicious malware, and hacking. As more and more users transition to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Web3, private key exposure has become the Achilles’ heel. Concentrating on hardware wallet key isolation, CZ is exposing a fundamental flaw that many may overlook . More broadly, this clear need also follows a best practice within the cryptocurrency industry. Hardware wallets are based on certified, tamper-resistant chips, never leak private keys externally, and those are still among the safest ways to cold-store them. CZ sounds alarm as crypto adoption rises and self-custody risks grow The timing of CZ’s comment is striking. In 2025, the industry is expected to expand rapidly as more users are introduced to cryptocurrency and begin to consider self-custody solutions, such as hardware wallets or keyless wallets offered by exchange/wallet vendors. However, with ever-greater focus comes a more significant potential threat. Hackers , scammers, and malicious actors frequently target wallet backups, seed phrases, and private keys, especially when these keys are stored or managed improperly. For CZ, by striking a hard line, with “private key must never leave the device,” the fragility of self-custody and the high bar for safe implementation are underscored. CZ had long been a prominent advocate of self‑custody, but also a realist. He has previously cautioned that if users misplace their keys or backups, the results of poorly managed self‑custody can be catastrophic. Most leading crypto experts have been vocal about the importance of self-custody and hardware wallet security, echoing the same refrain as Binance CEO’s stance that private keys must never leave the device. The principle is on e An dreas M. Antonopoulos has long advocated for, cautioning that money on an exchange or custodial system is automatically vulnerable, with the mantra “not your keys, not your Bitcoin.” Get seen where it counts.

According to live data from Binance, Bitcoin is currently trading at $89,029.43 against USDT. This significant milestone isn’t just a number—it represents a wave of renewed confidence and could signal the next phase for the world’s premier digital asset. Let’s unpack what’s driving this surge and what it means for your portfolio. What’s Fueling the Current BTC Price Surge? Several key factors are converging to push the BTC price to new heights. First, institutional adoption continues to grow, with major financial firms increasing their Bitcoin holdings. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, are driving investors toward hard assets like Bitcoin. Finally, positive regulatory developments in several countries are reducing uncertainty and building a more stable foundation for growth. Moreover, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the rate of new coin creation, is historically a major catalyst for price appreciation. Investors are positioning themselves ahead of this supply shock, creating sustained buying pressure that we see reflected in the current BTC price action. How Does This Rally Compare to Previous BTC Price Highs? Reaching $89,000 puts Bitcoin in rare territory, but how does this rally feel different? The market structure appears more robust. We are seeing: Stronger Fundamentals: Network usage and institutional custody are at all-time highs. Broader Acceptance: Bitcoin is now part of corporate treasuries and ETF offerings. Reduced Volatility: While still present, large price swings are less extreme than in previous cycles. This suggests the current BTC price increase may be supported by deeper, more sustainable demand, rather than purely speculative frenzy. However, it’s crucial to remain vigilant, as the crypto market is known for its unpredictability. What Should Investors Do as the BTC Price Climbs? Watching the BTC price climb can trigger both excitement and anxiety. The key is to have a strategy. For long-term holders, this rally validates the ‘hold’ philosophy, but it might also be a time to rebalance portfolios. For new investors, consider dollar-cost averaging—investing a fixed amount regularly—to mitigate the risk of buying at a short-term peak. Always remember the golden rules: never invest more than you can afford to lose, secure your assets in a private wallet, and base decisions on research, not fear or greed. The BTC price journey is a marathon, not a sprint. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s breakthrough above $89,000 is a electrifying moment that captures the dynamic spirit of the cryptocurrency revolution. It demonstrates growing mainstream trust and the evolving role of Bitcoin as a digital store of value. While future price movements are never guaranteed, this milestone strengthens the narrative of Bitcoin’s long-term potential. The journey continues, and staying informed is your greatest asset.

That’s exactly what happened to ChatGPT Plus subscribers recently, sparking a major controversy around OpenAI ‘s approach to promotional messages . The incident has raised critical questions about the future of AI advertising and user trust in premium AI services. What Sparked the ChatGPT Ads Controversy? In early December 2025, paying ChatGPT Plus users began reporting unexpected promotional messages appearing in their conversations. One user, Benjamin De Kraker, shared a screenshot showing ChatGPT suggesting Target shopping options during a conversation about Windows BitLocker encryption. “I’m in ChatGPT (paid Plus subscription), asking about Windows BitLocker and it’s showing me ADS TO SHOP AT TARGET,” he tweeted, capturing the frustration many users felt. The user backlash was immediate and intense. Subscribers who pay $20 monthly for ChatGPT Plus expressed outrage at what appeared to be traditional advertising interrupting their AI interactions. The controversy highlights the delicate balance AI companies must maintain between monetization and user experience. OpenAI’s Response: Confusion and Contradiction The company’s response to the ChatGPT ads controversy revealed internal confusion. ChatGPT head Nick Turley initially dismissed concerns, stating “There are no live tests for ads – any screenshots you’ve seen are either not real or not ads.” However, OpenAI’s chief research officer Mark Chen offered a more apologetic tone, acknowledging the company “fell short” with recent promotional messages . Key points from OpenAI’s response: Disabled the controversial suggestion system Acknowledged the messages felt like advertisements Promised better controls for users to manage suggestions Emphasized no financial component to the suggestions The Real Story Behind the Promotional Messages According to OpenAI executives, the controversial messages weren’t traditional advertisements but rather suggestions for apps built on the ChatGPT platform announced in October 2025. The company claims these were part of testing ways to showcase third-party applications without any “financial component.” However, users remained skeptical, with one responding: “Bruhhh… Don’t insult your paying users.” What OpenAI Said User Perception Reality Check App suggestions, not ads Traditional advertising Blurred line between promotion and utility No financial component Monetization strategy Potential future revenue stream Testing phase Live implementation Poorly communicated feature rollout Why This ChatGPT Ads Issue Matters for AI’s Future The controversy comes at a critical time for OpenAI . Earlier this year, the company hired former Instacart and Facebook executive Fidji Sumo as CEO of Applications, signaling potential moves toward advertising. However, a recent memo from CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red,” prioritizing ChatGPT quality improvements over other products including advertising. This incident reveals three critical challenges for AI companies: Monetization Pressure: As AI development costs soar, companies face pressure to generate revenue User Trust: Premium subscribers expect ad-free experiences Communication: Poorly explained features can damage brand reputation Lessons from the AI Advertising Backlash The user backlash against ChatGPT ads provides valuable lessons for all AI companies considering monetization strategies: Transparency is Crucial: Users need clear communication about feature changes Value Alignment: Promotional content must align with user expectations Control Matters: Users demand options to customize their experience Timing is Everything: Testing sensitive features requires careful planning FAQs About the OpenAI ChatGPT Ads Controversy What exactly were users seeing in ChatGPT? Users reported seeing promotional messages for companies like Peloton and Target during their ChatGPT conversations, despite paying for the Plus subscription. How did OpenAI respond to the complaints? OpenAI initially denied running ads, then acknowledged the messages felt like advertisements and disabled the feature while improving the model’s precision. Who are the key executives involved in this situation? Nick Turley (ChatGPT head) and Mark Chen (Chief Research Officer) provided conflicting responses, while CEO Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on quality improvements. Was this actually advertising or something else? OpenAI claims these were suggestions for apps built on their platform with no financial component, but users perceived them as traditional advertisements. What does this mean for ChatGPT Plus subscribers? The company promises better controls allowing users to dial down or turn off suggestions they don’t find helpful. The Bottom Line: Trust is the Real Currency The ChatGPT ads controversy serves as a stark reminder that in the AI industry, user trust is more valuable than any advertising revenue. OpenAI ‘s misstep with promotional messages demonstrates how quickly user backlash can erupt when expectations aren’t met. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, companies must prioritize transparent communication and user-centric design over rapid monetization strategies. The incident also highlights the growing pains of the AI industry as it transitions from research-focused organizations to sustainable businesses. How companies navigate this transition will determine their long-term success and user loyalty.

Traders watch the market drift, yet the coin resists deeper losses while new inflows support demand. U.S. spot XRP ETFs record 16 straight days of net inflows and push total assets towards $1B. WisdomTree points out that XRP ranks as the only major token that shows a year-to-date gain during a red month for crypto. This resilience sets the stage for Bitwise’s sudden shift toward Ripple. Source: WisdomTree Bitwise Says XRP’s Regulatory Era Has Finally Changed Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan explains that the firm waited years before building an XRP ETF . He says the reason sits in plain sight. The SEC lawsuit created an existential cloud over XRP. No institution wanted a digital asset that could vanish under regulatory pressure. No major company wanted to build real products on top of a blockchain that faced a direct challenge from the regulator. He recalls how the lawsuit harmed adoption, not because the tech lacked strength, but because uncertainty ruled every decision. Ripple could not secure the partnerships its supporters talked about for years. Investors hesitated. Developers kept their distance. Institutions refused to touch the asset until the courtroom dust settled. Hougan says the entire dynamic shifted the moment the legal battle ended in August. He believes the network finally stands on even ground with other large-cap assets. He says XRP now holds a real chance to chase the global use cases that Ripple’s community champions. He also notes that once the threat disappeared, Bitwise moved fast. The firm had the ticker ready. The company wanted to offer a simple, clean gateway for every institution that waited for clarity. That gateway now exists in the form of the XRP ETF . The XRP ETF Launch Proves Investor Appetite Runs Deep Bitwise’s ETF did not launch quietly. The product recorded $25.7 million in trading volume on its first day and reached $107.6 million in assets under management. Hougan says this early surge confirms that institutions never lacked interest. They only lacked a safe, compliant structure that fit their mandates. ETFs solve this issue. Funds, family offices, and traditional firms prefer this format because it gives exposure without technical hurdles. The momentum continued across the first three days. Bitwise funds received $135 million of inflows. The streak now runs for 16 days straight across the U.S. market. The steady climb toward $1B in total XRP ETF assets signals a turning point for Ripple and its ecosystem. Why Bitwise Believes XRP Can Compete Globally Now Hougan argues that the post-lawsuit era creates space for XRP to compete in cross-border finance. The network runs a ledger that many analysts call battle-tested. Demand for regulated, compliant products aligns with Ripple’s long-term goals. Institutions now enter the market without fear. Retail traders gain a clear benchmark for price discovery. Liquidity deepens as new channels open. XRP now steps into the flow of capital it spent years locked out of. Institutional Flows Push XRP Into a New Phase XRP’s slow, steady strength contrasts with the broader market slump. The market watches Bitcoin and Ethereum weaken , yet XRP holds a tight line. Bitwise calls this behavior a sign of quiet accumulation. The ETF era gives the asset a new front door, and investors walk straight through it. Hougan says the message is simple: the game changed, the risk vanished, and the door to global finance now stands wide open for Ripple and XRP.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-07 15:42:04

Although Ripple boasts strong institutional adoption as well as its ecosystem, its recent dynamics show that more of its existing buyers are in the loss category, thus motivating its holders to seek other assets with better growth dynamics. Among the most sought-after projects coming into the fold is that of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently priced only at $0.035, MUTM represents the new crypto coin within the DeFi crypto market that has managed to quickly gain popularity, with more than 18,330 participants signing up for its presale, with $19.15 million collected. Having entered its phase 6, the presale is near completion in this phase, showing intense interest as well as early adoption dynamics for this forthcoming digital currency. Unlike other altcoins, which mostly entice with promise, MUTM boasts a completely operational decentralized lending and borrowing system, along with interest-generating assets, as well as yield-based rewards, with its impending launch with its V1 Sepolia testnet within Q4 of 2025. XRP Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) has witnessed one of its most intense leverage flushes in recent years, which has significantly altered the sentiment within the Ripple ecosystem, rendering the Ripple (XRP) token structurally weak. Futures open interest plummeted a huge 59% (down from 1.7B to 0.7B in XRP terms), with the cost of borrowing ticking down from 0.01% closer to zero, implying that leveraged traders are taking a back seat, allowing the Ripple (XRP) market some much-needed air. This, alongside some profit-taking with every marginal pull-back, alongside a top-heavy distribution, shows that many recent participants are sitting on losses, thus diminishing the support that was rendered through the leveraged side. In this scenario, traders would do well to be more prudent, allowing the space for more early-stage coins with better, working utility, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is rapidly emerging as the DeFi crypto solution with solid fundamentals. MUTM Presale Accelerates as Phase 6 Nears Completion Mutuum Finance began its presale in early 2025 with a price of $0.01 per token. However, since then, the price keeps escalating, reaching a point of $0.035 in Phase 6, with a remarkable increase of 250% before the launch. With every phase previous selling out within a short time, this goes to show that there is more ardent interest in the project. Since this stage is almost completely sold, this presale stage is marked as one of the most active so far. However, participants realize that once this stage is over, the cost will soon escalate higher towards the launch value. Currently, this presale has raised more than $19.15 million. MUTM is not just any altcoin; it is a new crypto coin with full DeFi crypto functionality, making it highly attractive for early investors. Global Adoption The base of holders for MUTM is still expanding fast, with more than 18,330 holders. This shows more early adopters as well as new investors showing interest in the presale for the first time. Mutuum Finance is well accepted within worldwide crypto communities. Of the entire 4 billion MUTM tokens, 45.5% or 1.82 billion will be used for the presale. Over 800 million of the coins are already sold, with very few remaining. This is increasing the hype as the value will increase closer to the launch price of $0.06 as soon as this phase is complete. It is for this reason that MUTM is considered the new crypto coin for accumulation in the early stages of investment in 2026. Its DeFi crypto ecosystem offers lending, borrowing, and yield rewards that differentiate it from other altcoins. Roadmap Progress and Protocol Development Mutuum Finance is currently working on its roadmap’s Phase 2, which revolves around further development of the basic infrastructure of the protocol. Implementations of this stage would comprise smart contracts, backend infrastructure, risk models, liquidations, as well as analytics. The constant updates presented by the project development team clearly indicate that they remain committed to delivering a secure, scalable, as well as well-performing DeFi crypto solution, which could increase MUTM adoption rates once version 1 of the protocol goes live. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised almost $19.15 million with more than 18,330 contributors, with Phase 6 being near sold out. The token has already seen a huge increase of 250% from $0.01 to $0.035, with prices expected to increase further to $0.06. In Q4, 2025, the V1 Sepolia testnet will provide a comprehensive new crypto coin DeFi crypto solution. Purchase MUTM securely via the Presale page before the completion of Phase 6.

In his update on X, Saylor gave the message of “returning to the orange dots”, which signifies BTC purchases. Saylor's public release of this data has created strong expectations that the company could announce a new Bitcoin purchase very soon, often the next day, as has been seen repeatedly in the past. According to the data shared, Strategy's total Bitcoin holdings have reached 650,000 BTC. The portfolio's current value is $57.67 billion, with an average cost of $74,436. This massive position, at current prices, has generated a 19.20% profit for the company, with total unrealized profits reportedly exceeding $9.29 billion. This chart, which Saylor regularly shares, also provides indirect market insights into the company's Bitcoin buying cycle. Related News: Tulip Mania Debate Continues on Bitcoin - Bloomberg Analyst Puts an End to It To date, Strategy has reportedly made a total of 88 different acquisitions. In most of these acquisitions, Saylor shared similar “Bitcoin Tracker” information immediately before the announcements. Therefore, the prevailing market view is that Saylor's post is a precursor to a new acquisition announcement. On the other hand, the performance chart shows a striking divergence over the past year. Strategy's shares have lost -54.69% of their value over the year, while Bitcoin has declined -12.30% during the same period. The 42.39-point difference between these two performances suggests that the company's reliance on Bitcoin through a highly leveraged position makes it more aggressive during corrections. Despite this, Saylor's strategy shows no signs of reversal; on the contrary, it continues to treat every pullback as a long-term opportunity. *This is not investment advice.

The leading business intelligence and Bitcoin Treasury company, Strategy, has taken a similar approach, aiming to protect its bitcoin (BTC) holdings and shareholder interests over the coming months. According to a weekly report from CryptoQuant, Strategy is creating a U.S. dollar reserve funded entirely by at-the-market (ATM) issuance of new MSTR common stock. The reserve, expected to be worth more than $1.44 billion, will be managed separately from the entity’s Bitcoin Reserve. This development will make the firm a dual-reserve company. Strategy Unveils $1.44B Reserve Through the reserve, Strategy will handle cash dividends for preferred stock classes, which would cost roughly $700 million per year. The company will also cover short-term liquidity needs during capital market tightening, as well as interest on outstanding convertible bonds. Additionally, the reserve will also strengthen Strategy’s balance sheet by providing cash coverage for fixed obligations over the next 12-24 months. While the firm will avoid the need to sell its BTC holdings at low prices, it may have to offload a few assets or Bitcoin derivatives as part of the risk-management options. The dual-reserve model consists of long-duration BTC holdings and short-duration U.S. dollar liquidity that reduces the risk of BTC sales during downturns. Strategy no longer treats its holdings as untouchable across all market phases. Although BTC remains the center of the firm’s long-term thesis, the company is intent on maintaining a framework that defends the stash through cash buffers and hedging. Softened Demand and Reduced Selling Pressure Strategy’s latest move represents a major shift away from its Bitcoin accumulation model amid bearish conditions. On-chain signals suggest that BTC may have a weak 2026. Strategy has moved from just issuing equity and convertible bonds to buy BTC over the last five years to creating a model that protects its holdings and business. Over the last year, Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases have been declining monthly – from 134,000 BTC in November 2024 and 59,700 BTC in December 2024 to 31,500 BTC in July 2025 and 9,100 BTC last month. So far this month, the firm has only acquired 135 BTC. Nevertheless, the company’s move will have a significant impact on the Bitcoin market. Reduced buying will soften demand, while the USD reserve will lower the probability of distressed BTC selling.

This outlook comes as Bitcoin continues to struggle to break above the $90,000 mark following days of losses and stagnation. According to Poppe, Bitcoin’s failure to revisit and reclaim the $92,000 region could open the door to a sharp drop toward the low-$80,000 range, an area that aligns with multiple support levels, he said in an X post on December 7. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView He noted that trading activity between $86,000 and $92,000 currently represents “noise,” reflecting limited directional conviction. Notably, liquidity beneath prior highs has already been taken, while upside liquidity remains stacked above the market but will only become accessible if bulls regain control. The analysis also highlighted a major resistance band near $100,700, while the crucial downside pivot is around $89,300, a level Poppe considers essential to avoid a harsher decline. Bitcoin price key levels to watch If Bitcoin fails to retest or break above $92,000, he expects price action to slide toward the $80,000–$82,000 zone, where several historical support layers sit between $80,900 and $76,600. A revisit of this region could form a double-bottom pattern, potentially marking the final phase of the correction. Despite the looming downside risk, Poppe remained optimistic about what follows. He believes Bitcoin is “not far off bottoming,” and a strong rebound from lower support could ignite a year-end rally that carries into Q1 2026. Notably, the maiden cryptocurrency is currently consolidating as investors await the next Federal Reserve policy update. Markets are looking for clarity on how the central bank plans to approach 2026 before making fresh commitments.

The latest WisdomTree report highlights a pattern that contradicts short-term price weakness and points to long-term structural interest from professional investors. Europe Sets the Tone for Institutional Confidence Europe drives one of the clearest accumulation trends in digital assets this year. XRP attracts $549 million in new institutional money, which marks a level unmatched by every major altcoin. Ethereum brings in $185 million, while Solana sees heavy deterioration after its earlier $814 million run. Bitcoin remains ahead with $1.764 billion, yet Europe’s interest in XRP signals a shift within a region known for strict regulatory standards and cautious allocation practices. Institutional flows in Europe often shape global sentiment because allocators in the region emphasize compliance, long-term positioning, and infrastructure-grade assets. XRP’s presence in that group signals growing comfort with its liquidity profile and expanding utility. The trend also shows interest that forms during market stress and not during hype cycles. This gives the European inflow structure a weight that strengthens the broader global picture. Global Markets Mirror Europe’s Pattern Outside the United States, XRP records $252 million in new inflows this year. Bitcoin products take in $268 million, yet Bitcoin products remain more than twenty-five times larger. The data reveals a dramatic ratio: institutions put almost twenty-five times more fresh capital into XRP than Bitcoin when measured proportionally. That trend shows preference based on function rather than narrative trading. The pattern continues across Asia and other non-US regions. Market weakness creates an environment where allocators search for resilience and utility. XRP’s architecture supports settlement, compliance alignment, and predictable liquidity movement. Institutions outside the US appear aware of that shift and allocate based on fundamentals rather than speculative narratives. United States Begins Accelerating XRP Exposure The US synthetic XRP product records $241 million in inflows this year. That figure surpasses the $206 million added to Solana’s synthetic product. Every other altcoin product in the synthetic category trails far behind. The timing of this inflow matters because US markets saw $6.4 billion exit Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in November. Investors who cut exposure from the two largest assets still moved capital into XRP products. This shows a critical change in US institutional behavior. Allocators search for tokens that position themselves inside the regulated finance stack instead of tokens that depend on speculative cycles. XRP finds momentum at a time when capital usually flees risk markets. That timing strengthens the broader signal of global preference. GTreasury Acquisition Strengthens XRP’s Role in Enterprise Systems Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury, a platform that connects to financial operations used by major corporations, provides XRP with integration into workflows that manage $12.5 trillion in enterprise liquidity. Corporate teams use GTreasury for cross-border payments, payroll routes, working capital, and supply-chain networks. Analysts note that this embeds XRP into real-time settlement rails inside environments where treasurers control billions in daily liquidity. This creates a shift from speculative use toward operational finance. XRP evolves into back-end infrastructure rather than a retail-driven trading asset. The integration strengthens its utility profile and supports the institutional inflow data visible across global markets. XRP Outperforms a Declining Market WisdomTree data confirms that XRP posts the only positive YTD return among major cryptocurrencies in 2025 with a 4% gain, showing resilience in a year defined by macro tightening and risk-off behavior. Institutional flows across Europe, Asia, non-US regions, and the United States all point to the same conclusion. Professional capital now treats XRP as an operational asset aligned with the future of regulated global settlement. Price performance lags in the short term, yet preference from institutional allocators often arrives long before major price expansion.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-07 16:58:58

The project’s initial launch was met with overwhelming demand, seeing Phase 1 conclude in less than two weeks while securing a robust $500,000 in funding. This trajectory has only accelerated in Phase 2, which has already successfully raised over $570,000 from eager contributors. With this current phase now surpassing the 70% completion mark, market analysts are issuing alerts that Phase 3 could commence as early as next week. This rapid progression signals that the most advantageous entry window is closing quickly, urging investors to act before the next price tier activates. Institutional Moves vs. Individual Empowerment Ripple is seizing headlines with a massive $1B GTreasury acquisition and $887M in ETF inflows, cementing its institutional breakout phase. While Ripple reshapes corporate finance, GeeFi is revolutionizing personal wealth management through tangible utility. At the core of its comprehensive ecosystem lies the GeeFi DEX, a decentralized exchange that champions user autonomy. By offering a secure, non-custodial trading environment, it ensures that users retain absolute control over their assets, eliminating the vulnerabilities often associated with centralized intermediaries. The platform’s innovation extends into everyday utility through the upcoming GeeFi Crypto Cards. Integrated seamlessly with VISA and Mastercard networks, these cards bridge the gap between digital portfolios and global commerce, allowing for effortless spending worldwide. This utility is underpinned by the GEE token’s sophisticated deflationary model. Through a strategic mechanism of programmed token burns, the protocol actively reduces the circulating supply. This scarcity model is engineered to drive long-term value appreciation, directly rewarding holders who remain committed to the ecosystem as it expands. A Guaranteed ROI That Defies Market Averages The current GeeFi presale offers a financial opportunity that stands apart in a volatile market. In Phase 2, tokens are available at the remarkably low price of $0.06 . This entry point is strategic, as the token has a confirmed exchange listing price of $0.40 , effectively locking in a guaranteed 667% return for early participants. The long-term projections are even more staggering. With analysts forecasting a potential surge to $2 per token, a modest investment of $1,600 today could skyrocket to nearly $60,000 , delivering an exceptional 3,233% ROI . The velocity of Phase 2 sales validates these ambitious forecasts. Over 9.5 million tokens have already been purchased, generating more than $570,000 in capital. This intense buying pressure has led experts to predict an imminent sell-out of the current phase. The excitement is further amplified by persistent rumors of upcoming listings on major centralized exchanges. Such listings historically serve as powerful catalysts for explosive price action, suggesting that GeeFi is poised for a significant breakout immediately upon launch. Industry-Leading Staking Rewards and Bonuses GeeFi complements its capital growth potential with a powerful suite of passive income opportunities designed for every type of investor. The platform’s staking program, accessible via the GeeFi Wallet, offers industry-leading yields. Investors prioritizing flexibility can earn 10% APR with no lock-up period. For those willing to commit, the rewards increase substantially: 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and a massive 55% APR for a twelve-month term . Additionally, the project incentivizes community growth through a referral program, granting users a 5% bonus on all investments made through their unique links. The Final Window for Life-Changing Gains Market insiders are identifying GeeFi as the next potential 100x project, offering a rare combination of high utility and strategic tokenomics. This presale represents a fleeting moment to secure a stake in a future market leader before it becomes widely accessible to the public. With Phase 2 rapidly nearing capacity and a price increase inevitable in Phase 3, the opportunity to maximize returns is vanishing. The fear of missing out is palpable, driving smart money to secure GEE tokens now before this window of opportunity closes permanently.

The meme coin has spent the majority of recent days trading with a bearish tone, but its anniversary places into perspective how much the crypto environment has changed since the token’s joke-related launch in 2013. The celebration comes as analysts continue to debate whether Dogecoin’s long accumulation structure is nearing a turning point, and its next breakout might define its 13th year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says A Milestone That Shows How Far Dogecoin Has Come Dogecoin began as a lighthearted project by developer Billy Markus and Adobe sales employee Jackson Palmer in order to poke fun at the rising popularity of Bitcoin at the time. Over the years, what started as a joke has grown into one of the world’s most recognized cryptocurrencies. Happy birthday to Dogecoin. 12 years and going. pic.twitter.com/n9Qg6KtfQU — dogegod (@_dogegod_) December 6, 2025 At its peak on May 8, 2021, DOGE reached an all-time high of $0.73 with a market capitalization nearing $88.7 billion. Today, despite the recent price action, Dogecoin is still among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, with a market value around $22.5 billion and trading near $0.14. The 12th birthday of Dogecoin came at a time when broader market sentiment is weak and investors remain cautious. On its anniversary, Dogecoin dropped by 3.1%, steeper than the general market dip, due to ongoing pressure on meme coins. Amidst this, some milestones still stand out. The introduction of a Spot Dogecoin ETF shows this transformation more vividly than anything else, because it shows major financial players now view the meme coin as an asset worthy of structured, regulated investment exposure. Although early participation has been modest, the token’s entry into ETF territory is much more symbolic, as it represents a profound departure from the ecosystem that shaped its early years, and this could lead the cryptocurrency to new all-time highs in the coming months. What The 12th Year Means For Dogecoin’s Future Reaching 12 years isn’t just a symbolic milestone. It illustrates Dogecoin’s longevity in a crypto environment where many cryptocurrencies fade quickly. The fact that Dogecoin still holds a top-tier market position suggests resilience. That resilience is now being echoed on-chain, as some of the largest Dogecoin wallets have begun adding to their balances again after activity recently fell to a multi-month low. There are rumors that the updated internal code of Tesla’s website contains deeper Dogecoin payment mechanisms for electric cars like the Model 3 and Cybertruck, which is possibly related to the announced XMoney payment system on the X platform. This naturally circles back to the influence of Elon Musk, whose support has shaped Dogecoin’s public profile for years. The billionaire has consistently kept Dogecoin in the mainstream conversation through social media posts, product references, and earlier acknowledgments of Dogecoin-related payments for Tesla merchandise.

XRP is now in one of those silent phases where price compression hides building energy. Traders who study long-term structures believe this compression may be a precursor to a major expansion phase. The debate is simple: Will patience now offer access to a much larger multi-year move? A Macro Thesis Anchored in Clarity and Structure XRP’s macro appeal has grown since the legal battle with the SEC ended in August 2025. The conclusion of that case removed a long-standing source of uncertainty for institutions. With the legal cloud gone, investors now focus on utility, adoption, and long-term liquidity flows. This shift supports the argument that XRP is no longer a short-term speculation but a large-scale macro position. #XRP – The Macro Trade : The chart suggests a simple reality: The worst-case scenario appears to be a return toward $1.00, while the upside potential remains significantly larger and there is not limits. Is it worth risking a long-term position for a possible… pic.twitter.com/hhcKPGwzYk — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 7, 2025 Egrag Crypto’s Bull-Flag Framework Technical analyst Egrag Crypto highlights a clear monthly bull-flag structure. The structure follows a simple sequence: breakout, retest, and continuation. The pattern sits inside a long-term channel that has guided XRP’s movement for years. Egrag identifies a bull-flag target near $20. He also maps the top of “Line 1” around $35. His long-term “Line 2” projection extends toward the $200 region. These projections represent possibilities, not certainties, yet they show a strong asymmetry. The potential upside appears far larger than the possible downside. Current Market Position and Technical Context XRP is currently trading near $2.03. The token remains above the 21-month EMA, which supports a bullish structure. Egrag notes that compression often precedes expansion. The present consolidation fits that narrative well. Sentiment fluctuates because recent sessions delivered mixed momentum signals. Fear readings remain elevated, yet accumulation continues among long-term holders. This combination suggests a market preparing for a decisive move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Key Macro Risk Level at $1.00 Egrag outlines one critical risk level for the monthly chart. The level is the $1.00 support zone. As long as XRP stays above that level, the macro bullish outlook remains intact. A monthly close below $1.00 would invalidate much of the current structure. Such a close would force analysts to reassess the long-term trend. This single level offers a clear guide for disciplined risk management. Long-Term Positioning and Strategic Implications Macro traders prefer setups with limited downside and large upside potential. XRP’s current structure satisfies those conditions for many analysts. Long-term holders often choose to keep their positions during periods of compression. Some even plan to add during deep retests if they appear. Traders who want confirmation may wait for a clean breakout and retest. Institutions may scale gradually because the chart now aligns with regulatory clarity. In conclusion, Egrag Crypto’s analysis frames XRP as a macro trade defined by patience and structure. The token sits in a tight compression that could lead to strong expansion. The $1.00 level remains the decisive line for long-term validation. Above that level, the macro narrative stays bullish. Below it, the entire outlook changes.

At the same time, a fresh breakout in the Russell 2000 index lines up with a pattern that has often preceded past Bitcoin bull runs. Bitcoin ‘Liveliness’ Metric Climbs Even as Price Stalls Bitcoin’s onchain “liveliness” keeps rising this cycle despite softer price action, suggesting steady demand for spot BTC, according to analyst TXMC, who cited data from Glassnode’s Liveliness Ribbon chart. TXMC described liveliness as a running sum of all lifetime spending versus holding on the Bitcoin network. The metric rises when coins are spent and transacted, and it falls when more supply sits dormant in wallets. It also scales by the age of those coins, so movements in older holdings carry more weight than day-to-day trading. Bitcoin Liveliness Ribbon Chart. Source: Glassnode / X In past bull markets, liveliness has typically increased as coins change hands at higher prices and new capital enters the market. As demand cools and investors shift back to holding, the indicator’s upward momentum tends to slow or reverse. TXMC characterized it as a long-term moving average for onchain activity rather than a short-term trading tool. This cycle, however, liveliness “continues to march higher” even while prices trade below prior peaks, TXMC noted. That pattern points to an underlying base of demand that does not yet appear fully in spot prices. It also signals that larger entities are active onchain, though the identities behind those flows remain unknown. TXMC cautioned that liveliness is not a precise market timing signal, because it often turns after price has already moved. Even so, the continued upward trend in the metric shows that long-horizon Bitcoin holders and sizable market participants remain engaged in the network despite recent volatility. Bitcoin Rallies Have Followed Russell 2000 Breakouts, Analyst Says Bitcoin may be entering another upward phase after the iShares Russell 2000 ETF broke above long-standing resistance, according to analyst AO, who compared the small-cap index with past BTC market cycles. Bitcoin and Russell 2000 Breakout Comparison Chart. Source: TradingView / AO_btc_analyst AO’s chart highlights four previous moments — 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2021 — when the Russell 2000 pushed through major horizontal resistance. In each case, Bitcoin followed with a strong multi-month rally. The analyst notes that the index has now broken out again, marking the first such move since early 2021. The overlay shows the Russell’s resistance tests and breakouts aligned vertically with Bitcoin’s historical surges. Earlier cycles saw BTC accelerate shortly after the index confirmed strength, a pattern AO says has repeated consistently over the past decade. With the Russell 2000 now trading above its prior ceiling, AO suggests Bitcoin could again follow the same structural rhythm. The chart places a potential new BTC acceleration window into 2026 if the relationship holds. While the comparison does not provide timing precision, AO argues that the recurring correlation is strong enough to monitor as markets move into the next phase of the cycle.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-07 17:06:19

Dubbed the “Nvidia of China,” the company’s shares surged more than 400% on its first day of trading following the $1.1 billion listing, closing at 600.50 yuan. This figure is more than five times the IPO price of 114.28 yuan. CITIC Securities led the IPO, with BOC International Securities, China Merchants Securities, and GF Securities serving as joint bookrunners. Moore Threads, which is not yet profitable, announced that the proceeds from the IPO will be used to accelerate R&D for next-generation AI training and inference GPU chips. A portion of the proceeds will be earmarked for working capital. However, the company's IPO success has been overshadowed by renewed allegations within the Chinese crypto community. Li Feng, known as the figure behind Moore Academy, has allegedly been involved in cryptocurrency projects in the past. Li Feng is alleged to have launched tokens alongside figures like Li Xiaolai and Xue Manzi in 2017. Related News: Which Way Will the Wind Blow for Bitcoin? Analysts Say “There’s a Preparation Going On” Even more striking is the statement that OKX founder Star shared in his circle in 2018: Star said that Li Feng borrowed 1500 BTC from him, but did not pay it back and even disappeared completely after a while. Although Li Feng is sometimes publicly referred to as the “co-founder” of Moore Threads, his name is not listed on the company's executive lists. This has led to speculation that Li is not deeply involved in the company's operations. When the debates flared up again, OKX founder Star made the following statement on the X platform: “One cannot remain constantly in the shadow of a negative past.

The shift gains speed after Binance executives arrived in Islamabad this week for direct talks with the country’s political and military leadership. The meetings signal an important moment for Pakistan’s digital asset future as the government outlines strong support for regulation and oversight. High-Level Meetings Signal a National Crypto Strategy Binance CEO Richard Teng leads the exchange’s delegation during a series of meetings with the Prime Minister, the Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir, and senior financial officials. The Prime Minister’s Office confirms a strong governmental commitment to building a transparent and secure framework for digital assets. The engagements show that Pakistan seeks structure, clarity, and global alignment as it transitions from an unregulated environment toward a regulated market. PVARA Chairman Bilal bin Saqib presides over the core discussions and outlines progress made by his newly formed authority. His briefing includes updates on licensing, market surveillance systems, and the country’s attempts to bring crypto service providers under a unified national standard. The government highlights the need to promote innovation while safeguarding users in one of the world’s fastest-growing digital markets. Regulatory Momentum Rises as Pakistan Eyes National Digital Currency Plans Pakistan wants a clear framework that supports financial innovation and ensures investor safety. The government views digital assets as a sector that can help modernize payment systems and expand financial inclusion. Saqib confirms that Pakistan studies stablecoin models and explores the creation of a state-backed digital currency as part of its broader modernization plan. Pakistan has already unveiled its first strategic Bitcoin reserve this year, which shows the government’s intent to participate in global digital finance. Saqib mentions that CBDC discussions continue as the country assesses long-term benefits for settlement, security, and cross-border transactions. These discussions evolve as Pakistan gains momentum in retail user activity, exchange use, and overall adoption. Pakistan Emerges as a Global Crypto Hotspot Pakistan ranks third in the world in the latest Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index. The country sits ahead of global economies like China, Germany, and Japan. Pakistan ranks second in retail crypto transactions and third in activity across centralized exchanges. These rankings show strong local engagement and broad national interest. The market’s scale has drawn worldwide attention. From a recent tweet, Binance reveals that Pakistani users trade over $250 billion in crypto each year. The platform hosts nearly 17.5 million registered Pakistani users with digital asset holdings worth about $5 billion. Analysts estimate that about 20 to 40 million citizens hold crypto in some form, a figure that highlights the scale of adoption and the urgency for clear regulation. Pakistan Moves to Formalize Oversight and Capture Economic Value Pakistan now aims to convert raw adoption into a structured and regulated ecosystem . The country invited exchanges and virtual asset service providers to apply for licenses in September. Officials believe a formal licensing regime can bring more than $25 billion of untaxed digital wealth into the formal economy. Saqib states that Pakistan wants to turn its rapid adoption into a global model for responsible growth. He stresses the need to protect users as the country strengthens its regulatory groundwork. Experts warn that scams, market volatility, and low public awareness remain obstacles that require clear policy and strong enforcement. A Critical Turning Point for Pakistan’s Digital Future Pakistan stands at a pivotal moment as it balances mass adoption with regulatory clarity. The visit from Binance’s top leadership signals global recognition of Pakistan’s market size and growing influence.

Initial release nears and demand builds up throughout the last distribution period, analysts are now indicating that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is possibly preparing to pull off a big crypto move once its fundamental lending protocol releases. Early Growth and What Mutuum Finance Is Building Mutuum Finance was launched at the start of early 2025 at $0.01 and made it to $0.035, a 250% rise in the development. The project has collected $19.1M, attracted more than 18,300 holders, and sold above 810M tokens. There is 4B MUTM supply with 1.82B, or 45.5%, being allocated to the presale. Phase 6 is currently above 95% with an increasing demand and supply is declining. Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized lending protocol which runs two interconnected markets. Users are able to lend an asset in the form of ETH or USDT. When they lend, they earn mtTokens. mtTokens increase in value because borrowers pay off interest. As an illustration, when a user deposits $400 in ETH, the value of the mtTokens will increase with increasing lending. A system with adjustable rates is used by borrowers. In a high liquidity, it is cheaper to borrow. As liquidity becomes strained, it would be costlier to borrow. Loan-to-value ratios control prudent borrowing. Liquidation can be done in case collateral falls below acceptable. The liquidators paying a portion of the debt get discounted collateral. With these mechanics, Mutuum Finance is able to operate with actual economic activity and not sentiment only. V1 Testnet and Analyst Outlook On its official X account, Mutuum Finance insisted that the V1 testnet will be launched in Q4 of 2025. V1 will consist of the lending pool, the mtTokens, the liquidation engine and debt module. The Launch will support ETH and USDT. This will mark the initial time when the protocol goes live, and it is monitored by thousands of investors. Mutuum Finance has also a buy-and-distribute model. A portion of platform revenue acquires MUTM in the market. Buy tokens are registered to the stakers of the mtTokens. This generates a consistent purchase pressure pegged on borrowing. According to analysts, this model has the potential to make MUTM have an edge over other leading crypto tokens whose success is solely based on hype. Layer-2 Expansion Mutuum Finance is planning to come with a USD-pegged stablecoin allied with the interest charged by borrowers. Stablecoins enable lending platforms to scale due to their predictable value and promote more profound liquidity. The majority of the public successful DeFi ecosystems expanded much after introducing stablecoins to users and borrowers. The layer-2 networks will also be spread out in the protocol according to the official roadmap. The implementation of L2 will reduce expenses and raise the speed of transactions. Lending processes need fast changes of collateral and interest. With increased speed of performance, the user experience becomes better and more participants are attracted. In case of these characteristics incorporated in long-term forecasts, a number of analysts predict the possibility of upside in the 700%-800% token appreciation range in 2026 or 2027 with possible expansion of adoption. Security Framework and Daily Participation Mutuum Finance has security at its core. A CertiK audit of the project achieved the rating of 90/100 in the Token Scan. It is Halborn Security to review the lending contracts. The team also has a bug bounty of $50,000, that is, providing a motivation to developers in order to hunt potential code problems down before the protocol goes into broad testing. These are measures that facilitate the risk reduction before the release of the V1. The involvement of the community is high. The leaderboard with 24 hours reward will give the best contributor $500 in MUTM per day. This system ensures that users are kept alive and provide a constant demand as the project starts increasing. They are also able to pay using cards on the platform providing new users with an easy entry route. Phase 6 is approaching completion with allocation more than 95%. Very little of the tokens are left on the present level of $0.035. The actual price of the launch is $0.06 which creates some sense of urgency among the investors to acquire before another upsurge in value. As the V1 edges closer, audited agreements are in existence and the buy-and-distribute engine is ready to activate, many traders consider Mutuum Finance one of the potential fiercest new crypto competitors that may have a potential breakout in 2026.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $90,012.88. This surge isn’t just a number; it represents a powerful vote of confidence in the world’s premier cryptocurrency and marks a new chapter in its financial narrative. Let’s explore what’s fueling this rally and what it could mean for the market’s trajectory. What’s Driving the Historic Bitcoin Price Rally? The journey to this record-breaking Bitcoin price is supported by several converging factors. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are integrating Bitcoin into their offerings, treating it more like a legitimate asset class. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often lead investors to seek alternative stores of value. Moreover, the recent approval and inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have created a new, steady channel for capital to enter the ecosystem, applying consistent upward pressure. Why Does the $90,000 Milestone Matter for Investors? Crossing the $90,000 threshold is psychologically significant. It acts as a powerful signal to the entire market, from retail traders to large institutions. This key resistance level has now transformed into a potential support zone, which could pave the way for further gains. For investors, this milestone validates long-term strategies and highlights Bitcoin’s resilience. However, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is volatile. While this surge is exciting, prices can correct just as quickly. Therefore, a balanced perspective is essential. Consider these actionable insights for navigating the current market: Diversify Your Portfolio: Never allocate more to crypto than you can afford to lose. Understand the Cycles: Bitcoin has historically moved in bull and bear cycles; know where you might be in the trend. Focus on Fundamentals: Look beyond the price at network adoption, hash rate, and developer activity. Have an Exit Strategy: Decide in advance your goals for taking profits or cutting losses. What Challenges Could Lie Ahead for Bitcoin? Despite the bullish sentiment, challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainty in major economies can still cause short-term volatility. Additionally, the market’s sensitivity to macroeconomic announcements, like interest rate decisions, is high. Technological challenges, such as network scalability, also require ongoing solutions. The current Bitcoin price is a testament to overcoming past hurdles, but the path forward will demand continued innovation and adaptation from the community and developers alike. A Compelling Summary of the Bitcoin Breakout Bitcoin’s triumphant surge past $90,000 is a landmark event fueled by institutional adoption, macroeconomic trends, and robust ETF inflows. It reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a leading digital asset and a potential hedge in a complex financial world. While the future is always uncertain, this achievement solidifies the cryptocurrency’s position at the forefront of the financial revolution. The key for any participant is to stay informed, manage risk, and recognize both the opportunities and the inherent volatility that define this space.

Prices fluctuate constantly, so check a reliable exchange for the latest quote. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin after it hits $90,000? A2: “Too late” is subjective in investing. While buying at a lower price is ideal, many analysts believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. The decision should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and research, not just the current price. Q3: What caused Bitcoin to rise so quickly? A3: The rally is attributed to a combination of factors, including sustained demand from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, broader institutional adoption, and macroeconomic conditions driving interest in alternative assets. Q4: Could the Bitcoin price crash from here? A4> Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. While the trend is currently positive, corrections are a normal part of any market cycle.

A6> Market analysts often watch round numbers as psychological targets. Following $90,000, the next major milestones would be $100,000 and then the previous all-time high.

Avery describes Ripple's move as “the next phase in its takeover of traditional financial infrastructure,” noting that it's much more than just a tech acquisition. GTreasury is a financial platform integrated with more than 13,000 banks, used by global giants like Volvo and Subway, managing treasury operations for companies operating in 160 countries, and processing $12.5 trillion in payments annually. Ripple's incorporation of an integrated, reliable, and regulatory-compliant system at this scale means direct access to the world of corporate finance. The fundamental problem Avery highlights is the inefficiencies multinational companies face in cash management. It's impossible for a CFO to monitor cash flow in dozens of countries in real-time; a wire transfer from the US to Asia can take three to five days, and transfer fees can eat up 3 to 7 percent of the total amount. Furthermore, the money moves between banks throughout this process, making it difficult to track. Blockchain, on the other hand, offers infrastructure that can be deployed in seconds, at low cost, and 24/7. However, since it's unrealistic to ask Fortune 500 companies to build their infrastructure entirely on blockchain, Ripple's acquisition of GTreasury fills a critical gap. GTreasury is already embedded in the systems of global organizations, giving Ripple the opportunity to integrate blockchain into existing workflows without risk. This integration creates a hybrid model that doesn't eliminate traditional banking, but rather expands its options. GTreasury will continue to connect to traditional payment networks like SWIFT and ACH, while also providing access to Ripple's blockchain infrastructure. This allows companies to use traditional systems for routine payments and process urgent international transfers via blockchain in seconds. Having multiple payment gateways within the same interface will allow for a seamless and rapid transformation. Related News: Tulip Mania Debate Continues on Bitcoin - Bloomberg Analyst Puts an End to It Avery noted that the GTreasury acquisition would be incomplete when evaluated in isolation, highlighting Ripple's other strategic moves throughout 2025. Metaco, which the company acquired for $250 million, provides secure digital asset storage infrastructure for banks and institutions and is a prerequisite for large-volume value transfers via blockchain. Hidden Road (now Ripple Prime), acquired for $1.25 billion, gave the company control of a massive institutional network that handles over $3 trillion annually in forex, cryptocurrency, derivatives, and fixed-income securities. The company's stablecoin, RLUSD, can now be used as collateral within Ripple Prime, offering institutions leverage, liquidity, and yield. Rail, acquired in August 2025 for $200 million, provides infrastructure capable of high-frequency international stablecoin payments, surpassing banking in certain circumstances. According to the analyst, when these pieces are combined, it becomes clearer how Ripple's new financial model works. For example, if a multinational company identifies $50 million in unused funds at a European subsidiary through GTreasury, it can convert that money into a stablecoin through Rail and move it within minutes. Compared to traditional banking, cost savings of 60 to 90 percent can be achieved. Funds are then invested in yield-generating products on Ripple Prime and can be instantly withdrawn when needed thanks to Metaco's infrastructure. This entire process is conducted through a single interface, enabling both traditional finance and digital asset infrastructures to work together. According to Avery, the fact that Ripple's stablecoin, RLUSD, is fully backed by US dollars and its reserves are held by BNY Mellon creates a significant security element for large corporations. Multinational corporations stand out as the institutions most in need of such a hybrid model due to their currency risks, complex cash flows, and high volumes of international transfers. The periods where money “lays in transit” or “locks up” in traditional systems are virtually eliminated thanks to the company's infrastructure. Max Avery argues that Ripple is no longer a blockchain startup, noting that it invested over $2.7 billion in this strategy alone by 2025. According to the analyst, the company is evolving into a financial infrastructure provider that is “at the heart of how major companies manage money around the world.” *This is not investment advice.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC rises above $91,000 , trading at $91,005.54 on the Binance USDT market. This surge isn’t just a number—it’s a signal of renewed momentum in the digital asset space. Let’s dive into what’s fueling this impressive climb and what it could mean for your portfolio. What’s Driving the Surge as BTC Rises Above $91,000? The recent price action where BTC rises above $91,000 is rarely due to a single factor. Market analysts point to a confluence of bullish catalysts. Firstly, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Secondly, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often drive investors toward assets perceived as stores of value. Moreover, positive regulatory developments in key jurisdictions can reduce uncertainty and attract capital. This multi-faceted support creates a resilient environment for growth. Key Levels and Market Sentiment to Watch Now With Bitcoin trading firmly above $91,000, all eyes are on the next psychological resistance levels. The market’s ability to hold this new support zone is crucial. Here are the immediate factors traders are monitoring: Support Consolidation: Can the $90,000 level act as a new base for further advances? Trading Volume: Sustained high volume confirms genuine buyer interest, not just a speculative spike. On-Chain Metrics: Data like exchange outflows (coins moving to cold storage) often signal long-term holder confidence. Therefore, while the headline BTC rises above $91,000 is exciting, these underlying metrics offer a clearer picture of trend strength. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What should you do when you see news that BTC rises above $91,000 ? The key is to avoid emotional, reactive decisions. Instead, consider a strategic approach. Review your asset allocation to ensure it still matches your risk tolerance. If you’re considering new entries, dollar-cost averaging can mitigate the risk of buying at a short-term peak. Furthermore, always ensure you have a clear exit strategy for both profit-taking and loss prevention. Remember, volatility is a constant companion in crypto markets. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin This milestone where BTC rises above $91,000 opens a new chapter. The focus now shifts to whether this is a springboard toward the coveted $100,000 mark or if a period of consolidation is needed. Historical patterns suggest that breaking major resistance often leads to a test of that new level. Consequently, some market pullback would be normal and healthy. The long-term narrative, however, remains tied to adoption, technological utility, and its role in the evolving digital economy. In summary, the event where BTC rises above $91,000 is a significant technical and psychological achievement. It reflects growing confidence and a complex mix of fundamental drivers. For investors, it reinforces the importance of staying informed, sticking to a plan, and understanding that the journey is often as important as the destination. The crypto market continues to demonstrate its dynamic and transformative potential. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why did Bitcoin suddenly rise above $91,000? A: The surge is typically driven by a combination of factors like increased institutional buying, positive market sentiment, favorable macro-economic conditions, and sometimes, technical trading patterns triggering buy orders. Q: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin after it rises above $91,000? A: “Too late” is subjective in investing. Many analysts view major breakouts as the start of a new trend phase. However, it’s essential to conduct your own research, consider dollar-cost averaging, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q: What is the next major target if BTC holds above $91,000? A: The next significant psychological resistance level is widely considered to be $100,000. Traders will also watch previous all-time high regions as potential targets. Q: Could the price drop back below $90,000 after this rally? A> Yes, volatility is inherent to cryptocurrencies. It’s common for assets to “retest” newly broken resistance levels as support. A pullback would not necessarily invalidate the bullish trend if key support holds. Q: How does this price action affect other cryptocurrencies (altcoins)? A: Bitcoin often leads the market.

The asset has remained locked between $2.02 and $2.04 for almost two days. The movement looks less like a normal weekend slowdown and more like a system holding its breath. Order books across major exchanges appear thin, volume remains low, and several chart intervals on Coinbase have shown temporary failures. These details suggest structural tension building below the surface. According to analyst SonOfaRichard, the current behavior is not typical retail-driven stagnation. He argues that the order flow resembles a liquidity engine absorbing activity rather than a public market searching for direction. The price does not drift as it usually would under retail conditions. Instead, it pins tightly, while user interfaces show stress before any price movement occurs. This pattern is rare and usually appears when deeper architecture prepares for a shift. Something is off in the charts — and the timing is almost too defined. XRP has been pinned between $2.02–$2.04 for almost 48 hours straight. Weekend. Low volume. Bid/ask depth evaporated. Multiple interval failures on Coinbase — 1D, 4H, 1H, 15m — UI breaking before price.… https://t.co/U69MXeaoRI — SonOfaRichard (@heythereRich) December 7, 2025 Bitnomial’s Launch and the Timing Question The timing has raised eyebrows because Bitnomial is set to launch a full suite of XRP markets on Monday. The exchange is the first in the United States to offer crypto-settled futures, perpetuals, options, and spot products under full CFTC oversight. It also lists XRP and RLUSD as acceptable margin assets. Bitnomial previously challenged the SEC’s stance on XRP and has maintained a partnership with Ripple. Its arrival marks a major regulatory milestone for XRP within the U.S. derivatives ecosystem. Structural Shifts in Clearing and Settlement The launch aligns with recent updates from the DTCC. These updates refine classifications related to digital-asset settlement procedures. The DTCC does not influence day-to-day market action. Instead, it defines the rules that govern settlement, clearing, and collateral movement. Adjustments of this type often precede changes in how institutional markets interact with specific assets. Ripple’s Regulatory Integration Expands Ripple’s Major Payment Institution licence adds another important layer. The licence grants Ripple the authority to engage directly with banking systems. This permission allows Ripple to handle settlement, custody, and value transfer without intermediaries. When XRP and RLUSD sit inside approved banking workflows, they gain new utility for institutions seeking compliant settlement assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Convergence of Market and Infrastructure The simultaneous arrival of Bitnomial’s launch, the DTCC’s updates, and Ripple’s licensing progress creates a rare alignment. Each development moves XRP deeper into regulated settlement frameworks. When these frameworks tighten around an asset, the market often stops behaving like a simple order book. It begins to behave like infrastructure ready for increased throughput. What the Compression Could Signal Price compression of this type often precedes decisive movement. Similar patterns have appeared in commodities and foreign exchange. Liquidity thins, depth weakens, user interfaces strain, and then a release occurs. The market shifts from one price shelf to another with notable speed. These events do not guarantee direction. They simply indicate tension in the system. Outlook for the Coming Week XRP’s frozen range reflects more than weekend quiet. It shows a market preparing for structural change. With new derivatives, updated settlement rules, and expanded regulatory pathways converging at once, next week could deliver significant movement. The mechanics hint at pressure building beneath the charts, and that pressure rarely stays contained for long.

Together, the legal shift and the rise in open interest show how Ethereum’s role keeps deepening both in traditional courts and on crypto futures markets. UK passes law that directly strengthens ETH property rights Digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum now have explicit recognition as personal property in England, Wales and Northern Ireland after the Property (Digital Assets etc) Act 2025 received Royal Assent and came into force on Dec. 2. The Act states that a “thing,” including something digital or electronic, is not prevented from being the object of personal property rights just because it is neither a “thing in possession” nor a “thing in action,” the two traditional categories in English law. In effect, lawmakers have opened the door for a third category of personal property to cover assets like crypto-tokens and non-fungible tokens. The UK government says the change confirms that digital assets can be recognised as personal property and gives stronger protection to victims of digital theft and fraud, who can now rely on a clearer statutory basis when they go to court.Courts will be able to apply existing property law tools more directly to crypto, including freezing, tracing and recovery of misappropriated coins, and to handle digital asset balances more cleanly in insolvency or exchange failure cases. At the same time, legal analysts say the Act removes uncertainty for banks, custodians and funds that want to hold or use crypto under English-law structures. With digital assets now recognised as objects of property rights in statute, it becomes easier to document security interests and collateral arrangements over ETH and other tokens in secured lending and structured finance transactions. The legislation applies across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and took effect immediately on the day it was passed, following recommendations from the Law Commission’s 2023 digital assets report. ETH open interest climbs again after October crash Meanwhile, Ethereum futures open interest has been rebuilding since the violent wipeout on Oct. 10, leaving derivatives traders more exposed again, according to chart data shared by analyst Ted (@TedPillows). The ETHUSDT perpetual contract on Binance Futures now shows steadily rising positioning even as spot price trades well below its early-autumn levels. Ethereum Futures Open Interest Rebuilds. Source: TedPillows The accompanying chart tracks Ethereum’s daily candles on Binance Futures alongside aggregated open interest in coins from analytics platform Velo. It shows leverage collapsing in mid-October, when open interest dropped sharply, then grinding higher through November and into early December as traders slowly added new positions. Ted said he expects much of this rebuilt open interest to “be wiped out in the coming months,” arguing that market makers may push Ethereum into a choppy trading range to flush out leveraged longs and shorts. In that scenario, open interest could fall again as positions are forced to close, even if spot price does not revisit the October crash levels.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-07 18:17:56

Kash Dhanda, Jupiter Exchange’s chief operating officer, released a video statement addressing community concerns regarding the protocol’s lending product, acknowledging that claims of “zero risk of contagion” circulating on social media are “not 100% accurate.” Dhanda noted that some previous posts had portrayed Jupiter Lend's vaults as “isolated risk,” with one post even stating that “cross-contamination is completely eliminated.” This post was subsequently deleted by the Jupiter team due to backlash. Dhanda said in his statement: “The post we described as having zero risk of infection was completely inaccurate. We wanted to delete it to prevent further spread, but in hindsight, we should have issued a correction at that time.” The controversy was sparked by Fluid co-founder Samyak Jain’s announcement that Jupiter Lend uses rehypothecation for capital efficiency. This means collateral users deposit into vaults can be reused elsewhere within the protocol, meaning the collateral isn’t completely isolated. According to Jain, Jupiter Lend vaults can still be considered “isolated” because each vault has its own configuration, limit, liquidation threshold, and penalty rate. However, this structure does not prevent collateral reuse due to the shared liquidity layer. Related News: Big Bull Michael Saylor Gave Today's Expected Bitcoin Signal Dhanda also confirmed the use of rehypothecation, saying, “This mechanism is why these collateral generates returns.” However, Dhanda argued that the vaults are still “internally isolated.” Marius Ciubotariu, co-founder of rival Solana lending protocol Kamino, publicly criticized Jupiter Lend's design. Kamino recently blocked Jupiter's financial instrument from accessing Kamino positions. Ciubotariu argued that funds from a user who had pledged SOL collateral were being sent to loop trades and other risky positions, writing: “There's no isolation here, just complete cross-contamination. Contrary to what's advertised.” As the debate escalated, Solana Foundation President Lily Liu called on both sides on social media. Liu demanded that Kamino and Jupiter Lend stop targeting each other. Liu noted that the Solana lending market is approximately $5 billion, while Ethereum has a volume 10 times that, and the traditional financial collateral market is much larger. Liu used the following expressions in his message: “We can target each other, with one-click position-moving discussions, sarcastic remarks, etc., but instead we can focus on capturing share of the cryptocurrency market and traditional finance.” *This is not investment advice.

This accumulation phase has also pushed Bitcoin’s Realized Cap to a historic all-time high while the market trades calmer, larger, and more institutional. Capital Inflows and Realized Cap Glassnode’s Q4 Digital Assets Report with FasanaraDigital shows that cumulative capital inflows in the 2022–2025 cycle reached $732B. Previous timelines experienced an influx of $4.4B from 2011–2015, $86B over 2015–2018, and $388B during 2018–2022. Data reveals that monthly net inflows during the current session have ranged from $30B to $100B, with the most recent upswing in October 2025 bringing approximately $39.8B per month into the network. Since then, these movements have cooled to around $15B per month. The report notes that this influx comes from stablecoin liquidity, spot ETF demand, and tokenized asset rails, which have changed how money gets into the ecosystem. On the other hand, the leading cryptocurrency also achieved another milestone this year with its Realized Cap reaching $1.1T. Unlike market capitalization, which assesses all coins at the most recent market price, the metric tracks cumulative net capital inflows and outflows, valuing each coin at its last on-chain transaction. During the 2022–2025 period, Bitcoin’s price also climbed from $16K to $126K, representing an increase of 690%. Market Dominance and Volatility Since November 2022, Bitcoin’s dominance has increased from 38.7% to 58.3%. Glassnode attributes this to a shift toward higher-liquidity and lower-risk assets. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s market share has declined to 12.1%, continuing its multi-year trend of underperformance relative to Bitcoin following the 2022 Merge. The broader Altcoin sector now represents 21.3% of the total market due to subdued retail participation and limited speculative capital compared with previous cycles. Additionally, Stablecoins account for 8.3% of the total market, slightly higher than last year but below their 17.3% peak in late 2022. The report highlights that these assets remain the primary quote currency on centralized and decentralized exchanges. Further, their rising adoption in emerging markets contributes to liquidity and supports dollar-denominated trade. The data also reveals a decrease in Bitcoin’s long-term volatility, with the figure dropping from 84% to 43%. The digital asset’s realized volatility has also recorded a structural decline as market depth expanded. Meanwhile, short-term fluctuation measures over one-month and three-month periods have swung between 17% and 75%. Despite being lower than in previous Bitcoin cycles, Glassnode reports that these levels remain above typical equity and commodity benchmarks, indicating that the market continues to respond to liquidity shifts and changes in sentiment.

Volatility measures are narrowing down on leading markets, and investment inflows for leading ETFs are fluctuating, keeping investors’ nerves in line with the current state of the world at large as BTC finds itself at the crossroads of the final month of the year. However, the current wave of investment appetite for much of the markets may just be moving towards MUTM due to its rapid growth in its presale, making it a new crypto coin and the next crypto to explode in the eyes of early investors. Priced at only $0.035, MUTM has been able to attract well over 18,330 investors and generate $19.15 million in funding, propelling phase 6 of its presale towards completion at an unprecedented rate. However, in addition to the overwhelming numbers that speak to its potential, it is the genuine DeFi use case of this project that sets it apart: it is purely and simply based on a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that promises to create interest-bearing tokens and yield in an unprecedented manner. Now on the horizon comes the much-anticipated V1 Sepolia Testnet launch for Mutuum Finance as it positions itself as the next crypto to explode. Bitcoin Braces for Sharp Reversal as Analysts Ponder December Downside Risks The week-long gain of Bitcoin (BTC) in the markets has been wiped out in just one savage movement, falling beneath $87,000, leading to more than $400 million in liquidations in just one hour due to low liquidity and extreme leverage. Trade volume increased to $110 billion, indicating just how extreme this movement has been, and at current levels near $86,300, attention is immediately focused on the vital level of $87,000. Some analysts are sounding warnings that a breakdown beneath $80,000 may well lead to further devastation, yet some of this action can be seen as part of the rotation of digital risk assets into hard money as interest in commodities such as silver escalates. In this situation, investors looking at what might develop in December are simultaneously taking an early look at some of the more promising cryptos that hold better asymmetry, including Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new crypto coin widely considered the next crypto to explode. MUTM Phase 6 Presale is Nearing Completion Due to Overwhelming Demand The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale remains on an upward trend as it approaches the final portion of Phase 6. Structured in such a way that it contains tiered pricing and hard caps on each sale, this presale has remained committed to rewarding those that invest earlier and at lower rates. Starting off at an investment level of $0.01 in Phase 1, MUTM has increased in cost to $0.035 in Phase 6, marking a 250% jump. Thus far, it has raised about $19.15 million, and this has been facilitated by the ever-increasing community of more than 18,330 holders. Because 95% of phase 6 has been sold, and given that the supply level is very low, this is among the last chance investors have to get MUTM tokens prior to the cost rising in phase 7 to $0.04 due to the 20% increase in price. Another factor that makes MUTM one of the leading crypto investments of 2025 is the rapid progression of the presale. Strategic Advantage and Strong Security for Early Investors Early contributors on the Mutuum Finance presale gain access to tokens at substantially discounted rates, preparing them for potentially lucrative returns of up to 300% on day one of launch. In addition to this opportunistic advantage, early contributors can draw on the potential for developmental growth in the project. Mutuum Finance draws in its early supporters due to its advanced dual lending mechanism, its stablecoin-based vision for the long-term, its fully audit-trail-worthy and open-source smart contracts, and token economics that promote MUTM token appreciation. All of this makes MUTM an extremely promising entrant in the DeFi market, recognized as the new crypto coin and considered the next crypto to explode in the market. Risk Management is integrated directly within the protocol. Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation levels are graded based on the volatility of the underlying collateral. Collaterals that are less volatile have higher borrowing ratios, while those that are riskier have stricter borrowing conditions. Another layer of stability comes in the form of multipliers for reserves that range between 10% for less risky products and 35% for higher-risk products. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) boasts over 18,330 investors and has raised around $19.15M in funding, as it is nearing completion of phase 6. The token sale price is at $0.035, which is lower than the launch price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance boasts its DeFi ecosystem and is soon launching the testnet of its V1 Sepolia, solidifying its reputation as the new crypto coin and the next crypto to explode in 2025.

55475554,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=874282,1765134000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55475554.jpeg,"Dogecoin (DOGE) Faces Liquidity Exits, Could GeeFi (GEE) Be the Hidden Gem to Save Your Portfolio?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-doge-faces-liquidity-exits-could-geefi-gee-be-the-hidden-gem-to-save-your-portfolio/,"While the crypto community speculates on the future of established coins, GeeFi is demonstrating what real investor confidence looks like with its powerhouse presale. This all-in-one crypto ecosystem concluded its first phase in less than two weeks, raising a notable $500,000 . The momentum has surged into Phase 2, which has already pulled in over $570,000 in contributions. Analysts are flagging the urgency, as the current phase is now over 70% sold out, with projections that Phase 3 could begin as early as next week. This signals that the best opportunity for early entry is quickly disappearing. Hype vs. High-Utility Dogecoin is capturing attention with its $0.15 price , ongoing ETF speculation, and historical patterns hinting at potential future rallies. While this generates excitement, savvy investors are looking beyond the hype and toward GeeFi for its concrete, real-world utility. GeeFi is building a comprehensive financial ecosystem centered around the GeeFi DEX, a secure, non-custodial decentralized exchange where users can trade digital assets with complete control, removing the risks associated with centralized platforms. GeeFi’s vision extends well beyond the exchange. The platform is preparing to launch its own Crypto Cards, integrated with both VISA and Mastercard, to bridge the gap between digital finance and everyday global spending. This functionality is supported by the GEE token’s deflationary architecture. Through a programmed token burn mechanism, the protocol is engineered to systematically reduce the total supply. This is designed to increase scarcity and reward long-term holders with sustained value appreciation. An Explosive ROI That You Cannot Afford to Miss GeeFi’s presale is currently in Phase 2, offering tokens at the highly attractive price of just $0.06 . This entry point creates a compelling financial opportunity, as the token has a confirmed listing price of $0.40 , which guarantees a 667% return for all presale participants. The long-term growth potential is even more impressive. Based on analyst forecasts of the token reaching $2, an initial $1,600 investment could potentially surge to $60,000 , delivering a remarkable 3,233% ROI . The presale’s velocity supports this bullish sentiment. Over 9.5 million tokens have been sold in Phase 2 alone, raising more than $570,000 in a short period. This intense demand has led experts to predict that the current phase will sell out within days. The excitement is further fueled by leaked discussions from the GeeFi team about upcoming listings on several major exchanges, a development that often acts as a powerful catalyst for explosive price growth. A New Standard in Passive Income and Staking Rewards In addition to its capital growth potential, GeeFi offers a highly competitive staking program designed to generate substantial passive income. Accessible via the GeeFi Wallet, the platform provides flexible options for all investment strategies. Users can earn up to 10% APR on their tokens without any lock-up period. For those seeking higher yields, GeeFi offers 15% APR for a one-month term , 22% APR for three months , and an impressive 55% APR for a twelve-month commitment . The ecosystem also features a referral program, giving users a 5% bonus on all contributions from their referrals. Don’t Miss Your Chance to Secure the Next 100x Gem Market analysts are increasingly pinpointing GeeFi as a project with rare 100x potential, a true standout in today’s crowded crypto market. The current presale phase offers a limited-time chance to secure a position in a high-utility ecosystem before it hits the public market and gains widespread attention. With Phase 2 selling out fast and a price increase scheduled for Phase 3, the window for achieving maximum returns is closing. The fear of missing out is driving investors to act now before this opportunity disappears.

Yet one digital asset continues to behave differently. XRP has shown a pattern of resilience that now separates it from the wider market and signals a shift worth monitoring. According to X Finance Bull, WisdomTree’s recent market data places XRP in a unique position. XRP is the only major cryptocurrency recording a year-to-date gain while others trend downward. WisdomTree confirms that XRP remains up roughly 4% this year, even as broader sentiment turns cautious. This divergence is attracting attention across the industry. Most top assets have posted negative performance during the latest downturn. Trading volumes dropped, and liquidity thinned across several key exchanges. Despite this environment, XRP maintained stability. Its ability to hold gains during a market retreat suggests deeper structural interest rather than speculative volatility. While the rest of the market slipped… $XRP quietly held the line WisdomTree just called it: XRP is the only major token showing a YTD gain in a sea of red. Up +4% despite the pullback. Something is happening with $XRP Slow strength > fast noise. Watch closely. pic.twitter.com/RPeogmzza9 — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 7, 2025 Institutional Signals Strengthen the Narrative The growing presence of regulated XRP products is playing an important role. Several ETP issuers, including WisdomTree, expanded XRP offerings this year. These products make it easier for institutions to gain exposure with compliance-friendly structures. Data also shows disciplined accumulation in XRP’s order books, revealing a steady influx rather than rapid emotional buying. On-Chain Factors Reinforce the Stability On-chain settlement activity for XRP remains consistent. Wallet flows show balanced movement between exchanges and self-custody. Such behavior usually reflects confidence from long-term holders. These holders often buy during downturns and provide quiet support during periods of volatility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Traders Should Pay Attention An asset that outperforms during weakness often signals a potential trend shift. XRP’s resilience creates attractive setups for traders watching for early momentum. Long-term investors may also see this moment as evidence of maturing market behavior. Strong institutional rails, combined with calm accumulation, reduce volatility while improving long-term expectations. Even with these positive signs, risks remain. Market shocks, liquidity drops, or regulatory surprises could weaken XRP’s position. Traders should treat the current strength as a signal to analyze further, not as a guarantee of a major breakout. Smart risk management remains essential. Slow Strength Is Building XRP’s recent stability is not random. It stems from institutional flows, consistent on-chain activity, and quiet accumulation during a market decline. These factors show that something meaningful may be forming beneath the surface. XRP is displaying slow strength rather than fast noise, and the coming weeks may reveal how significant this divergence truly is.

According to data retrieved by Finbold on December 7, traders on Polymarket currently price the likelihood at just 3%.

Source: Polymarket The market’s pricing, driven by Polymarket’s crypto -using participants who stake real funds on event outcomes, has trended sharply downward throughout the final quarter.

As of press time, traders had wagered more than $170,000 on the question, with resolution set for January 1, 2026. Notably, sentiment surrounding a possible record high has deteriorated in recent sessions in line with the broader market tone.

According to Lunde, the current market structure suggests strong upside potential, and Bitcoin's current valuation reflects panic rather than fundamental factors. “The probability of a market breakout to the upside is much higher than the probability of another 80% crash,” he said. K33 argues that investors are overly focused on distant threats, including the potential risks posed by quantum computing and speculation that Strategy (MSTR) might sell its Bitcoin holdings. The research firm argues that these concerns are overpriced in the market, while recent positive signals are being underestimated. Related News: Big Bull Michael Saylor Gave Today's Expected Bitcoin Signal These positive developments include the possibility of allowing crypto assets in 401(k) individual retirement accounts in the US and the Fed shifting to a more supportive stance towards crypto. K33's assessment suggests that despite increased volatility in recent weeks, the crypto market is showing signs of a structural recovery. Analysts believe the market's excessive fear-driven reactions will eventually stabilize, paving the way for a strong uptrend. *This is not investment advice.

The group now enables access to Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and USDC through its regional networks. The launch signals a major step by a traditional financial institution entering an increasingly competitive digital asset sector. Early Rollout Targets Two Million Customers BPCE introduced the service within four regional entities, including Banque Populaire Île-de-France and Caisse d’Épargne Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur. These entities represent around two million customers. The group plans to introduce the service across its remaining networks during 2026. However, executives want to monitor performance before accelerating expansion. Customers can buy or sell supported assets through the Caisse d’Épargne and Banque Populaire apps. Each user creates a dedicated digital asset account that carries a monthly fee of €2.99. Moreover, each transaction includes a 1.5% commission with a €1 minimum. Hexarq, BPCE’s crypto subsidiary, manages all related accounts. European Banks Intensify Their Crypto Push European banks are expanding digital asset services as more consumers seek regulated access. Fintech competition increased pressure on traditional banks. Apps like Revolut, Deblock, Bitstack, and Trade Republic attracted millions of crypto users across Europe. Consequently, major banks now view digital assets as an important retention tool. Several institutions already moved ahead. BBVA allows Spanish customers to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin and Ether through its app. Additionally, Santander’s digital unit Openbank added Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Polygon, and Cardano with integrated trading and custody. These developments show rising confidence among banks exploring broader crypto strategies for retail clients. BPCE Aims to Strengthen Its Retail Position BPCE sees digital assets as a way to strengthen customer loyalty during rapid fintech disruption. Moreover, the bank expects growing interest as users seek simple crypto access through familiar platforms. The phased rollout helps BPCE collect data and refine the service. This approach also prepares the bank for larger demand once digital asset regulations adjust across Europe. Significantly, the move aligns with a wider trend in European banking that supports regulated access instead of external platforms.

In this downtrend, Dogecoin is accompanied by the overall selling pressure in bitcoin and utter disappointment in the poor-performing Dogecoin ETFs that failed to attract even meager inflows of just $2.16 million. Presently, Dogecoin finds itself in the downtrend due to its failure to breach an important level of resistance at $0.1383. In this situation, investors are left wondering what crypto to invest in that has better potential. Factors like the potential for growth are attracting the attention of investors, who are looking for the best crypto to buy during this correction phase. Dogecoin: Structural Break Dogecoin’s recent treading makes it obvious how difficult it can be for narrative-driven assets in risk-off markets. The tokens breakdown was overwhelming, and it can be seen that the relative spike in trading volume of 650% above average reinforced this idea. Also, the lack of capital inflows from the ETF launch attempt has neutralized the near-term bullish factor. Though the asset is technically oversold, indicating that it may be due for a bounce, it has yet to indicate any sort of divergence or turn that may change its course. If DOGE is to change its course, it must overcome the resistance at the level of $0.1495—a difficult task given the current attitude in the markets. Behind this difficulty lies the current trend of smart investors looking for the next big asset, which may be based on solid fundamentals. Mutuum Finance: Offering an Appealing Alternative Unlike meme coins that are still very unstable, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is evidently one of the best DeFi crypto investments, and this is especially evident in the current ongoing presale. MUTM is currently in phase 6 of its presale, which is more than 95% full. In this phase, investors can still purchase MUTM at just $0.035, which is 250% higher than the first phase and prior to the impending 20% rise to $0.04 in phase 7. Starting at a launch selling price of only $0.06, those who are in on it are looking at making some heavy profits, making it one of the top cryptos to invest in for explosive growth. Having gained over $19,150,000 in funding from 18,330 investors in such a short period for the presale is testament to immense marketplace confidence. There is no doubt that FOMO is at play as this sell-out period nears. V1 protocol launch & Leaderboard The benefits of this project go beyond the pre-sale phase. Mutuum Finance is currently working on the development of the next generation of lending and borrowing protocol and aims to launch its V1 protocol in Q4 of this year on the Sepolia testnet. It will include the entire range of DeFi services such as Liquidity Pool and Liquidator Bot and will be operating on ETH and USDT lending & borrowing. In addition, the project encourages steady interaction through such functions as the 24-Hour Leaderboard, in which the leaderboard leader earns a daily bonus of $500 MUTM. For ease of accessibility, investors are now able to acquire MUTM tokens straight via their card, eliminating any obstacles that were present. In addition, as the independent security audit process at Halborn is underway, this project re-emphasizes its dedication to vigilance and security, making it one of the top cryptos to invest in. It is due to the convergence of several factors that this option emerges as one of the top choices for investors looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in during such uncertain periods. Final Considerations For those looking for the very best cryptos to purchase at present, it can be tough to reconcile risk and potential gain. Established cryptos that may be struggling can be deals, or revolutionary systems in the very early developmental phase may be showing potential for growth. Now that it has almost completed presale phase 6 and is on the verge of milestones in its development, it is difficult to deny that Mutuum Finance is such an opportunity.

Профессиональный игрок и амбассадор CoinPoker познакомил зрителей с уникальным материалом, который ранее не попадал ни на одну медиаплатформу. В преддверии премьеры прошел специальный 24-часовой розыгрыш, в ходе которого каждый новый подписчик автоматически участвовал в распределении призов на сумму $5 000. Этот запуск стал заметным шагом вперед в развитии личного бренда Мосбека и предложил поклонникам покера новый источник эксклюзивного контента и аналитики. ПОДПИСАТЬСЯ НА КАНАЛ Эксклюзивные кадры из Triton Invitational Montenegro: что увидели зрители Для первого ролика Мосбек подготовил материалы из турнира, который сам по себе вызывает огромный интерес — Triton Invitational Montenegro с бай-ином $200 000. Это одно из самых элитных событий мирового покера, где за столами собираются признанные мастера и известные VIP-игроки. На Дне 1 Марио оказался за столом с Филом Айви, Артуром Мартиросяном, Леоном Штурмом и Джонатаном Джаффе — соперниками, с которыми попадают в одну раздачу лишь лучшие. Видео включило разбор ключевых моментов турнира, детальные объяснения решений и взгляд изнутри на те раздачи, которые аудитория в обычных условиях никогда бы не увидела. Мосбек не только показал ход игры, но и поделился личными впечатлениями и комментариями о динамике стола. В ролик также вошла его «кулерная» вылетная раздача, ставшая одним из самых эмоциональных моментов сюжета. Простой и честный розыгрыш: как пользователи становились участниками За сутки до премьеры CoinPoker и Мосбек организовали акцию, в рамках которой разыгрывали $5 000 среди зрителей, успевших подписаться на канал. Условия были максимально прозрачными: действия требовалось всего одно — нажать кнопку «Подписаться» за сутки до запуска. В розыгрыше участвовали 200 билетов CoinMasters номиналом по $25, что давало победителям шанс попасть в турнир с гарантией $10 000. Все победители определялись посредством случайной выборки, а тикеты начислялись напрямую на их CoinPoker-аккаунты. Отсутствие скрытых условий и полного контроля случайности сделало акцию привлекательной как для новых пользователей, так и для постоянных поклонников платформы. Почему важно подписаться заранее: выгоды для будущих зрителей Хотя розыгрыш уже завершен, запуск канала ясно продемонстрировал, что это был лишь первый шаг. Канал Мосбека обещает стать регулярным источником аналитики с турниров высоких ставок, образовательных разборов и редких инсайтов, которые могут быть полезны игрокам любого уровня. Поскольку Марио многие годы является частью топовой профессиональной сцены, его контент представляет реальную практическую ценность. Не менее важно и то, что CoinPoker последовательно внедряет новые активности и промо-кампании. Если ранние подписчики уже получили возможность выиграть билеты CoinMasters, то будущие подписчики также смогут претендовать на новые розыгрыши и бонусы. Чтобы не упускать таких возможностей, достаточно подписаться на канал заранее и следить за обновлениями — это всего один шаг, который легко может превратиться в выгодное участие в следующей акции.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,OTHER,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-07 20:00:33

Market conditions remain volatile, yet many analysts believe a strong shift is building beneath the surface. Long-term holders see renewed confidence, while fresh liquidity continues to enter the market. The conversation has now intensified around one bold claim: XRP may be preparing for a dramatic move. In a recent post, STEPH IS CRYPTO shared a striking chart comparison that fueled this narrative. From this point onward, he will be referred to as Steph. His analysis compares Bitcoin’s historic 2013 breakout with XRP’s current trend. The visual sparked immediate debate across the crypto community. A Technical Setup That Commands Attention Steph’s chart places Bitcoin’s 2013 pattern beside XRP’s recent movements. Bitcoin delivered a tenfold surge after crossing its 200-day moving average. XRP now shows a similar structure on its higher time frame charts. The comparison highlights a possible momentum shift. The pairing does not promise identical results, but it raises important questions. Bitcoin’s 2013 rally began after a clean break above long-term resistance. Liquidity was thin, and market conviction grew quickly. Traders chased the move, and confidence accelerated the trend. The rally reshaped the market and introduced Bitcoin to a global audience. The episode remains one of the strongest historical examples of rapid crypto expansion. $XRP will explode, just like Bitcoin did! pic.twitter.com/R2eaj6aZF8 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 6, 2025 XRP’s Present Position in the Market XRP trades near the $2.00 region, holding a stable range despite recent volatility. Institutional interest has grown since the Ripple–SEC case concluded in mid-2025. Clearer regulation has strengthened investor confidence. Market depth for XRP has also improved across several exchanges. Its liquidity profile supports larger moves, both upward and downward. Similarities and Differences in Market Conditions There are similarities between Bitcoin’s old setup and XRP’s current structure. Both assets formed long consolidations before the momentum shift. Both showed improved strength above the 200-day moving average. However, differences remain important. Bitcoin’s market cap in 2013 was far smaller. XRP now operates in a more mature and competitive environment. These differences reduce the likelihood of a perfect replay. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Potential Catalyst Behind an XRP Breakout A breakout would require a strong combination of factors. Renewed liquidity must enter from institutional and retail players. Global risk appetite must remain favorable. Continued regulatory clarity will also play a critical role. If these conditions align, XRP could accelerate rapidly. The technical setup suggests strong demand near key support levels. Market Risks and What Traders Should Consider Every bullish setup carries risk. Global market weakness could disrupt momentum. A decline in crypto liquidity could slow acceleration. Unexpected regulatory events may also influence price. Traders should focus on disciplined planning and risk control. Chart similarities should guide awareness, not blind expectation. In conclusion, Steph’s analysis offers a compelling angle that invites deeper research. His comparison does not guarantee an outcome, yet it highlights a meaningful pattern. XRP sits at a critical stage that could define its next major trend . If historical conditions align with current dynamics, the asset may deliver a powerful move.

According to van de Poppe, a short-term correction could pave the way for a confirmation of the uptrend. The analyst stated that Bitcoin could make a correction that would sweep away the lows at the beginning of the week or before the FOMC meeting, and that a test of the $87,000 level is possible. In this scenario, Van de Poppe stated that if Bitcoin rebounds rapidly after the decline, it will re-enter an uptrend, arguing that he expects a rally to $100,000 within one to two weeks once the $92,000 resistance level is broken. He noted that macro factors such as the Fed's reduction of balance sheet contraction, preparations for interest rate cuts, and increased liquidity will support this rise. Related News: Big Bull Michael Saylor Gave Today's Expected Bitcoin Signal According to the analyst, the scenario has two critical invalidity points: Losing $86,000 could push the price into the $80,000 range. Failure to break and hold above $92,000 could invalidate the bullish scenario and increase the risk of a decline. Van de Poppe noted that Bitcoin swept through the above-mentioned area a bit earlier than expected, adding that the chart outlook is not bad. According to the analyst, a test of $92,000 in the coming days will strengthen the price's chances of reaching $100,000 and generate momentum in the altcoin market. On the other hand, in a bearish scenario, if the weekend volatility continues, closing below $86,000 could pave the way for a new test in the $78,000-$80,000 region. *This is not investment advice.

The Key Chart Signal You Need to See,https://cryptopotato.com/solana-sol-to-315-the-key-chart-signal-you-need-to-see/,"Solana (SOL) is trading near a key monthly support zone, with the price hovering around $132. Over the past week, it has dropped 3%, while daily losses stand at 1%. Consequently, traders are watching this area as it aligns with a long-term ascending channel support level. Testing Long-Term Support on Monthly Chart According to a chart shared by Rose Premium Signals, SOL is now sitting near the lower boundary of its ascending channel on the 1-month timeframe. This zone has previously acted as a base for multiple upward moves. Current price action suggests the level is holding for now. Notably, the chart outlines two upside levels: $263 and $315. These align with the channel’s middle and top. Price structure remains intact as long as the trendline is not broken. #SOL Monthly Channel Reversal Setup Solana is testing the major ascending channel support on the 1M chart — a historically strong reversal zone A successful bounce from this level sets up a clean path toward higher targets: • $262.62 • $315.43 pic.twitter.com/shMIvhWdO9 — Rose Premium Signals (@VipRoseTr) December 5, 2025 Furthermore, CryptosBatman posted a weekly chart showing SOL has stayed in a wide range between $125 and $250 for nearly two years. The price has once again reached the lower edge of this range. A small bounce has followed. The Stochastic RSI indicator is showing a golden cross, with values in the oversold zone. CryptosBatman said this “ might be a good setup here for a potential bounce .” As long as the price stays above the support, the range remains valid. Short-Term Moves Depend on Holding Support On the 4-hour chart, shared by BitGuru, SOL is reacting at a previously tested support zone between $124 and $125. After dipping to this level in late November, the asset bounced and is now moving around $138. Consolidation is visible below the $140 level. BitGuru noted, “If it holds above this level, a short-term move upward is possible.” If buyers maintain control above $134–$135, the price could push toward $145.84 and $149.31. If not, the lower zone may be tested again. ETF Launch and Market Flows Franklin Templeton launched its spot SOL ETF on December 5. It currently holds 17,000 SOL tokens, worth around $2.4 million. The ETF applies a 0.19% fee and will stake its holdings. As CryptoPotato reported , ETF data shows $531 million in inflows during the first week of trading. However, since November 26, Solana ETFs have seen money move out—except for November 28, December 2, and December 4, when inflows returned. Despite the recent pressure, total assets have stayed above $900 million. A fresh inflow of $4.59 million came in most recently, pointing to a possible shift in sentiment.

The majority of the stocks were in the red as the trading volume dipped by 25.66%. At the start of the week, BTC mining stocks had a trading volume of $413.5k, and by Friday, this number dropped to $307.35k. The market cap was standing at $69.12 billion on November 28th, but it dropped to $67.89 billion on December 5. Bitcoin mining stocks record 25 losers There are 34 BTC mining stocks listed on trading markets. Out of those, six stocks closed the week in the green while the remaining 25 mining stocks were in the red. The top 10 Bitcoin mining stocks were among the losers, except for Applied Digital Corporation (ticker: APLD) and Core Scientific, Inc. (ticker: CORZ). APLD finished the week with 15.20% gains, while CORZ saw a positive 1.30% during the same timeline. On December 2, Applied Digital invested $25 million in a funding round for Corintis, a Swiss company that develops advanced chip-cooling solutions. Corintis aims to improve efficiency and power density in data centers running AI workloads. Applied Digital wants to expand its footprint in designing, building, and operating high-performance data centers through investments and partnerships. VR Advisory Services, an asset manager, scooped up over 1.2 million CORZ stocks. The acquisition happened in the third quarter and was disclosed in an SEC filing dated November 14. CORZ closed the week at $17.11 while APLD was standing at $31.22. Among other winners for the last week include SATO Technologies Corp., SOS Limited, Cathedra Bitcoin, Inc., and Ebang International Holdings, Inc. The biggest loser for the week was American Bitcoin Corp. (ticker: ABTC) with a 47.40% price drop in five days. The company that was co-founded by Eric Trump saw a tough week. ABTC started the week trading at $5.75 and dropped to $2.23 by Friday. The heavy selling of ABTC happened at a time when Bitcoin climbed above $91k. Crypto-linked stocks followed suit and climbed higher. But ABTC tanked after a share unlock allowed early private investors to cash out for the first time. Eric Trump said on X, “Today our pre-merger private placement shares unlocked — these early investors are freely available to cash in on their profits for the first time, which is why we will see volatility.” American Bitcoin went public in September through a reverse merger with Gryphon Digital. Such a structure makes ABTC naturally volatile and attracts speculative traders. Market cap heatmap. Source: BitcoinMiningStock . Bitcoin production costs surge Based on data from CryptoRank , the average cash cost to mine one BTC among public miners climbed to $74,600. But the all-in cost including depreciation and SBC (stock-based compensation) jumped to $137,800. Mining profitability has tanked, especially after the hashrate shot past the symbolic 1 zettahashes per second (ZH/s) point. The competition among public BTC miners is intense. That’s why Bitcoin mining companies are moving to artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads to compensate for mining losses and diversify revenue streams. AI data centers have healthy profit margins compared to BTC mining. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $91k.

Bessent, stating that the economy is “in better shape than they expected,” stated that they expect 3 percent real GDP growth by the end of 2025. Addressing President Donald Trump's discomfort with media criticism, the minister argued that the economic outlook is more positive than previously thought, saying, “Real incomes increased by about 1 percent.” Bessent said holiday shopping was strong and that Trump's warnings of price increases months ago hadn't materialized. However, when asked about criticism of toy price increases, he said inflation was largely driven by the service sector and that price increases for imported goods were lower. When reminded that the poll found that 60% of Americans believe Trump's inflation statements are better than they actually are, and that the president's approval rating on the economy has fallen to 36%, Bessent suggested this was due to media rhetoric. “There are two components to purchasing power: inflation and real income. Real incomes are rising,” he said, arguing that the Biden administration has inherited a “legacy of embedded inflation.” Bessent stated that energy and regulatory shortages have fueled inflation during the Biden administration. He noted that, according to his calculations, the “ordinary person index,” which reflects the working class, has fallen below the general inflation rate for the first time. He added that he predicts inflation will fall even more sharply in 2026. When asked about criticism of food prices, Bessent acknowledged that grocery prices remain high, but argued that President Trump's launch of a “price-gouging investigation” over high beef prices was not consistent with the Biden administration's policies. “They didn't do it right, we'll do it right,” he said. Related News: South Korea Sees Trading Volume Surge in 21 Altcoins - Here's the List Bessent also addressed the agricultural agreement with China, stating that China had committed to purchasing 12.5 million tons of soybeans and that prices had increased by 12-15 percent since the agreement. However, he stated that China would not accelerate its purchases and was proceeding according to the schedule set out in the agreement. When reminded that the USDA was preparing a “bridge payment” for short-term support for farmers, Bessent explained that this was due to delays stemming from China's use of farmers as leverage in negotiations. The program also featured the newly announced “Trump accounts.” Under this plan, the federal government will open a $1,000 investment account for every US citizen born between 2025 and 2028.

This robust crypto ecosystem concluded its first phase in under two weeks, securing a substantial $500,000 . The momentum has only accelerated in Phase 2, which has already amassed over $570,000 in funding. With the current stage now more than 70% sold out, market analysts predict that Phase 3 could launch as early as next week. This rapid progression signals that the optimal window for early-stage investment is closing much faster than the market anticipated. Institutional Growth vs. Immediate Utility Solana is experiencing a massive institutional wave, marked by a 3.1M SOL staking milestone , a surge in TVL to $436M , and major adoption by Revolut . While Solana builds institutional trust, GeeFi is delivering tangible utility for individual investors right now. At the core of its ecosystem is the GeeFi DEX, a decentralized exchange that provides a secure, non-custodial trading environment. This empowers users to trade digital assets with complete autonomy, eliminating the security risks associated with centralized intermediaries. The ecosystem’s vision extends far beyond simple trading mechanics. GeeFi is preparing to roll out its own Crypto Cards, fully integrated with VISA and Mastercard, to bridge the gap between digital assets and everyday global commerce. This practical utility is reinforced by the GEE token’s deflationary architecture. Through a systematic token burn process, the protocol reduces the total supply over time. This scarcity mechanism is designed to reward long-term holders by fostering sustained value appreciation as the platform expands. The Financial Opportunity of the Year GeeFi’s presale is currently in Phase 2, offering tokens at the incredibly low price of $0.06 . This entry point offers a significant strategic advantage, as the token has a confirmed listing price of $0.40 , locking in a guaranteed 667% return for all presale participants. The long-term growth potential is even more compelling. With analysts forecasting a future price of $2 per token, a $1,600 investment today could potentially skyrocket to $60,000 , delivering a staggering 3,233% ROI . The velocity of the presale validates this bullish outlook. Over 9.5 million tokens have already been snatched up in Phase 2, raising more than $570,000 and demonstrating intense market demand. This strong performance has led experts to predict a swift conclusion to the current phase. Excitement is further amplified by leaked reports of upcoming listings on several major exchanges, a development that historically serves as a powerful catalyst for explosive price growth. Unmatched Passive Income and Rewards Beyond capital appreciation, GeeFi establishes a high-yield passive income structure through its versatile staking program. Accessible directly within the GeeFi Wallet, the platform offers flexible options tailored to every investment strategy. A no-lock staking plan offers up to 10% APR , perfect for those who value liquidity. For higher yields, fixed-term options provide 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and an industry-leading 55% APR for a twelve-month commitment . Additionally, the referral program rewards community growth, offering a 5% bonus on all investments made through unique referral links. Secure Your Spot Before the Next Price Jump Market insiders are increasingly identifying GeeFi as a potential 100x project, a rare opportunity in the current crypto landscape. This presale offers a limited-time chance to invest in a high-utility ecosystem before it enters the public market. With Phase 2 selling out rapidly and a price increase scheduled for Phase 3, the window to maximize returns is closing by the hour. The fear of missing out is driving investors to act decisively, securing their GEE tokens before this opportunity vanishes.

Two Markets, Two Moods",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-gives-a-mixed-signal-right-now-two-markets-two-moods/,"XRP sits in a confusing position as traders watch the market with growing caution. Price remains relatively stable, yet the underlying flows paint a divided picture. The asset now reflects two contrasting regional moods that shape sentiment differently. Arthur highlighted this divergence in a recent X post that quickly drew attention. His assessment focused on shifting exchange reserves and the behavior of both whales and retail traders. The data he shared shows the market moving in two directions at once. Binance Reserves Show Clear Outflows Binance has recorded a steady decline in XRP reserves over recent sessions. Whales continue to withdraw large amounts from the exchange. These withdrawals usually point to long-term accumulation. Off-exchange storage often signals stronger conviction among deep-pocketed holders. Lower supply on Binance tightens the liquidity pool. This tightening can support higher prices if demand continues to rise. XRP gives a mixed signal right now Binance reserves keep dropping → whales are withdrawing, supply is tightening Upbit & Bithumb reserves are rising → short-term selling pressure, Asia taking profits Two markets, two moods… pic.twitter.com/ebQgK6MvR1 — Arthur (@XrpArthur) December 7, 2025 Korean Exchanges Show Rising Supply Upbit and Bithumb are moving in the opposite direction. XRP reserves on both exchanges have been climbing. This rise suggests active selling and short-term profit-taking in the South Korean market. Korean traders often respond quickly to sharp movements. Their reactions sometimes cause sudden pressure during periods of uncertainty. The increase in supply on these platforms reflects a more defensive tone among retail participants. Two Markets Create Two Distinct Moods The global XRP market now splits into two clear camps. Western-based traders appear focused on accumulation and long-term positioning. Asian retail traders want to lock in gains while volatility stays high. These conflicting behaviors create mixed signals across major trading hubs. The result is an uneven structure that complicates short-term predictions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Impact on Market Structure The shrinking supply on Binance creates a potential bullish foundation. Reduced availability can amplify upward moves once demand strengthens. However, the rising supply on Korean exchanges introduces friction. This friction can slow momentum and delay breakouts. Traders now face a tug-of-war between tightening liquidity and renewed selling pressure. The balance between both forces will shape the next major move. Why These Signals Matter Exchange reserves often act as early indicators of sentiment. Withdrawals hint at stronger confidence. Rising reserves suggest hesitation or caution. XRP’s current split highlights a broader theme in global trading behavior. Different regions react to market conditions with different priorities. Understanding these flows helps traders avoid misleading signals and rushed decisions. What Traders Should Watch Short-term direction depends on which trend becomes dominant. If Binance outflows continue, tightening supply could support higher prices. If Korean sales accelerate, downward pressure may increase. Traders should monitor changes in exchange reserves and regional volume shifts. These metrics provide clearer insights than price alone. XRP now sits between two moods that define its immediate outlook. Arthur’s observation captures a market struggling between optimism and caution. The coming days will reveal which side gains control as liquidity patterns continue to shift. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to the report, while there were notable changes in user assets, the exchange generally maintained reserve ratios that more than covered customer balances. In Binance's latest snapshot, user balances and exchange reserves of dozens of assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, BNB, SOL, XRP, USDC, were compared. Users' Bitcoin holdings on Binance reached 617,620 BTC. This represents a 4% increase compared to November 1st. 23,768 BTC were added to user balances in the past month. The reserve ratio for BTC was recorded at 102.11%, meaning Binance holds more than enough reserves to fully cover users' BTC holdings, according to the report. Related News: Watch Out: Large Token Unlocking Events in 10 Altcoins This Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Binance users' ETH balances decreased by 1.32% to 4.04 million ETH.

Phase 6 has reached 95% allocation, creating urgency for buyers searching for what crypto to invest in as prices prepare to jump. The current valuation of $0.035, already up 250% from the Phase 1 level of $0.01, is becoming a focal point as investors shift toward the next big crypto poised for utility-driven growth. This rising traction is strengthening the view that MUTM is the best cryptocurrency to invest in as the year closes. Cardano Struggles As Market Signals Weaken Cardano has been showing renewed stress throughout November, and its recent behavior has turned many traders away while they assess what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in for short-term upside. ADA has been sliding in a clear downtrend after dropping more than 31% this month as large wallets ease off and money flow weakens. The Chaikin Money Flow indicator has been staying below zero, signaling that capital is exiting rather than entering, although price briefly attempted a rebound. Spent coins have increased sharply, which means more ADA is moving from storage to exchanges, creating pressure on supports that were already fragile. That shift in supply has intensified concerns because ADA must reclaim $0.438 to escape the downtrend. Losing that level would expose lower zones near $0.386 and potentially $0.354 if outflows continue. Traders monitoring what crypto to buy now have noted that ADA’s bounce attempts remain unstable, and its 1.9% weekly recovery has not changed the broader structure. Consequently, attention is rotating toward new crypto projects offering stronger momentum, which is increasing the appeal of alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for buyers seeking the best crypto to invest today. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Momentum Momentum has been accelerating around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as investors rush to secure tokens before the Phase 6 allocation closes out entirely. The stage has reached 95% completion, which means only a limited window is left to accumulate tokens at $0.035. $19,150,000 has been raised since the presale began and total holder count has climbed to 18,330, reinforcing the view that MUTM is emerging as a top crypto to buy during a period of renewed investor activity. Because Phase 7 will increase the price nearly 20% to $0.04, buyers evaluating the best cryptos to buy now are responding quickly. The upcoming launch valuation of $0.06 offers current participants an attractive 380% upside, which continues to draw interest. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also introduced a daily 24-hour leaderboard for depositors, and the top daily participant earns a $500 MUTM bonus after completing one transaction in the same period. The leaderboard refreshes at 00:00 UTC, and this gamified approach has amplified participation. In addition, buyers have been responding strongly to Mutuum’s $100,000 giveaway , where ten winners will receive $10,000 each. Early participants have been monitoring these incentives as they explore which crypto to buy today for long-term positioning. The team has further confirmed that an independent audit by Halborn Security is underway and that the lending and borrowing contracts are in the final review stage. Beyond the presale acceleration, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been preparing its V1 protocol for release. The platform will go live on the Sepolia testnet in 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens and a liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be supported initially for lending, borrowing and collateral, shaping a streamlined DeFi crypto environment that connects flexible markets with secure execution. Urgency Behind The Final Tokens Investors scanning the market for the best crypto to invest in are reacting swiftly because Phase 6 is selling out fast and the chance to acquire tokens at this level is almost gone. The price increase in Phase 7 will close this window, and many buyers do not want to miss the last heavily discounted tier. Interested participants should act quickly to avoid entering at the higher rate.

Shares in the GPU maker skyrocketed to as much as 470% on Thursday following its initial public offering (IPO) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, valuing the company at around RMB 282 billion ($39.9 billion). However, as the success was being celebrated online, a social media post revived claims that Moore Threads’ co-founder Li Feng borrowed 1,500 Bitcoins from Mingxing “Star” Xu, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange OKX , and never repaid the loan. Crypto past with OKX founder resurfaces In an X post, AB Kuai.Dong referenced Feng’s involvement in a 2017 initial coin offering that raised 5,000 ETH alongside controversial angel investor Xue Manzi. Feng allegedly dismissed the Bitcoin loan, stating, “It was just that Xu Mingxing’s investment in me had failed.” Xu responded to the post with a conciliatory message, writing, “People cannot always remain in the shadow of negative history. Face the future and contribute more positive energy.” He added, “Let the legal system handle the debt issue,” and offered blessings to every entrepreneur. Feng reportedly partnered with Xue Manzi and Li Xiaolai in 2017 to launch Malego Coin, which was later renamed Alpaca Coin MGD. The project reportedly raised approximately 5,000 ETH, but it was around this period that China banned ICOs, allowing regulators to crack down on what they viewed as speculative excess and potential fraud in the cryptocurrency sector. The Bitcoin loan dispute appears separate from the ICO controversy. According to sources familiar with the matter, the original loan agreement was dated December 17, 2014, with an expiry of December 16, 2016. It was subsequently renewed on March 30, 2017, with guarantees provided by Hu Zhibin. Xu previously posted publicly seeking a resolution and pursued legal action in both China and the United States. However, ambiguities due to the classification and legal status of cryptocurrencies at that time meant he never got a meaningful resolution. Moore Threads touted as China’s semiconductor champion Moore Threads, founded in 2020 by James Zhang Jianzhong, a former head of Nvidia’s China vice president who spent 14 years at the American chip giant, has positioned itself as a homegrown alternative to foreign GPU suppliers. The company’s IPO raised RMB 8 billion, around $1.1 billion. It also received regulatory approval in just 88 days, which is significantly faster than the average 470-day timeline for Chinese listings. Major investors include ByteDance , Tencent, Sequoia China, and DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, among others.

The Bitcoin price has decisively broken below the critical $90,000 psychological level, sending ripples through investor portfolios. According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $89,977.83. This sudden shift prompts a crucial question for every trader and holder: is this a temporary dip or the start of a deeper correction? Let’s analyze the landscape. What Triggered the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market movements are rarely caused by a single event. Therefore, understanding the confluence of factors is key. A sharp Bitcoin price decline often follows periods of excessive optimism or “overheating.” In this case, several potential catalysts are at play. First, broader macroeconomic uncertainty, such as shifting interest rate expectations, can trigger risk-off sentiment, impacting all risk assets including crypto. Second, large-scale sell orders from institutional whales or profit-taking after a rally can create sudden downward pressure. Finally, technical analysis levels, like the $90,000 support, act as magnets for market activity; breaking below them can trigger automated selling. How Should Investors React to BTC Volatility? Watching the Bitcoin price swing can be unnerving. However, seasoned investors know volatility is part of the crypto DNA. The key is to have a strategy rather than react emotionally. Consider these points: Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Ensure your exposure to Bitcoin aligns with your overall risk tolerance. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): For long-term believers, price dips can be opportunities to accumulate at a lower average cost. Set Clear Stop-Losses: Protect your capital by defining exit points before emotions take over. Look Beyond the Price: Assess fundamental developments like network adoption and regulatory clarity, not just daily charts. Is the $90,000 Level Still Important for Bitcoin? Absolutely. Major round numbers like $90,000 serve as powerful psychological benchmarks for the market. A sustained break below this level could see the Bitcoin price test lower support zones, potentially around $85,000 or $88,000, where previous buying interest emerged. Conversely, a swift recovery back above $90,000 would signal strong buyer conviction and could invalidate the bearish breakout. Monitoring how BTC interacts with this level in the coming days will be critical for determining short-term momentum. What’s the Long-Term Outlook for Bitcoin Price? While short-term fluctuations dominate headlines, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin often remains intact. Drivers like institutional adoption through ETFs, its role as a potential hedge against inflation, and the continued development of its underlying technology provide a foundational thesis. Today’s Bitcoin price action, though significant, is a single data point in a much larger chart. History shows that Bitcoin has weathered numerous corrections exceeding 20-30% on its path to new all-time highs. In summary, the drop below $90,000 is a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. It underscores the importance of disciplined investing, thorough research, and a focus on long-term fundamentals over short-term noise. Whether this is a buying opportunity or a warning sign depends entirely on your investment horizon and strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why did Bitcoin fall below $90,000? A: The drop is likely due to a combination of factors including macroeconomic pressures, large investor profit-taking, and the breaking of a key technical support level, which triggered automated selling. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A> This is a personal decision based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Panic selling during dips often leads to losses. Consider your long-term strategy, portfolio allocation, and whether your original investment thesis for Bitcoin still holds true. Q: Could the Bitcoin price go lower? A> Yes, it is possible. The next key support levels to watch are around $88,000 and $85,000. Market sentiment and broader financial conditions will determine if the decline continues. Q: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A> For investors using a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy, a lower price can be an opportunity to buy at a better average cost. However, trying to “time the bottom” is extremely difficult and risky. Q: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? A> Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. A significant drop in BTC price typically leads to declines across major altcoins, as investor sentiment and capital flow are interconnected. Q: Where can I reliably track the Bitcoin price? A> Use reputable and established cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken for real-time prices. Aggregator sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko also provide reliable data across multiple platforms. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin price movement helpful? Market insights are best when shared.
