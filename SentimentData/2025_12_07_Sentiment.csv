Extreme fear dominates crypto markets, yet history shows such conditions often precede major price reversals. Steph IS CRYPTO highlights that this contrarian environment could create a favorable risk-to-reward scenario for investors ready to act. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently shows “extreme fear,” historically a strong signal for potential upside. Similar readings in June 2022, April 2023, and July 2024 preceded significant gains for XRP. Such patterns suggest that patient investors could benefit by positioning themselves against prevailing market sentiment. Institutional Demand Is Rising Institutional interest in XRP is accelerating, particularly through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Recent data indicate that inflows to these ETFs are approaching $1 billion, signaling substantial demand from large investors. Surprisingly, XRP’s price has not yet fully reflected this inflow, creating a temporary disconnect between supply and market valuation. You Have NO Idea What’s Coming for #XRP … Watch asap! https://t.co/i0toVaF6WK pic.twitter.com/wIQHyTALEj — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 5, 2025 ETF inflows matter because they reduce available XRP supply on exchanges . Coins are being moved into custody, likely off-market and away from short-term trading. This tightening of supply sets the stage for a potential price reaction once buying pressure intensifies. Whales and Long-Term Holders Are Accumulating On-chain data shows XRP whales steadily accumulating while short-term holders continue selling. This shift implies confidence among long-term investors, who are absorbing selling pressure and reinforcing key support levels. Steph notes that long-term holders are buying again for the first time since October, signaling renewed conviction in XRP’s prospects. This dynamic often precedes bullish trends. When major holders accumulate while smaller investors exit, the stage is set for structural market improvements. It also suggests that the bottoming process for XRP could be concluding, offering a foundation for potential upward momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical Analysis Supports a Bullish Thesis XRP is consolidating around significant support zones, indicating stability in the short term. On the daily chart, prices show consistent support, while the 4-hour timeframe hints at a possible double bottom pattern — a classic bullish reversal formation. Traders are anticipating higher highs as these technical patterns materialize. If realized, the combination of support stability, long-term accumulation, and institutional inflows could spark renewed buying interest, creating a favorable environment for price appreciation. Caution Remains Essential While the setup is compelling, investors must remain cautious. Extreme fear can persist longer than expected, and crypto markets are increasingly driven by institutions, which may alter traditional sentiment-based signals. Historical trends provide guidance, not guarantees, and risk management remains critical. Combining institutional ETF inflows, whale accumulation, and technical patterns suggests XRP could be on the brink of a significant move . For informed investors, the current environment may represent one of the rare opportunities in today’s crypto markets.

According to Buterin, while transaction fees are low today, users don't have a clear understanding of how fees will change over the next two years. Therefore, the market needs a new mechanism to generate expectations about future gas fees. Buterin explained that such a futures market could function like a prediction market built on BASEFEE, allowing users to see market signals about future gas prices more transparently and protect themselves against potential price increases. This structure would effectively allow users to purchase the amount of gas they will need within a specific timeframe, effectively “prepaying.” Related News: Experienced Economist Says, “The Fed Should Not Cut Interest Rates Next Week,” Explains Why Vitalik Buterin also noted that there are already startups working in this area, citing the Oiler project as an example. However, Buterin argued that the ecosystem is not yet mature, stating that the development and widespread adoption of such solutions would provide significant security and predictability for Ethereum users. *This is not investment advice.

Some come from meme coins, others from strong utility projects, and a few appear early before the market notices them. As analysts prepare for the next major upswing, attention is shifting to three altcoins that could play a big role. Two of them already proved their power in previous cycles, while the third is now entering a critical stage with 94% of Phase 6 sold out and strong momentum behind it. Pepecoin (PEPE) Pepecoin (PEPE) entered the market with no expectations, yet it quickly became one of the most talked-about meme tokens of its era. The token surged massively during its first major run as social interest exploded across the crypto community. Its market cap grew faster than analysts expected, driven almost entirely by online culture and community momentum. Today, PEPE still remains a recognizable name in meme-coin circles, but its growth curve has slowed. Large market caps tend to limit explosive gains, and analysts say PEPE may struggle to repeat its original breakout. While spikes may still appear, many traders are now exploring new entries that offer higher upside and clearer development roadmaps. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) also delivered one of the strongest rallies in meme-coin history. SHIB grew from near-zero levels to an asset that reached billions in market cap and built a global community. Early investors saw massive returns, and SHIB cemented itself as one of the top altcoins of the previous bull cycle. But like PEPE, SHIB now faces the same limitation: size. Its market cap is large, and the token’s growth has become slower compared to its early days. Analysts say SHIB may still move with the broader market, but the possibility of sharp, early-cycle gains is lower than before. Many traders now watching top crypto discussions are looking toward younger projects with more room to grow. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While PEPE and SHIB already had their explosive runs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is just beginning. The project is building a fully decentralized lending system with real utility, and its early progress has caught the attention of analysts tracking new crypto launches. Mutuum Finance opened its presale at $0.01 in early 2025. The token now trades at $0.035, marking a 250% rise from the first stage. The project has raised $19.1 million and passed 18,300 holders, with more than 810 million tokens already purchased. Out of the 4 billion total supply, 1.82 billion tokens were allocated for early backers. Phase 6 is now 94% sold out, and analysts say the shift from one stage to the next could happen without warning. Interest has been rising faster in recent days as traders search for DeFi projects with utility rather than meme-driven movement. The team confirmed through its official X account that the V1 testnet will launch on Sepolia in Q4 2025. This first version includes the liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tracking, and the liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be the first supported assets. This clear development roadmap is one of the reasons analysts expect MUTM to play a major role in the next market cycle. Price Outlook Mutuum Finance uses mtTokens to reward suppliers. When someone lends assets, they receive mtTokens that grow in value as borrowers repay interest. The yield depends on real usage, not set rewards. The platform also uses a buy-and-distribute model. A portion of revenue will be used to buy MUTM from the open market. Those purchased tokens are redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. Analysts say this creates long-term buying pressure that can support strong price movement once the platform gains active users. Accurate pricing is also important for lending markets, so the protocol will rely on Chainlink price feeds, fallback oracles, aggregated data, and on-chain DEX pricing when liquidity is strong. This ensures liquidations happen at the right time and keeps positions safe. Market analysts studying early DeFi cycles say that tokens with real lending utility tend to gain traction quickly once their first version is active. Some believe MUTM could rise 400% to 700% after V1, especially as long as borrowing markets grow at the pace seen in past DeFi expansions. L2 Expansion Mutuum Finance is preparing to introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin that will be minted and burned based on demand. The stablecoin will be backed by interest paid by borrowers, giving the protocol a stable internal asset for borrowing and lending. This is important because stablecoins have historically played a major role in the growth of DeFi ecosystems. The project also plans to expand to multiple layer-2 networks where fees are low and user activity is high. Analysts say this expansion could help Mutuum Finance enter a much larger market, with deeper liquidity pools and more borrowing demand. If the stablecoin and layer-2 rollout match expectations, some analysts believe MUTM could join lists of next crypto assets with strong growth potential heading into 2026. Strong Audits, Daily Incentives, and Presale Acceleration Security remains a strong focus for the team. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score. Halborn Security is reviewing the lending and borrowing contracts, while the project runs a $50K bug bounty to find vulnerabilities early. The project also has a 24-hour leaderboard where the top daily contributor receives $500 in MUTM. This feature has kept the community active and has helped push the treasury forward each day. With card payments available and increasing whale activity, the final section of Phase 6 is moving fast. Analysts say a recent $100K whale allocation is a strong signal that larger investors are entering before the next stage begins. PEPE and SHIB had their explosive moments, and both remain major names in the altcoin market. But analysts say their best days may be behind them. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, is in its early stages with real utility, rising demand, strong audits, and a confirmed V1 launch. With 94% of Phase 6 already sold out, this new DeFi project is now one of the top candidates for traders searching for the potential best crypto to buy now before the next cycle.

Earlier this week, the Polish President, Karol Nawrocki, vetoed a bill aimed at setting strict rules in the country’s digital assets market. Why Did The Polish President Veto The Digital Asset Bill? On Friday, December 5, Bloomberg reported that the lower house of the Polish parliament couldn’t secure the required three-fifths majority vote to override the President’s veto of the Crypto-Asset Market Act. This bill, introduced in June 2025, aimed to align Poland with the European Union’s MiCA framework for the digital asset markets. Related Reading: Key Updates On The US Crypto Market Structure Bill: What You Need To Know However, President Nawrocki decided against signing the crypto market legislation due to concerns that it may pose a real threat to the freedom of Poles, their property, and the stability of the country. According to the country’s leader, “overregulation” is one way to drive away new companies and investors, while seriously slowing innovation. As Bitcoinist earlier reported , the crypto community in Poland had already raised concerns about the regulation as early as September, especially as the bill surpassed the European Union (EU) minimum regulatory requirements. For instance, the bill’s messaging read that all Crypto Asset Service Providers are required to obtain a license from the Polish Financial Service Authority (KNF). Meanwhile, the bill proposed heavy fines and potential prison time for market participants who break the law. According to the Bloomberg report, supporters of the bill have also voiced out the need to provide regulatory oversight of Poland’s digital assets industry. Their belief is that clear, comprehensive rules are critical to fight fraud and avoid potential misuse of digital assets by bad actors. Poland’s Presidency Calls Crypto Bill A Legal Fiasco Rafael Leskiewicz, the press secretary of the President, took to the social media platform to react to the lawmakers’ failure to override the veto. The presidential spokesperson said the Crypto-Asset Market Act is a legal fiasco, while calling the attempt to overturn the president’s veto a political maneuver. Leskiewicz said in a statement: The President, by vetoing this act, exposed the low quality of the legislation being created. This market should be subject to monitoring and control, but certainly, bad law should not be created that restricts the freedom to conduct business activities. President Nawrocki, who was elected earlier in June, had always portrayed himself as a pro-Bitcoin leader who would rather veto regulatory restrictions than create new digital asset laws. According to market data, the adoption of crypto assets by Polish households has continued to grow in recent years, with the number of domestic users expected to hit 7.9 million by this year’s end.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Crypto-Asset Market Bill|Digital Assets|Karol Nawrocki|poland,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 20:30:42

The presale’s Phase 1 concluded in just over a week, a stunning achievement that saw 10 million tokens fly off the shelves and $500,000 raised. That momentum has only accelerated, with total funds now rocketing past the $1 million milestone from a rapidly expanding base of over 2,100 investors. As a decentralized ecosystem built on the principle of user ownership, GeeFi is capturing the attention of smart money. Analysts are now forecasting that the upcoming Phase 3 will last no more than 10 days, driven by strong rumors that the team is in advanced talks for major exchange listings. A Clear Upgrade From Legacy Coins While established altcoins show signs of weakness, with Ripple (XRP) currently trading around $2.06 and struggling with volatility, investors are seeking shelter and upside in GeeFi. This non-custodial ecosystem offers a solution to the centralization risks plaguing the industry. The GeeFi Wallet gives users 100% control over their private keys, providing a level of security that custodial platforms cannot match. The feature-rich mobile app is already available on Android, with an iOS version in development. The GeeFi ecosystem is far more than just a wallet. It integrates a powerful Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that supports over 14 networks, allowing for seamless asset swaps and bridging. The highly anticipated GeeFi Crypto Card is set to revolutionize crypto spending, enabling global transactions with both VISA and Mastercard. Developed since 2023, the GeeFi Team has built a platform focused on real-world utility and financial sovereignty, positioning it as a superior alternative to older, less secure networks. The Presale That Guarantees Explosive Returns The GeeFi presale is engineered to generate exceptional returns for its early supporters. Now in Phase 2, tokens are available for just $0.06 each. This incredibly low entry point is causing a surge in demand, as the confirmed listing price of $0.40 guarantees investors a massive 667% return. The potential for life-changing wealth is staggering: a $1,200 investment today could balloon to $40,000 if the token hits a $2 valuation, delivering a mind-blowing 3,233% ROI. With Phase 2 already 70% sold out, having raised over $570,000 from the sale of 9.4 million tokens, the window of opportunity is closing fast. Staking Rewards That Dominate the Market GeeFi is creating powerful incentives for long-term holders by offering some of the most competitive and sustainable yields available. Investors can lock their GEE tokens to earn an incredible 55% APR for 12 months. For those seeking greater flexibility, the platform also provides shorter-term options, including 22% APR for three months and 15% APR for just one month. Even better, users who prefer to keep their assets fully liquid can earn up to 10% APR without any lock-up period. The rewards don't end with staking. GeeFi’s innovative referral program gives users a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through their unique referral link. This approach encourages organic community growth and rewards early adopters for spreading the word. These high-yield passive income streams, all accessible within the secure GeeFi Wallet, make holding GEE a cornerstone of any serious wealth-building strategy. Your Final Call to Secure a 100x Gem This is a defining moment. Analysts are calling GeeFi a potential 100x gem, and its explosive presale performance in a shaky market validates that belief. While other investors are stuck waiting for legacy coins to recover, the smart money is moving into a project with a working product, a clear vision, and unprecedented ROI potential. The fear of missing out is justified. Phase 2 is selling out at a record pace, and a price increase is imminent. This is your final opportunity to secure a position in the next big crypto disruptor before it goes mainstream. Act now before this chance disappears forever.

GeeFi's presale has shown remarkable momentum, finishing its first phase in just over a week by selling 10 million tokens and raising $500,000. In total, the project has already raised over $1 million and established a strong community of more than 2,100 investors. GeeFi is a comprehensive non-custodial ecosystem, and experts predict its upcoming Phase 3 will sell out in under 10 days due to widespread talk of listings on major exchanges. Looking Past the Dogecoin Ride While Dogecoin (DOGE) investors are used to its frequent and often unpredictable price swings, many are now looking for a utility-driven asset. That search is leading them directly to GeeFi, a project many analysts believe will be 2026's 100x gem. It provides a single, intuitive platform where users can manage assets across more than 14 networks, swap tokens, and bridge chains without the usual complexity. This all-in-one solution addresses a major need for crypto users who require both security and convenience. The GeeFi Team began development in 2023 and went public in 2024, consistently delivering feature updates to its wallet. This dedication to building a functional product first is what separates it from other projects. The platform gives users full control over their private keys, ensuring their assets are always secure. With the Android app already live and an iOS version in development, GeeFi is demonstrating a commitment to tangible progress, reinforcing its potential to be 2026's 100x gem. The GeeFi Presale Opportunity GeeFi has now advanced to Phase 2 of its presale, with a token price of $0.06. By buying now, investors lock in a guaranteed return of 667% based on the planned $0.40 listing price. The potential for massive returns is substantial; an investment of just $1,800 at the current price could expand to $90,000 if the token reaches the analysts' forecast of a $3 valuation, achieving an incredible 4,900% ROI. Analysts have praised GeeFi's presale for its incredible performance. The momentum from Phase 1 has carried over, with Phase 2 already 70% complete in only 5 days, raising $570K from 9.4M tokens sold. Experts now believe Phase 3 will begin next week and will not last long, as rumors intensify about GeeFi preparing for listings on major exchanges. This is a key reason many see it as 2026's 100x gem. Powerful Staking and Referral Rewards One of the most compelling features driving demand for GeeFi is its robust staking program. Investors can generate significant passive income through multiple flexible options. By locking tokens, users can earn an impressive 15% APR for one month, 22% APR for three months, or a substantial 55% APR for a 12-month term. For those who prefer to keep their assets liquid, GeeFi offers a staking option with no locked funds that still provides returns of up to 10%. To further increase earnings, GeeFi has implemented a generous referral program. By sharing your personal link, you can earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made by your referrals. This system creates a strong incentive for community growth and allows early supporters to multiply their holdings. These features provide real, sustainable yield, attracting investors serious about maximizing their portfolio's performance. Your Final Chance for a Ground-Floor Entry The window of opportunity for life-changing investments in crypto is often small. GeeFi's presale represents one of those rare moments to get in on a project with massive potential before it becomes widely known. The combination of a deflationary token model, a working product, and a clear path to adoption with its upcoming crypto card positions GeeFi to become a significant force in the industry. The rapid pace of the presale signals strong market confidence. As the market prepares for the next major upswing, projects with strong fundamentals and real utility are set to lead the charge. Missing out on GeeFi now could be a major regret when the token launches on major exchanges and its full ecosystem is deployed, validating the belief that it is 2026's 100x gem. The time to act is now. Securing a position during the presale is the best way to capitalize on the explosive growth that experts are forecasting.

This comprehensive crypto platform completed its first phase in under two weeks, raising an impressive $500,000. The momentum has surged into Phase 2, which has already brought in over $570,000. Analysts are watching closely as the current phase is now more than 70% sold out. Projections suggest Phase 3 could start as early as next week, signaling that the window for early-stage investment is closing rapidly. Shifting Focus from Market Leaders to Real Utility Solana is showing resilience, holding a key support level at $135 with a remarkable $3.092B in DEX volume and a potential rally toward $150. While Solana’s performance is notable, many investors are looking for opportunities with higher growth ceilings. GeeFi is emerging as a prime candidate, offering a platform built on tangible, real-world utility. At its core is the GeeFi DEX, a decentralized exchange that provides a secure, non-custodial environment for trading digital assets with complete user control. The ecosystem’s utility extends far beyond just trading. GeeFi is set to launch its own Crypto Cards, integrated with VISA and Mastercard, to bridge the gap between digital finance and everyday global commerce. This real-world application is powered by the GEE token's deflationary design. Through a system of programmed token burns, the protocol is designed to methodically reduce the total supply, increasing scarcity and rewarding long-term holders with sustained value appreciation. A Financial Opportunity with Massive Growth Potential GeeFi's presale is currently in Phase 2, with tokens priced at just $0.06. This presents a compelling financial opportunity, as the token has a confirmed listing price of $0.40, locking in a guaranteed 667% return for presale investors. The long-term outlook is even more impressive. Based on analyst forecasts of the token reaching $2, an initial $1,600 investment could potentially grow to $60,000, delivering a staggering 3,233% ROI. The presale’s velocity supports this bullish sentiment. Over 9.5 million tokens have been sold in Phase 2 alone, raising over $570,000 in a short period. This intense demand has led experts to predict that the current phase will sell out within days. Excitement is further fueled by discussions from the GeeFi team about upcoming listings on several major exchanges, a development that often acts as a powerful catalyst for explosive price growth. Redefining Passive Income with Advanced Staking In addition to its capital growth potential, GeeFi offers a highly competitive staking program designed to generate passive income for its community. Accessible via the GeeFi Wallet, the platform provides flexible options for all investment strategies. Users can earn up to 10% APR on their tokens without any lock-up period. For those seeking higher yields, GeeFi offers 15% APR for a one-month term, 22% APR for three months, and an impressive 55% APR for a twelve-month commitment. The ecosystem also features a referral program, giving users a 5% bonus on all contributions from their referrals. Don't Miss the Next Breakout Success Market analysts are increasingly singling out GeeFi as a potential 100x project, a rare find in today's crowded crypto space. The current presale phase offers a limited-time opportunity to secure a position in a high-utility project before it hits the public market and gains widespread attention. With Phase 2 selling out fast and a price increase scheduled for Phase 3, the window for achieving maximum returns is closing. The fear of missing out is driving investors to act now before this opportunity is gone.

Despite the growing concern among Americans regarding inflation, President Trump continues to claim that prices are falling and the economy is recovering. President Donald Trump’s verbal attacks continue Financial commentator Peter Schiff publicly challenged President Donald Trump on Saturday after the president attacked him on Truth Social for appearing on Fox & Friends Weekend. The president’s attack on Schiff was in response to his discussing the affordability crisis facing Americans during his morning television appearance on December 6, 2025. Trump posted on Truth Social, questioning why Fox & Friends would host Schiff. The president described Schiff as a “Trump hating loser who has already proven to be wrong.” Trump insisted that prices are substantially reducing and blamed former President Joe Biden for creating the affordability crisis. He claimed gasoline hit $1.99 per gallon in certain states and that other prices are almost all down. Hours later, Schiff responded on X, challenging Trump or his designee to a debate on the U.S. economy and the effectiveness of his policies. In a separate post, Schiff suggested Trump should change the name of his social media platform to “Lie Social,” considering his dislike for the truth. During his Fox & Friends appearance, Schiff explained that the inflation rate is going to accelerate as Trump’s term progresses and that the policies continue to impact pricing. He told the show’s host, Griff Jenkins, that Biden had a lot of help in causing the affordability crisis, including from Trump during his first term. Schiff stated that Trump is not fixing the problem but making it worse. The President has continued to dismiss concerns about affordability as a Democrat con job. During a cabinet meeting this week, the president said that the word affordability is a Democrat scam. He argued that Democrats just say the word, but it doesn’t mean anything to anybody. However, Google search data shows that searches for affordability are up 110% compared to a year ago. How did Schiff and Binance’s CZ go? Prior to his exchange with the President, Schiff was in Dubai at Binance Blockchain Week, where he had a debate with Changpeng Zhao , known as CZ, the founder of Binance and Giggle Academy. The debate centered on Bitcoin versus tokenized gold as forms of money. During the Dubai debate , Schiff argued that Bitcoin is backed by nothing and has no inherent value. He stated that Bitcoin is a speculative asset with no utility beyond transferring it to someone else. Schiff also promoted his TGold platform, which allows users to purchase physical gold through a mobile app and store it in secure vaults while transferring or redeeming it digitally. CZ’s defense was Bitcoin’s widespread adoption and its practical advantages. He noted that 300 million people on Binance alone all have some kind of Bitcoin. He pulled a piece of gold from his pocket and explained the difficulty in transporting gold to demonstrate the benefits of Bitcoin’s portability. Schiff insisted that money requires physical backing to be credible and that Bitcoin’s price is driven primarily by speculation. CZ dismissed this notion, comparing Bitcoin’s value to tech platforms like Google or X, stating that many virtual things have value not tied to physical properties. President Trump recently granted a full pardon to CZ, who had faced legal issues related to his role at Binance. Trump said CZ wasn’t guilty and was persecuted by the Biden administration.

GeeFi has demonstrated incredible market strength with its explosive presale, concluding Phase 1 in just over a week. This initial stage saw 10 million tokens completely sell out, raising $500,000 in record time. The momentum has only grown, with total funds now surging past the $1 million milestone, backed by a loyal and expanding community of over 2,100 holders. GeeFi is a complete decentralized ecosystem built on the principle of user ownership, and this vision is attracting serious attention. Analysts are now forecasting that the upcoming Phase 3 will last no more than 10 days, fueled by rumors of advanced talks for major exchange listings. A Tangible Ecosystem in a Speculative Market The market for meme coins remains highly volatile, with Dogecoin (DOGE) trading between $0.14-$0.15 and holding a $23 billion market cap based on hype. For investors seeking real-world utility over speculation, GeeFi offers a powerful alternative. The GeeFi Wallet, a non-custodial mobile application, gives users complete control over their private keys, a level of security that centralized platforms cannot match. The app is already live on Android, with an iOS version in active development to expand its reach. GeeFi’s ecosystem is far more than just a secure wallet. It features a built-in Decentralized Exchange (DEX) with support for over 14 networks, allowing for effortless cross-chain swaps and bridging. The upcoming GeeFi Crypto Card will further connect digital assets to everyday life, enabling users to spend their holdings globally via the VISA and Mastercard networks. The GeeFi Team, which has been developing the project since 2023, has delivered a platform focused on tangible utility and financial freedom. An Unmissable Presale with Guaranteed Returns The GeeFi presale is structured to provide early investors with phenomenal returns. The project is currently in Phase 2, offering tokens at just $0.06 each. This incredibly low entry point has ignited a buying frenzy, as the confirmed listing price of $0.40 guarantees a 667% return for presale participants. An investment of just $1,200 today could transform into $40,000 if the token reaches a conservative $2 valuation, delivering a mind-blowing 3,233% ROI. The urgency is palpable, as Phase 2 is already 70% sold out, with over 9.4 million tokens sold, raising an additional $570,000. Rumors of the team considering listings on top-tier exchanges are only intensifying the demand. Unlock Powerful Passive Income with GeeFi Staking GeeFi offers some of the most attractive and sustainable yields in the crypto space, creating compelling incentives for long-term holding. Investors can earn an impressive 55% APR by locking their GEE tokens for 12 months. For those who need more flexibility, the platform also provides a 22% APR for a three-month lock and 15% APR for one month. In a standout feature, users who prefer to keep their assets liquid can still earn up to 10% APR without any lock-up period. The earning potential is further amplified by GeeFi’s referral program, which offers a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through a user's personal link. This smart growth mechanism rewards community builders and accelerates the expansion of the ecosystem. These high-yield passive income streams, all managed within the secure GeeFi Wallet, make holding GEE a powerful strategy for wealth generation. Your Final Chance to Secure a 100x Opportunity In the crypto world, timing is everything. The explosive growth of GeeFi's presale during a period of market uncertainty is a clear indicator of its massive potential. While others are distracted by the unpredictable nature of meme coins, savvy investors are securing their position in a project with a functioning product, a clear roadmap, and staggering ROI potential. Analysts are calling GeeFi a potential 100x gem, and with Phase 2 selling out fast, the fear of missing out is very real. This is your chance to invest in the next big thing before it goes mainstream. Secure your GEE tokens now before this opportunity disappears.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level. In September, the price saw high volatility reaching as high as $0.0260 but failed to stay at the level and ended the month below the $0.02200 mark. In October, the price declined further and ended the month below the $0.01500 mark as bears dominated the crypto markets during the later half of the month. in November, the downtrend continued with VET ending the month below the $0.130 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|VET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-06 21:00:00

It Was Overlooked in Yesterday’s Headlines,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-this-be-the-reason-behind-bitcoins-recent-drop-it-was-overlooked-in-yesterdays-headlines/,"The National Security Strategy published yesterday by US President Donald Trump increased geopolitical risks and created severe unease in the cryptocurrency markets. Following the document, the Bitcoin price fell to the $89,000 level, and the possibility of a new “crypto winter” was brought to the agenda among market participants. The strategy document released by the White House conveys the message that the US will no longer carry a significant portion of the global defense burden alone. Reminiscent of Trump's speech at the United Nations last year, the text states, “The days of the US carrying the entire world order on its back like an Atlas are over.” The document states that developed countries allied with the US must assume greater responsibility in their own regions. Although the strategy document is not legally binding, analysts note that it increases uncertainty in the market, putting downward pressure on crypto assets. Related News: What Do Current Options in Bitcoin (BTC) Indicate? The crypto market's strong reaction stems from expectations that a potential increase in defense spending could delay interest rate cuts by central banks. The strategy document advocates for NATO countries to increase their defense budgets from 2% to 5% of GDP. The possibility of governments borrowing to fund such an increase could increase inflationary pressures. Rising inflation puts pressure on risky assets because it could lead central banks to delay interest rate cuts. Low interest rates typically drive investors into riskier assets, particularly cryptocurrencies. Therefore, any delays in rate cuts could weaken Bitcoin's bullish potential. Despite this, markets are still anticipating a rate cut at next week's Fed meeting. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch tool puts the probability of a 25 basis point cut at 86%. A Reuters survey of 100 economists similarly suggests a high probability of a rate cut. Forecasts on the Polymarket platform put the probability as high as 94%. *This is not investment advice.

She made the statement on X in response to a user who seemed to imply that Binance’s official X account is being run like a group controlled by a “bunch of KOLs.” A quick run through the page will show nothing but official updates and occurrences, but the statement was enough to put He Yi on the defensive. He Yi’s response He Yi did not like the implications of the statement the user made on X. According to her, the official Binance X account is run by competent staff who have the freedom to choose the style of posts. However, that freedom is restricted to their work and the level of creativity they are allowed to apply while doing it. He Yi drew the line at the participation of said employees in the launching or promotion of any tokens. She acknowledged the fact that the BNB memecoin space getting active again has encouraged the community to start tokenizing words excerpted from posts made by the official Binance X account, or by her. But none of that has anything to do with Binance itself. She also insisted that the increased frequency does not mean they will stop posting. She clarified that her statement regarding “encouraging employees to innovate and try” has to do with only their daily work and not “coin issuance projects.” Her post comes at a time when tokenization has taken center stage in crypto discussions, and memecoins have become a fixture in the patchwork. Binance brass preach accountability It is not the first time He Yi has spoken up about the current token trend. In the past, she has urged users to take responsibility for their actions and start actively trying to protect themselves from pump and dump schemes by doing better research and being more vigilant. Chanpeng Zhao has also sounded similar warnings several times in the past. As recently as last month, he took action against people he claimed were selling X accounts he was following by unfollowing many of them. Those accounts have reportedly been used for a laundry list of bad acts. Zhao urged users on X to avoid buying those handles, promising to “unfollow any sold accounts,” and asking his followers to report any account they see on sale. “Let me know,” he wrote . “DM, tweet, notify interns,” adding that he follows accounts randomly because they are “supportive, informative, positive energy people in the community.” Regardless of their warnings, the crypto trenches tend to defy logic and warnings. It only took one photo of CZ’s dog before countless meme tokens named for the Broccoli went viral. CZ’s tweet about the upcoming release of the BNB Chain’s Four.meme token launch at the time also set off a frenzy for meme coins, so-named too. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This follows a Wednesday appeal in which a court overturned a previous dismissal. Florida Ruling Revives Binance Lawsuit A Bloomberg report reveals that a judge has determined that the crypto exchange can be sued locally for allegedly failing to prevent the stolen funds from being transferred. The plaintiff, Jonny Chen, says he fell victim to a 2022 scam that drained 1,000 Bitcoin from his account. He further claims that he immediately notified Binance at the time and requested that the platform freeze the assets, but alleges the company did not act quickly enough, allowing the money to disappear. The victim had initially filed a negligence lawsuit in Florida, but the trial court dismissed the case on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction because Binance is headquartered overseas. However, the recent appeal has now reopened the door for it to proceed. The decision said that Binance’s digital presence and business activity in Florida, including marketing to local users and offering services through its platform, were sufficient to establish legal jurisdiction. The court wrote that Chen “will have a fresh opportunity to show he can sue Binance Holdings Inc. in state court over an alleged theft of eighty million dollars’ worth of Bitcoin.” It also said the lower tribunal had made an error when it decided it could not hear the case. Jurisdiction Disputes This is not the first time a crypto company has delayed or contested legal action by raising jurisdictional challenges. Several large platforms have postponed or escaped litigation by arguing that regulators lacked authority over them due to their overseas registration. For instance, in the case of BitMEX, American investors had accused the firm of market manipulation and operating without proper licensing. However, the company countered that it was beyond U.S. reach because it was incorporated in the Seychelles and had no physical footprint in the country, which led to delays and partial dismissals in the proceedings. KuCoin, another foreign-based operator, faced action in New York for allegedly offering unregistered securities. The company had initially disputed the case by insisting it had no major ties to the United States. Despite this, New York’s Attorney General later relied on the Martin Act to move forward despite the firm’s objections. Bitfinex and its affiliate Tether have also dealt with multiple claims involving alleged market manipulation and transparency shortcomings, with the two initially challenging U.S. authority, citing foreign incorporation. Despite this, some litigation eventually moved forward and resulted in settlements.

Although the recovery of ETH is promising, focus is being placed more on new projects that can provide early-stage opportunity and actual utility. A new crypto with a great potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on the verge of completing an important milestone with Phase 6 about to be fully allocated, having attracted more than 18,350 investors and having raised almost $19.15 million. Mutuum Finance is a well-priced, decentralized lending and borrowing, interest-bearing and yield-driven token, with a well-developed roadmap, culminating with the V1 Sepolia testnet release, making it the best crypto to invest in to be exposed to high potential, utility-driven token early in 2025. Investors searching for the next big crypto and the top crypto to buy are increasingly turning toward MUTM due to its strong fundamentals. Ethereum Recovers $3000 in a Bullish Frenzy Ethereum (ETH) has moved back up to the $3,000 level and it is backed by a big bull divergence that most analysts see this as the indicator of all-time highs. It is predicted that there may be a potential increase to $4,958.75 and some analysts believe that the potential of ETH increase to $5,000 may be achievable as long as the momentum and the market environment continue to be conducive. This newfound confidence in ETH has redirected investor interest to projects with high early potential, and innovative tokens, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), have found themselves attracting more and more investor attention. This rising attention reinforces MUTM’s position as the next big crypto and a top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance Presale The presale of Mutuum Finance is constantly picking up pace with Phase 6 filling up. Starting at $0.01 when the sale was initiated in 2025, MUTM has since taken a steady increase to $0.035 in its present phase, which is an increase of 250% reported even prior to exchange listing. All previous rounds were sold out quickly, which highlights the long-term attention to the utility of the project with its DeFi focus. Phase 6 is nearly emptied, so investors are moving as fast as possible to get tokens before the next price increase puts MUTM even nearer to its established launch price of $0.06. So far, the presale has raised over $19.15 million in contributions and has made MUTM one of the best early-stage crypto projects of the year. In addition to its powerful fundraising trend, Mutuum Finance stands out among most altcoins due to its execution of useful features in a fully developed DeFi system, a feature that is an attractive entry point to early adopters who may be interested in long-term usability. With this level of traction, traders label MUTM as the next big crypto and among the absolute top crypto to buy before its price increases. Growth indicates the extent to which MUTM tokens have been adopted by first time entrants. The project has been attracting interest in the world of crypto due to the growth and advancement of the platform and presale. A total amount of 1.82 billion tokens has been assigned to the presale. Over 800 million tokens are already sold. Since the current stage is nearing its limit and the price is drawing nearer to the $0.06 listing value, the urgency has been increasing. This is coupled with the lending and borrowing led, yield oriented DeFi structure of the platform, which contributes to making MUTM a prospective early stage asset to accumulate. Such adoption further strengthens its reputation as the next big crypto for long-term growth and a top crypto to buy during its presale window. Roadmap Development Mutuum Finance is in Phase 2 of its roadmap, which is core protocol development. This stage comprises smart-contract engineering, integration of the backend system, revised risk-management systems, liquidation operations, and sophisticated analytics. Frequent development team updates are indicators of a serious dedication to the provision of secure, efficient, and scalable DeFi environment. With these elements approaching their completion, the expectation grows more and more regarding the upcoming Version 1 release of the protocol, a move that would go a long way in increasing platform adoption and solidifying MUTM as a newcomer in the decentralized finance industry. Mutuum Finance has received almost 18,350 investors who have invested almost $19.15 million, with Phase 6 almost sold out at $0.035. Its price is up by 250% since, with this being the last opportunity to purchase the token before Phase 7 raises its price to $0.04. As V1 Sepolia testnet is just a few days away, MUTM will be providing a fully operational DeFi platform where lending and borrowing are possible with interest rates on yields. Before this discounted phase dies off, early investors will be able to get tokens at the official presale. This opportunity positions MUTM as the next big crypto and the top crypto to buy.

The account ties early, small bets to later services now offered to advisors and clients. Early Interest Turned Practical Around 2013, a small group inside Fidelity began meeting to learn what Bitcoin might mean for the firm. They mapped out 52 possible uses. Most ideas did not survive testing. One early result — accepting Bitcoin donations for charity — gave the team credibility outside the company and opened doors for deeper work. That early credibility made it easier for the firm to test bigger ideas without waiting for orders from the top. A Bold Mining Bet Paid Off Johnson pushed for a $200,000 purchase of Antminer hardware at a time many inside opposed the move. Reports say that mining effort became “probably the single highest IRR business” Fidelity has had. The decision put staff into Bitcoin’s technical layers, giving them real experience with wallets, security, and the plumbing of the network long before many rivals caught up. Company Moves Into Custody Based on reports, demand from financial advisors drove Fidelity toward custody services. Advisors wanted secure ways to help clients hold and pass on Bitcoin, and Fidelity responded by building custody, custody-adjacent products, and support across asset management and research. Johnson told the audience she owns Bitcoin personally and described it as a core digital asset that could play a role in people’s savings plans. She calls it crypto’s “gold standard.” Exchange Supply Drops As Accumulation Continues Market data referenced in the session showed Bitcoin trading above $89,000 while balances on centralized exchanges fell to roughly 1.8 million BTC — a level not seen since 2017, according to aggregated CryptoQuant and Glassnode figures cited by BRN Research. Realized-cap growth stayed positive on a monthly basis, which analysts interpret as fresh capital entering the market even when price moves stay contained. Shark Wallets And Network Growth For Ethereum Reports also pointed to Ethereum strength. ETH climbed past $3,200 as so-called shark wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH resumed accumulation. Daily new addresses briefly neared 190,000 following the Fusaka upgrade, a spike that analysts say often lines up with stronger demand for ETH. Market Signals And What’s Missing Analysts quoted in the briefing noted that supply leaving exchanges and steady accumulation point to longer-term holders taking control. What the market lacks, they said, is a decisive push into the roughly $96K to $106K band that would signal a broader breakout. For now, accumulation continues while prices trade in a tighter range. Based on reports from the conference, Fidelity’s crypto path reads like a slow build: small internal experiments grew into real operations, and a handful of early bets — including a $200,000 mining play — gave the firm practical know-how. Combined with current on-chain signs of accumulation, the picture suggests established players and patient holders are shaping market supply even as price momentum waits for a clearer trigger.

With key support levels holding and bullish patterns forming, the market may be setting up for a notable upside. Golden Pocket Rejection: Confirming The High-Risk Scenario In a recent update on X, analyst Luca referenced his recent market commentary, noting that Ethereum price action unfolded exactly as he had anticipated, with the price tapping into the lost high-timeframe support range. This range aligned with the golden pocket between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels, and the price rejected there, confirming the high-risk scenario he had highlighted in advance. Related Reading: Ethereum Coils For A Breakout As IH&S + Heavy Accumulation Emerges Since that rejection, the price has broken below the key 0.618 Fibonacci Point of Interest (POI). However, the asset is still managing to hold above the crucial 1-Day Bull Market Support Band. Luca stressed that this band has historically served as a strong reversal spot over the last couple of months. Thus, he believes the current low-timeframe market structure is not yet fully invalidated. Despite this technical hold, the analyst reiterated his cautious approach, stating that until he sees clear signs of strength on the low-timeframes, signs that can durably confirm the bottom is in and that key support levels are properly reclaimed, he won’t scale out of his edges. Luca concluded that until that concrete bullish confirmation materializes, the most likely outcome for the immediate future remains further consolidation. The market needs time to absorb the recent volatility and build a new base before a more durable reversal to the upside can take hold. ETH/BTC Trendline Breakout: Market Risk Appetite Returns Crypto analyst Paramatik outlined that a major structural event has occurred on the ETH/BTC charts: a falling trend breakout. This is a highly significant development, although Paramatik suggests that a retest of this broken trendline may occur before the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Sitting On Its Most Critical On-Chain Support Level — A Rally Emerging? The analyst provided clarity on what this breakout means for the broader market. First and foremost, this situation is interpreted as a strengthening signal for Ethereum. When ETH begins to gain value relative to Bitcoin, it typically indicates that the market’s overall risk appetite is returning, as investors shift capital from BTC to ETH. Secondly, the gained strength in Ethereum is often the key trigger for the start of the much-anticipated altcoin season. This is because investors first shift funds from BTC to ETH, and then move capital into the riskier, smaller altcoins in hopes of achieving higher returns. Paramatik summarized his findings by stating that this breakout in the ETH/BTC pair is not merely a technical line break; it is a harbinger of a market direction change. The analyst concluded with an analogy that the market has reached a state where every external event, even humorously irrelevant ones, could affect crypto prices.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $573.15, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,327.46 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we’ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question “How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?” and we’ll try to answer that.

Overall the altcoin has gained 0.58% of its value across the last 24-hours as SOL stabilizes at the price level. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL holds above $130 The one-day price chart of the Solana shows that the decline is continuing with the drop below the $125 mark before the bulls found support enabling recovery. However, after failing to climb past $140 the price is now headed back towards $130. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is narrow, leading to low volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $145.58 The indicator’s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $125.68. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the neutral area but is quite close to the oversold region. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 42.03, and its downwards curve signifies a dominance of sellers. If selling activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows strong bearish activity at the current price level as bears erase last few days progress. The altcoin’s price has decreased to $133 as bears continue to dominate the price action. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a higher volatility level. This level of volatility signifies increased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $146.80, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $133.08, indicating support. The RSI indicator is in the oversold region. Currently at 40.32 the RSI curve is pointing down, confirming an increase in selling activities. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph indicates support from the buying side of the market at the current price level. We can expect further decline if selling activities persist for a few more hours.

If selling pressure continues, we might see the price fall to $130. On the other hand, if buyers return to control the price chart, we might see a price increase to retest the resistance level at $140. Is SOL a good investment?

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170. In November, the decline continued with SOL ending the month below the $130 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-06 22:15:00

The ETF, which is the first pure spot-based product focused on XRP, recorded strong activity on its opening day, hitting $58 million . Even with this positive event, the overall market environment has remained weak, placing downward pressure on XRP. Current Market Performance A market-wide pullback has affected most major assets. Bitcoin dropped below the important $100,000 level, and this shift put pressure on XRP as well. Since the decline started in early November, XRP’s market value has fallen by $14.63 billion, bringing its total valuation to $137.12 billion. This represents a large drop from its highest market cap of $216.69 billion, set on July 18 when XRP’s price reached $3.66. Compared to that peak, XRP is now short by almost $80 billion. If the market recovers, XRP could regain the value it has lost. However, with ETF inflows rising rapidly , some projections go further. These explore what could happen if XRP gains up to $1 trillion or more, going far beyond its previous highs. Can XRP Add $1 Trillion to its Market Cap? Much of the current speculation centers on what would happen if XRP’s market cap expanded by an additional $1 trillion . This level of growth is rare in the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin remains the only digital asset to have crossed that threshold. It reached a trillion-dollar valuation in early 2021, increased further during the peak of that cycle, then dropped sharply during the 2022 bear market. It has since recovered and now holds a valuation of about $1.92 trillion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If XRP adds $1 trillion to its present market cap, the new total would stand at $1.137 trillion. Based on the current supply of about 60 billion tokens, this would place XRP close to $18.95. This price would exceed its previous highs and move it into the double-digit range that analysts have discussed for years. Expectations for Future Levels Several analysts have mentioned the possibility of XRP climbing above $18. One analyst, Dr. Cat, has suggested that this range becomes possible if the XRP-to-Bitcoin ratio rises to a specific zone and Bitcoin reaches a much higher price. A separate view from Changelly projects that XRP could reach $19.62. However, Changelly’s timeline places this several years from now, with 2030 as the target period. If XRP ever reached a valuation of $1.137 trillion, it would rank among the most valuable companies in the world, higher than Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan, Walmart, and Visa. While this scenario is hypothetical, it reflects ongoing discussions about XRP’s long-term potential . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $88,951.1. This sudden movement has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting urgent questions about market stability and future direction. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters for your portfolio. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Fall Below $89,000? Market corrections are a normal part of any asset’s lifecycle, and Bitcoin is no exception. The drop below $89,000 is likely a confluence of several factors. First, profit-taking by short-term traders after a recent rally can create immediate selling pressure. Second, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as interest rate fears or geopolitical tensions, often trigger risk-off sentiment, impacting high-volatility assets like crypto. Finally, large sell orders on major exchanges can trigger automated stop-losses, accelerating a downward move. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for navigating volatility. What Does This Price Action Mean for Traders? For active traders, this dip presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Key support and resistance levels are now being tested. The immediate focus will be on whether the Bitcoin price can hold above $88,000 or if further downside is imminent. Here are actionable insights for different trading styles: For Swing Traders: Monitor the $88,000 level closely. A strong bounce could signal a buying opportunity, while a break below may indicate a trend reversal. For Long-Term Holders (HODLers): Short-term fluctuations are often noise. This dip could be a chance to dollar-cost average if you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term thesis. For New Investors: Volatility is standard. Never invest more than you can afford to lose and consider this a live lesson in market cycles. How Should Investors React to Bitcoin’s Volatility? Emotional decisions are the enemy of sound investment. When the Bitcoin price moves sharply, it’s vital to stick to your pre-defined strategy. Did you have a plan for a 5% or 10% drop? If not, now is the time to create one. Diversification remains a cornerstone of risk management. Furthermore, consider the source of your information. Rely on data from reputable exchanges and trusted analysts rather than social media hype. This disciplined approach separates successful investors from reactive speculators. What’s the Future Outlook for the Bitcoin Price? Predicting the exact future Bitcoin price is impossible, but we can assess the landscape. On-chain data, such as exchange flows and whale wallet activity, provides clues about investor sentiment. Additionally, institutional adoption trends and regulatory developments will play a significant long-term role. While today’s drop is notable, it’s a single data point in Bitcoin’s broader journey. The fundamental narrative around digital scarcity and decentralized finance remains unchanged for many proponents. In conclusion, the break below $89,000 is a significant market event that demands attention but not panic. It underscores the inherently volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets. By focusing on data, maintaining a clear strategy, and understanding the underlying causes, investors can navigate these waves with greater confidence. The key takeaway is to use such movements as learning experiences to refine your approach to the dynamic world of crypto investing. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the Bitcoin price drop a sign of a bear market? A: Not necessarily. A single drop below a support level is a correction, not a confirmed bear market. A bear market is typically defined by a sustained downtrend over a longer period. Q2: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A: This depends entirely on your investment goals and risk tolerance. Selling based on fear often leads to buying back at higher prices. Consult your investment plan before making emotional decisions. Q3: What is a good entry point after this dip? A: There is no perfect entry. Strategies like dollar-cost averaging (investing a fixed amount regularly) can help mitigate timing risk instead of trying to “catch the bottom.” Q4: Could the Bitcoin price go lower than $88,000? A: Yes, it is possible. Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. The next major support levels are often watched, but nothing is guaranteed in these markets. Q5: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies (altcoins)? A> Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. A significant drop in BTC’s price usually leads to larger percentage drops in most altcoins, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” Q6: Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price data? A> Use established tracking websites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, and verify prices directly on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase for the most accurate real-time data.

55442403,https://timestabloid.com/?p=91621,1765065645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Crypto Analyst: XRP Flash Crash Imminent. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-analyst-xrp-flash-crash-imminent-heres-why/,"Market commentator ExtraVod has issued a new warning about XRP, stating that a flash crash is imminent. According to him, current conditions suggest the asset may face a sharp downward move before any meaningful recovery. His remarks follow several days of price weakness, as XRP has gradually retreated from the rebound that pushed it to $2.21 on December 4. Since then, the asset has slipped to about $2.03, a decline that may only represent the early stage of a broader correction. Market Liquidations and Volatility In his video , ExtraVod highlighted rising liquidations across the crypto market. Citing The Kobeissi Letter, he noted that $200 million in positions were wiped out within four hours on December 5 after Bitcoin briefly fell below $90,000. XRP FLASH CRASH IMMINENT — ExtraVOD (@ExtraVOD_) December 5, 2025 Although BTC later steadied near $89,500, Coinglass data showed liquidations climbing to $412.6 million over 24 hours, mostly from long positions. ExtraVod said this sharp increase reflects a stressed market and creates conditions where a sudden, disruptive move becomes more likely as liquidity clusters and traders remain overexposed. Is a Flash Crash Coming? A central part of ExtraVod’s argument comes from the recent behavior of XRP’s price structure. He highlighted that since April 2025, the asset has formed a sequence of higher lows during each corrective phase. XRP bottomed near $1.61 in early April, around $1.77 in October , then near $1.81 in late November, and finally at approximately $1.98 at the start of December. While this pattern may appear constructive, ExtraVod believes these levels have become too narrow and have attracted an excessive number of stop-loss orders. He contends that this cluster of liquidity below each successive bottom creates an incentive for market makers to drive the price downward in order to clear these positions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He warned that such a move could happen quickly and forcefully, which is why he characterizes it as a potential flash crash. Even so, he does not view the scenario as entirely negative. He maintains that once this liquidity is removed, XRP could break free and establish a more stable foundation for upward momentum . Additional Bullish Signals ExtraVod also highlighted XRP’s weekly RSI, noting what he considers a hidden bullish divergence . He explained that XRP formed a higher low on price after its November 2024 bottom near $0.5, while the RSI set a lower low, falling from about 44 and potentially dropping below 30 if a flash crash occurs. He believes this pattern suggests the broader uptrend remains intact. If a flash crash pushes the RSI into oversold territory, XRP could rebound from that level and eventually move toward new highs once volatility settles.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.25 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility. 2025 has been a defining stress test: Pi surged to about $2.98 in February, crashed to a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, and now trades near $0.22 in early December, highlighting extreme volatility as the year closes. But basic building blocks continue to keep investor interest alive, including the Passkey security improvement to Pi Wallet, Pi DEX, and AMM on Testnet, Pi Network Ventures pushing towards decentralization and AI with OpenMind, and millions of new KYC verifications and continuing projects such as the 2025 Pi Hackathon and Sign Protocol partnership. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2025–2031 favors a sustained recovery or further downside. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.2269 Price Change 24h 1.8% Market Cap $1.89B Circulating Supply 8.34B PI Trading Volume 24h $14.07M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.2269 Price Prediction $ 0.1692(-25.01%) Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 5.14% (High) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2348 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 48.50 (Neutral) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Pi trades around $0.2269, up about 1.8% in the past 24 hours after bouncing off intraday lows near $0.221. Daily RSI is near 45, still below the neutral 50 line, while MACD is around zero with a slightly negative histogram, suggesting weak upside momentum in a wider downtrend. Key resistance remains at $0.240 and $0.250, with support clustered at $0.220, then deeper around $0.205–$0.200. As of December 6, 2025, Pi Network is posting a modest recovery after earlier December weakness. PI network is currently changing hands near $0.2267, with a market cap at roughly $1.89 billion and 24-hour volume down to about $14 million, signaling that the latest bounce is happening on lighter trading activity. Price is holding above the $0.22 floor but has not yet shown the strength needed to challenge the major resistance band just below $0.25. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows a small green candle following several sessions of sideways-to-lower action since the late-November peak near $0.28 and $0.29. Today’s candle trades between $0.2237 and $0.2325, with a close around $0.2269, which reflects stabilization rather than a decisive reversal. Pi remains well below its November top and still trades under the key $0.24 and $0.25 resistance zone, meaning the larger 2025 downtrend is intact. The RSI (14) stands near 45.17, with its signal baseline around 52.32. This places momentum slightly below neutral but off the more depressed levels seen earlier in the week, showing that selling pressure has eased even though buyers have not fully taken back control. A sustained push above the 50 midpoint would be an early sign that bulls are regaining momentum. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26), the histogram is about -0.0025, while the MACD and signal lines sit close to -0.0010 and 0.0015. All three readings are very close to the zero line, but the negative histogram tells us the MACD line is just under the signal line again. This configuration signals fading upside momentum: the prior bullish impulse has largely run out of steam, yet the market has not rolled into a sharp new down-leg. Immediate resistance is still concentrated around $0.240, where several November rallies stalled, followed by a heavier ceiling in the $0.260and $0.280 area. First support remains at $0.220, with stronger backing at $0.205 and $0.200. A 24-hour close below $0.220 would revive the risk of retesting the October capitulation lows, while a decisive break and hold above $0.240–$0.250 would suggest that December’s volatility is beginning to resolve into a more constructive base. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi is trading around $0.2266, almost flat on the session after failing to build on its earlier intraday bounce. Price continues to move in a tight band between roughly $0.22 and $0.24, with the structure since late November still showing lower highs from the peak near $0.28, which keeps the short-term bias mildly bearish to sideways. The RSI (14) is at about 42.47, with its signal line near 40.02, meaning momentum is still below the neutral 50 mark but no longer oversold. This points to weak but improving buying interest: bulls are defending the $0.22 area, yet they have not mustered enough strength to flip the trend. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the three readings sit close to zero around 0.0002, –0.0025, –0.0028, indicating that both MACD lines and the histogram are clustered around the baseline. This shows a very flat momentum profile, with neither side in clear control and no strong follow-through after the recent bounce. For a convincing bullish reversal on this 4-hour timeframe, Pi would need to break above the $0.235–$0.240 zone with a clear MACD turn higher; otherwise, the market remains vulnerable to another dip back toward $0.22 if sellers reassert themselves. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2984 SELL SMA 5 $0.2746 SELL SMA 10 $0.2590 SELL SMA 21 $0.2456 SELL SMA 50 $0.2348 SELL SMA 100 $0.2800 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2383 SELL EMA 5 $0.2426 SELL EMA 10 $0.2650 SELL EMA 21 $0.3013 SELL EMA 50 $0.3603 SELL EMA 100 $0.4533 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to stay range-bound between $0.22 and $0.24 in the short term, with weak but stabilizing momentum as buyers and sellers balance out. A daily close above $0.24 and $0.25 with RSI pushing back over 50 and a clean bullish MACD crossover could open room toward $0.26 and $0.28. If $0.22 breaks on strong volume instead, focus will quickly shift to the deeper $0.205 and $0.200 support zone and a possible retest of October’s lows. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price up today? Pi is up today mainly because Pi Network rolled out AI-powered KYC tools that speed up verification for millions of users, boosting confidence ahead of December’s 190M PI token unlock. Technically, the price also bounced from key Fibonacci and support levels near $0.223–$0.225 after RSI left oversold territory, attracting short-term dip buyers. However, gains are capped by ongoing regulatory worries, especially China’s “air coin” warning and thin liquidity that could be pressured once the $43M unlock hits the market. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network is traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-07 00:15:00

While the premier cryptocurrency has been on something resembling a recovery path since the market bloodbath, some sectors believe that the bear season has already kicked off. With BTC sitting beneath its opening price of 2025, it is becoming increasingly difficult to make a bullish case for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Moreover, an interesting data point about a relevant class of Bitcoin investors has emerged, further adding credence to the beginning of a possible bear market. Are Bitcoin Treasury Firms Offloading Their Coins? In a new post on X, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, shared an on-chain insight to support the hypothesis that the Bitcoin bear market has started. This conclusion is based on the Balance Growth of an investor group known as the “dolphins.” Dolphins refer to a group of crypto investors holding substantial amounts of a coin, placing them between small investors (shrimps) and the largest investors (whales). Specifically, Moreno described dolphins as wallet addresses with significant BTC holdings between 100 – 1,000 coins. According to the latest data from CryptoQuant, the growth in the Dolphins’ BTC holdings has slowed down in the past year and appears to be in a downward trend. Moreno believes that this negative change points to the emergence of a Bitcoin bear market . Moreno revealed that these Dolphin addresses had increased year-over-year by roughly 965,000 BTC when the BTC price hit its current all-time high around $125,000. Now that the BTC price is nearly 30% below its record high, the Bitcoin Dolphins’ balance stands at around 694,000 coins. Moreno wrote on X: This address cohort includes ETFs and Treasury companies, which have also stopped buying. More interestingly, the CryptoQuant Head of Research revealed that this investor group consists of ETF issuers and Treasury companies, which have stopped purchasing Bitcoin. According to data from SoSoValue, the US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have posted net outflows in five out of the last six weeks. Meanwhile, BTC and crypto treasury companies have struggled in the past few months, with retail investors losing tens of billions to the hype. While there have been rarely reports of crypto treasury sell-offs, this decline in these Dolphins’ holdings tells an entirely different story. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,151, reflecting an over 3% decline in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin dolphins|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-07 00:30:36

Pat Gelsinger, the former Intel CEO who spent 35 years at the chip giant, is now leading a startup called xLight that just secured a preliminary deal for up to $150 million from the US Commerce Department. This isn’t just another funding round—it’s a bold attempt to solve the semiconductor industry’s most critical bottleneck and potentially resurrect Moore’s Law from its perceived slowdown. Why Pat Gelsinger Bet His Reputation on xLight A year after his departure from Intel, Pat Gelsinger hasn’t slowed down. Now a general partner at Playground Global, he’s working with 10 startups, but xLight has captured his primary attention. “I have this long-term mission to continue to see Moore’s law in the semiconductor industry,” Gelsinger said at a recent StrictlyVC event. “We think this is the technology that will wake up Moore’s law.” What makes xLight so special? The startup is developing massive “free electron lasers” powered by particle accelerators that could revolutionize semiconductor lithography —the process of etching microscopic patterns onto silicon wafers. Gelsinger explains the significance: “About half of the capital goes into lithography. In the middle of a lithography machine is light… this ability to keep innovating for shorter wavelength, higher power light is the essence of being able to continue to innovate for more advanced semiconductors.” The Government’s Unprecedented Role in Semiconductor Innovation The xLight deal represents a significant shift in how the US approaches technological competitiveness. The Commerce Department is set to become xLight’s largest shareholder through funding from the Chips and Science Act. This arrangement has raised eyebrows in Silicon Valley, where free-market principles have long been sacred. California Governor Gavin Newsom captured the industry’s unease: “What the hell happened to free enterprise?” But Gelsinger remains unapologetic about the government partnership. “I measure it by the results,” he said. “Does it drive the results that we want and that we need to reinvigorate our industrial policies? Many of our competitive countries don’t have such debates. They’re moving forward with the policies that are necessary to accomplish their competitive outcomes.” Key Aspect Traditional Approach xLight’s Innovation Light Source Integrated into each machine External utility-scale system Scale Machine-sized components Football field-sized facilities Wavelength 13.5 nanometers (current EUV) Targeting 2 nanometers Power Source Conventional lasers Free electron lasers with particle accelerators How xLight’s Technology Challenges ASML’s Dominance The ASML competition represents one of xLight’s biggest challenges. ASML, the Dutch company, currently dominates the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) market with near-total control. xLight’s approach fundamentally differs from ASML’s integrated systems. Nicholas Kelez, xLight’s founder and CEO, explains their revolutionary concept: “We go away from building an integrated light source with the tool, which is what ASML does now and that fundamentally constrains you to make it smaller and less powerful. We treat light the same way you treat electrical power or HVAC. We build outside the fab at utility scale and then distribute in.” The company plans to build machines roughly 100 meters by 50 meters—about the size of a football field—that will sit outside semiconductor fabrication plants. These free electron lasers would generate extreme ultraviolet light at wavelengths as precise as 2 nanometers, far more powerful than the 13.5 nanometer wavelengths currently used by ASML. The Road Ahead: Can This xLight Startup Deliver? xLight faces significant hurdles on its path to commercialization. The company aims to produce its first silicon wafers by 2028 and have its first commercial system online by 2029. However, several critical questions remain unanswered: Customer commitments: No major chipmakers have committed to purchasing xLight’s technology yet ASML integration: While discussions are ongoing, ASML hasn’t formally committed to buying the technology Competition: Other startups like Substrate (backed by Peter Thiel) are pursuing similar approaches Technical challenges: Building football field-sized laser facilities presents unprecedented engineering challenges Gelsinger acknowledges the uncertainty: “We’ve agreed in principle on the terms, but like any of these contracts, there’s still work to get done.” When asked whether the $150 million funding could end up being double the announced amount—or potentially not materialize at all—he remained candid about the ongoing negotiations. FAQs: Understanding the xLight Revolution Who is Pat Gelsinger and why is he involved with xLight? Pat Gelsinger spent 35 years across two stints at Intel, eventually serving as CEO before his departure in late 2023. He’s now a general partner at Playground Global and serves as xLight’s executive chairman, bringing his semiconductor expertise to the startup. What makes xLight’s technology different from ASML’s? While ASML builds integrated lithography machines with built-in light sources, xLight treats light as a utility. They plan to build massive free electron laser facilities outside fabs and distribute the light to multiple machines, potentially achieving shorter wavelengths and higher power. How does this relate to Moore’s Law? Moore’s Law predicts that computing power should double every two years. As chip features shrink, better lithography technology becomes essential. xLight’s potentially more powerful light sources could enable continued miniaturization, thus sustaining Moore’s Law. What role does the US government play? The Commerce Department is providing up to $150 million through the Chips and Science Act, becoming xLight’s largest shareholder. This represents a shift toward more direct government involvement in strategic technologies. Who is Nicholas Kelez? Nicholas Kelez founded xLight after leading quantum computer development at PsiQuantum and spending two decades building large-scale X-ray science facilities at national labs including SLAC and Lawrence Berkeley. The Bottom Line: A Calculated Gamble with National Implications Pat Gelsinger’s bet on xLight represents more than just another venture investment—it’s a strategic move with implications for national competitiveness, technological sovereignty, and the future of computing. The partnership between a Silicon Valley veteran and the US government signals a new era in industrial policy, where the lines between public and private sector innovation are blurring. For Gelsinger, this is personal. “My mind is so stretched here, and I’m just grateful that the Playground team would have me to join them and let me make them smarter and be a rookie venture capitalist,” he said. Then he added with a grin: “And I gave my wife back her weekends.” Whether xLight succeeds or fails, its story illuminates the changing dynamics of technological innovation in an era of geopolitical competition. The semiconductor wars have entered a new phase, and the battlefield now includes government boardrooms as well as research laboratories.

Some of the names that are making the most noise in the new cycle are Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and the new up-and-coming player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , three very different players but sharing the same commonality, the potential for high returns. ADA remains one of the assets that many people are banking on for the long term, as the growth of the ecosystem sends the message for potential re-pricing, and DOGE, as it always does, remains one of the most volatile assets that can easily spark off explosions and rallies based on the evergreen factor of the community. But the new kid on the block, MUTM, has already put itself into the frame as the best crypto to buy, based on the break-out presale and the quick-growing demand that’s available for the crypto, which is priced at $0.035. Investors are increasingly seeing MUTM as the next big crypto to watch. Cardano Rebounds Sharply as Buyers Support Crucial Demand Area Cardano (ADA) had finally exhibited some kind of reaction as it fell as low as $0.37, but ever since, the traders had initiated strong buy signals that raised the prices from $0.37 to $0.45, showing an improvement of over 20%, which again perceives the region of $0.32-$0.36 as an important area where the demand for ADA resides. On the basis of the performance above $0.42, the short-term trend for ADA looks more favorable, opening gates for potential targets such as $0.48, $0.52, and $0.57. As ADA tries to sustain this upsurge, the focus of investors is shifting towards the new DeFi platforms developing rapid network effects, which gives increasing attention to the potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the next big crypto in 2026. Dogecoin Attempts Rebound as Buyers Defend Key Support Levels Dogecoin (DOGE) had been falling for the last few weeks, but it appears that the price movements are now coming alive as it rebounds from the major support area, which had previously acted as the same area that initiated many rallies. Market players are slowly making their entrance again, and if the trend continues, it looks like it could make an attempt to re-enter the upper levels, thus igniting the bull run again. As different coins start showing some activity despite the turbulent marketplace, the focus of the investors is drifting towards the new possibilities that are coming alive, thus naturally leading to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), considered the best crypto to buy for its early-stage potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Nearly Finished in Phase 6 Mutuum Finance enters the last leg of the Phase 6 presale as the interest and demand for the project show no signs of slowing. Created to promote multi-level pricing, the ongoing presale offers the best crypto to buy entry levels for the earliest investors. Started off initially at $0.01 during the Phase 1, MUTM is now up to $0.035 during Phase 6, which marks a 250% increase. The total amount raised during the presale thus far is well over $19.18 million, and it has accumulated support from above 18,350 holders. Since Phase 6 is already over 95% subscribed, the supply available for the same price would not be much. Once Phase 7 starts, the cost for the token will increase by 20%, and it will be $0.04, which makes Phase 6 one of the last chances for such cheap investment for MUTM. This presale phase clearly indicates the potential for the next big crypto. Investors that participated during the early levels of the presale are guaranteed some of the cheapest entry costs, and the potential for returns could reach 500% during launch. Apart from the benefit of cost, Mutuum Finance stands out as it offers a two-level lending model, an extended lending model based on the stablecoin, completely auditable smart contracts, and tokenomics that promote growth. These elements make MUTM the best crypto to buy for investors interested in utility and growth potential. Effective Risk Management Serves as the Foundation for Safety Mutuum Finance implements the dynamic risk management system as an integral component of the Mutuum protocol. Loan-to-Value ratios and Liquidation thresholds are determined based on the volatility of the respective collateral, which means that stronger, less volatile collateral gets to support higher LTV ratios, while tougher ratios are required for less reliable collateral. Other reserve multipliers factor into the equation, ranging between 10%, which applies to less risky groups, and 35% for the higher-risk pools. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has seen $19.18M raised from 18,350+ investors, and Phase 6 is over 95% sold for $0.035. The V1 Sepolia testnet launch event is close, providing an entire DeFi platform. This provides one of the last opportunities to acquire the best crypto to buy before the price increase to $0.04 during Phase 7, confirming MUTM as the next big crypto to watch in 2026.

In a video posted on X, Claver revealed that his firm has been in recent conversations with large family offices that are now making significant allocations into XRP. His comments arrive at a moment when XRP’s long-term narrative is witnessing increased interest due to ETFs, and they highlight a shift happening among investors who have always avoided cryptocurrencies altogether. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Is Just Getting Started — 200x Growth Possible, Tom Lee Says Wealthy Families Quietly Accumulating XRP Claver explained that XRP ownership is currently extremely limited relative to the global population, noting that only around 8 million wallets exist on the XRPL. Half of those wallets contain fewer than 100 XRP, which makes existing holders far more uncommon than they may think. He contrasted this with Bitcoin’s widespread ownership, arguing that XRP is still early in its adoption curve. He said the wealthy families showing interest are not looking for quick profits. According to him, they have already built their fortunes and instead see XRP as a form of insurance. According to his post, these families are buying crypto, not to get richer, but to protect the wealth they already have. He described their interest in cryptocurrencies as a hedge. These investors want something uncorrelated in their portfolios ahead of any potential shock in traditional markets. Claver’s $10K Price Target And The Conditions He Outlined When asked where he sees the price of XRP going, Claver stated that he believes the cryptocurrency could be trading at $10,000 by late 2026 or early 2027. He tied this prediction to how much ecosystem infrastructure becomes active on the XRPL over the next two years. He said the network would need substantial institutional-grade utilities, including XRP treasury systems, Evernorth’s launch, on-chain borrowing mechanisms, and new amendments to the XRP Ledger that will bring in additional compliance layers and smart-contract features. His projection assumes that rising network volume will require higher liquidity levels and that price stability at four- and five-figure ranges will only be achievable if the ledger is handling large-scale financial flows. He also pointed to ETFs as a major factor in shaping supply and demand, noting that as ETF adoption grows, more XRP will be locked away in long-term institutional products. Speaking of ETFs, Spot XRP ETFs are now approaching $1 billion in total net assets and could cross that threshold within the next few days. Since their debut, these funds have taken in about $897.35 million worth of XRP from exchanges and OTC desks, and they have yet to record a single day of outflows.

With its weak performance over the past few months and price action showing signs of exhaustion , the analyst has predicted that the next major support level lies more than 33% below all-time highs. Analyst Breaks Down Chart Signaling Bitcoin Price Crash TradingView crypto expert ‘EliteGoldAnalysis’ has released a fresh chart study on Bitcoin’s next selling move, warning that the cryptocurrency’s downtrend may not be over yet. The analyst’s breakdown highlights a key support level he believes Bitcoin could crash to if its current downward momentum persists. EliteGoldAnalysis outlines a price structure on the chart that begins with a weak high, a technical condition that often reflects a liquidity grab before a reversal. The appearance of a weak high near the top of Bitcoin’s most recent rally indicates that buyers may have been swept out before the momentum fully shifted. This pattern is accompanied by a steadily forming lower high, hinting at a developing bearish structure . From his perspective, the analyst explains that a short bias becomes relevant only after a clear confirmation of a bearish trend. Based on the Bitcoin price chart, such confirmation could include a break of minor support beneath the weak high, followed by a retest of that level. EliteGoldAnalysis also noted that a bearish rejection through wick actions or a strong bearish close would strengthen the case for a temporary Bitcoin price crash . While the analyst’s breakdown is just an interpretation of the chart rather than a trading call, Bitcoin’s price structure still hints at a possible retracement amid strengthening sell-side pressure . How Low Bitcoin Price Could Decline In his TradingView chart, EliteGoldAnalysis outlined critical zones that could dictate Bitcoin’s next bearish moves . The first region to watch is the potential “target level” marked in the purple zone above $85,000. The analyst views this level as a demand or imbalance area. Should Bitcoin reach and hold this target, it may act as the first checkpoint before the market decides whether to correct downwards or push higher. Just beneath the $85,000 region lies a “strong support level” highlighted in blue at $84,000 on the chart. EliteGoldAnalysis predicts that Bitcoin could decline to as low as this $84,000 support area. The analyst suggests that this level is the final retracement target, potentially representing a significant liquidity pool that could attract buyers if the price declines. A decisive drop toward this level would reflect a more than 6% decline from current levels above $89,000. Such a move would also mark the completion of the downside move implied by the chart structure. Over the past 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin has fallen roughly 3%, meaning a crash to $84,000 would further prolong the ongoing downtrend .

Meme assets often return during optimistic market phases, and FLOKI’s large community makes it a familiar starting point for conversation. Analysts at CoinDesk point out that user-driven tokens often outperform when retail interest rises. This sets the stage for a deeper evaluation of the best crypto to invest in 2025 as traders balance stability with early-stage opportunity. The market is now shifting toward ecosystems that combine transparent tokenomics, structured reward systems, and long-term utility. Projects with clear presale frameworks gain notable traction as buyers look for predictable scaling models rather than hype alone. While several assets demonstrate solid growth potential, one project is now gaining record attention for its strong mechanics, early-stage upside, and rapid token demand. This lineup highlights six assets shaping the broader conversation around the best crypto to invest in 2025 . 1. BullZilla (BZIL): The Best Crypto To Invest In 2025 With A High Velocity Presale Model BullZilla progresses through Stage 13, known as Zilla Sideways Smash, at a presale price of $0.00033238, and has already raised over $1 million. More than 32 billion tokens have been sold to over 3,600 holders, reflecting strong demand. Early participants in Stage 13B secured returns exceeding 5,680.52% as the token moves toward its projected listing value of $0.00527. Current participants still achieve approximately 1,485.95% projected ROI. A one-thousand-dollar purchase equals about 3.008 million tokens today. The next stage lifts pricing from $0.00033238 to $0.00033905, continuing BullZilla’s fast-moving upward valuation curve. A Roaring ROI Path That Pushes Early Gains Higher BullZilla ‘s structure creates a rising price floor, as each stage locks in previous levels and reduces the available supply. A three-thousand-dollar entry today secures more than nine million tokens. If the price reaches its projected listing of 0.00527, that position could exceed fifty thousand dollars. The model attracts early participants because it combines predictable price growth with transparent on-chain mechanics. Join BullZilla now at $0.00033238 before the next 2.006 percent price surge pushes early gains out of reach. 2. Sui (SUI): A High-Performance Chain Redefining User Experience Sui continues to gain attention for its parallel execution model, which improves speed and supports complex applications without network strain. Developers use Sui to build features that require low latency and high reliability. Its resource ownership system gives users unique control over assets while enabling advanced digital identity and gaming functions. Recent integrations highlight extended interoperability as Sui strengthens its developer environment. Analysts note its appeal among builders seeking predictable performance without high fees. As adoption grows across consumer applications, Sui positions itself as a strong contender in the evolving landscape of advanced blockchain ecosystems. 3. MoonBull (MOBU): A High APY Staking Ecosystem Built For Long-Term Growth MoonBull merges entertainment with a structured scarcity system that rewards steady participation. Built on Ethereum, the project uses reflections, auto liquidity support, and a multi-stage supply model that pushes value higher as the ecosystem grows. Its 95% APY staking pool attracts users seeking long-term returns backed by locked-in liquidity. The team uses AI-driven reward optimization to maintain balance during market volatility. Verified contracts and community governance reinforce transparency, helping MoonBull grow into one of the most trusted emerging assets for 2025. 4. La Culex (CULEX): A Multi-Stage Scarcity Engine With Strong Community Incentives La Culex presents a balanced token structure built for long-term resilience. The 200 billion supply is divided into presale, liquidity, staking, and community pools. Liquidity remains locked for 18 months, providing users with strong protection. Staking rewards reach eighty percent APY through the Hive Vault, while the Bite Chain referral system boosts network expansion. Each of the thirty-two presale stages reduces supply and pushes value closer to its projected 0.007 listing. Its audited contracts and zero-tax design strengthen trust among new participants seeking reliable early-stage growth. 5. APEMARS: A Mission Styled Ecosystem Built For Creative Expansion APEMARS is a story-centered memecoin designed as a community-driven mission to Mars, built on the ERC 20 standard to offer an experience that feels like an evolving expedition rather than a standard presale. The journey progresses through 23 weekly stages, each symbolizing a segment of Commander Ape’s 225 million-kilometer voyage, with narrative and pricing moving forward together. Mars-themed mechanics shape the project, including burn checkpoints at Stages 6, 12, 18, and 23 to strengthen scarcity. After launch, the APE Yield Station delivers 63 percent APY with rewards locked for two months, while the Orbital Boost referral system offers 9.34 percent rewards once a holder contributes 22 dollars, forming the core of Operation RED BANANA. 6. FLOKI: A Meme Giant Preparing For Another Cycle FLOKI’s large global community continues driving attention toward its broader utility features. The project develops metaverse experiences, educational platforms, and decentralized finance tools that extend beyond typical meme narratives. FLOKI’s marketing strength helps maintain visibility across major markets, and several institutions follow its ecosystem due to strong branding. Analysts from Messari highlight FLOKI’s cross-chain expansion as a core driver of renewed interest. As the market shifts toward 2025, FLOKI remains well-positioned for strong participation, driven by community energy and upcoming utility upgrades. Conclusion Sui, MoonBull, and La Culex show strong technical discipline with systems built for steady growth, while APEMARS and FLOKI highlight creative communities shaping fresh narratives within the market. These projects attract different types of traders as adoption rises and new features strengthen their long-term appeal. Together, they form a diverse group of emerging ecosystems that continue gaining attention from users seeking stability, utility, and innovative design across expanding blockchain networks. BullZilla stands at the center of the discussion as the best crypto to invest in 2025 thanks to its structured presale system, strong early returns, and rapid community expansion. Its rising holder count and predictable stage-based valuation path make it a standout option for traders positioning ahead of the next cycle. As markets move toward higher engagement in 2025, many follow BullZilla closely because it offers transparent mechanics, reliable token flow, and a clear roadmap supporting future growth. Buy BullZilla today and catch the surge early.

MSTY consistently underperforms MSTR during rallies while only marginally mitigating downside, making it unattractive compared to direct MSTR exposure. Recent dividend reductions and high return of capital indicate the payout is shrinking and not supported by true income generation. I maintain a Hold rating on MSTY, as upside is capped and downside protection is minimal; direct MSTR ownership is preferable if bullish. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) is liked by some investors for its high dividend yield of 100%+, which it partially achieves by generating income from Strategy ( MSTR ) options. But oftentimes, if something seems too good to be true, it is. On February 27, I wrote about the MSTY ETF, and the article was titled ""MSTY: 100%+ Dividend Yield, But There's A Catch."" In that article, I highlighted several risks to note for investors considering a position in MSTY. Those risks included BTC potentially falling by another 10%+ (which is what it did shortly after the article was published), the potential for smaller dividends over time, Strategy's premium over its mNAV, and the fact that MSTY can underperform when MSTR performs very well but still capture a lot of the downside when MSTR performs badly. I think it's safe to say that those things have played out. The price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was around $84,000 when I wrote that article and is actually a bit higher now at around $89,000. However, MSTY's total return since then -- which includes dividends -- has been -30.27%. A lot of this has to do with MSTR's poor performance and mNAV premium erosion lately. MSTY's Performance Since My Last Article (Seeking Alpha) At the same time, MSTY's dividends have shrunk considerably. The only reason the yield is still high is because the share price has fallen. So, what's next? While MSTY is surely a much better Buy now than it was a few months ago, I still don't think this is an investment vehicle worth pursuing -- compared to MSTR stock -- for the long term for many of the same reasons as before. This is despite me not being bearish on BTC. Therefore, I'm staying on the sidelines with a Hold rating. A Brief Overview of MSTY's Strategy MSTY indirectly invests in MSTR stock. Its main goal is to generate income, and its secondary goal is to capture the share price movements of MSTR stock. I went over MSTY's strategy in my last article on the ETF, and I suggest reading that for more context, but here's a refresher. Previously, I wrote: MSTY is an options-based ETF. Instead of buying MSTR shares, MSTY gains its exposure to MSTR through the purchase of call options. To help finance these purchases, MSTY also sells puts on MSTR. The fund doesn't just sell puts, though. Particularly, the fund's prospectus states the following: On a monthly basis or more frequently, the Fund will sell call option contracts on the Underlying Security with expiration dates of approximately one month or less in the future at strike prices that are approximately equal to 0%-15% above the then-current share price of the Underlying Security. And when MSTY's management team is more confident that MSTR stock will rise, it can choose to employ a call credit spread (which it calls a covered call spread strategy) instead of covered calls to seek greater upside potential. Further, the fund invests in US Treasuries with target maturities of 6 months to 2 years. Its 6 main types of holdings can be seen below. MSTY's Portfolio Strategy (MSTY's Prospectus) MSTY's Prospectus MSTY ETF's Performance Problem MSTY's strategy leaves it with a performance issue. It tends to underperform greatly when MSTR stock rallies, and it still captures a lot of the downside when MSTR does poorly. That's because its covered call and call credit spread strategies limit upside potential. I'm sure most readers of this article are familiar with these options strategies, so I'll spare you the details. The strategies may sound great on the surface (generating income from MSTR's volatility), but they often just don't do that well. Here's how MSTY has performed compared to MSTR -- dividends included. In the chart below, the candlesticks represent MSTY, while the bars represent Strategy stock. Since its inception in February 2024, MSTY has returned 102.4%, while MSTR has returned 151.8%. You can also tell how much better MSTR's outperformance is during bullish periods. MSTY's Performance vs. MSTR's Performance (TradingView) Here's another thing to consider. During the most recent drawdown starting in July, MSTY has fallen by 55.6%. MSTY's Performance Starting From July 18, 2025 (TradingView) At the same time, MSTR has fallen by 60.4%. MSTR's Performance Starting From July 18, 2025 (TradingView) Sure, MSTR performed worse during this period, but not by much. The income generated from MSTY's options strategy only spared the fund a few percentage points of drawdown while sparing it many percentage points of upside during good times. That's quite the opposite of a strategy I'd want to be exposed to. The Dividend Problem The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF has a variable dividend that can fluctuate greatly. When I wrote my previous MSTY article, the most recent dividend was $2.0216 per share, paid 13 times a year, for an annualized dividend of $26.28 per share. Of course, that ""annualized"" dividend would only come to fruition if the dividend held steady, which it didn't. I previously noted that factors like implied volatility and MSTR's stock price can impact the dividend. All else being equal, a higher MSTR stock price and higher implied volatility for its options will lead to greater premiums, which can help sustain the dividend. The same principle applies if MSTR and its IV fall. Since the implied volatility was low and the stock price had fallen in February, I argued that the March distribution could be lower. The March distribution then came out to $1.3775 per share -- a big drop. All the dividends after that, except a $2.3734 per share dividend in May, were much lower than February's dividend. It's worth noting that the fund started paying its dividends weekly in October. MSTY's Dividend History (yieldmaxetfs.com) And for reference, volatility in Strategy's options chain is at around the same level as it was in February, but it had dropped off in a big way in the middle of the year. Strategy's Historical Volatility (Interactive Brokers) There's also another thing that affects MSTY's dividends -- the amount of money it has invested. Here's the problem, though: MSTY has been using ""return of capital"" ((ROC)) to fund large portions of its dividend payments since May. You can see that in the ""ROC"" section of the chart above. For example, 92.88% of the most recent dividend of $0.1388 per share came from a return of capital, meaning that only about 7% came from income the fund generated. This isn't true income. It's just the fund giving your money back to you. The less money the fund has (because it's just giving you your money back), the less it can invest, and the less income it will make. This certainly doesn't help the dividend. So, yes, the fund yields over 100% right now if you annualize the most recent dividend, but that's not a guaranteed dividend. It depends on several factors. The annualized dividend right now is around $7.22 per share. Recall that in February, it was $26.28 per share, and some people were bashing me for not being bullish despite a high yield. However, I do recognize that the dividend can increase from here if MSTR stock recovers. But as we've seen, MSTY tends to underperform during upswings. If you're bullish on MSTR, you might as well buy MSTR then, not MSTY. At Least Bitcoin is Well Off Its Highs The MSTY ETF has something going for it. Bitcoin is well off its all-time high and is close to a trendline support area. Bitcoin can potentially bounce back, helping Strategy stock recover, which would then help MSTY. BTC-USD Daily Chart (TradingView) Even the CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index shows that the crypto market is in fear territory (21 out of 100), and buying when the market is fearful can sometimes translate to nice gains. CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index (coinmarketcap.com) Strategy's Premium to mNAV Has Eroded Strategy stock's premium to its mNAV used to be much higher, sometimes above 2x or 3x. It's now 1.16x. To be honest, I don't even think it should be trading above mNAV, and I prefer the ETH treasury company SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ), but that's another argument for another article. The point is that the downside risk at 1.16x is much lower for MSTR and, in turn, MSTY. Strategy's Premium To mNAV (strategy.com) Therefore, one can make the argument that MSTR is relatively cheap, making MSTY worth buying. But at that point, why not just buy MSTR? The Bottom Line on MSTY ETF The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is a great ETF if you want high dividends, but that doesn't make it a great ETF overall. In recent months, your ""dividends"" would mostly have been your capital being returned to you. It looks nice to receive large dividends until you realize that these dividends are getting smaller and smaller over time and will only get bigger if MSTR stock rises or if its implied volatility rises sharply. But if you think MSTR stock will rise, you'd likely see better performance buying MSTR. In a crypto bull market, MSTR stock will rise, and its premium to mNAV (which is relatively low now) would likely rise as well, amplifying the gains. While MSTY would capture some of those gains, it wouldn't capture all of them, and that's by design. You can see that play out in its past performance. In most scenarios, buying MSTY is like capping the upside on MSTR stock while barely offsetting the downside. It's just not an attractive investment, relatively speaking. Therefore, I don't suggest that anyone buy it. The main reason I don't rate it as an outright Sell is because of Bitcoin's potential to bounce back after its recent fall.",MSTR|MSTR:CA|MSTY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-07 02:20:06

Buyers and sellers are locked in a tight battle, and the market now waits for a decisive break. A push above key resistance could open the door to $107,000, while weakness at support risks a deeper slide toward $71,000. Bounce Scenario: A Return Toward The Pink Box And Descending Trendline Kamile Uray, in her latest update on Bitcoin, noted that BTC failed to hold above the $90,720 level on the hourly chart, triggering the expected decline. The first immediate support now sits at $87,644, while the deeper support range lies between $83,822 and $82,477. If buyers defend this zone successfully, Bitcoin could attempt another climb toward the pink box region and retest the descending trendline overhead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Echoes 2022 Bear Start, Glassnode Warns Uray explained that a sustained move above the pink box resistance on the daily timeframe would open the door for Bitcoin to challenge the descending blue trendline. A confirmed breakout from this area could strengthen bullish momentum, pushing the price toward the next major resistance levels at $98,200 and $107,500. A break above $107,500 alongside the descending trendline would serve as a strong signal that the broader uptrend is ready to continue. However, she warned that a daily close below $82,477 would shift the market structure toward further weakness, placing Bitcoin at risk of revisiting lower levels. Even so, Uray highlighted one critical area of strength: the $74,496–$71,237 zone. This region represents the key breakout top from November 2024 and is considered a strong historical support. In this area, buyers may step in aggressively, potentially setting the stage for an upward reversal. Bitcoin Price Rejection At $93,000–$95,000 Zone According to Crypto Candy, Bitcoin’s latest price action has been unfolding precisely in line with expectations. After facing rejection in the $93,000–$95,000 resistance zone, BTC dipped sharply and nearly touched the anticipated support range at $86,000–$87,500. This move reflects the broader market’s reaction to heavy selling pressure near the upper resistance band. Related Reading: Reversal Loading? Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Build Powerful High-Time-Frame Structures Crypto Candy emphasized that the $86,000–$87,500 zone now serves as a crucial pivot area. If buyers successfully defend this support and the price stabilizes above it, Bitcoin could once again revisit the $93,000–$95,000 range, or even push beyond it. Such a rebound would signal renewed bullish momentum and set the stage for another attempt at breaking higher resistance levels. However, the analyst also warned that failure to hold the $86,000–$87,500 support could trigger deeper downside movement.

The company, by far the largest corporate holder of Ether in the world, has accumulated the figure in just the last two days, according to new blockchain tracking data. The acquisitions were made in two large purchases : the first on Friday for $130.7 million, and another for $68 million on Saturday. These purchases bring the total of Ether held by BitMine to approximately $11.3 billion, which is about 3.08% of all ETH in existence at the time of this press release. The company is now edging closer to its long-time goal of capturing 5% of the Ethereum network. BitMine’s aggressive buying spree pushes forward against the current backdrop – a space where most top-calibre traders and institutional participants are short-term bearish on Ether. BitMine speeds up acquisitions, despite an industry slowdown The broader corporate Ethereum market has cooled sharply. Among the largest companies, net treasury savings, excluding its flagship company product, reached a seven-quarter high of $67.5 billion. Digital asset treasury activity – that segment that monitors corporate purchases of large cryptos has decreased 81% in just 3 months. In August, businesses combined accumulated 1.97 million ETH, but that number dropped significantly in November to just 370,000 ETH. BitMine, meanwhile, has taken the opposite approach. The firm has purchased 679,000 ETH (valuing $2.13 billion) in the past month alone. This purchase represented the vast majority of all corporate Ether purchased during that timeframe and demonstrated the company’s increasing dominance and confidence. BitMine management has consistently described its approach as one that invests in the Ethereum platform as a key feature of the emerging digital economy. Remaining bullish, BitMine has proven multiple times that the occasional bear market isn’t a signal of doom — it’s an opportunity for accumulation. The company also maintains a cash reserve of $882 million, which could be utilised to continue purchasing if market conditions remain favourable. However, as BitMine is betting big on Ethereum’s future, the most sophisticated traders in the market are now betting, at least in the short term, on something else. Smart money traders have accumulated a significant amount of short interest, according to data from the leading blockchain intelligence platform Nansen. Over the past 24 hours, ETH shorts have added a net notional amount of $2.8 million, resulting in a total short exposure of $21 million in combined notional value. They are a signal that managers expect prices to continue to fall. Institutional sentiment also appears subdued. Spot Ethereum ETFs, generally one of the heaviest drivers of liquidity for the asset, continue to experience outflows. Spot ETH ETFs on Friday reported $75.2 million in net outflows, marking its second consecutive day of outflows. That lukewarm demand comes on the heels of a sharp $1.4 billion outflow in November, indicating wariness among institutional investors. BitMine rises as a major force in the Ether ecosystem BitMine’s rapid expansion into the Ethereum universe has larger implications. With the firm nearing ownership of 5% of available ETH, it now has a greater vested interest in a network where supply centralisation affects market structure, liquidity profiles, and staking dynamics. At 5% BitMine would have more ETH than every large decentralised staking pool combined, possibly setting a threshold on the amount of assets a corporation controls from an Ethereum perspective. It also raises questions about how traditional treasuries could evolve as cryptocurrencies increasingly integrate into mainstream financial systems. BitMine’s approach, for now, is obvious: pile in like mad and stay liquid to become a major player in Ethereum in the long run. However, market concerns aside, the firm’s recent activity demonstrates unabated conviction in Ethereum’s growth prospects and a willingness to continue buying until its target of 5% is achieved.

While the global financial system is accelerating its transition to real-time settlement, XRP is emerging as a contender for enterprise-level treasury flows. As Ripple’s institutional network continues to expand, the altcoin is stepping into a role where digital assets can enhance liquidity management and power the next generation of global value transfer. Why RippleNet’s Expanding Network Drives Enterprise Confidence The bearish view of XRP is clouding the bigger transformation happening behind the scenes. Analyst Xfinancebull has mentioned on X that XRP is embedding itself into the financial engines where global treasury systems teams move trillions. With the GTreasury acquisition, Ripple gains access to the operational layer where $12.5 trillion in enterprise liquidity flows. This is about the altcoin becoming a native rail inside the financial command centers of over 1,000 multinational giants where trillions move. Treasury teams move real money, not just $100 payments, but payroll, supply chain financing, and liquidity management across continents. The XRP niche is that it moves trillions fast, 24/7, across borders. Meanwhile, Ripple now controls the infrastructure platform that interacts with BNY Mellon to move trillions and automates finance at scale. According to Xfinancebull, the token goes from a speculative asset to invisible plumbing. This shift doesn’t make the front-page headlines, but it moves everything behind them. Most analysts won’t notice that this has unlocked the token to become a standard settlement rail in the GTreasury automation stack, making its utility broader, invisible, and massive. Founder of Lux Lions NFT and host of the crypto Blitz YouTube show, RipBullWinkle, stated that the Federal Reserve has officially halted its Quantitative Tightening (QT) measures, ending the two-year liquidity drain that weighed down the entire crypto sector. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager with $11 trillion in AUM, has reversed course and will now allow clients to have access to the regulated crypto ETFs. This single move clears the path for trillions in passive capital, a macro environment of liquidity, compliance, and global settlement that XRP is engineered for. How XRP Defies The Market Slump With A Rare Positive Performance While the crypto market has been struggling to find its footing, an observer and researcher of the current tech shift, SMQKE, has noted that WisdomTree data shows that XRP is the only major cryptocurrency posting positive year-to-date returns in 2025. On a year-to-date basis, where the broader markets were pulling back, the altcoin has stood out as the lone performer, holding onto a modest +4% gain year-to-date. In a challenging year for most large-cap digital assets, it has emerged as the top-tier asset with a positive year-to-date performance. Even after experiencing drawdowns in line with the broader market during Q4, XRP has demonstrated remarkable relative resilience and remains up +4% YTD and +12% over the past 12 months.",XRP|BNY Mellon|Crypto Blitz|crypto ETFs|GTreasury|Lux Lions NFT|QT|Quantitative Tightening|RipBullWinkle|ripple|SMQKE|Vanguard|wisdomtree|Xfinancebull|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT|Year-To-Date|Youtube|YTD,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-07 03:30:49

Jamie Dimon stated that a “weak” Europe is not just a European problem, but one with serious implications for global growth, trade flows, and ultimately, the US economy. “If Europe goes down, we all go down,” Dimon warned, underlining that sluggish growth, burdensome regulation, and sluggish productivity on the continent represent a systemic risk for transatlantic and global prosperity. He made these remarks during the Reagan National Defence Forum, which was held on Saturday, December 6. At this time, Dimon insisted that “Europe has a real problem.” To elaborate on his claim, the CEO began by acknowledging that the continent has implemented some considerable safety measures. However, he voiced concerns about Europe’s approach, which pushes businesses away, chases off investment, and stifles innovation. This finding ignited heated debates among individuals. To address this controversy, Dimon highlighted a positive aspect of the continent. According to him, the continent is making a comeback. Dimon calls on the urgency to address the challenges that make Europe weak Earlier, Dimon raised concerns about Europe’s split status. As the head of the largest bank in the US, he explained that this division presents a substantial challenge that the world encounters. This statement was revealed after the CEO shared his letter to shareholders earlier this year, noting that Europe has s ome critical issues that need to be addressed as soon as possible. Even with these challenges in place, Dimon expressed his excitement about the launch of the euro, a significant accomplishment for the region. He also acknowledged Europe’s efforts to establish peace among its trading partners, primarily with Ukraine. Nonetheless, he urged the continent to work on its agreements within the European Union (EU) since this challenge poses a risk to Europe. “If they fall apart, then you can say that America first will not exist anymore,” Dimon said. Notably, analysts discovered that the EU and the US are each other’s largest and most important trading partners. Therefore, Dimon emphasized that the United States should assist because this situation will affect it more than any other nation. Apart from conducting trade, the US and the EU have also shared values which matter greatly. “We need a long-term plan to make them stronger,” Dimon stated while still highlighting that a weak Europe has negative impacts on the US. Meanwhile, reports dated October of this year mentioned that JPMorgan released a statement confirming its plans to make a substantial investment worth $1.5 trillion in industries that play a crucial role in enhancing the US’s economic security and strength over the next decade. This amounts to $500 billion more than what the bank would have otherwise contributed. Dimon cautioned on the US’s habit of relying on unreliable sources JPMorgan CEO admitted that it was crystal clear that the US has increasingly relied on unreliable sources for key minerals, products, and manufacturing. Jay Horine, an investment banker, leads this recently initiated project, which Dimon refers to as “100% commercial.” Sources close to the situation hinted that this initiative will focus on four main areas. This includes supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defence and aerospace, energy independence and resilience, and frontier and strategic technologies. On the other hand, another report from a reliable source highlighted that the bank intends to allocate $10 billion of its own funds to aid certain firms in expansion, innovation , or accelerate key manufacturing processes. Dimon also complimented US President Donald Trump’s efforts to lower bureaucracy in the government on Saturday this week. According to him, this is a smart move that they can achieve while ensuring that safety measures are effective in sectors such as food and banking.

In an interview, he explained why the timing of the launch mattered. His comments arrive at a point when XRP seeks a larger role in global finance, and investors want clarity on its long-term path. A Positive Change in Conditions Hougan described a simple reason for Bitwise’s decision. He said Ripple has a strong community. He also referred to XRP as a Lindy asset that has been in existence for a long time. He then addressed the central issue. He said XRP faced an “existential regulatory threat” during the SEC’s lawsuit . He noted that no major institution wanted to build real-world products on a network that faced that level of risk. He said the lawsuit froze adoption. His point was clear. The barrier was not technology, but uncertainty. Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, says the reason they launched a Ripple ETF is simple: the playing field has finally changed. For years, Ripple and XRP were held back by an existential regulatory threat. The SEC lawsuit froze real-world adoption and made major partnerships nearly… https://t.co/szyM53PQiM pic.twitter.com/Ho42F9EAts — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) December 4, 2025 This legal battle ended in August , and Hougan stated that this development changed the landscape. He said the blockchain now has “a chance” to compete on a level playing field. He pointed out that this change does not guarantee success. It does, however, enable XRP to gain the use cases that its supporters have long discussed. Xaif reinforced this point in his caption when he said the lawsuit held back adoption and stopped partnerships at scale. His comments aligned with Hougan’s reasoning. A Strategic ETF Launch Hougan highlighted the ETF structure as a key step for investors who want exposure through regulated markets. He said Bitwise launched the product to give the community “high-quality exposure” through a simple ticker. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He also said Bitwise reserved the ticker XRP in advance. The firm moved as soon as the regulatory landscape allowed it. This decision gives institutions a direct path to allocate capital. It also strengthens XRP’s position among other approved digital asset funds. Rising Institutional Interest in XRP The Bitwise XRP ETF entered the market with strong interest from investors. It had a trading volume of $25.7 million on the first day , with $107.6 million in assets under management (AUM). ETFs often attract traditional firms that need compliance-ready exposure. Bitwise’s ETF launch shows that institutions are interested in XRP. Greater regulatory clarity tends to support long-term confidence. With the lawsuit now over, access through an ETF increases market depth. XRP now competes for institutional flow that once excluded it. If new partnerships and enterprise use appear, XRP could gain a stronger position in global finance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The company handles a large share of global corporate activity. Its clients process $12.5 trillion in annual payment volume. It also manages $250 billion in operational accounts. The platform links to BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirect, which supports over $6.5 trillion in yearly transaction flow. GTreasury shared this information in its public summary. X Finance Bull focused on the size of these flows. He said that “XRP is becoming part of enterprise treasury systems, where trillions move .” He said that treasury teams within global firms move large amounts each day through key systems. These actions operate at all hours because companies function in many regions. He believes this type of activity fits XRP’s design. Ripple Gains a Direct Link to Core Finance Tools GTreasury said that it now gives customers the option to use real-time settlement and institutional-grade infrastructure . It linked this change to Ripple’s plan to offer custody, liquidity, treasury tools, payments, and real-time settlement on a single platform. X Finance Bull said, “Ripple now controls the infrastructure that talks to BNY Mellon”. He sees this as a major step because treasury platforms guide how large companies transfer money. He argued that this position could help Ripple offer fast settlement rails to corporate clients.

He also said that many people will not notice this shift because it happens deep inside enterprise systems. The scale of these flows gives XRP a stronger future in global finance . Automation Could Boost XRP’s Use GTreasury said that the future of corporate treasury has no friction and no boundaries. X Finance Bull linked this to Ripple’s plan to build a full digital asset platform. He believes that more automation inside these tools will lead to active settlement. He wrote that XRP gains “continuous, invisible, and massive” utility as it enters GTreasury’s automation stack. Ripple’s deal puts XRP inside tools used by major global firms, and this pipeline could change everything for XRP, as it moves trillions of dollars.

Reports indicate it was caused by a technician who made an error while performing maintenance work in Aurora, Illinois. The breakdown , on November 28, brought business to a standstill at some of the world’s most critical financial markets and underscored vulnerabilities in the infrastructure that supports derivative trading globally. CyrusOne said the incident originated from on-site staff and contractors not following “standard procedures for draining cooling towers” that cool internal infrastructure before lower temperatures set in. As the temperature outside dropped, so did the temperature inside the facility when its cooling system stopped working. This failed several key cooling units, leading to higher room temperatures in the server rooms. The servers that host CME’s Globex trading platform began to overheat. Robotic safety systems then shut down the equipment to avoid damage. With core servers offline, CME’s markets for futures, options, and products tied to commodities, currencies, and the Treasury spectrum abruptly ceased processing trades. The pause reverberated around the global financial system. Traders in Asia, Europe, and the United States were cut off from live prices or unable to manage their positions. At a few of the largest markets, liquidity vanished altogether, as in gold and Treasury futures, leaving some traders unprotected as they waited for systems to come back online. Markets shudder as the shutdown reverberates around the world The outage occurred in the early morning hours in the United States, prompting traders to assess the situation. Markets had already opened for many traders in Europe and Asia by the time prices on CME-connected products suddenly stopped moving. Futures on prominent U.S. stock indexes ceased updating. On the commodity markets, including the crude oil and gold markets, there was only eerie silence. U.S. Treasury futures, a global fixed-income trading lynchpin, were offline for several hours. Currency trading markets were also thrown into disarray as CME’s electronic brokering system for currency trading, Globex, went offline. Traders were unable to avoid exposure or take profits. Institutional desks faced similar woes, with some stating that their standard risk management tools have become ineffective. The disruption showed how dependent modern markets have become on a small number of data centres. With CME’s primary engine offline, there was virtually no corner of global trading able to access one of its most critical pricing feeds. Some firms reported minor internal delays as activity surged on alternative platforms, while others warned that the inability to exit positions posed significant danger. Had equities sharply sold off during the halt, they said, the resulting losses could have been devastating. CME’s long delay before returning to Black Friday trading was caused by the venue being disconnected so that its cooling systems could be stabilized and servers brought back online. CME rethinks data center strategy after human error After a human error was determined to be the primary cause of the circumstances, CyrusOne stated that it has already implemented more stringent cold-weather procedures. These include increasing the number of personnel on duty during periods of extreme weather, enhancing cooling infrastructure, hardening systems, and improving redundant systems to prevent the simultaneous failure of multiple units. The incident has reignited debate over CME’s move to depend on a data centre it no longer owns. CME sold the Aurora site in 2016. Since then, it has relied on CyrusOne to run the infrastructure that supports much of its electronic trading . The outage has also prompted questions over whether such an arrangement affords CME sufficient control over its essential systems. And questions arose about CME’s decision not to relocate to its backup facility. Emergency plans called for relocating operations at a second location, but CME declined to activate that site, as it received early indications that the outage would be short-lived. However, the few hours of cooling loss proved far more serious, and the delay ensured that the outage would last more than ten hours. Industry analysts say the episode should serve as a wake-up call. Modern markets aren’t just software—they’re also hardware, with power supply and cooling systems. A breakdown in any of them can halt global markets. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Yet a recent post by BD (@DiepSanh) offered a clearer view. He highlighted comments from Vet (@VetX_0), a validator on the XRP Ledger, focusing on a simple contrast of how both assets entered the market. That contrast now shapes how each network grows. Different Distribution Models Create Different Outcomes Vet noted that Bitcoin enjoyed an early advantage because it had an “amazing distribution phase through mining.” The mining model enabled BTC to reach a wide base of early users. It rewarded those who supplied computing power at a time when the network needed it most. This model helped Bitcoin gain recognition during its first years. The situation shifted once distribution began to taper off. Vet stated that Bitcoin then faced “high miner costs, rising fees, no true finality, and constant sell pressure from miners.” The comment reflects a structural issue. Miners must sell BTC to cover their expenses. This creates steady selling pressure during every market cycle. It also forces the network to rely on higher fees as block rewards shrink. These factors reduce efficiency and place friction on growth. XRP took a different path. Vet said XRP was “harder to distribute at the start” because it did not use mining. That choice removed the long-term burden of ongoing production costs. The supply model stays fixed . Validators do not earn XRP through block creation. The ledger can run without the need for rising transaction fees. This structure makes the network easier to scale and maintain. It also reduces forced selling because there is no mining treasury. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Matters for XRP’s Price Growth BD highlighted these points because they affect the future performance of both assets. Bitcoin must push fees higher to support miners. Rising fees can limit activity during peak periods. It also makes everyday payments less practical. This weakens long-term demand for BTC as a utility asset. XRP does not face those limits. The absence of mining gives the network a cost advantage. Firms can move value at speed without fear of fee spikes. This supports stronger use in payments and settlement . It adds a base layer of demand that does not rely on speculation.
