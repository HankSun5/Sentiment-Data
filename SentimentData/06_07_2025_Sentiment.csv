Hyperliquid’s HYPE token has surged over the last year, driven by significant trading volume and supply control. However, recent dips have raised questions about whether this momentum can be sustained. SUI, another rising contender, has attracted attention with bold price targets, but its user activity has slowed, leading to doubts about near-term growth. In stark contrast, BlockDAG’s recent partnership with the Seattle Seawolves and an impressive presale raising $331 million, with over 23.5 billion coins sold, reflects growing trust in the project. BlockDAG (BDAG) ROI since Batch 1 is 2,660%, and the special offer of purchasing tokens at $0.0016 has made it one of the most enticing long-term crypto investments available. Hyperliquid Price Outlook: Token Surges, and Momentum Hyperliquid has gained attention with a massive 1,000% surge in the HYPE token over the last year, backed by steady user demand. It has secured around 70% of the on-chain perpetuals volume and averaged $420 million in daily trading activity. This growth is largely attributed to the platform’s buy-and-burn model, where trading fees fund token buybacks, limiting supply. Despite the gains, recent price corrections raise concerns about sustaining this momentum. Hyperliquid’s airdrop strategy has helped avoid early sell-offs, but with the HYPE token experiencing fluctuations, it remains uncertain whether this rally will continue. Technical indicators suggest recovery after a brief dip from its $45 peak, but maintaining this growth will rely on consistent user engagement and managing supply efficiently. SUI Price: Bold Targets vs. User Momentum Slows The price potential for SUI has sparked debates, especially after Raoul Pal set an ambitious target of $22. However, the data suggests a more measured growth trajectory. While SUI has experienced short-term rallies, such as a 40% increase recently, its trading volume has cooled, indicating a possible slowdown in user interest. From a technical perspective, resistance around the $1.50 level remains a challenge. SUI’s price has yet to break through this ceiling, and without renewed demand, it may struggle to gain further upward movement. While SUI’s long-term fundamentals still hold promise, its immediate price potential will depend on overcoming these technical barriers and rekindling consistent usage. BlockDAG Joins Seattle Seawolves in Web3 Revolution The Seattle Seawolves have partnered with BlockDAG.Network to introduce blockchain-powered fan experiences. This collaboration aims to enhance fan interaction by offering unique digital ownership opportunities such as NFTs, tradable tokens, and exclusive collectibles linked to the team and its players. In addition, BlockDAG has become the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves for the 2025 season. This partnership will include co-branded content, providing match previews, predictions, and exclusive behind-the-scenes moments across Seawolves’ social media channels. Fans will have access to blockchain-based digital assets, allowing them to collect and trade items securely. This partnership represents the merging of digital ownership with sports fan loyalty. The collaboration also underscores BlockDAG’s rising momentum, with its record-breaking presale continuing to attract attention. BlockDAG’s presale has raised over $331 million and sold 23.5 billion coins, with Batch 29 priced at $0.0276. For a limited time, buyers can purchase at just $0.0016, offering the potential for substantial returns. With the increasing adoption of Web3 technology, BlockDAG continues to solidify its status as one of the best long-term crypto investments. Conclusion While the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies often leads to unpredictable price swings, BlockDAG’s stable approach sets it apart. By locking its presale price at $0.0016, BlockDAG offers a clear, predictable entry point for buyers. This structured approach to its presale, currently in Batch 29 at $0.0276, eliminates the fear of missing out and gives participants confidence in their purchase. In the evolving landscape of crypto, where quick price spikes often distract from long-term value, BlockDAG offers a solid and stable investment opportunity. Its recent partnership and continued presale success show that its path is guided by real adoption and tangible progress, making it one of the best long-term crypto options for 2025.

But for investors chasing explosive growth, newer opportunities like Ruvi AI (RUVI) may hold greater potential. Analysts are pointing to a highly favorable set of circumstances that could see Ruvi AI reach a $1 valuation faster than expected , perhaps even challenging Binance Coin’s renowned growth trajectory. With $2.2 million raised during its presale, a robust foundation of more than 2,000 holders , and a utility-centered model, Ruvi AI is well-positioned for breakout success. Here’s how Ruvi AI is catching the attention of experts and why it could surpass expectations. Trust and Transparency Set Ruvi AI Apart At the center of Ruvi AI’s appeal is its commitment to security and transparency, qualities that are critical for early-stage crypto projects building investor confidence. Ruvi AI’s smart contracts have successfully passed a third-party audit by CyberScope , a respected blockchain auditing firm. This detailed inspection confirms the system’s functionality and safeguards against vulnerabilities, giving investors peace of mind. Ruvi AI has further solidified its reputation by partnering with WEEX Exchange , ensuring guaranteed post-presale liquidity . This allows investors to trade their tokens seamlessly once the project goes live. Together, robust auditing and liquidity strategies highlight Ruvi AI’s reliability, making it a sound investment for both newcomers and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. Real-World Applications Cement Value While speculative hype has often been a hallmark of rapid crypto growth, Ruvi AI focuses on delivering real-world utility . Combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI provides scalable solutions that address core challenges in industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance . Practical Use Cases Driving Demand Marketing Businesses struggling with inefficient advertising budgets are utilizing Ruvi AI’s AI-tools for precision targeting and campaign optimization. This ensures higher returns on investment while minimizing costs.

Presale Momentum Signals Strong Market Enthusiasm Ruvi AI’s presale metrics indicate a promising future: $2.2 million raised , showcasing solid community support. Over 180 million tokens sold , signaling widespread market interest. More than 2,000 holders , highlighting its growing investor base. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , Ruvi AI is priced at an attractive $0.015 per token . Once the presale ends, the price will jump to $0.07 , giving early participants a nearly 5x ROI . Analysts have even predicted Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token post-listing, equating to a life-changing 66x return on investment for initial backers. VIP Tiers Offer Massive Bonus Opportunities A unique feature of Ruvi AI’s presale is its VIP investment tiers , which offer substantial bonuses. These tiers make it possible for investors to amplify their returns significantly. Here’s the breakdown: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000.

These tiers allow early supporters to maximize their financial gains by capitalizing on Ruvi AI’s rising token valuation. Why Ruvi AI Could Overtake Binance Coin’s Momentum While Binance Coin remains a solid investment for those seeking steady long-term growth, its established position limits its potential for meteoric short-term gains. By contrast, Ruvi AI’s early-stage potential, combined with its trusted audit , liquidity assurance , and real-world applications , makes it a more dynamic opportunity for investors seeking substantial returns. Priced at just $0.015 , Ruvi AI delivers a compelling entry point, offering exponential growth possibilities as it targets a $1 valuation and beyond. Thanks to its innovative approach, demand-driven utility, and investor-focused presale structure, Ruvi AI is setting itself up as a breakout player in the cryptocurrency space.

Outset PR Uncovers an 82% Media Meltdown That Could Block Your Reach,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/trying-to-scale-your-web3-project-in-europe-outset-pr-uncovers-an-82-media-meltdown-that-could-block-your-reach,"As crypto adoption surges across Europe, you'd expect media visibility to follow suit. But according to Outset PR’s latest report , the opposite is happening. Between January and March 2025, 82% of crypto-native media outlets in Western Europe lost traffic. The platforms that once shaped narratives and drove awareness for Web3 startups are now struggling to survive under the combined weight of regulation, algorithmic change, and shifting user behavior. If you’re trying to scale your Web3 project in Europe, this meltdown might be the invisible force throttling your reach. The Paradox: Rising Interest, Shrinking Visibility Crypto interest across the EU is rising: ownership in some countries like Slovenia, Italy, and Croatia exceeds 15%, and Europe's total on-chain crypto value exceeded $500 billion last year which accounted for over 21% of the global value. Source: Chainalysis Yet, while the audience grows, media channels are losing their grip. Outset PR analyzed 133 media outlets across the region, 87 of which were crypto-focused, and found that 82% suffered traffic losses in Q1 2025. The reasons, though varied by country, point to a common denominator: the convergence of regulatory pressure, algorithmic change, and market volatility. At the center of this shift is MiCA , the European Union’s new crypto regulation framework. While full enforcement is still rolling out, its early impact has already reshaped how crypto content is written, published, and ranked. Under MiCA-aligned interpretations, regulators from Paris to Rome began scrutinizing tone, affiliate disclosures, and investment-style language — effectively forcing outlets to recalibrate both editorial and monetization models. Some regional regulators interpreted MiCA differently, so the impact of this new framework verified depending on the country: Source: Outset report Outset’s report also revealed that just 7 outlets across the region crossed the 1 million monthly visits threshold, and accounted for 60.26% of total traffic. Another 6 made up most of the mid-tier. But beyond that, 58 outlets drew under 100K visits each, showing how fragmented and vulnerable the long tail of crypto media has become. Real Numbers, Real Fallout Outset PR’s traffic tracking via SimilarWeb and Ahrefs shows just how deep the cuts go: Italian outlets: Over 70% saw visibility drop, despite high local interest. Dutch-language media: 76% lost search traffic after Google’s March update. German-speaking sites: Nearly 40% of total outlets, yet most failed to hold their audience. UK platforms: Though not subject to MiCA, many got hit by the FCA’s expanded financial promotions regime. Source: Outset report Only a few outliers — like Bit2Me News (Spain, +149.4%) and CoinJournal DE (Germany, +23.9%) — managed to grow, thanks to multilingual content, regulatory awareness, and technical SEO strength. Algorithmic Gatekeeping: The Discover Problem Beyond traditional search rankings, Google Discover has emerged as a powerful channel for crypto media distribution. But here too, the visibility crisis is deepening. Outset PR’s report reveals that only 22.99% of crypto-native media outlets in Western Europe maintained consistent presence in Google Discover throughout Q1 2025. By comparison, 32.61% of generalist finance, tech, and economic platforms — the kind that cover crypto as part of broader business reporting — held steady in Discover. This seemingly narrow percentage gap translates into a massive disparity in reach. For Web3 founders, this shift has immediate consequences. Even the most compelling project announcements, protocol updates, or ecosystem news may never surface in front of their intended audience if they rely on media partners that are excluded from Discover. Why This Blocks Your Growth If you’re relying on crypto media in Europe to boost your brand, here’s the harsh truth: your message may never reach the audience it deserves. With fewer high-traffic platforms, limited Google Discover inclusion , and increasing compliance pressure, traditional media outreach is no longer enough. Worse still, many remaining outlets under 100K monthly visits now lack the editorial firepower or domain authority to move the needle — especially for token launches, exchange listings, or major product drops. Conclusion The European Web3 opportunity is enormous with rising user adoption, institutional momentum, and a unified regulatory framework under MiCA. But Outset PR’s latest report makes one thing painfully clear: the infrastructure for visibility is collapsing right when it’s needed most. Crypto-native media outlets are bleeding traffic. Google Discover is excluding a growing number of them. And regional regulators are rewriting the rules of public communication. For founders and marketing leaders, the implications are strategic. Getting covered is no longer enough — you need compliance-ready storytelling, multilingual editorial alignment, and a targeted outreach strategy that prioritizes quality over quantity. That’s where Outset PR comes in. As the only data-driven communications agency, Outset builds visibility strategies that match the new rules of engagement. In this new cycle, the winners won’t just be the loudest. They’ll be the most visible to the right audience, through the right channels and at the right level of credibility.

Outset PR's recent findings indicate a significant drop in traffic across crypto-specific media outlets, with an impactful 82% experiencing a decline in the first quarter of 2025. This decline in media engagement occurs despite a growing interest in cryptocurrency throughout Europe, presenting a paradox for Web3 founders. The urgency to adapt and find new avenues for visibility is crucial. Understanding the Media Decline Outset PR's research uncovered that various factors contributed to the downturn in media traffic, including regulatory pressures from the new MiCA framework, algorithmic changes in search engines, and overall market volatility. The European Union's MiCA regulations have started reshaping public communication rules, affecting how crypto content is published and distributed. Such regulatory shifts have led media outlets to alter their content strategies, impacting their visibility and traffic. Source: Chainalysis While the audience for crypto content grew, the platforms that once served this audience are now losing their ability to reach them effectively. Regional Variations and Impact The impact of these changes isn't uniform across all countries. Each country's regulatory body has interpreted and implemented MiCA differently, leading to a varied impact on media outlets within those regions. Source: Outset report Strategic Adaptations for Web3 Projects Given these challenges, Web3 founders must rethink their outreach strategies. Traditional media may no longer suffice to gain the necessary exposure. Instead, integrating compliance-ready narratives, leveraging multilingual content, and focusing on platforms that still maintain significant traffic is essential. Some platforms, like Bit2Me News in Spain and CoinJournal DE in Germany, have seen positive growth by aligning their content with regulatory standards and focusing on SEO enhancements. Concluding Insights The landscape for crypto media in Europe is rapidly evolving under new regulations and market dynamics.

After its launch in 2023, SUI surged past $1, reaching $2.18 by March 27, 2024. Despite a dip afterward, the token rebounded impressively in autumn 2024, hitting a new high of $2.36 on October 14. By the end of 2024, SUI's value soared to $5.35. This growth was fueled by a significant increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) within its system, surpassing $2 billion. Christian Williams, managing director of the Sui Foundation, expressed pride in the ecosystem's growth, noting the remarkable development from the community and DeFi activities. As of January 6, 2025, SUI hovered around $5.20. Named after the Japanese element of water, the Sui platform aims to bring fluidity and adaptability to the Web3 landscape. Built on Sui Move, derived from the Move programming language, it offers a flexible network for developers and users alike.

Some analysts foresee FET reaching $35 by 2026; others predict more modest growth. By 2030, forecasts range from $3 to $4.66. Projections for 2050 suggest significant potential, but investors should be cautious due to market unpredictability. In today's market, Fetch.ai is appealing for those interested in AI and blockchain fusion. Its innovative technology, strategic partnerships, and potential for industry disruption make FET a cryptocurrency to watch as it evolves.

Aiming to bring top-tier financial products to everyone, this protocol offers innovative solutions for tokenized real-world assets. ONDO's value surged in the early months, peaking in June before a slight dip. Later in the year, interest in real-world asset cryptocurrencies reignited ONDO's momentum. This enthusiasm propelled the token to an all-time high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, ONDO was trading at around $1.45, showcasing its resilience and growing adoption. Looking ahead, predictions suggest a promising future for ONDO. By the end of 2025, forecasts estimate the token could range between $1.50 and $3.50.

Amid a revival of memecoins, its presale has soared by an incredible 3,333%. Crypto traders are hurrying to invest in this new token, drawn by its impressive gains. Excitement is building, and many are wondering what's next for XYZVerse. What is driving this meteoric rise? Explore the factors behind its rapid ascent. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $14 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333. At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits From Meme to Market Star: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. It was created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They chose a popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which is rare, Dogecoin is plentiful. There is no limit to how many can be made. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined. At first, people saw it as a ""memecoin."" But in 2021, its value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Its total value went over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and support from Elon Musk. It showed how online communities can impact markets. Dogecoin's technology is simple and easy to use. Transactions are fast and cheap. Its abundant supply makes it accessible. With growing acceptance, some think it has potential. However, its value is heavily influenced by trends and social media. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features. In the current market, it's important to be cautious. The crypto market is unpredictable. While Dogecoin has a strong community, its future depends on continued interest. For those looking for a fun and community-driven coin, Dogecoin remains an option. But as with any investment, it's wise to do your research. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender Shiba Inu, or SHIB, started as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency but has grown into much more. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work smoothly within the larger Ethereum ecosystem. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, which increased SHIB's popularity. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's use of Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a platform for trading, and plans for NFTs and community governance. SHIB's connection to Ethereum gives it more possibilities. It aims to be more than just a meme coin. In today's market, SHIB shows potential because of its ongoing development and strong community. While the crypto world can be unpredictable, SHIB's steps into decentralized finance and increased usefulness might make it appealing to some. Compared to other similar coins, SHIB offers more features, which could help it last as the market moves toward practical uses of blockchain technology. BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Energizing the Solana Community BONK is a new memecoin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a playful Shiba Inu mascot. It's not just another token; BONK aims to shake up the crypto scene by redistributing power from big venture capital firms to everyday users. After its recent listing on Coinbase, BONK's value shot up by over 100%. Half of its total supply was airdropped to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects, showing its commitment to building a strong community. The coin faces challenges like a large total supply and the wild swings common in memecoin prices. However, BONK is carving out a space in the growing ecosystem of decentralized apps on Solana. The launch of BonkSwap, its own decentralized exchange, adds to its utility. In a market where community-driven projects are gaining attention, BONK stands out. While it shares the spotlight with other memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, BONK's deep integration with Solana's technology gives it unique potential. Keeping an eye on market trends and developments around BONK could be worthwhile for those interested in the evolving crypto landscape. PEPE: The Frog Memecoin Shaking Up the Crypto Scene PEPE is a deflationary cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Embracing the playful spirit of internet culture, PEPE aims to join the ranks of popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets PEPE apart is its no-tax policy and its honest approach about having no utility—it's all about fun and simplicity in the world of memes. In April and May 2023, PEPE's market cap soared to an astonishing $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires and gathering a vibrant community of enthusiasts. This explosive growth ignited what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with new meme coins experiencing dramatic rises and falls. Looking ahead, PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a bold plan for a ""meme takeover."" With the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many eyes are on PEPE. Compared to other coins, PEPE captures the whimsical side of crypto, standing out in the current market trends. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, BONK, and PEPE have made strides, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth and uniting sports fans worldwide.

This ethos is intended to captivate not only crypto enthusiasts but also a broader audience that appreciates the underdog spirit in competitive arenas like sports. Building a Robust Community The creators of XYZVerse have dedicated 10% of the total token supply for community rewards, fostering a sense of ownership and involvement among its members. This strategy enhances its foundation, aiming to cultivate a loyal and engaged base. Join the XYZVerse Community for Exclusive Airdrops and Rewards Case Studies: The Rise of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin's journey from a quirky memecoin to a staple in top crypto rankings has paved the way for tokens like XYZVerse. With a large supply and strong community engagement, Dogecoin showed that beyond the memes, substantial market value can be created. Similarly, Shiba Inu leverages its Ethereum-based architecture to expand beyond meme status, integrating real-world applications and community governance. Emerging Contenders: BONK and PEPE While BONK invigorates the Solana ecosystem with its unique community-focused distribution strategy, PEPE remains steadfast in its no-tax, fun-centric philosophy amidst the crypto volatility, underpinning the diverse strategies within the memecoin sphere. Conclusion: Anticipating the Future of XYZVerse As XYZVerse prepares for its upcoming exchange listings, comparisons to early days of DOGE and SHIB are inevitable. Whether it will mimic their success remains to be seen, but the combination of strong community backing and strategic market entries might just position XYZVerse as a formidable player in the crypto arena.

Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Bitcoin: The Digital Currency Changing Money Forever Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, reshaping how we think about money. Created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it's a form of electronic cash that allows people to send payments directly to each other. There's no need for banks or governments to get involved. Bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain, which is like a public ledger shared across many computers. This system ensures that transactions are secure and transparent. Miners around the world verify these transactions by solving complex puzzles. They are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. This process keeps the network running smoothly and safely. Right now, Bitcoin's future looks promising. Every four years, an event called a ""halving"" cuts the rewards miners receive by half. With only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, this makes each one more valuable over time. In the current market, Bitcoin stands strong among other digital currencies. Its limited supply and growing acceptance make it an attractive option for investors. As the world moves towards digital solutions, Bitcoin could play a big role in the future of finance. Keeping an eye on market trends might help you decide if now is the right time to get involved. Solana's SOL: Speeding Ahead in the Blockchain Race Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena with its emphasis on scalability and speed. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a solid foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). What makes Solana stand out is its unique architecture aimed at faster transactions and its flexibility in supporting multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana's high-capacity network that avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. This design attracts developers and investors seeking a platform capable of handling high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, where efficiency and speed are increasingly valued, SOL presents itself as an attractive option. Its technological advancements position it well against other coins, making it a significant player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion While BTC and SOL are strong, XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, unites global sports fans and aims for 20,000% growth, positioning itself as a cultural icon.

Concurrently, the XYZVerse presale has surpassed the $14 million milestone, reflecting significant investor enthusiasm. These developments may be early indicators of a broader surge in alternative cryptocurrencies. The market is abuzz, and the coming days could reveal impactful shifts. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin: The Digital Currency Changing Money Forever Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, reshaping how we think about money. Created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it's a form of electronic cash that allows people to send payments directly to each other. There's no need for banks or governments to get involved. Bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain, which is like a public ledger shared across many computers. This system ensures that transactions are secure and transparent. Miners around the world verify these transactions by solving complex puzzles. They are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. This process keeps the network running smoothly and safely. Right now, Bitcoin's future looks promising. Every four years, an event called a ""halving"" cuts the rewards miners receive by half. With only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, this makes each one more valuable over time. In the current market, Bitcoin stands strong among other digital currencies. Its limited supply and growing acceptance make it an attractive option for investors. As the world moves towards digital solutions, Bitcoin could play a big role in the future of finance. Keeping an eye on market trends might help you decide if now is the right time to get involved. Solana's SOL: Speeding Ahead in the Blockchain Race Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena with its emphasis on scalability and speed. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a solid foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). What makes Solana stand out is its unique architecture aimed at faster transactions and its flexibility in supporting multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana's high-capacity network that avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. This design attracts developers and investors seeking a platform capable of handling high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, where efficiency and speed are increasingly valued, SOL presents itself as an attractive option. Its technological advancements position it well against other coins, making it a significant player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion While Bitcoin and Solana thrive in the 2025 bull run, XYZVerse's unique sports memecoin positions it for remarkable growth in the surging altcoin market.

This astonishing rise is stirring up excitement in the crypto community. The comeback of memecoins seems to be fueling this intense demand. What's behind this explosive growth, and what could it signal for XYZVerse's future? The captivating developments are drawing attention from investors everywhere. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity From Meme to Market Star: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. It was created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They chose a popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which is rare, Dogecoin is plentiful. There is no limit to how many can be made. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined. At first, people saw it as a ""memecoin."" But in 2021, its value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Its total value went over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and support from Elon Musk. It showed how online communities can impact markets. Dogecoin's technology is simple and easy to use. Transactions are fast and cheap. Its abundant supply makes it accessible. With growing acceptance, some think it has potential. However, its value is heavily influenced by trends and social media. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features. In the current market, it's important to be cautious. The crypto market is unpredictable. While Dogecoin has a strong community, its future depends on continued interest. For those looking for a fun and community-driven coin, Dogecoin remains an option. But as with any investment, it's wise to do your research. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender Shiba Inu, or SHIB, started as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency but has grown into much more. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work smoothly within the larger Ethereum ecosystem. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, which increased SHIB's popularity. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's use of Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a platform for trading, and plans for NFTs and community governance. SHIB's connection to Ethereum gives it more possibilities. It aims to be more than just a meme coin. In today's market, SHIB shows potential because of its ongoing development and strong community. While the crypto world can be unpredictable, SHIB's steps into decentralized finance and increased usefulness might make it appealing to some. Compared to other similar coins, SHIB offers more features, which could help it last as the market moves toward practical uses of blockchain technology. BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Energizing the Solana Community BONK is a new memecoin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a playful Shiba Inu mascot. It's not just another token; BONK aims to shake up the crypto scene by redistributing power from big venture capital firms to everyday users. After its recent listing on Coinbase, BONK's value shot up by over 100%. Half of its total supply was airdropped to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects, showing its commitment to building a strong community. The coin faces challenges like a large total supply and the wild swings common in memecoin prices. However, BONK is carving out a space in the growing ecosystem of decentralized apps on Solana. The launch of BonkSwap, its own decentralized exchange, adds to its utility. In a market where community-driven projects are gaining attention, BONK stands out. While it shares the spotlight with other memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, BONK's deep integration with Solana's technology gives it unique potential. Keeping an eye on market trends and developments around BONK could be worthwhile for those interested in the evolving crypto landscape. PEPE: The Frog Memecoin Shaking Up the Crypto Scene PEPE is a deflationary cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Embracing the playful spirit of internet culture, PEPE aims to join the ranks of popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets PEPE apart is its no-tax policy and its honest approach about having no utility—it's all about fun and simplicity in the world of memes. In April and May 2023, PEPE's market cap soared to an astonishing $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires and gathering a vibrant community of enthusiasts. This explosive growth ignited what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with new meme coins experiencing dramatic rises and falls. Looking ahead, PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a bold plan for a ""meme takeover."" With the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many eyes are on PEPE. Compared to other coins, PEPE captures the whimsical side of crypto, standing out in the current market trends. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, BONK, and PEPE thrive, XYZVerse unites sports fans, aiming for 20,000% growth with a community-driven, meme-infused ecosystem set to become the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

Investor anxiety over potential energy supply disruptions and growing regional instability led to persistent pressure on asset prices. Despite this, the DEX to CEX spot trade volume reached a historic peak of 27.9% in June. DEX Fever Hits June Over the past year, DEX trading volumes have more than doubled. This is in contrast with flat volumes on CEX platforms, according to the latest Binance Research report shared with CryptoPotato. In fact, PancakeSwap led DEX market share growth as it climbed from 16% in April to 42% in June, driven by Alpha trading volume growth and the Infinity upgrade that boosted speed, cost, and liquidity efficiency. World Liberty Financial’s increased on-chain activity also boosted liquidity and yield opportunities. Hyperliquid’s spot volume rose from $6 billion in January to nearly $10 billion in June, amidst fierce competition from decentralized perp trading solutions. On Solana, PumpSwap also maintained strong user engagement. The same cannot be said for Raydium, Orca, and Meteora, which struggled to match their January trading peaks, then fueled by meme coin hype. Hybrid CeDeFi Platforms Narrow the Gap A major driver of this growth is that CEXes are increasingly channeling activity toward DEX platforms. Several large exchanges have launched or revealed hybrid models that merge CEX liquidity with on-chain settlement. Binance Research explained that these CeDeFi offerings deliver low-slippage trading, MEV protection, and fast transactions, which allow DEX scalability while bridging the gap between centralized and decentralized crypto markets. It also stated that the flexible regulatory environment for DeFi has allowed DEXes to innovate and expand with new features, which has driven their on-chain volumes. On the other hand, CEX spot volumes remain tied to retail speculation, macro conditions, and volatility, which makes them more vulnerable to external market shifts seen throughout this year.

Many projects are active, but only a few combine strong development with expanding ecosystems. Whether aiming for early access or focusing on existing platforms, these four stand out. This list includes BlockDAG, Cardano, VeChain, and Stellar. From ongoing presales to network upgrades, each offers different paths to long-term potential. Here’s how they are shaping up for the year ahead. 1. BlockDAG: Active Presale and Expanding Ecosystem BlockDAG is gaining traction with its ongoing presale, now in Batch 29. BDAG is priced at $0.0016 and available through the GLOBAL LAUNCH release until August 11. So far, over 23.6 billion BDAG have been sold, and the project has raised about $331 million. The listing price is set at $0.05, which suggests possible returns up to 25x for early participants. The project is already showing user activity. The mobile mining app has 2 million users. Hardware units are also part of the plan, with X30 and X100 rigs shipping July 7, and X10 units going out August 15. Security checks have been completed through Halborn and CertiK. Listings are confirmed for MEXC, LBANK, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. Liquidity plans are in place to manage market entry. With a clear rollout and user base growing, BlockDAG (BDAG) fits well into the best crypto to buy in 2025 category. 2. Cardano: Whale Activity and Governance Steps Forward Cardano is holding firm even as the price moves within a narrow range. ADA is trading near $0.56 after staying between roughly $0.5450 and $0.5939. While some smaller holders have been selling, larger addresses continue to add. Data shows wallets with more than 1 million ADA have added around 490 million ADA recently, bringing their combined holdings to about 23.74 billion ADA. This steady buying from big accounts points to rising confidence at scale. Cardano also makes a case as one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 due to its progress on governance. The Constitutional Committee election closed on July 2, marking a major move toward community-led decisions. This new body will guide network changes under the Cardano Constitution. At the same time, Intersect introduced updates to proposal tools, treasury systems, and GovTool, giving users more control. With consistent buying from large holders and a governance model taking shape, Cardano shows a clear path forward with long-term focus. 3. VeChain: Enterprise Use and Fresh Staking Incentives VeChain continues to focus on real-world supply chain tools. VET is currently near $0.0207. On July 1, the project launched StarGate staking, setting aside $15 million worth of VTHO rewards for early participants over the next six months. This setup encourages users to commit their VET and helps support network strength and decentralization. Joining the program requires holding at least 10,000 VET in wallets like VeWorld. This update is part of VeChain’s larger Renaissance push, which now includes bridging to more than 40 chains like Ethereum and BNB Chain. The network also now supports EVM compatibility and improved development tools. These combined updates are part of what makes VeChain one of the best crypto to buy in 2025. While some projects rely mainly on market interest, VeChain continues to work with firms using blockchain for product tracking, identity checks, and logistics. With utility and income potential, it stands out. 4. Stellar: Focused Growth and Expanding Payment Tools Stellar’s focus on cross-border transactions remains central. XLM is now trading between $0.23 and $0.24 and has kept a steady pace while the market moves sideways. Recently, Stellar completed its Protocol 23 upgrade, which brings smart contract support through Soroban. While no major headlines have surfaced this week, several key partnerships are progressing, including PayPal’s PYUSD and SG-FORGE’s Euro stablecoin, both set to operate on Stellar. These developments help explain why Stellar still belongs among the best crypto to buy in 2025. It continues to build with financial firms and shows strength in handling payment volumes. At the same time, DeFi activity on Stellar is rising, with total value locked now over $97 million. For those focused on networks with long-term use cases and steady growth, Stellar offers a grounded option. It may not post fast gains, but its consistent development and trusted use in financial services are hard to overlook. Summary: What These Four Projects Have in Common For those tracking the best crypto to buy in 2025 , looking beyond short-term price swings is key. BlockDAG is running a large presale, has a live miner app, and continues to build out its tools. Cardano is deepening its governance structure and still offers strong staking systems. VeChain is adding new earning options and expanding its links to other networks. Stellar continues to grow its payment network and is working with major platforms like PayPal and SG-FORGE. Whether your focus is early rollout or proven networks, these four are worth following this year.

After bouncing back from a brief pullback near $105,500 on Wednesday, Bitcoin recently tested $109,000 again in the past 24 hours. A popular crypto analyst has shared a long-term “Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet” that claims that the cryptocurrency has now entered into the final phase that will lead to massive price gains. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Declares Start Of Final Bull Phase In a recent post on X, Merlijn The Trader released what he dubbed the “Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet.” This cheat sheet is a breakdown of Bitcoin’s past market movements that shows the distinct phases of bear markets, accumulation zones, and subsequent parabolic bull runs. The cheat sheet divides each of Bitcoin’s two previous cycles from 2014 into three colored boxes: red for bear markets, orange for accumulation, and green for bull runs. Merlijn’s chart traces this repeating structure over the past decade, showing how each bull market followed a similar rhythm that began after a lengthy consolidation period and ended with a strong price explosion. The first full cycle began with Bitcoin’s peak around $1,000 in December 2013. Following that top, the price entered a long, painful bear market that spanned into 2015. This red-box phase eventually transitioned into accumulation, where Bitcoin traded sideways between $80 and $500 for a prolonged period. The green bull run box on the chart began around early 2017, and eventually ended with a peak just below $20,000 in late 2017. According to the cheat sheet, this entire cycle from peak to new peak lasted 1500 days. Bitcoin’s second cycle kicked off after its December 2017 top. A long drawdown followed, and the bear market phase dragged Bitcoin down to $3,000 by the end of 2018. The chart marks this point with another red box, followed by the orange accumulation zone that stretched well into 2020. The cheat sheet’s green box reappeared in late 2020 right as Bitcoin broke above its previous highs. The price shot up throughout 2021 and eventually reached a new all-time high around $69,000 in November of that year. This second full cycle was shorter than the first and spanned around 1400 days from the previous top. When Will The Next Bull Run Begin? The current cycle began with Bitcoin’s all-time high in November 2021. Since then, the market has gone through its familiar sequence. A sharp decline into 2022 which bottomed around $15,000 represents the bear market phase. The decline was followed by nearly a year of sideways movement and slow recovery up until early 2025. This is represented as the orange accumulation box on the cheat sheet above. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is now in the next bull phase, and possibly the largest one yet. The chart projects a continuation along the long-term growth curve, possibly toward the $250,000 to $300,000 range over the coming year. Notably, the timeline for the entire cycle this time should take about 1,300 days from late 2021 to complete.

Price scenarios, holder behaviour, and post-breakout plans",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/what-happens-if-fun-hits-010-price-scenarios-holder-behaviour-and-post-breakout-plans,"What if a simple $100 investment today could become $1,000 by Christmas? FUNToken sits at $0.009978 on June 30, 2025, just pennies away from a potential 10x surge that would launch it into crypto's top 100. With 77% of 21.5K community members voting bullish despite recent volatility, the question burning through Web3 gaming circles isn't whether FUNToken will break $0.10. It's what happens next when this deflationary gaming token achieves a milestone that could trigger massive holder redistribution, unlock institutional floodgates, and position early adopters for life-changing wealth. The math is brutal in its simplicity: $0.10 represents a 902% gain from current levels, pushing FUNToken's market cap to $1.08 billion and validating its Web3 gaming leadership thesis. Current holders are already positioning for scenarios most haven't considered. The FUNToken roadmap reveals strategic timing that could make $0.10 inevitable rather than optimistic. Market Reality Check FUNToken's current market position reveals classic pre-breakout dynamics that seasoned analysts recognize immediately. Trading at $0.009978 with a $107.95M market cap, the token shows accumulation patterns despite a 0.26% daily decline and 46.46% volume reduction. These contradictions often signal smart money positioning before explosive moves. The 177.39% yearly gain demonstrates sustained momentum, while the 24.82% volume-to-market cap ratio indicates healthy institutional interest. Most importantly, the fixed 10.81 billion token supply creates mathematical scarcity that compounds with each deflationary burn event. Community sentiment remains remarkably stable with 77% bullish votes from 21.5K participants. This level of confidence through volatility typically precedes major breakouts. Metric Value 24h Change Price $0.009978 Down slightly Market Cap $107.95M -0.26% Volume $26.62M -46.46% Bullish Sentiment 77% Stable The $0.10 Mathematics: Why This Target Makes Sense Breaking $0.10 isn't fantasy; it's mathematical inevitability if current trends continue. This target pushes FUNToken's market cap to $1.08 billion, placing it firmly in the top 100 cryptocurrencies and triggering institutional recognition algorithms. The journey requires conquering resistance at $0.02, $0.05, and $0.075 before the psychological $0.10 barrier falls. Historical Web3 gaming token analysis reveals 10x moves typically unfold over 2-4 months during favorable market conditions. FUNToken's revenue-driven deflationary mechanism creates additional upward pressure by systematically removing tokens from the 10.81 billion supply based on platform performance. Each quarterly burn event makes remaining tokens mathematically scarcer, amplifying price appreciation potential. The timing aligns perfectly with market cycles and FUNToken's strategic roadmap . Q4 2025 gaming platform launches and major partnerships could provide fundamental catalysts for sustained breakout momentum beyond speculative trading. Conservative analysis suggests $0.05 by September creates pathway conditions for full $0.10 achievement by year-end. Aggressive scenarios point to $0.15-$0.20 if institutional adoption accelerates beyond current projections. Holder Behavior Revolution Current FUNToken holders face a psychological transformation most haven't experienced. The 77% bullish majority demonstrates diamond-hand mentality, but $0.10 triggers dramatic behavioral shifts as modest investments become substantial wealth. Analysis reveals three distinct holder categories emerging: conviction holders (40%), strategic profit-takers (35%), and full exiters (25%). Conviction holders understand FUNToken's Web3 gaming positioning offers multi-year value creation beyond short-term gains. These participants will likely hold through $0.10, anticipating further ecosystem expansion and utility growth. Their unwavering confidence often stabilizes prices during volatile breakout phases. Strategic profit-takers represent the most sophisticated group, implementing graduated selling strategies that capture gains while maintaining core positions. These holders typically sell 25-50% at major milestones, using profits to diversify while keeping skin in the game for continued upside. The most dramatic transformation affects small retail holders who accumulated below $0.01. A $0.10 breakout converts $500 positions into $5,000+ wealth, creating unexpected financial freedom for ordinary investors. This psychological impact generates viral social media attention that extends rallies beyond fundamental justification. Projected Holder Behavior at $0.10 Strategy Percentage Action Plan Hold Strong 40% Target $0.20+ Take Profits 35% Sell 25-50% Full Exit 25% Complete sale Roadmap Convergence: Strategic Timing for Breakout FUNToken's 2025-2026 roadmap creates perfect fundamental alignment for $0.10 achievement by year-end. The Q4 2025 gaming platform launch coincides with major partnership announcements that drive organic demand beyond speculative interest. Each completed milestone adds credibility to higher valuation targets. Deflationary tokenomics accelerate value appreciation as ecosystem usage expands. Gaming platform transaction fees trigger automatic Buy-and-Burn events, permanently reducing supply while demand increases. This mathematical relationship suggests $0.10 represents fair value rather than speculative overvaluation. These burn events have already started with the June burn of 25 million tokens taken out of circulation. Strategic positioning shows FUNToken benefiting from broader Web3 gaming adoption projected for late 2025. Industry analysis indicates gaming tokens with working products achieve 10-20x valuations during sector rotations. FUNToken's execution record positions it perfectly for this institutional recognition phase. Critical 2025 Milestones Timeline Catalyst Expected Impact Q3 2025 Gaming partnerships Utility expansion Q4 2025 Platform launch Revenue generation Q4 2025 Enhanced burns Supply reduction Community Momentum FUNToken's community expansion provides essential social infrastructure for sustained price appreciation. The FUNToken Telegram community shows consistent growth while social engagement increases across platforms. This organic building creates viral potential during major price movements. Plus, the AI-power Telegram bot will have gamified features like quizzes to ensure the community remains engaged and build a stronger community. Institutional awareness grows alongside retail enthusiasm. Professional traders increasingly discuss FUNToken's undervaluation relative to competitors with similar utility but higher market caps. This recognition often precedes capital inflows that drive 10x movements. The 77% bullish sentiment from 21.5K votes demonstrates remarkable confidence through volatility. Tokens maintaining 70%+ bullish sentiment during accumulation phases typically experience explosive breakouts within 3-6 months. Beyond $0.10: The Ecosystem Expansion Strategy Achieving $0.10 represents the beginning of FUNToken's value creation journey rather than its conclusion. Post-breakout strategy focuses on ecosystem expansion and utility diversification that sustains momentum toward $0.20-$0.50 longer-term targets. The Web3 gaming sector's trillion-dollar potential provides unlimited growth runway. Breaking $0.10 validates FUNToken's Web3 gaming thesis and unlocks institutional investment previously constrained by market cap requirements. The resulting visibility creates network effects that compound growth exponentially. Smart money recognizes this inflection point as a generational wealth creation opportunity. The $0.10 breakout isn't just a price target; it's a gateway to Web3 gaming dominance.

As institutional adoption accelerates, this projection appears increasingly plausible, prompting discussions about the potential effects on other major cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. Growing Momentum Behind a $1 Million Bitcoin The current market landscape reflects growing optimism about Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory. After surpassing the $100,000 milestone, the asset has seen a surge in institutional involvement. Numerous corporations, inspired by Strategy, have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury holdings. Reports suggest that more than 200 companies now include BTC in their balance sheets. Additionally, the U.S. government is said to be exploring the possibility of creating a national Bitcoin reserve of up to one million BTC. This shift in sentiment has led several public figures to support the $1 million projection, including Michael Saylor, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, Jack Dorsey , Samson Mow, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, and Eric Trump. Estimating XRP’s Price in a $1 Million Bitcoin Scenario To estimate XRP’s potential value in a market where Bitcoin reaches $1 million, it is necessary to consider current market share distributions. At the moment, Bitcoin accounts for approximately 65.7% of the global cryptocurrency market, which currently has a total capitalization of about $3.28 trillion. In comparison, XRP holds a market share of approximately 3.9%. If Bitcoin reaches the $1 million mark while maintaining its market dominance, the total market capitalization of the crypto sector would likely expand to roughly $30.3 trillion. Should XRP maintain its existing market share in this scenario, it would have a market capitalization of around $1.19 trillion. Based on its circulating supply, this would result in a per-token valuation of approximately $20.15, a significant increase from its current price of $2.21, representing a growth of around 830%.

While the above projection assumes XRP maintains its current market share, several analysts argue that XRP could appreciate further even before Bitcoin achieves the $1 million target. For instance, Davinci Jeremie, a long-standing Bitcoin supporter, recently predicted that XRP could reach $24 by the end of 2025. Other projections, such as those from Telegaon , foresee XRP reaching $87 by 2035. In the same forecast, Telegaon also anticipates Bitcoin reaching $1.2 million by that year. These forecasts suggest that XRP’s market share could increase over time, especially if investor interest broadens beyond Bitcoin. Historical data supports this possibility. Over the past year, XRP has recorded a price increase of approximately 350%, compared to Bitcoin’s 75% rise. This suggests a higher growth rate for XRP, which could significantly alter its valuation trajectory. If Bitcoin reaches the projected $1 million price point and XRP retains its current market share, a valuation near $20 for XRP appears feasible. However, this outcome depends on multiple variables, including market sentiment, institutional support, and regulatory developments. With some analysts expecting XRP to gain market share even before Bitcoin reaches this milestone, the actual price of XRP in a future crypto market could exceed these early estimates.

According to a new report by a local news outlet, federal prosecutors say that Denice James, a teller at First Federal Savings of Lorain, allegedly stole approximately $75,000 from eight different victims by faking documents and embezzled $1,000 from the bank itself. The report says that James stole the money between July 25, 2023, and November 2, 2023, by forging customers’ names on bank slips and submitting them right before the bank closed, as no customers were inside. She would then process the withdrawals and take the cash for herself. She has been charged with eight counts of bank fraud, eight counts of aggravated identity theft, and one count of embezzlement, to which she has pleaded not guilty. This incident is the latest in a string of fraud schemes involving bank tellers. In May, a bank teller in Maryland pleaded guilty to stealing $255,000 from his employer’s elderly clients by having conspirators impersonate victims to make fraudulent bank withdrawals. In March, a bank teller from New York, whose job it was to tally up money at the end of the day, was accused of stealing $1,000,000 in cash from his bank’s vault by forging signatures.

Here’s The Math",https://timestabloid.com/1000-xrp-could-be-worth-3-38-million-heres-the-math/,"An XRP community analyst has released a detailed projection estimating that a relatively modest investment in XRP could yield millions in the future, provided the asset reaches its full transactional potential. Currently trading near the $2.22 range , XRP continues to be viewed by many analysts as undervalued. This perspective stems from the belief that XRP’s real-world applications, particularly in the global payment ecosystem, are not yet fully reflected in its market valuation. In response to this perceived undervaluation, some analysts have modeled potential future price scenarios based on XRP’s utility. One such projection was recently shared by a community figure known as The5Blairs. Estimating XRP’s Future Market Performance According to The5Blairs, XRP’s current supply of 60 billion tokens and market activity levels suggest that the network could handle approximately $1.3 trillion in annual on-chain transactions. This estimate assumes a velocity of 10, meaning each token is transacted about 10 times per year. At its current price of $2.20, 60 Billion in Circulating Supply, and an annual velocity of 10, $XRP can handle about $1.3 Trillion in annual flow on chain today. You're not ready for the rest of this post…Lock in… 1700 NDAs, at least 14% of Swift, Derivatives, FX Market,… — Future XRP (@the5blairs) June 28, 2025 Using this baseline, the analyst assessed how increased adoption could significantly alter XRP’s price. The projection incorporates both current activity and potential future integration with institutional financial systems. Ripple’s Institutional Ties and Market Opportunities A central element in this analysis is Ripple’s extensive engagement with major financial and tech institutions. During legal proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple disclosed that it had signed over 1,700 non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with various banks and payment firms, many of which are exploring or testing XRP-related solutions. Additionally, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently predicted that XRP could eventually process up to 14% of SWIFT’s transaction volume. SWIFT facilitates approximately $150 trillion in global transfers annually. If XRP captures even 15% of this market, it could be responsible for over $22 trillion in transaction volume per year. Another area of potential lies in the massive derivatives market, which exceeds $1 quadrillion in size. Ripple has expressed interest in tapping into this market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent patent filings by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a major clearinghouse handling over $2 quadrillion in transactions yearly, included references to Ripple and XRP in the context of cross-chain settlements. While speculative, some believe this could hint at possible future adoption. Price Implications: From $2.20 to $3,380 Per XRP Based on these projections, The5Blairs concluded that XRP could eventually facilitate between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion in annual flow. If this materializes and XRP maintains the same token supply and transaction velocity, the price would need to increase by a factor of 1,538 to support the volume. This would place XRP’s value at approximately $3,380 per token. For individual investors, the implications are significant. A holding of 1,000 XRP, worth around $2,200 today, would rise to $3.38 million at this projected valuation. Similarly, a 5,000 XRP position would reach $16.9 million, and 10,000 XRP could be valued at $33.8 million. A wallet holding 50,000 XRP could theoretically exceed $169 million in value. While these forecasts remain speculative and depend on a variety of future developments, they underscore the optimism within the community regarding the asset’s long-term prospects. If XRP reaches the scale of adoption envisioned in these models, the impact on its market price and its early adopters could be substantial.

Coinbase Exec Explains Why The Mysterious $8 Billion BTC Transfer Was Possibly A Hack,https://zycrypto.com/largest-heist-ever-coinbase-exec-explains-why-the-mysterious-8-billion-btc-transfer-was-possibly-a-hack/,"On Thursday, a single entity transferred $8.6 billion worth of Satoshi-era Bitcoin from eight addresses that had held on to the BTC fortune for over 14 years. Conor Grogan, the director of America’s biggest crypto exchange, Coinbase , suggested there is a chance the $8.6 billion BTC movement was caused by a hack that might set a new heist record. Suspicious BCH Transaction Raises Alarm “There is a small possibility that the $8B in BTC that recently woke up were hacked or compromised private keys,” Grogan observed, pointing out a suspicious Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transaction of over 10,000 tokens (valued at roughly $5 million at current prices) made before the main transfers involving 80,000 Bitcoin began. The move raised the likelihood of someone accessing legacy private keys and quietly testing them before commencing the massive BTC movements. “There is a possibility that the owner was testing the private key in a way that wouldn’t get noticed,” Grogan said in a post on Twitter (aka X). “BCH isn’t monitored heavily by whale-watching services.” The pundit stressed that he saw the behavior as unusual: “What makes me say this is that the other BCH wallets have not been touched at all; why wouldn’t they also sweep these? It implies the actor may not have full access.” Incoming Selling Pressure? According to onchain sleuths, all of the Bitcoin was moved into the original wallets on April 2 or May 4, 2011, and had remained untouched for over 14 years after initially receiving the coins in what is now colloquially known as the network’s “Satoshi era,” when its pseudonymous creator was still active online. No individual or company has, so far, publicly claimed ownership of these wallets, but the timing and scope of the transfers left onlookers befuddled. This is particularly because enormous fund movements by OG wallets often hint at incoming selling pressure. But in this case, the Bitcoin is still sitting in the eight new wallets and hasn’t been deposited into exchange addresses. Bitcoin was recently trading hands at $108,029 per coin, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko, after barely changing over a 24-hour timeframe despite the uncertainty. The leading cryptocurrency is about 3.4% down from the lifetime high of $111,814 it registered in May.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Coinbase,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BCH|SPONSORED|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-06 00:03:46

What begins as a casual online chat can end in financial devastation . In one case, a victim was lured by a friendly stranger and guided to a legitimate cryptocurrency investment platform with charts, a sleek interface, and responsive customer support. Initial deposits showed modest gains. Encouraged, the victim sent more money, even borrowing to keep up. Then, the platform went dark, and the account balance vanished. “That’s how they do it,” said Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the US Secret Service, speaking last month to law enforcement officials in Bermuda. “They’ll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it’s probably some old guy in Russia.” The case was just one of many dissected during a week-long workshop led by the Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) — a little-known unit specializing in tracing digital financial crimes across borders. Using open-source tools, GIOC investigators traced the scam back to a domain, a crypto wallet, and, thanks to a brief VPN glitch, an exposed IP address. The GIOC has quietly become one of the most powerful players in crypto enforcement. Over the past decade, the team has seized nearly $400 million in digital assets, according to people familiar with internal agency briefings. Much of it is held in a cold-storage wallet, ranking among the largest known government-controlled digital asset holdings. Kali Smith leads global push to expose crypto crime and train nations on digital threats Kali Smith, the Secret Service’s head of cryptocurrency strategy, is central to this effort. Under her leadership, the agency has trained law enforcement and prosecutors in over 60 countries, targeting jurisdictions vulnerable to exploitation through weak regulation or residency-for-sale schemes. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn’t even realize that this is occurring in our country,’” Smith said during the Bermuda training session. Bermuda, known for its advanced crypto regulations, hosted the recent workshop amid growing concern that its digital asset-friendly policies could also attract bad actors. Bermuda Governor Andrew Murdoch told reporters that technologies and financial services are fantastic for economic growth but can also be exploited. He notes that, alongside the benefits, you need strong investigative powers to deal with abuse under the law. In a session overlooking Hamilton Harbor, Smith warned that scam victims often falsely assume Bitcoin guarantees safety. “They think they can use Bitcoin and be safe. But that isn’t the case,” she said. One real-life case involved an Idaho teenager who was extorted into paying hundreds of dollars after sending an intimate photo online. The investigation revealed a network of transactions funneled through another American teen, ultimately leading to a crypto wallet that had processed nearly $4.1 million through 6,000 transactions. The wallet was linked to a Nigerian passport, and the suspect was arrested in England, awaiting extradition. Crypto scams drive record losses as fraud turns violent and global manhunts intensify Digital asset fraud is now the top cause of cybercrime losses in the US. Americans lost $9.3 billion to scam schemes related to crypto in 2024. Heists and fraud losses — more than half the FBI’s $16.6 billion total for the year. The elderly victims were hit the hardest, with losses approaching $2.8 billion, much of that to fraudulent investment sites. In more extreme cases, digital theft has escalated to real-world violence. In New York, two men were charged with kidnapping and torturing a longtime friend to access his crypto wallet. In Connecticut, six individuals were accused of abducting and beating the parents of a teenage hacker who had stolen $245 million in Bitcoin in a failed ransom attempt. The Secret Service often works with large cryptocurrency firms to track stolen money. Companies such as Coinbase and Tether have been invaluable in investigating by conducting wallet analysis and freezing accounts suspected of fraudulent activity. One of the largest hauls was $225 million USDT, linked to a sweeping romance-investment scam. The agency’s focus on tracking dirty money is part of a broader, decades-old mission that has now been extended to the digital world, and in which the New York field office, which also covers Bermuda, has taken on a leading role in global cryptocurrency enforcement and training efforts.

The decision came just one day after President Donald Trump signed a tax-and-spend bill into law. That decision reignited tensions between the two. Elon, who backed Trump with hundreds of millions and even served under his administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and close confidant, had warned about the bill repeatedly. But Trump signed it anyway. The president also has plans to yank all federal subsidies going to Elon’s businesses, a number that runs into the tens of billions. Elon’s answer was simple: launch a party, cut ties, and go to war. Elon says he’ll fund takedowns of lawmakers Elon had said that he would spend his own money to oust lawmakers who voted for the bill. Now, he’s doing it under a new party banner. Elon wants full control. And that’s already freaking out the GOP. Republicans are worried that the public feud between him and Trump could wreck their chances of holding onto congressional seats in the 2026 midterms. Elon posted on X that: “Increasing the deficit from an already insane $2T under Biden to $2.5T. This will bankrupt the country.” CBS News asked Brett Kappel, an election attorney with decades of experience, what it takes to actually build a party like this. “Only the richest person in the world could make a serious effort at creating a new American political party,” he said . Elon’s wealth makes it possible, but that doesn’t make it easy. Every state has its own ballot access rules, and most of them are built to block third parties. Kappel said political parties are “creatures of the states,” which means Elon has to navigate 50 separate systems. In places like California, it’s brutal. To even be recognized as a party there, you either register 0.33% of all voters, or collect 1.1 million signatures. After that, you’ve got to keep up those numbers or win 2% of the statewide vote just to stay qualified. Filing across states demands time and money And it’s not just California. Every other state has its own rules and thresholds. Elon will need to get each version of the America Party approved individually, then request an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission to be taken seriously at the national level. None of this happens quickly. Legal teams will be all over it. Democrats and Republicans can, and definitely will, fight every signature. The lawsuits alone will cost a fortune. The current legal system favors the two-party system and works to block third-party entries. Even for someone like Elon, getting recognized in all 50 states before 2026 is unlikely. “It might be doable for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states,” attorney Kappel said, but building a full national party “would take years.” Still, Elon thinks he doesn’t need 50 states. He said on X that a party could “laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts.” That’s enough, he believes, to control the vote on major legislation. And he may be right. If the America Party candidates hold the deciding votes, Elon wins by default. He doesn’t have to take over. He just has to disrupt. But also, this isn’t the first time someone’s tried to build a third party, but the track record is ugly. The Green Party and the Libertarian Party have been around for decades. They still fight for ballot access, still push state-by-state, and still struggle to reach even single-digit national support.

33767162,[object Object],1751763613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Analyst Who Predicted 600% XRP Price Rally In 2024 Says Next Leg Up Will Be ‘Parabolic’,https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-who-predicted-600-xrp-price-rally-in-2024-says-next-leg-up-will-be-parabolic/,"A crypto analyst who previously forecasted a massive 600% XRP price surge in 2024 is once again drawing attention with a new technical analysis of the cryptocurrency. This time, the market expert says that XRP is getting ready for its next parabolic leg up. XRP Price Setup Signals Violent Upswing The latest XRP price analysis by market expert Crypto Michael indicates that the top altcoin has just concluded a significant period of consolidation and could be poised for an extremely explosive upward move. In his X post, the analyst shared a supporting chart, capturing XRP’s price action from 2017 to 2026, based on a long-term quarterly candlestick view. Over these years, XRP formed a large symmetrical triangle through a convergence of trendlines, illustrating a prolonged phase of price compression and market indecision. This chart pattern, extending from a peak in 2018 through to mid-2024, culminated in a decisive breakout in 2025. With Crypto Michael now considering XRP’s prolonged consolidation complete , technical indicators show a shift into a buildup phase ahead of the next major leg up . The analysis also highlights that this consolidation was necessary to accumulate buying pressure and position XRP for a shift out of its downtrend. Moving forward, the XRP price chart shows that the analyst expects a breakout from the symmetrical triangle soon. Once the cryptocurrency crosses the upper boundary of the triangle, a sustained move above key resistance levels could serve as a strong bullish signal. While the analyst has not explicitly outlined the exact target for his optimistic projection, the trajectory of his chart highlights that the XRP price, currently sitting at $2.22, is set to move upward. Analyst Sets Next XRP ATH Target Above $80 In other news, crypto analyst CW has dropped another incredibly bold forecast for the XRP price. The market expert presented a compelling multi-cycle chart, suggesting that XRP is in the final stages of a long-term consolidation and is now gathering momentum for a massive breakout . According to CW’s chart analysis, XRP has been in a six-month accumulation period, similar to patterns seen in previous markets. This steady accumulation phase appears to be forming a converging triangle, which historically is a precursor to major upward moves. Now at the cusp of a breakout, especially after testing the previous ATH region, the analyst suggests that XRP is finally stabilizing, interpreting this calm as a steady energy build-up for the next surge. If historical patterns hold, a surge beyond ATH prices could ignite a vertical rally. The chart identifies the first target at the previous ATH level above $3.8, followed by a second target around $21.5. The final target, representing phase 5 of the analysis, points to a parabolic surge beyond $80.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs are nearing $50 billion in cumulative net inflows , underscoring Wall Street’s mounting demand for the cryptocurrency. BTC’s “at-the-market” implied volatility—a metric tracking expected price swings over timeframes from seven days to six months—has dipped to its lowest level since October 2023, when BTC was trading at about a third of its current price. Meanwhile, monthly transactions on the Bitcoin network fell by 15% in June compared to May, reaching their lowest point since October 2023. The slowdown has become so pronounced that miners have been forced to dig deep into the mempool to include abnormally low-fee transactions in blocks. Institutional demand surges as ETFs break records and public firms accumulate Bitcoin Despite this muted on-chain activity, US spot Bitcoin ETFs are hitting new records. The funds drew over $1 billion in net inflows across just two days last week, pushing the cumulative total near the $50 billion mark. In total, these ETFs now hold approximately $137.6 billion worth of BTC—a record high—according to SoSoValue. Publicly traded companies also ramped up their BTC purchases in June, adding around 65,000 BTC, valued at roughly $7 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Though on-chain metrics remain subdued, a Glassnode analysis suggests a shift in network dominance toward institutional investors and whales as high-value transactions become more common. Adding to signs of a summer slowdown, Bitcoin futures volume has declined. Still, the broader trend indicates that institutional demand may be decoupling from retail activity on-chain. Robert Kiyosaki fires back at Bitcoin crash predictions amid $109K resistance struggle Amid this backdrop of waning retail activity and growing institutional presence, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has pushed back against rising bearish sentiment. With BTC struggling to break through the $109,500 resistance level, some traders are bracing for a correction down to $90,000. But Kiyosaki remains unfazed. According to a message on the X platform, Robert Kiyosaki fired back at Bitcoin skeptics while dismissing crash warnings as fear tactics aimed at shaking out weak hands. His comments come as the crypto market faces strong selling pressure, with BTC failing to surpass the $109,500 resistance. In his message on the X, Kiyosaki wrote : “CLICK BAIT Losers keeps warning of a Bitcoin crash. They want to frighten off the speculators. I hope Bitcoin crashes. I will only buy more. Take care”. Reaffirming his long-term bullish stance, Robert Kiyosaki said any sharp correction in BTC should be seen as a fresh buying opportunity. Kiyosaki, a steadfast BTC supporter, maintains his bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. His latest remarks come amid heightened market volatility and growing uncertainty over Bitcoin’s short-term direction. However, Kiyosaki is placing his bets on silver in the near term. Among all asset classes, he’s bullish on silver for July, forecasting a potential 3x surge to $105 by year-end. He continued to say that any Bitcoin dip could be an opportunity to buy for the long term. Currently, BTC price faces rejection at $109,500 while macro factors like the falling US Dollar Index support the upside.
