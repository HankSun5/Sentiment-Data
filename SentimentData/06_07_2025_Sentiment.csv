Hyperliquid’s HYPE token has surged over the last year, driven by significant trading volume and supply control. However, recent dips have raised questions about whether this momentum can be sustained. SUI, another rising contender, has attracted attention with bold price targets, but its user activity has slowed, leading to doubts about near-term growth. In stark contrast, BlockDAG’s recent partnership with the Seattle Seawolves and an impressive presale raising $331 million, with over 23.5 billion coins sold, reflects growing trust in the project. BlockDAG (BDAG) ROI since Batch 1 is 2,660%, and the special offer of purchasing tokens at $0.0016 has made it one of the most enticing long-term crypto investments available. Hyperliquid Price Outlook: Token Surges, and Momentum Hyperliquid has gained attention with a massive 1,000% surge in the HYPE token over the last year, backed by steady user demand. It has secured around 70% of the on-chain perpetuals volume and averaged $420 million in daily trading activity. This growth is largely attributed to the platform’s buy-and-burn model, where trading fees fund token buybacks, limiting supply. Despite the gains, recent price corrections raise concerns about sustaining this momentum. Hyperliquid’s airdrop strategy has helped avoid early sell-offs, but with the HYPE token experiencing fluctuations, it remains uncertain whether this rally will continue. Technical indicators suggest recovery after a brief dip from its $45 peak, but maintaining this growth will rely on consistent user engagement and managing supply efficiently. SUI Price: Bold Targets vs. User Momentum Slows The price potential for SUI has sparked debates, especially after Raoul Pal set an ambitious target of $22. However, the data suggests a more measured growth trajectory. While SUI has experienced short-term rallies, such as a 40% increase recently, its trading volume has cooled, indicating a possible slowdown in user interest. From a technical perspective, resistance around the $1.50 level remains a challenge. SUI’s price has yet to break through this ceiling, and without renewed demand, it may struggle to gain further upward movement. While SUI’s long-term fundamentals still hold promise, its immediate price potential will depend on overcoming these technical barriers and rekindling consistent usage. BlockDAG Joins Seattle Seawolves in Web3 Revolution The Seattle Seawolves have partnered with BlockDAG.Network to introduce blockchain-powered fan experiences. This collaboration aims to enhance fan interaction by offering unique digital ownership opportunities such as NFTs, tradable tokens, and exclusive collectibles linked to the team and its players. In addition, BlockDAG has become the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves for the 2025 season. This partnership will include co-branded content, providing match previews, predictions, and exclusive behind-the-scenes moments across Seawolves’ social media channels. Fans will have access to blockchain-based digital assets, allowing them to collect and trade items securely. This partnership represents the merging of digital ownership with sports fan loyalty. The collaboration also underscores BlockDAG’s rising momentum, with its record-breaking presale continuing to attract attention. BlockDAG’s presale has raised over $331 million and sold 23.5 billion coins, with Batch 29 priced at $0.0276. For a limited time, buyers can purchase at just $0.0016, offering the potential for substantial returns. With the increasing adoption of Web3 technology, BlockDAG continues to solidify its status as one of the best long-term crypto investments. Conclusion While the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies often leads to unpredictable price swings, BlockDAG’s stable approach sets it apart. By locking its presale price at $0.0016, BlockDAG offers a clear, predictable entry point for buyers. This structured approach to its presale, currently in Batch 29 at $0.0276, eliminates the fear of missing out and gives participants confidence in their purchase. In the evolving landscape of crypto, where quick price spikes often distract from long-term value, BlockDAG offers a solid and stable investment opportunity. Its recent partnership and continued presale success show that its path is guided by real adoption and tangible progress, making it one of the best long-term crypto options for 2025.

But for investors chasing explosive growth, newer opportunities like Ruvi AI (RUVI) may hold greater potential. Analysts are pointing to a highly favorable set of circumstances that could see Ruvi AI reach a $1 valuation faster than expected , perhaps even challenging Binance Coin’s renowned growth trajectory. With $2.2 million raised during its presale, a robust foundation of more than 2,000 holders , and a utility-centered model, Ruvi AI is well-positioned for breakout success. Here’s how Ruvi AI is catching the attention of experts and why it could surpass expectations. Trust and Transparency Set Ruvi AI Apart At the center of Ruvi AI’s appeal is its commitment to security and transparency, qualities that are critical for early-stage crypto projects building investor confidence. Ruvi AI’s smart contracts have successfully passed a third-party audit by CyberScope , a respected blockchain auditing firm. This detailed inspection confirms the system’s functionality and safeguards against vulnerabilities, giving investors peace of mind. Ruvi AI has further solidified its reputation by partnering with WEEX Exchange , ensuring guaranteed post-presale liquidity . This allows investors to trade their tokens seamlessly once the project goes live. Together, robust auditing and liquidity strategies highlight Ruvi AI’s reliability, making it a sound investment for both newcomers and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. Real-World Applications Cement Value While speculative hype has often been a hallmark of rapid crypto growth, Ruvi AI focuses on delivering real-world utility . Combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI provides scalable solutions that address core challenges in industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance . Practical Use Cases Driving Demand Marketing Businesses struggling with inefficient advertising budgets are utilizing Ruvi AI’s AI-tools for precision targeting and campaign optimization. This ensures higher returns on investment while minimizing costs.

Presale Momentum Signals Strong Market Enthusiasm Ruvi AI’s presale metrics indicate a promising future: $2.2 million raised , showcasing solid community support. Over 180 million tokens sold , signaling widespread market interest. More than 2,000 holders , highlighting its growing investor base. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , Ruvi AI is priced at an attractive $0.015 per token . Once the presale ends, the price will jump to $0.07 , giving early participants a nearly 5x ROI . Analysts have even predicted Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token post-listing, equating to a life-changing 66x return on investment for initial backers. VIP Tiers Offer Massive Bonus Opportunities A unique feature of Ruvi AI’s presale is its VIP investment tiers , which offer substantial bonuses. These tiers make it possible for investors to amplify their returns significantly. Here’s the breakdown: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000.

These tiers allow early supporters to maximize their financial gains by capitalizing on Ruvi AI’s rising token valuation. Why Ruvi AI Could Overtake Binance Coin’s Momentum While Binance Coin remains a solid investment for those seeking steady long-term growth, its established position limits its potential for meteoric short-term gains. By contrast, Ruvi AI’s early-stage potential, combined with its trusted audit , liquidity assurance , and real-world applications , makes it a more dynamic opportunity for investors seeking substantial returns. Priced at just $0.015 , Ruvi AI delivers a compelling entry point, offering exponential growth possibilities as it targets a $1 valuation and beyond. Thanks to its innovative approach, demand-driven utility, and investor-focused presale structure, Ruvi AI is setting itself up as a breakout player in the cryptocurrency space.

Outset PR Uncovers an 82% Media Meltdown That Could Block Your Reach,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/trying-to-scale-your-web3-project-in-europe-outset-pr-uncovers-an-82-media-meltdown-that-could-block-your-reach,"As crypto adoption surges across Europe, you'd expect media visibility to follow suit. But according to Outset PR’s latest report , the opposite is happening. Between January and March 2025, 82% of crypto-native media outlets in Western Europe lost traffic. The platforms that once shaped narratives and drove awareness for Web3 startups are now struggling to survive under the combined weight of regulation, algorithmic change, and shifting user behavior. If you’re trying to scale your Web3 project in Europe, this meltdown might be the invisible force throttling your reach. The Paradox: Rising Interest, Shrinking Visibility Crypto interest across the EU is rising: ownership in some countries like Slovenia, Italy, and Croatia exceeds 15%, and Europe's total on-chain crypto value exceeded $500 billion last year which accounted for over 21% of the global value. Source: Chainalysis Yet, while the audience grows, media channels are losing their grip. Outset PR analyzed 133 media outlets across the region, 87 of which were crypto-focused, and found that 82% suffered traffic losses in Q1 2025. The reasons, though varied by country, point to a common denominator: the convergence of regulatory pressure, algorithmic change, and market volatility. At the center of this shift is MiCA , the European Union’s new crypto regulation framework. While full enforcement is still rolling out, its early impact has already reshaped how crypto content is written, published, and ranked. Under MiCA-aligned interpretations, regulators from Paris to Rome began scrutinizing tone, affiliate disclosures, and investment-style language — effectively forcing outlets to recalibrate both editorial and monetization models. Some regional regulators interpreted MiCA differently, so the impact of this new framework verified depending on the country: Source: Outset report Outset’s report also revealed that just 7 outlets across the region crossed the 1 million monthly visits threshold, and accounted for 60.26% of total traffic. Another 6 made up most of the mid-tier. But beyond that, 58 outlets drew under 100K visits each, showing how fragmented and vulnerable the long tail of crypto media has become. Real Numbers, Real Fallout Outset PR’s traffic tracking via SimilarWeb and Ahrefs shows just how deep the cuts go: Italian outlets: Over 70% saw visibility drop, despite high local interest. Dutch-language media: 76% lost search traffic after Google’s March update. German-speaking sites: Nearly 40% of total outlets, yet most failed to hold their audience. UK platforms: Though not subject to MiCA, many got hit by the FCA’s expanded financial promotions regime. Source: Outset report Only a few outliers — like Bit2Me News (Spain, +149.4%) and CoinJournal DE (Germany, +23.9%) — managed to grow, thanks to multilingual content, regulatory awareness, and technical SEO strength. Algorithmic Gatekeeping: The Discover Problem Beyond traditional search rankings, Google Discover has emerged as a powerful channel for crypto media distribution. But here too, the visibility crisis is deepening. Outset PR’s report reveals that only 22.99% of crypto-native media outlets in Western Europe maintained consistent presence in Google Discover throughout Q1 2025. By comparison, 32.61% of generalist finance, tech, and economic platforms — the kind that cover crypto as part of broader business reporting — held steady in Discover. This seemingly narrow percentage gap translates into a massive disparity in reach. For Web3 founders, this shift has immediate consequences. Even the most compelling project announcements, protocol updates, or ecosystem news may never surface in front of their intended audience if they rely on media partners that are excluded from Discover. Why This Blocks Your Growth If you’re relying on crypto media in Europe to boost your brand, here’s the harsh truth: your message may never reach the audience it deserves. With fewer high-traffic platforms, limited Google Discover inclusion , and increasing compliance pressure, traditional media outreach is no longer enough. Worse still, many remaining outlets under 100K monthly visits now lack the editorial firepower or domain authority to move the needle — especially for token launches, exchange listings, or major product drops. Conclusion The European Web3 opportunity is enormous with rising user adoption, institutional momentum, and a unified regulatory framework under MiCA. But Outset PR’s latest report makes one thing painfully clear: the infrastructure for visibility is collapsing right when it’s needed most. Crypto-native media outlets are bleeding traffic. Google Discover is excluding a growing number of them. And regional regulators are rewriting the rules of public communication. For founders and marketing leaders, the implications are strategic. Getting covered is no longer enough — you need compliance-ready storytelling, multilingual editorial alignment, and a targeted outreach strategy that prioritizes quality over quantity. That’s where Outset PR comes in. As the only data-driven communications agency, Outset builds visibility strategies that match the new rules of engagement. In this new cycle, the winners won’t just be the loudest. They’ll be the most visible to the right audience, through the right channels and at the right level of credibility.

Outset PR's recent findings indicate a significant drop in traffic across crypto-specific media outlets, with an impactful 82% experiencing a decline in the first quarter of 2025. This decline in media engagement occurs despite a growing interest in cryptocurrency throughout Europe, presenting a paradox for Web3 founders. The urgency to adapt and find new avenues for visibility is crucial. Understanding the Media Decline Outset PR's research uncovered that various factors contributed to the downturn in media traffic, including regulatory pressures from the new MiCA framework, algorithmic changes in search engines, and overall market volatility. The European Union's MiCA regulations have started reshaping public communication rules, affecting how crypto content is published and distributed. Such regulatory shifts have led media outlets to alter their content strategies, impacting their visibility and traffic. Source: Chainalysis While the audience for crypto content grew, the platforms that once served this audience are now losing their ability to reach them effectively. Regional Variations and Impact The impact of these changes isn't uniform across all countries. Each country's regulatory body has interpreted and implemented MiCA differently, leading to a varied impact on media outlets within those regions. Source: Outset report Strategic Adaptations for Web3 Projects Given these challenges, Web3 founders must rethink their outreach strategies. Traditional media may no longer suffice to gain the necessary exposure. Instead, integrating compliance-ready narratives, leveraging multilingual content, and focusing on platforms that still maintain significant traffic is essential. Some platforms, like Bit2Me News in Spain and CoinJournal DE in Germany, have seen positive growth by aligning their content with regulatory standards and focusing on SEO enhancements. Concluding Insights The landscape for crypto media in Europe is rapidly evolving under new regulations and market dynamics.

After its launch in 2023, SUI surged past $1, reaching $2.18 by March 27, 2024. Despite a dip afterward, the token rebounded impressively in autumn 2024, hitting a new high of $2.36 on October 14. By the end of 2024, SUI's value soared to $5.35. This growth was fueled by a significant increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) within its system, surpassing $2 billion. Christian Williams, managing director of the Sui Foundation, expressed pride in the ecosystem's growth, noting the remarkable development from the community and DeFi activities. As of January 6, 2025, SUI hovered around $5.20. Named after the Japanese element of water, the Sui platform aims to bring fluidity and adaptability to the Web3 landscape. Built on Sui Move, derived from the Move programming language, it offers a flexible network for developers and users alike.

Some analysts foresee FET reaching $35 by 2026; others predict more modest growth. By 2030, forecasts range from $3 to $4.66. Projections for 2050 suggest significant potential, but investors should be cautious due to market unpredictability. In today's market, Fetch.ai is appealing for those interested in AI and blockchain fusion. Its innovative technology, strategic partnerships, and potential for industry disruption make FET a cryptocurrency to watch as it evolves.

Aiming to bring top-tier financial products to everyone, this protocol offers innovative solutions for tokenized real-world assets. ONDO's value surged in the early months, peaking in June before a slight dip. Later in the year, interest in real-world asset cryptocurrencies reignited ONDO's momentum. This enthusiasm propelled the token to an all-time high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, ONDO was trading at around $1.45, showcasing its resilience and growing adoption. Looking ahead, predictions suggest a promising future for ONDO. By the end of 2025, forecasts estimate the token could range between $1.50 and $3.50.

Amid a revival of memecoins, its presale has soared by an incredible 3,333%. Crypto traders are hurrying to invest in this new token, drawn by its impressive gains. Excitement is building, and many are wondering what's next for XYZVerse. What is driving this meteoric rise? Explore the factors behind its rapid ascent. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $14 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333. At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits From Meme to Market Star: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. It was created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They chose a popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which is rare, Dogecoin is plentiful. There is no limit to how many can be made. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined. At first, people saw it as a ""memecoin."" But in 2021, its value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Its total value went over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and support from Elon Musk. It showed how online communities can impact markets. Dogecoin's technology is simple and easy to use. Transactions are fast and cheap. Its abundant supply makes it accessible. With growing acceptance, some think it has potential. However, its value is heavily influenced by trends and social media. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features. In the current market, it's important to be cautious. The crypto market is unpredictable. While Dogecoin has a strong community, its future depends on continued interest. For those looking for a fun and community-driven coin, Dogecoin remains an option. But as with any investment, it's wise to do your research. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender Shiba Inu, or SHIB, started as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency but has grown into much more. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work smoothly within the larger Ethereum ecosystem. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, which increased SHIB's popularity. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's use of Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a platform for trading, and plans for NFTs and community governance. SHIB's connection to Ethereum gives it more possibilities. It aims to be more than just a meme coin. In today's market, SHIB shows potential because of its ongoing development and strong community. While the crypto world can be unpredictable, SHIB's steps into decentralized finance and increased usefulness might make it appealing to some. Compared to other similar coins, SHIB offers more features, which could help it last as the market moves toward practical uses of blockchain technology. BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Energizing the Solana Community BONK is a new memecoin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a playful Shiba Inu mascot. It's not just another token; BONK aims to shake up the crypto scene by redistributing power from big venture capital firms to everyday users. After its recent listing on Coinbase, BONK's value shot up by over 100%. Half of its total supply was airdropped to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects, showing its commitment to building a strong community. The coin faces challenges like a large total supply and the wild swings common in memecoin prices. However, BONK is carving out a space in the growing ecosystem of decentralized apps on Solana. The launch of BonkSwap, its own decentralized exchange, adds to its utility. In a market where community-driven projects are gaining attention, BONK stands out. While it shares the spotlight with other memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, BONK's deep integration with Solana's technology gives it unique potential. Keeping an eye on market trends and developments around BONK could be worthwhile for those interested in the evolving crypto landscape. PEPE: The Frog Memecoin Shaking Up the Crypto Scene PEPE is a deflationary cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Embracing the playful spirit of internet culture, PEPE aims to join the ranks of popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets PEPE apart is its no-tax policy and its honest approach about having no utility—it's all about fun and simplicity in the world of memes. In April and May 2023, PEPE's market cap soared to an astonishing $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires and gathering a vibrant community of enthusiasts. This explosive growth ignited what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with new meme coins experiencing dramatic rises and falls. Looking ahead, PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a bold plan for a ""meme takeover."" With the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many eyes are on PEPE. Compared to other coins, PEPE captures the whimsical side of crypto, standing out in the current market trends. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, BONK, and PEPE have made strides, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth and uniting sports fans worldwide.

This ethos is intended to captivate not only crypto enthusiasts but also a broader audience that appreciates the underdog spirit in competitive arenas like sports. Building a Robust Community The creators of XYZVerse have dedicated 10% of the total token supply for community rewards, fostering a sense of ownership and involvement among its members. This strategy enhances its foundation, aiming to cultivate a loyal and engaged base. Join the XYZVerse Community for Exclusive Airdrops and Rewards Case Studies: The Rise of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin's journey from a quirky memecoin to a staple in top crypto rankings has paved the way for tokens like XYZVerse. With a large supply and strong community engagement, Dogecoin showed that beyond the memes, substantial market value can be created. Similarly, Shiba Inu leverages its Ethereum-based architecture to expand beyond meme status, integrating real-world applications and community governance. Emerging Contenders: BONK and PEPE While BONK invigorates the Solana ecosystem with its unique community-focused distribution strategy, PEPE remains steadfast in its no-tax, fun-centric philosophy amidst the crypto volatility, underpinning the diverse strategies within the memecoin sphere. Conclusion: Anticipating the Future of XYZVerse As XYZVerse prepares for its upcoming exchange listings, comparisons to early days of DOGE and SHIB are inevitable. Whether it will mimic their success remains to be seen, but the combination of strong community backing and strategic market entries might just position XYZVerse as a formidable player in the crypto arena.

Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Bitcoin: The Digital Currency Changing Money Forever Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, reshaping how we think about money. Created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it's a form of electronic cash that allows people to send payments directly to each other. There's no need for banks or governments to get involved. Bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain, which is like a public ledger shared across many computers. This system ensures that transactions are secure and transparent. Miners around the world verify these transactions by solving complex puzzles. They are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. This process keeps the network running smoothly and safely. Right now, Bitcoin's future looks promising. Every four years, an event called a ""halving"" cuts the rewards miners receive by half. With only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, this makes each one more valuable over time. In the current market, Bitcoin stands strong among other digital currencies. Its limited supply and growing acceptance make it an attractive option for investors. As the world moves towards digital solutions, Bitcoin could play a big role in the future of finance. Keeping an eye on market trends might help you decide if now is the right time to get involved. Solana's SOL: Speeding Ahead in the Blockchain Race Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena with its emphasis on scalability and speed. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a solid foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). What makes Solana stand out is its unique architecture aimed at faster transactions and its flexibility in supporting multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana's high-capacity network that avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. This design attracts developers and investors seeking a platform capable of handling high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, where efficiency and speed are increasingly valued, SOL presents itself as an attractive option. Its technological advancements position it well against other coins, making it a significant player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion While BTC and SOL are strong, XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, unites global sports fans and aims for 20,000% growth, positioning itself as a cultural icon.

Concurrently, the XYZVerse presale has surpassed the $14 million milestone, reflecting significant investor enthusiasm. These developments may be early indicators of a broader surge in alternative cryptocurrencies. The market is abuzz, and the coming days could reveal impactful shifts. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin: The Digital Currency Changing Money Forever Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, reshaping how we think about money. Created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it's a form of electronic cash that allows people to send payments directly to each other. There's no need for banks or governments to get involved. Bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain, which is like a public ledger shared across many computers. This system ensures that transactions are secure and transparent. Miners around the world verify these transactions by solving complex puzzles. They are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. This process keeps the network running smoothly and safely. Right now, Bitcoin's future looks promising. Every four years, an event called a ""halving"" cuts the rewards miners receive by half. With only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, this makes each one more valuable over time. In the current market, Bitcoin stands strong among other digital currencies. Its limited supply and growing acceptance make it an attractive option for investors. As the world moves towards digital solutions, Bitcoin could play a big role in the future of finance. Keeping an eye on market trends might help you decide if now is the right time to get involved. Solana's SOL: Speeding Ahead in the Blockchain Race Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena with its emphasis on scalability and speed. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a solid foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). What makes Solana stand out is its unique architecture aimed at faster transactions and its flexibility in supporting multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana's high-capacity network that avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. This design attracts developers and investors seeking a platform capable of handling high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, where efficiency and speed are increasingly valued, SOL presents itself as an attractive option. Its technological advancements position it well against other coins, making it a significant player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion While Bitcoin and Solana thrive in the 2025 bull run, XYZVerse's unique sports memecoin positions it for remarkable growth in the surging altcoin market.

This astonishing rise is stirring up excitement in the crypto community. The comeback of memecoins seems to be fueling this intense demand. What's behind this explosive growth, and what could it signal for XYZVerse's future? The captivating developments are drawing attention from investors everywhere. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity From Meme to Market Star: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. It was created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They chose a popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which is rare, Dogecoin is plentiful. There is no limit to how many can be made. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined. At first, people saw it as a ""memecoin."" But in 2021, its value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Its total value went over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and support from Elon Musk. It showed how online communities can impact markets. Dogecoin's technology is simple and easy to use. Transactions are fast and cheap. Its abundant supply makes it accessible. With growing acceptance, some think it has potential. However, its value is heavily influenced by trends and social media. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features. In the current market, it's important to be cautious. The crypto market is unpredictable. While Dogecoin has a strong community, its future depends on continued interest. For those looking for a fun and community-driven coin, Dogecoin remains an option. But as with any investment, it's wise to do your research. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender Shiba Inu, or SHIB, started as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency but has grown into much more. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work smoothly within the larger Ethereum ecosystem. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, which increased SHIB's popularity. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's use of Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a platform for trading, and plans for NFTs and community governance. SHIB's connection to Ethereum gives it more possibilities. It aims to be more than just a meme coin. In today's market, SHIB shows potential because of its ongoing development and strong community. While the crypto world can be unpredictable, SHIB's steps into decentralized finance and increased usefulness might make it appealing to some. Compared to other similar coins, SHIB offers more features, which could help it last as the market moves toward practical uses of blockchain technology. BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Energizing the Solana Community BONK is a new memecoin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a playful Shiba Inu mascot. It's not just another token; BONK aims to shake up the crypto scene by redistributing power from big venture capital firms to everyday users. After its recent listing on Coinbase, BONK's value shot up by over 100%. Half of its total supply was airdropped to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects, showing its commitment to building a strong community. The coin faces challenges like a large total supply and the wild swings common in memecoin prices. However, BONK is carving out a space in the growing ecosystem of decentralized apps on Solana. The launch of BonkSwap, its own decentralized exchange, adds to its utility. In a market where community-driven projects are gaining attention, BONK stands out. While it shares the spotlight with other memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, BONK's deep integration with Solana's technology gives it unique potential. Keeping an eye on market trends and developments around BONK could be worthwhile for those interested in the evolving crypto landscape. PEPE: The Frog Memecoin Shaking Up the Crypto Scene PEPE is a deflationary cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Embracing the playful spirit of internet culture, PEPE aims to join the ranks of popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets PEPE apart is its no-tax policy and its honest approach about having no utility—it's all about fun and simplicity in the world of memes. In April and May 2023, PEPE's market cap soared to an astonishing $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires and gathering a vibrant community of enthusiasts. This explosive growth ignited what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with new meme coins experiencing dramatic rises and falls. Looking ahead, PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a bold plan for a ""meme takeover."" With the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many eyes are on PEPE. Compared to other coins, PEPE captures the whimsical side of crypto, standing out in the current market trends. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, BONK, and PEPE thrive, XYZVerse unites sports fans, aiming for 20,000% growth with a community-driven, meme-infused ecosystem set to become the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

Investor anxiety over potential energy supply disruptions and growing regional instability led to persistent pressure on asset prices. Despite this, the DEX to CEX spot trade volume reached a historic peak of 27.9% in June. DEX Fever Hits June Over the past year, DEX trading volumes have more than doubled. This is in contrast with flat volumes on CEX platforms, according to the latest Binance Research report shared with CryptoPotato. In fact, PancakeSwap led DEX market share growth as it climbed from 16% in April to 42% in June, driven by Alpha trading volume growth and the Infinity upgrade that boosted speed, cost, and liquidity efficiency. World Liberty Financial’s increased on-chain activity also boosted liquidity and yield opportunities. Hyperliquid’s spot volume rose from $6 billion in January to nearly $10 billion in June, amidst fierce competition from decentralized perp trading solutions. On Solana, PumpSwap also maintained strong user engagement. The same cannot be said for Raydium, Orca, and Meteora, which struggled to match their January trading peaks, then fueled by meme coin hype. Hybrid CeDeFi Platforms Narrow the Gap A major driver of this growth is that CEXes are increasingly channeling activity toward DEX platforms. Several large exchanges have launched or revealed hybrid models that merge CEX liquidity with on-chain settlement. Binance Research explained that these CeDeFi offerings deliver low-slippage trading, MEV protection, and fast transactions, which allow DEX scalability while bridging the gap between centralized and decentralized crypto markets. It also stated that the flexible regulatory environment for DeFi has allowed DEXes to innovate and expand with new features, which has driven their on-chain volumes. On the other hand, CEX spot volumes remain tied to retail speculation, macro conditions, and volatility, which makes them more vulnerable to external market shifts seen throughout this year.

Many projects are active, but only a few combine strong development with expanding ecosystems. Whether aiming for early access or focusing on existing platforms, these four stand out. This list includes BlockDAG, Cardano, VeChain, and Stellar. From ongoing presales to network upgrades, each offers different paths to long-term potential. Here’s how they are shaping up for the year ahead. 1. BlockDAG: Active Presale and Expanding Ecosystem BlockDAG is gaining traction with its ongoing presale, now in Batch 29. BDAG is priced at $0.0016 and available through the GLOBAL LAUNCH release until August 11. So far, over 23.6 billion BDAG have been sold, and the project has raised about $331 million. The listing price is set at $0.05, which suggests possible returns up to 25x for early participants. The project is already showing user activity. The mobile mining app has 2 million users. Hardware units are also part of the plan, with X30 and X100 rigs shipping July 7, and X10 units going out August 15. Security checks have been completed through Halborn and CertiK. Listings are confirmed for MEXC, LBANK, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. Liquidity plans are in place to manage market entry. With a clear rollout and user base growing, BlockDAG (BDAG) fits well into the best crypto to buy in 2025 category. 2. Cardano: Whale Activity and Governance Steps Forward Cardano is holding firm even as the price moves within a narrow range. ADA is trading near $0.56 after staying between roughly $0.5450 and $0.5939. While some smaller holders have been selling, larger addresses continue to add. Data shows wallets with more than 1 million ADA have added around 490 million ADA recently, bringing their combined holdings to about 23.74 billion ADA. This steady buying from big accounts points to rising confidence at scale. Cardano also makes a case as one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 due to its progress on governance. The Constitutional Committee election closed on July 2, marking a major move toward community-led decisions. This new body will guide network changes under the Cardano Constitution. At the same time, Intersect introduced updates to proposal tools, treasury systems, and GovTool, giving users more control. With consistent buying from large holders and a governance model taking shape, Cardano shows a clear path forward with long-term focus. 3. VeChain: Enterprise Use and Fresh Staking Incentives VeChain continues to focus on real-world supply chain tools. VET is currently near $0.0207. On July 1, the project launched StarGate staking, setting aside $15 million worth of VTHO rewards for early participants over the next six months. This setup encourages users to commit their VET and helps support network strength and decentralization. Joining the program requires holding at least 10,000 VET in wallets like VeWorld. This update is part of VeChain’s larger Renaissance push, which now includes bridging to more than 40 chains like Ethereum and BNB Chain. The network also now supports EVM compatibility and improved development tools. These combined updates are part of what makes VeChain one of the best crypto to buy in 2025. While some projects rely mainly on market interest, VeChain continues to work with firms using blockchain for product tracking, identity checks, and logistics. With utility and income potential, it stands out. 4. Stellar: Focused Growth and Expanding Payment Tools Stellar’s focus on cross-border transactions remains central. XLM is now trading between $0.23 and $0.24 and has kept a steady pace while the market moves sideways. Recently, Stellar completed its Protocol 23 upgrade, which brings smart contract support through Soroban. While no major headlines have surfaced this week, several key partnerships are progressing, including PayPal’s PYUSD and SG-FORGE’s Euro stablecoin, both set to operate on Stellar. These developments help explain why Stellar still belongs among the best crypto to buy in 2025. It continues to build with financial firms and shows strength in handling payment volumes. At the same time, DeFi activity on Stellar is rising, with total value locked now over $97 million. For those focused on networks with long-term use cases and steady growth, Stellar offers a grounded option. It may not post fast gains, but its consistent development and trusted use in financial services are hard to overlook. Summary: What These Four Projects Have in Common For those tracking the best crypto to buy in 2025 , looking beyond short-term price swings is key. BlockDAG is running a large presale, has a live miner app, and continues to build out its tools. Cardano is deepening its governance structure and still offers strong staking systems. VeChain is adding new earning options and expanding its links to other networks. Stellar continues to grow its payment network and is working with major platforms like PayPal and SG-FORGE. Whether your focus is early rollout or proven networks, these four are worth following this year.

After bouncing back from a brief pullback near $105,500 on Wednesday, Bitcoin recently tested $109,000 again in the past 24 hours. A popular crypto analyst has shared a long-term “Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet” that claims that the cryptocurrency has now entered into the final phase that will lead to massive price gains. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Declares Start Of Final Bull Phase In a recent post on X, Merlijn The Trader released what he dubbed the “Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet.” This cheat sheet is a breakdown of Bitcoin’s past market movements that shows the distinct phases of bear markets, accumulation zones, and subsequent parabolic bull runs. The cheat sheet divides each of Bitcoin’s two previous cycles from 2014 into three colored boxes: red for bear markets, orange for accumulation, and green for bull runs. Merlijn’s chart traces this repeating structure over the past decade, showing how each bull market followed a similar rhythm that began after a lengthy consolidation period and ended with a strong price explosion. The first full cycle began with Bitcoin’s peak around $1,000 in December 2013. Following that top, the price entered a long, painful bear market that spanned into 2015. This red-box phase eventually transitioned into accumulation, where Bitcoin traded sideways between $80 and $500 for a prolonged period. The green bull run box on the chart began around early 2017, and eventually ended with a peak just below $20,000 in late 2017. According to the cheat sheet, this entire cycle from peak to new peak lasted 1500 days. Bitcoin’s second cycle kicked off after its December 2017 top. A long drawdown followed, and the bear market phase dragged Bitcoin down to $3,000 by the end of 2018. The chart marks this point with another red box, followed by the orange accumulation zone that stretched well into 2020. The cheat sheet’s green box reappeared in late 2020 right as Bitcoin broke above its previous highs. The price shot up throughout 2021 and eventually reached a new all-time high around $69,000 in November of that year. This second full cycle was shorter than the first and spanned around 1400 days from the previous top. When Will The Next Bull Run Begin? The current cycle began with Bitcoin’s all-time high in November 2021. Since then, the market has gone through its familiar sequence. A sharp decline into 2022 which bottomed around $15,000 represents the bear market phase. The decline was followed by nearly a year of sideways movement and slow recovery up until early 2025. This is represented as the orange accumulation box on the cheat sheet above. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is now in the next bull phase, and possibly the largest one yet. The chart projects a continuation along the long-term growth curve, possibly toward the $250,000 to $300,000 range over the coming year. Notably, the timeline for the entire cycle this time should take about 1,300 days from late 2021 to complete.

Price scenarios, holder behaviour, and post-breakout plans",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/what-happens-if-fun-hits-010-price-scenarios-holder-behaviour-and-post-breakout-plans,"What if a simple $100 investment today could become $1,000 by Christmas? FUNToken sits at $0.009978 on June 30, 2025, just pennies away from a potential 10x surge that would launch it into crypto's top 100. With 77% of 21.5K community members voting bullish despite recent volatility, the question burning through Web3 gaming circles isn't whether FUNToken will break $0.10. It's what happens next when this deflationary gaming token achieves a milestone that could trigger massive holder redistribution, unlock institutional floodgates, and position early adopters for life-changing wealth. The math is brutal in its simplicity: $0.10 represents a 902% gain from current levels, pushing FUNToken's market cap to $1.08 billion and validating its Web3 gaming leadership thesis. Current holders are already positioning for scenarios most haven't considered. The FUNToken roadmap reveals strategic timing that could make $0.10 inevitable rather than optimistic. Market Reality Check FUNToken's current market position reveals classic pre-breakout dynamics that seasoned analysts recognize immediately. Trading at $0.009978 with a $107.95M market cap, the token shows accumulation patterns despite a 0.26% daily decline and 46.46% volume reduction. These contradictions often signal smart money positioning before explosive moves. The 177.39% yearly gain demonstrates sustained momentum, while the 24.82% volume-to-market cap ratio indicates healthy institutional interest. Most importantly, the fixed 10.81 billion token supply creates mathematical scarcity that compounds with each deflationary burn event. Community sentiment remains remarkably stable with 77% bullish votes from 21.5K participants. This level of confidence through volatility typically precedes major breakouts. Metric Value 24h Change Price $0.009978 Down slightly Market Cap $107.95M -0.26% Volume $26.62M -46.46% Bullish Sentiment 77% Stable The $0.10 Mathematics: Why This Target Makes Sense Breaking $0.10 isn't fantasy; it's mathematical inevitability if current trends continue. This target pushes FUNToken's market cap to $1.08 billion, placing it firmly in the top 100 cryptocurrencies and triggering institutional recognition algorithms. The journey requires conquering resistance at $0.02, $0.05, and $0.075 before the psychological $0.10 barrier falls. Historical Web3 gaming token analysis reveals 10x moves typically unfold over 2-4 months during favorable market conditions. FUNToken's revenue-driven deflationary mechanism creates additional upward pressure by systematically removing tokens from the 10.81 billion supply based on platform performance. Each quarterly burn event makes remaining tokens mathematically scarcer, amplifying price appreciation potential. The timing aligns perfectly with market cycles and FUNToken's strategic roadmap . Q4 2025 gaming platform launches and major partnerships could provide fundamental catalysts for sustained breakout momentum beyond speculative trading. Conservative analysis suggests $0.05 by September creates pathway conditions for full $0.10 achievement by year-end. Aggressive scenarios point to $0.15-$0.20 if institutional adoption accelerates beyond current projections. Holder Behavior Revolution Current FUNToken holders face a psychological transformation most haven't experienced. The 77% bullish majority demonstrates diamond-hand mentality, but $0.10 triggers dramatic behavioral shifts as modest investments become substantial wealth. Analysis reveals three distinct holder categories emerging: conviction holders (40%), strategic profit-takers (35%), and full exiters (25%). Conviction holders understand FUNToken's Web3 gaming positioning offers multi-year value creation beyond short-term gains. These participants will likely hold through $0.10, anticipating further ecosystem expansion and utility growth. Their unwavering confidence often stabilizes prices during volatile breakout phases. Strategic profit-takers represent the most sophisticated group, implementing graduated selling strategies that capture gains while maintaining core positions. These holders typically sell 25-50% at major milestones, using profits to diversify while keeping skin in the game for continued upside. The most dramatic transformation affects small retail holders who accumulated below $0.01. A $0.10 breakout converts $500 positions into $5,000+ wealth, creating unexpected financial freedom for ordinary investors. This psychological impact generates viral social media attention that extends rallies beyond fundamental justification. Projected Holder Behavior at $0.10 Strategy Percentage Action Plan Hold Strong 40% Target $0.20+ Take Profits 35% Sell 25-50% Full Exit 25% Complete sale Roadmap Convergence: Strategic Timing for Breakout FUNToken's 2025-2026 roadmap creates perfect fundamental alignment for $0.10 achievement by year-end. The Q4 2025 gaming platform launch coincides with major partnership announcements that drive organic demand beyond speculative interest. Each completed milestone adds credibility to higher valuation targets. Deflationary tokenomics accelerate value appreciation as ecosystem usage expands. Gaming platform transaction fees trigger automatic Buy-and-Burn events, permanently reducing supply while demand increases. This mathematical relationship suggests $0.10 represents fair value rather than speculative overvaluation. These burn events have already started with the June burn of 25 million tokens taken out of circulation. Strategic positioning shows FUNToken benefiting from broader Web3 gaming adoption projected for late 2025. Industry analysis indicates gaming tokens with working products achieve 10-20x valuations during sector rotations. FUNToken's execution record positions it perfectly for this institutional recognition phase. Critical 2025 Milestones Timeline Catalyst Expected Impact Q3 2025 Gaming partnerships Utility expansion Q4 2025 Platform launch Revenue generation Q4 2025 Enhanced burns Supply reduction Community Momentum FUNToken's community expansion provides essential social infrastructure for sustained price appreciation. The FUNToken Telegram community shows consistent growth while social engagement increases across platforms. This organic building creates viral potential during major price movements. Plus, the AI-power Telegram bot will have gamified features like quizzes to ensure the community remains engaged and build a stronger community. Institutional awareness grows alongside retail enthusiasm. Professional traders increasingly discuss FUNToken's undervaluation relative to competitors with similar utility but higher market caps. This recognition often precedes capital inflows that drive 10x movements. The 77% bullish sentiment from 21.5K votes demonstrates remarkable confidence through volatility. Tokens maintaining 70%+ bullish sentiment during accumulation phases typically experience explosive breakouts within 3-6 months. Beyond $0.10: The Ecosystem Expansion Strategy Achieving $0.10 represents the beginning of FUNToken's value creation journey rather than its conclusion. Post-breakout strategy focuses on ecosystem expansion and utility diversification that sustains momentum toward $0.20-$0.50 longer-term targets. The Web3 gaming sector's trillion-dollar potential provides unlimited growth runway. Breaking $0.10 validates FUNToken's Web3 gaming thesis and unlocks institutional investment previously constrained by market cap requirements. The resulting visibility creates network effects that compound growth exponentially. Smart money recognizes this inflection point as a generational wealth creation opportunity. The $0.10 breakout isn't just a price target; it's a gateway to Web3 gaming dominance.

As institutional adoption accelerates, this projection appears increasingly plausible, prompting discussions about the potential effects on other major cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. Growing Momentum Behind a $1 Million Bitcoin The current market landscape reflects growing optimism about Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory. After surpassing the $100,000 milestone, the asset has seen a surge in institutional involvement. Numerous corporations, inspired by Strategy, have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury holdings. Reports suggest that more than 200 companies now include BTC in their balance sheets. Additionally, the U.S. government is said to be exploring the possibility of creating a national Bitcoin reserve of up to one million BTC. This shift in sentiment has led several public figures to support the $1 million projection, including Michael Saylor, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, Jack Dorsey , Samson Mow, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, and Eric Trump. Estimating XRP’s Price in a $1 Million Bitcoin Scenario To estimate XRP’s potential value in a market where Bitcoin reaches $1 million, it is necessary to consider current market share distributions. At the moment, Bitcoin accounts for approximately 65.7% of the global cryptocurrency market, which currently has a total capitalization of about $3.28 trillion. In comparison, XRP holds a market share of approximately 3.9%. If Bitcoin reaches the $1 million mark while maintaining its market dominance, the total market capitalization of the crypto sector would likely expand to roughly $30.3 trillion. Should XRP maintain its existing market share in this scenario, it would have a market capitalization of around $1.19 trillion. Based on its circulating supply, this would result in a per-token valuation of approximately $20.15, a significant increase from its current price of $2.21, representing a growth of around 830%.

While the above projection assumes XRP maintains its current market share, several analysts argue that XRP could appreciate further even before Bitcoin achieves the $1 million target. For instance, Davinci Jeremie, a long-standing Bitcoin supporter, recently predicted that XRP could reach $24 by the end of 2025. Other projections, such as those from Telegaon , foresee XRP reaching $87 by 2035. In the same forecast, Telegaon also anticipates Bitcoin reaching $1.2 million by that year. These forecasts suggest that XRP’s market share could increase over time, especially if investor interest broadens beyond Bitcoin. Historical data supports this possibility. Over the past year, XRP has recorded a price increase of approximately 350%, compared to Bitcoin’s 75% rise. This suggests a higher growth rate for XRP, which could significantly alter its valuation trajectory. If Bitcoin reaches the projected $1 million price point and XRP retains its current market share, a valuation near $20 for XRP appears feasible. However, this outcome depends on multiple variables, including market sentiment, institutional support, and regulatory developments. With some analysts expecting XRP to gain market share even before Bitcoin reaches this milestone, the actual price of XRP in a future crypto market could exceed these early estimates.

According to a new report by a local news outlet, federal prosecutors say that Denice James, a teller at First Federal Savings of Lorain, allegedly stole approximately $75,000 from eight different victims by faking documents and embezzled $1,000 from the bank itself. The report says that James stole the money between July 25, 2023, and November 2, 2023, by forging customers’ names on bank slips and submitting them right before the bank closed, as no customers were inside. She would then process the withdrawals and take the cash for herself. She has been charged with eight counts of bank fraud, eight counts of aggravated identity theft, and one count of embezzlement, to which she has pleaded not guilty. This incident is the latest in a string of fraud schemes involving bank tellers. In May, a bank teller in Maryland pleaded guilty to stealing $255,000 from his employer’s elderly clients by having conspirators impersonate victims to make fraudulent bank withdrawals. In March, a bank teller from New York, whose job it was to tally up money at the end of the day, was accused of stealing $1,000,000 in cash from his bank’s vault by forging signatures.

Here’s The Math",https://timestabloid.com/1000-xrp-could-be-worth-3-38-million-heres-the-math/,"An XRP community analyst has released a detailed projection estimating that a relatively modest investment in XRP could yield millions in the future, provided the asset reaches its full transactional potential. Currently trading near the $2.22 range , XRP continues to be viewed by many analysts as undervalued. This perspective stems from the belief that XRP’s real-world applications, particularly in the global payment ecosystem, are not yet fully reflected in its market valuation. In response to this perceived undervaluation, some analysts have modeled potential future price scenarios based on XRP’s utility. One such projection was recently shared by a community figure known as The5Blairs. Estimating XRP’s Future Market Performance According to The5Blairs, XRP’s current supply of 60 billion tokens and market activity levels suggest that the network could handle approximately $1.3 trillion in annual on-chain transactions. This estimate assumes a velocity of 10, meaning each token is transacted about 10 times per year. At its current price of $2.20, 60 Billion in Circulating Supply, and an annual velocity of 10, $XRP can handle about $1.3 Trillion in annual flow on chain today. You're not ready for the rest of this post…Lock in… 1700 NDAs, at least 14% of Swift, Derivatives, FX Market,… — Future XRP (@the5blairs) June 28, 2025 Using this baseline, the analyst assessed how increased adoption could significantly alter XRP’s price. The projection incorporates both current activity and potential future integration with institutional financial systems. Ripple’s Institutional Ties and Market Opportunities A central element in this analysis is Ripple’s extensive engagement with major financial and tech institutions. During legal proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple disclosed that it had signed over 1,700 non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with various banks and payment firms, many of which are exploring or testing XRP-related solutions. Additionally, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently predicted that XRP could eventually process up to 14% of SWIFT’s transaction volume. SWIFT facilitates approximately $150 trillion in global transfers annually. If XRP captures even 15% of this market, it could be responsible for over $22 trillion in transaction volume per year. Another area of potential lies in the massive derivatives market, which exceeds $1 quadrillion in size. Ripple has expressed interest in tapping into this market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent patent filings by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a major clearinghouse handling over $2 quadrillion in transactions yearly, included references to Ripple and XRP in the context of cross-chain settlements. While speculative, some believe this could hint at possible future adoption. Price Implications: From $2.20 to $3,380 Per XRP Based on these projections, The5Blairs concluded that XRP could eventually facilitate between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion in annual flow. If this materializes and XRP maintains the same token supply and transaction velocity, the price would need to increase by a factor of 1,538 to support the volume. This would place XRP’s value at approximately $3,380 per token. For individual investors, the implications are significant. A holding of 1,000 XRP, worth around $2,200 today, would rise to $3.38 million at this projected valuation. Similarly, a 5,000 XRP position would reach $16.9 million, and 10,000 XRP could be valued at $33.8 million. A wallet holding 50,000 XRP could theoretically exceed $169 million in value. While these forecasts remain speculative and depend on a variety of future developments, they underscore the optimism within the community regarding the asset’s long-term prospects. If XRP reaches the scale of adoption envisioned in these models, the impact on its market price and its early adopters could be substantial.

Coinbase Exec Explains Why The Mysterious $8 Billion BTC Transfer Was Possibly A Hack,https://zycrypto.com/largest-heist-ever-coinbase-exec-explains-why-the-mysterious-8-billion-btc-transfer-was-possibly-a-hack/,"On Thursday, a single entity transferred $8.6 billion worth of Satoshi-era Bitcoin from eight addresses that had held on to the BTC fortune for over 14 years. Conor Grogan, the director of America’s biggest crypto exchange, Coinbase , suggested there is a chance the $8.6 billion BTC movement was caused by a hack that might set a new heist record. Suspicious BCH Transaction Raises Alarm “There is a small possibility that the $8B in BTC that recently woke up were hacked or compromised private keys,” Grogan observed, pointing out a suspicious Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transaction of over 10,000 tokens (valued at roughly $5 million at current prices) made before the main transfers involving 80,000 Bitcoin began. The move raised the likelihood of someone accessing legacy private keys and quietly testing them before commencing the massive BTC movements. “There is a possibility that the owner was testing the private key in a way that wouldn’t get noticed,” Grogan said in a post on Twitter (aka X). “BCH isn’t monitored heavily by whale-watching services.” The pundit stressed that he saw the behavior as unusual: “What makes me say this is that the other BCH wallets have not been touched at all; why wouldn’t they also sweep these? It implies the actor may not have full access.” Incoming Selling Pressure? According to onchain sleuths, all of the Bitcoin was moved into the original wallets on April 2 or May 4, 2011, and had remained untouched for over 14 years after initially receiving the coins in what is now colloquially known as the network’s “Satoshi era,” when its pseudonymous creator was still active online. No individual or company has, so far, publicly claimed ownership of these wallets, but the timing and scope of the transfers left onlookers befuddled. This is particularly because enormous fund movements by OG wallets often hint at incoming selling pressure. But in this case, the Bitcoin is still sitting in the eight new wallets and hasn’t been deposited into exchange addresses. Bitcoin was recently trading hands at $108,029 per coin, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko, after barely changing over a 24-hour timeframe despite the uncertainty. The leading cryptocurrency is about 3.4% down from the lifetime high of $111,814 it registered in May.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Coinbase,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BCH|SPONSORED|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-06 00:03:46

What begins as a casual online chat can end in financial devastation . In one case, a victim was lured by a friendly stranger and guided to a legitimate cryptocurrency investment platform with charts, a sleek interface, and responsive customer support. Initial deposits showed modest gains. Encouraged, the victim sent more money, even borrowing to keep up. Then, the platform went dark, and the account balance vanished. “That’s how they do it,” said Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the US Secret Service, speaking last month to law enforcement officials in Bermuda. “They’ll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it’s probably some old guy in Russia.” The case was just one of many dissected during a week-long workshop led by the Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) — a little-known unit specializing in tracing digital financial crimes across borders. Using open-source tools, GIOC investigators traced the scam back to a domain, a crypto wallet, and, thanks to a brief VPN glitch, an exposed IP address. The GIOC has quietly become one of the most powerful players in crypto enforcement. Over the past decade, the team has seized nearly $400 million in digital assets, according to people familiar with internal agency briefings. Much of it is held in a cold-storage wallet, ranking among the largest known government-controlled digital asset holdings. Kali Smith leads global push to expose crypto crime and train nations on digital threats Kali Smith, the Secret Service’s head of cryptocurrency strategy, is central to this effort. Under her leadership, the agency has trained law enforcement and prosecutors in over 60 countries, targeting jurisdictions vulnerable to exploitation through weak regulation or residency-for-sale schemes. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn’t even realize that this is occurring in our country,’” Smith said during the Bermuda training session. Bermuda, known for its advanced crypto regulations, hosted the recent workshop amid growing concern that its digital asset-friendly policies could also attract bad actors. Bermuda Governor Andrew Murdoch told reporters that technologies and financial services are fantastic for economic growth but can also be exploited. He notes that, alongside the benefits, you need strong investigative powers to deal with abuse under the law. In a session overlooking Hamilton Harbor, Smith warned that scam victims often falsely assume Bitcoin guarantees safety. “They think they can use Bitcoin and be safe. But that isn’t the case,” she said. One real-life case involved an Idaho teenager who was extorted into paying hundreds of dollars after sending an intimate photo online. The investigation revealed a network of transactions funneled through another American teen, ultimately leading to a crypto wallet that had processed nearly $4.1 million through 6,000 transactions. The wallet was linked to a Nigerian passport, and the suspect was arrested in England, awaiting extradition. Crypto scams drive record losses as fraud turns violent and global manhunts intensify Digital asset fraud is now the top cause of cybercrime losses in the US. Americans lost $9.3 billion to scam schemes related to crypto in 2024. Heists and fraud losses — more than half the FBI’s $16.6 billion total for the year. The elderly victims were hit the hardest, with losses approaching $2.8 billion, much of that to fraudulent investment sites. In more extreme cases, digital theft has escalated to real-world violence. In New York, two men were charged with kidnapping and torturing a longtime friend to access his crypto wallet. In Connecticut, six individuals were accused of abducting and beating the parents of a teenage hacker who had stolen $245 million in Bitcoin in a failed ransom attempt. The Secret Service often works with large cryptocurrency firms to track stolen money. Companies such as Coinbase and Tether have been invaluable in investigating by conducting wallet analysis and freezing accounts suspected of fraudulent activity. One of the largest hauls was $225 million USDT, linked to a sweeping romance-investment scam. The agency’s focus on tracking dirty money is part of a broader, decades-old mission that has now been extended to the digital world, and in which the New York field office, which also covers Bermuda, has taken on a leading role in global cryptocurrency enforcement and training efforts.

The decision came just one day after President Donald Trump signed a tax-and-spend bill into law. That decision reignited tensions between the two. Elon, who backed Trump with hundreds of millions and even served under his administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and close confidant, had warned about the bill repeatedly. But Trump signed it anyway. The president also has plans to yank all federal subsidies going to Elon’s businesses, a number that runs into the tens of billions. Elon’s answer was simple: launch a party, cut ties, and go to war. Elon says he’ll fund takedowns of lawmakers Elon had said that he would spend his own money to oust lawmakers who voted for the bill. Now, he’s doing it under a new party banner. Elon wants full control. And that’s already freaking out the GOP. Republicans are worried that the public feud between him and Trump could wreck their chances of holding onto congressional seats in the 2026 midterms. Elon posted on X that: “Increasing the deficit from an already insane $2T under Biden to $2.5T. This will bankrupt the country.” CBS News asked Brett Kappel, an election attorney with decades of experience, what it takes to actually build a party like this. “Only the richest person in the world could make a serious effort at creating a new American political party,” he said . Elon’s wealth makes it possible, but that doesn’t make it easy. Every state has its own ballot access rules, and most of them are built to block third parties. Kappel said political parties are “creatures of the states,” which means Elon has to navigate 50 separate systems. In places like California, it’s brutal. To even be recognized as a party there, you either register 0.33% of all voters, or collect 1.1 million signatures. After that, you’ve got to keep up those numbers or win 2% of the statewide vote just to stay qualified. Filing across states demands time and money And it’s not just California. Every other state has its own rules and thresholds. Elon will need to get each version of the America Party approved individually, then request an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission to be taken seriously at the national level. None of this happens quickly. Legal teams will be all over it. Democrats and Republicans can, and definitely will, fight every signature. The lawsuits alone will cost a fortune. The current legal system favors the two-party system and works to block third-party entries. Even for someone like Elon, getting recognized in all 50 states before 2026 is unlikely. “It might be doable for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states,” attorney Kappel said, but building a full national party “would take years.” Still, Elon thinks he doesn’t need 50 states. He said on X that a party could “laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts.” That’s enough, he believes, to control the vote on major legislation. And he may be right. If the America Party candidates hold the deciding votes, Elon wins by default. He doesn’t have to take over. He just has to disrupt. But also, this isn’t the first time someone’s tried to build a third party, but the track record is ugly. The Green Party and the Libertarian Party have been around for decades. They still fight for ballot access, still push state-by-state, and still struggle to reach even single-digit national support.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs are nearing $50 billion in cumulative net inflows , underscoring Wall Street’s mounting demand for the cryptocurrency. BTC’s “at-the-market” implied volatility—a metric tracking expected price swings over timeframes from seven days to six months—has dipped to its lowest level since October 2023, when BTC was trading at about a third of its current price. Meanwhile, monthly transactions on the Bitcoin network fell by 15% in June compared to May, reaching their lowest point since October 2023. The slowdown has become so pronounced that miners have been forced to dig deep into the mempool to include abnormally low-fee transactions in blocks. Institutional demand surges as ETFs break records and public firms accumulate Bitcoin Despite this muted on-chain activity, US spot Bitcoin ETFs are hitting new records. The funds drew over $1 billion in net inflows across just two days last week, pushing the cumulative total near the $50 billion mark. In total, these ETFs now hold approximately $137.6 billion worth of BTC—a record high—according to SoSoValue. Publicly traded companies also ramped up their BTC purchases in June, adding around 65,000 BTC, valued at roughly $7 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Though on-chain metrics remain subdued, a Glassnode analysis suggests a shift in network dominance toward institutional investors and whales as high-value transactions become more common. Adding to signs of a summer slowdown, Bitcoin futures volume has declined. Still, the broader trend indicates that institutional demand may be decoupling from retail activity on-chain. Robert Kiyosaki fires back at Bitcoin crash predictions amid $109K resistance struggle Amid this backdrop of waning retail activity and growing institutional presence, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has pushed back against rising bearish sentiment. With BTC struggling to break through the $109,500 resistance level, some traders are bracing for a correction down to $90,000. But Kiyosaki remains unfazed. According to a message on the X platform, Robert Kiyosaki fired back at Bitcoin skeptics while dismissing crash warnings as fear tactics aimed at shaking out weak hands. His comments come as the crypto market faces strong selling pressure, with BTC failing to surpass the $109,500 resistance. In his message on the X, Kiyosaki wrote : “CLICK BAIT Losers keeps warning of a Bitcoin crash. They want to frighten off the speculators. I hope Bitcoin crashes. I will only buy more. Take care”. Reaffirming his long-term bullish stance, Robert Kiyosaki said any sharp correction in BTC should be seen as a fresh buying opportunity. Kiyosaki, a steadfast BTC supporter, maintains his bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. His latest remarks come amid heightened market volatility and growing uncertainty over Bitcoin’s short-term direction. However, Kiyosaki is placing his bets on silver in the near term. Among all asset classes, he’s bullish on silver for July, forecasting a potential 3x surge to $105 by year-end. He continued to say that any Bitcoin dip could be an opportunity to buy for the long term. Currently, BTC price faces rejection at $109,500 while macro factors like the falling US Dollar Index support the upside.

While top cryptocurrencies like ETH dominate headlines, smart money is quietly rotating into high-upside altcoins with real utility and strong fundamentals. Enter Mutuum Finance, a low-price, undervalued DeFi crypto project that’s catching the attention of seasoned analysts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi crypto is quietly gaining momentum. The project has sold more than 60% of presale stage 5 at $0.03. MUTM has mobilized in excess of $11.7 million and has attracted over 12,700 investors. Mutuum Finance could be the next crypto to explode while Ethereum consolidates. Ethereum Shows Signs of Weakness as Market Eyes $2,000 Support Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,452, but is showing signs of fading momentum as broader market uncertainty weighs on top assets. Despite recent bullish developments like spot ETF inflows and ongoing ecosystem upgrades, ETH hasn’t been able to maintain a strong uptrend. Analysts are warning of a potential retest of the $2,000 level if bearish pressure continues and buying volume stays low. While ETH remains a long-term cornerstone of the crypto market, in the short term, traders are increasingly cautious, rotating into smaller, undervalued tokens with higher growth potential. One such project gaining attention during this lull is Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 5 Presale Sees Growing Traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it soars in Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,700 early adopters and well over $11.7 million in funds raised, the project is taking giant strides as a major player in the DeFi. USD Stablecoin Launch & $50K Security Bounty Mutuum Finance, in its plans to build more on its DeFi, is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to highly risk-exposed algorithmic stablecoins, this token has been designed in such a manner that it will guarantee its value even during market volatility. The project itself is about integrity and security. Mutuum Finance platform is already audited by CertiK as well, which once again shows team dedication to transparency, reliability, and sustainability. Mutuum Finance also introduced Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, where a reward of 50,000 USDT is offered. The bounty comes in four categories, namely the critical, major, minor, and low. This will level out all the tiers of vulnerability and reward it alike. Investor Incentives In appreciation of the presale mania and as a token of appreciation to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will distribute a $100,000 giveaway . Ten such winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for being part of the early backers of the project. With the community growing exponentially, the early backers are being rewarded, not only with possible future gain, but with real, present-time rewards. As Ethereum (ETH) flirts with a potential drop toward $2,000, savvy investors are already pivoting toward high-upside opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $11.7 million raised, more than 12,700 investors onboard, and over 60% of Stage 5 already sold out at just $0.03, Mutuum Finance is proving to be more than hype, it’s becoming a movement. Backed by a CertiK audit, a $50K bug bounty, and a forthcoming USD-backed stablecoin, the project combines utility, transparency, and momentum. Now’s the time to act, secure your MUTM tokens today and join the next potential DeFi breakout before prices rise again.

Tron’s steady rise in USDT activity and SUI’s reactions following a significant token unlock reflect how fast market dynamics can shift, highlighting the importance of choosing well-positioned projects. While Tron and SUI maintain strong relevance, BlockDAG is attracting serious interest with its presale numbers and upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release. After raising more than $331.5 million and selling over 23.6 billion coins, BlockDAG has entered batch 29 at $0.0276. However, it now offers a limited-time buying opportunity at just $0.0016 until August 11. Backed by two major security audits and a fast-growing mining base, BlockDAG is making a compelling case as one of the best crypto coins for 2025. Tron’s Rising USDT Usage Strengthens Market Outlook Tron’s roots in decentralized content delivery and its strategic alliances continue to offer stability despite broader market changes. Its recent rise in USDT activity contrasts with the wider market pullback, indicating strong usage across the network. The Tron (TRX) market outlook remains optimistic as developers and users benefit from fast and low-cost transactions. Tron’s well-established ecosystem facilitates stablecoin transfers and DeFi applications, proving its real-world utility. Still, questions about decentralization and regulation remain. Some critics argue that central control and potential scalability bottlenecks could challenge future growth. Nonetheless, Tron’s consistent performance and ecosystem strength keep it positioned for further gains. SUI Reacts to Token Unlock But Maintains Developer Interest SUI gained early support for its high-performance Layer 1 setup, offering speed and cost efficiency. A recent $164 million token unlock, however, sparked a short-term dip, putting pressure on SUI price movement. Despite this, SUI’s design still appeals to developers seeking secure, flexible infrastructure. The platform supports smart contracts and digital assets directly on-chain, which could boost adoption over time. That said, SUI faces strong competition and ongoing market volatility. Its path forward will depend on how well it manages token supply, builds community trust, and delivers consistent development progress. BlockDAG’s $0.0016 Offer, Strong Audits, & GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Draw Attention BlockDAG’s upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release is helping it stand out from other rising crypto projects. Early buyers are now being offered one of the most attractive entry points since the project’s inception. With over $331.5 million already raised during its presale, more than 23.6 billion coins sold, and the current batch 29 priced at $0.0276, BlockDAG is now giving users a rare opportunity to buy in at just $0.0016 until August 11, matching one of the lowest prices available since batch 1. This limited-time phase aims to broaden access and reward early adopters before the full launch begins. Alongside its pricing advantage, BlockDAG has earned added trust through completed audits by Halborn and CertiK, confirming that its foundation is built for long-term, secure expansion. These validations reinforce the team’s dedication to delivering not just short-term hype, but a reliable and scalable ecosystem. BlockDAG’s competitive pricing, paired with these trust signals and a growing adoption base, highlight its momentum. With more than 18,300 miners sold and increasing participation through the X1 Mining App, BlockDAG is proving its utility through live tools already in users’ hands. For those following Tron or observing recent SUI price movement, BlockDAG’s blend of strong security, record-breaking presale milestones, and the forthcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release positions it as one of the best crypto coins for 2025 and a clear project to watch. Summing Up The Tron (TRX) market outlook remains steady thanks to increased USDT usage, though questions about its governance model persist. Meanwhile, SUI price movement shows how token unlocks can affect short-term performance, even as its developer base continues to support the project. BlockDAG, however, is turning momentum into results. Its upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release opens a $0.0016 entry point until August 11, an attractive deal compared to its current $0.0276 batch price. With over $331.5 million raised, audits from Halborn and CertiK, and thousands of miners already active, BlockDAG is showing strength across key areas. In a market full of bold claims, BlockDAG is backing its vision with action. For those looking at the best crypto coins for 2025 , BlockDAG offers one of the most complete and compelling opportunities available today.

Yet, by rejecting calls for a pause and a phased process, the EU may be sabotaging its own ambitions and handing the future of artificial intelligence to the US and China . The European Commission formally rejected industry requests to delay the implementation of the AI Act, choosing instead to stick to a rigid legal timeline. This means general-purpose AI (GPAI) models must comply by August 2025, while high-risk system rules take effect in 2026. There’s no grace period, no transition window, and no exceptions. This is despite loud protests from both American tech giants and European innovators. From Alphabet and Meta to ASML and Mistral, companies around the world have cautioned that an “over-hasty” introduction of the AI Act risked dampening innovation, adding compliance burdens, and potentially becoming a less appealing place to develop AI products in Europe. At a press conference, Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier acknowledged the barrage of feedback — letters, articles, and media criticism — but remained unmoved. “ Let me be as clear as possible, there is no stop the clock ,” he said. That phrase might sound principled, but it could also spell strategic defeat in today’s breakneck tech environment. Rushed rules leave EU businesses in the dark The intention behind the AI Act is commendable. Europe is right to want a robust legal framework for AI, especially as generative models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini are increasingly entwined in business, education, media, and daily life. However, the method and pace of implementation matter just as much as the message. A recent Amazon Web Services (AWS) survey found that more than two-thirds of European companies are still unsure about their compliance obligations under the AI Act. If even large enterprises are in the dark, what does that mean for startups and small firms lacking the legal and technical resources to decode such a complex law? The answer is simple: they either pause development, scale down their AI ambitions, or relocate to more flexible jurisdictions. As the US innovates and China accelerates, Europe risks falling behind Unlike the bloc’s sweeping rulebook, the United States has adopted a voluntary compliance model focused on sectoral risk assessments and industry-led best practices. While not perfect, it has allowed American firms to innovate without the same immediate regulatory chokehold. Conversely, China has taken a different route — integrating AI into its state control mechanisms and social stability frameworks. While critics argue this limits free expression, it also shows China is committed to dominating the AI race on its terms. Europe, meanwhile, sits at a crossroads. It wants to be the ethical leader in AI, where technology is built responsibly. But if it becomes the hardest place to innovate, that leadership will be symbolic at best. European leaders call for a smarter rollout before innovation suffers Even some of Europe’s leaders are voicing concern. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson recently called the rules “confusing” and urged the bloc to postpone implementation. The tech industry lobby group CCIA Europe — representing Apple, Meta, and Amazon — said the AI Act’s rollout risks becoming a barrier to innovation. These aren’t fringe complaints. They are early warning signs that the region’s dream of technological sovereignty could collapse under the weight of its own regulatory ambition. What Europe needs now is not deregulation but calibration. A phased rollout, a temporary grace period, or, at the very least, clearer guidance for smaller businesses would make a difference. It would allow firms to innovate confidently while still preparing for compliance. The Commission has committed to delivering measures to simplify digital regulation, including easier reporting for SMEs. That’s a start. However, the AI Act requires a more direct and focused response. But we can’t let our sense of right and wrong stand in the way of progress, not when the world is only getting more competitive. If Europe really wants to be a leader in responsible AI, it needs to strike the right balance between principle and pragmatism. Otherwise, AI in the future will be scripted and run from elsewhere.",OP-ED,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-06 02:15:27

At first glance, it might seem bold, even forward-thinking, for the United States to invest heavily in Bitcoin. But if we really care about long-term financial leadership, Americans should look beyond just buying digital assets. The smarter strategy lies in creating a national platform that integrates blockchain technology into our financial system. The U.S. holds a privileged place in the world economy. As the issuer of the global reserve currency, the U.S. dollar, we benefit from widespread trust in our economy, our government, and our ability to maintain financial stability. That trust gives us enormous influence around the world. But maintaining that position requires forward-thinking action, not just investing in trendy assets. The Flaws in Relying on Bitcoin Reserves Many argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and resistance to manipulation make it a perfect candidate for national reserves. Since it is not controlled by any government, Bitcoin is often compared to digital gold, a supposedly safe and neutral asset in times of global uncertainty. But while that may sound good in theory, it doesn’t serve the practical needs of a national reserve. Strategic reserves are designed for emergencies, to settle international debts, support the economy in times of disruption, and ensure financial continuity. Bitcoin’s price volatility and limited real-world usage make it a poor fit for such purposes today. Worse yet, if the U.S. were to begin hoarding Bitcoin, the move might be interpreted as a lack of confidence in our own currency. That could undermine global trust in the dollar and open the door for geopolitical rivals, such as China or Russia, to challenge America’s financial credibility. Simply put, trying to “future-proof” the economy by holding Bitcoin could actually weaken our position in the short term. While it’s true that Bitcoin could evolve into a global settlement tool, that evolution is still underway. What’s needed now is not stockpiling crypto, but building the rails that allow digital assets, including Bitcoin, to become functional parts of the financial system. Why Building a Platform Is a Better Strategy To really lead in the digital finance age, the U.S. must do more than own assets, we need to build the infrastructure others rely on. Think back to the early days of the internet. The winners weren’t those who simply bought up websites; it was the companies that built powerful platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, that shaped the digital economy. The same principle applies today. America should invest in becoming the premier hub for digital assets by creating trustworthy exchanges, safe custodial services, and streamlined on- and off-ramps for crypto. In doing so, we export American values like the rule of law, financial transparency, and technological innovation into the growing digital economy. Bitcoin might be the starting point, but it won’t be the end. As decentralized finance (DeFi) matures, the U.S. has the opportunity to lead in developing not just the tools, but the rules that define how digital assets operate globally. Real-World Applications Already Taking Root You don’t have to be an economist to see how digital finance is changing daily life. Currently, millions of Americans are utilizing cryptocurrency for more than just trading; they’re applying it to entertainment, investing, and even gaming. For example, the rise of online casinos in the U.S. highlights how fast digital transactions are being adopted. Many platforms now accept cryptocurrencies, allowing players to deposit and withdraw instantly with lower fees and more privacy. Still, while regulations vary by state, the demand for digital-first entertainment shows just how far the financial landscape has shifted. This isn’t a far-off future, it’s already happening, and it’s one more reason we need to lead with infrastructure, not speculation. The Power of Stablecoins Backed by the Dollar One of the biggest opportunities for strengthening America’s global financial role lies in the expansion of dollar-based stablecoins. These are digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar, offering the stability of our national currency with the speed and accessibility of blockchain technology. Used wisely, stablecoins can facilitate faster, cheaper, and more inclusive cross-border payments. They can provide people around the world with access to digital dollars without requiring a U.S. bank account. If properly regulated and with clear rules around reserves, consumer protection, and transparency, stablecoins could extend the reach of the dollar more effectively than traditional banks or foreign policy ever could. Of course, not all countries welcome dollarization, and in regions where local currencies are weak or politically sensitive, dollar-pegged stablecoins may face resistance. That’s where Bitcoin and other decentralized assets can act as neutral alternatives, bridging systems without being tied to any one nation. Sparking American Innovation Through Smart Policy The U.S. didn’t build the internet by micromanaging innovation. Instead, we laid the legal and technical groundwork for entrepreneurs to experiment and scale. That’s how Silicon Valley became the envy of the world. We can take a similar approach now by giving U.S. companies the space to build on top of open financial networks whether that’s blockchain, stablecoins, or other emerging tech. A balance between regulation and freedom is critical. With too much red tape, we risk losing talent and capital to friendlier markets. With too little oversight, we undermine trust. If we get the balance right, we can lead again, offering an open alternative to closed, authoritarian systems like central bank digital currencies being developed in places like China.

As 2025 progresses, some projects are getting attention for their strong purpose, structured plans, and active communities. This article highlights four networks with different focuses, like mining systems, wallet utilities, Solana trading tools, and Bitcoin-based rewards. While each one has its unique approach, all share good upside potential during their current presale phases. Here are the top crypto presale projects in 2025 you should know about today, starting with BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release. BlockDAG: GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Brings Special Pricing Currently in Batch 29, BlockDAG’s presale price is fixed at $0.0016 until August 11th. It has sold over 23.5 billion coins and raised $331.5 million so far. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. The listing price is set at $0.05, opening the chance for over 3,000% returns when listed. There will be 45 batches or until it hits its $600 million funding target. This method builds strong infrastructure and market readiness before launch. BlockDAG uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work and DAG setup that supports fast processing with better energy efficiency. Its X1 Miner App now has more than 2 million active users. Hardware miners X30 and X100 will ship on July 7, and X10 on August 15. Security checks by CertiK and Halborn add to its credibility. BlockDAG (BDAG) is growing with real DeFi uses, an active system, and a six-week global plan, making it one of the top crypto presale projects in 2025 with strong basics and early access advantages. BEST Wallet: A Multi-Use Wallet with Built-In Utility BEST Wallet offers a non-custodial wallet that works as a launchpad and staking platform. Its $BEST coin presale has raised over $13.5 million at a current price of $0.0252. From its 10 billion total coins, only 4.5% are in presale, spread across 100 small pricing stages. It offers swaps, bridges, staking, NFTs, and governance straight from its interface. Owning $BEST offers fee discounts, exclusive staking APYs above 105%, and access to future presales via the app. Security is boosted with Fireblocks MPC. Soon, NFT support and derivatives will launch. BEST Wallet is becoming a place for DeFi and presale activity, placing it among the top crypto presale projects in 2025 for those seeking wallet benefits and passive income options. Snorter: Telegram-Based Solana Trading Bot Snorter is built for Solana and gives fast, low-cost Telegram trading features. It combines sniping, MEV protection, honeypot checks, and copy-trading in one platform. Its standout feature is that it works directly within Telegram, letting users place trades quickly using simple chat commands. The presale is live, and pricing changes with demand via its portal. More than a bot, Snorter is building an entire system for the new Telegram trading era. As Solana bots grow, Snorter gives a timing and safety advantage. MEV protection and honeypot scanning help reduce risks often linked with fast sniping. This makes Snorter one of the top crypto presale projects in 2025 for users aiming to automate and improve their Solana trading strategies. BTC Bull: Coin Rewards Linked to Bitcoin Growth BTC Bull is a rewards coin that tracks Bitcoin’s market rise without needing to hold BTC itself. It uses custom smart contracts and DeFi staking layers to let users earn from BTC movements. The presale starts at around $0.001 with a burn system to keep the supply limited. Each presale stage has limited allocations to avoid sudden price drops. BTC Bull stands out for its rewards based on Bitcoin’s price. Users who stake early can earn higher APYs when BTC’s value goes up. Future plans include listings, BTC-pegged liquidity vaults, and rewards tied to Bitcoin dominance. With Bitcoin aiming beyond $60,000, BTC Bull gives a way to gain from this growth trend through structured incentives, making it a strong candidate in the top crypto presale projects in 2025 list. Final Remarks! BlockDAG offers an entry at just $0.0016 with early buyers seeing 2,660% gains so far, BEST Wallet combines wallet services with staking and launchpad utility, Snorter delivers Solana trading tools on Telegram, and BTC Bull lets users benefit from BTC price rises through its reward system. These top crypto presale projects in 2025 each bring their own features, from real usage to smart passive rewards. Picking the right one depends on your goals, but these projects are already building strong trust and practical use cases before their exchange listings.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000708. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000381 and an average trading price of $0.0032 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Floki Inu Token FLOKI Price $0.00007424 Market Capitalization $714.51M Trading Volume $38.9M Circulating Supply 9.62T FLOKI All-time High $0.0003462 (Jun 05, 2024) All-time Low $0.00000002 (Aug 08, 2021) 24-hour High $0.00007618 24-hour Low $0.00007312 Floki Inu price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.81% 50-Day SMA $0.00008529 14-Day RSI 46.65 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 67 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.00009696 Floki Inu price analysis Key Insights: Floki’s price is down 0.36% today. Floki Inu is testing crucial support at $0.00007297. A breakout above $0.00007662 could target $0.00008167. FLOKI on the daily timeframe: Analysis reveals a potential reversal point for Floki Inu The daily chart of Floki Inu on July 6 reveals the current price is testing support at $0.00007297, with a recent low point near $0.00007000. The price action indicates some accumulation around this level, but a clear breakout is yet to be seen. The MACD, with green histograms and a positive crossover, suggests a possibility of a shift in momentum. Although the price has been trading in a tight range, it remains below the previous resistance at $0.00007662, which could act as a major barrier. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView In the event of a push upwards, the price could target $0.00008167, the upper resistance, but this will require a sustained increase in buying pressure. A breach below $0.00007000 would open the door to further downside, potentially testing the $0.00005876 level, which has been a historical support. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe: Market indecision becomes prevalent in the short term The 4-hour chart for Floki Inu reveals a period of consolidation following a series of fluctuations. The Bollinger Bands indicate a tightening range, with the price hovering near the middle band at $0.00007452. The market is currently indecisive as the price is struggling to break out of this zone. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The volume oscillator shows a significant decline of -25.88%, suggesting decreasing market participation, and the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) histogram is revealing diminishing bullish momentum, with the line at -0.35. This implies that unless the price pushes above the middle Bollinger Band at $0.00007605, the trend could remain muted, with further chances of revisiting the lower boundary of $0.00007190.

The coin is facing resistance at $0.00007662 while holding support at $0.00007297. The next move will depend on a breakout above resistance or a breakdown below support, with a shift in volume or momentum likely triggering a decisive move. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $100 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 100x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

This support would be triggered if t he 5 0% tariff on aluminum imports remains in place beyond the mid-term, according to Jean Simard, CEO of the Aluminium Association of Canada ( AAC). In an interview, Simard said early discussions are underway and could help support the industry if Ottawa fails to finalize a trade deal with the US, its largest trading partner, by the July 21 deadline. While Canadian aluminum companies currently have no liquidity issues, Simard warned that a prolonged 50% US tariff could eventually impact Canada’s financial system. Canada seeks to offer support to its giant aluminum firms amid Trump’s tariff policies About 50% of the aluminum used in the US comes from other countries, and most comes from Canada. Last year, Canada exported 3.2 million tons of the metal to America. US President Donald Trump increased steel and aluminum import tariffs to 50% last month. This was to ratchet pressure on global steel producers and escalate his trade war to further his objective of boosting the local production of essential materials for building. Concerning Canada’s big move to offer support to its big aluminum firms, Simard said that this is part of a larger discussion where everything is on the table. He further stated that no decision had been reached. According to Simard, with the 50% tariff in effect since June 4, it is normal that there are discussions, among other things, about the impact on businesses’ liquidity if the situation persists over time. Simard’s remarks come after earlier media reports, which cited Mélanie Joly, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry of Canada, said the government is in talks with Rio Tinto to provide financial assistance in light of Trump’s devastating tariffs policies. According to reports from sources, Joly reportedly raised the discussions in a meeting with business leaders in the Saguenay region of Quebec, a major center of aluminum production, often called Canada’s Aluminum Valley. Rio Tinto declined a request for comment. On the other hand, a Joly office spokesperson stated that Ottawa is currently having “active conversations” about the best ways to support Canada’s aluminum industry, given an environment of unjustified US tariffs, to support greater investment in the sector. Trump’s tariff policies on steel and aluminum cause undesirable outcomes Trump plans to back and promote investment in steel and aluminum production within the country. These two are key products in the construction sector. Apart from this, aluminum has an additional benefit. It is widely employed in the transport sector and the packaging industry. Still, aluminum end-users in the physical market have confronted certain problems in America. For instance, they should expect to pay at the London Metal Exchange when purchasing the raw material. Also, there is another cost for the spot market price. This is inclusive of shipping and duties. US manufacturing sector sales have dropped since they depend on raw-material imports. May data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) indicated the sector contracted for the third month, recording a six-month low. This decrease led to the sustained loss of jobs throughout the industry. It has also been hurt by increasing energy prices. It is worth pointing out that apart from exporting aluminum to the US, Canada also imports steel. A quarter of US steel comes from imports, mostly from Mexico and Canada.

Altcoins with real use, strong presales, and serious community momentum are taking center stage. Smart buyers are no longer chasing hype alone, they’re tracking utility, infrastructure rollouts, and early access. Some names are already breaking out in chat groups and newsletters. These aren’t coins just surviving the market, they’re setting up for serious runs before the next bull wave hits. Here’s a closer look at four of the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025. Whether you want to catch a 25x presale rocket or ride the wave of AI and Layer-1 growth, these are the tokens with serious upside. Get in before everyone else does. 1. BlockDAG: 25x Presale Rocket With Real Utility Behind It BlockDAG is grabbing headlines, and wallets, fast. It’s still deep in presale, but it already feels like a breakout is near. Batch 29 is live, offering BDAG at just $0.0016 until August 11 through a limited Global Launch promo. With over 23.5 billion coins sold and $331.5 million raised so far, this isn’t just hype, it’s a presale with muscle. When it hits the $0.05 listing mark, early buyers could be sitting on a 25x return. And BlockDAG isn’t just promises. Its X1 mobile mining app has already pulled in more than 2 million users. Hardware rigs? On the way. The X30 and X100 ship out July 7, with the X10 following on August 15. Add in successful audits from Halborn and CertiK, plus confirmed listings on MEXC, BitMart, CoinStore, and XT.com, and you’ve got a launchpad in motion. With liquidity support and a goal to crack the CoinMarketCap Top 30, BlockDAG could easily be one of the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025, and time is ticking. 2. Render (RNDR): The AI-Powered GPU Engine of Crypto Render is riding the AI explosion and doing it with power to spare. RNDR offers decentralized GPU rendering for creators, game studios, and AI developers, linking idle GPU power to people who actually need it. It’s cheaper, faster, and smarter. And now, it’s not just tied to animation and VFX, it’s supporting AI training and machine learning on a global scale. Trading around $7.80, RNDR is surging thanks to big exchange listings and constant tech upgrades. Its model is simple: give developers a better way to compute, and let the RNDR token power the engine. With AI adoption soaring, RNDR is right in the sweet spot. If your portfolio is missing a high-tech edge, RNDR could be one of the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025 that delivers massive growth tied to a real-world need. 3. NEAR Protocol: The Smart Chain Built for Builders NEAR Protocol is making major moves, and devs love it. This chain isn’t just fast and cheap, it’s made to be used. With Nightshade sharding, NEAR brings powerful scalability without the usual coding headaches. That’s why more builders are migrating here and launching apps with real use. As of early July, NEAR trades around $5.30, bouncing strong from 2023 lows. With cross-chain tools, AI integration, and major backing, it’s poised for a breakout. Add its growing DeFi ecosystem and smooth onboarding tools, and it’s clear why NEAR belongs on any serious watchlist. If you want a project with tech that actually works and dev teams ready to scale, NEAR is one of the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025 that could surprise everyone. 4. Cardano (ADA): The Long-Term Player Starting to Shine Cardano has taken its time, but that’s the point. Built on deep research and peer-reviewed protocols, ADA’s approach is slow and steady. But now in 2025, all that patience is starting to pay off. Its ecosystem is expanding with more DeFi apps, dApps, and partnerships, especially across Africa and Latin America. Sitting near $0.38, ADA might not double overnight, but it’s one of the most trusted names out there. Recent updates like Hydra and Mithril boost its performance and efficiency, keeping the chain future-ready. For those looking to anchor their portfolio with a project that plays the long game, Cardano remains one of the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025 that blends trust, leadership, and a clear path forward. 4 Coins, Real Tools, Big Potential If you’re aiming for serious gains this year, these four coins check the right boxes. BlockDAG is a rare find, live tech, hardware shipping soon, audits completed, and a presale price of just $0.0016 before it hits $0.05. That’s the kind of low-entry, high-reward setup that doesn’t come often. NEAR is making dev tools easier, RNDR is connecting crypto with the AI revolution, and ADA is showing why steady wins the race. The real winners in 2025 won’t just be hype coins, they’ll be projects that are building fast, shipping real features, and getting ahead of the next wave. Each of these belongs in the conversation about the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025 . Now’s the time to act while the window’s still open.

Despite the hesitation, bulls have held critical support, and the coming days are shaping up to be a defining moment for Ethereum and the broader altcoin space. Momentum is slowly shifting as investors look for confirmation that ETH will lead the next wave of upside action. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Top analyst Ted Pillows has shared a bullish technical outlook, suggesting that a Wyckoff accumulation pattern is currently unfolding. According to Pillows, this structure resembles the early stages of major breakouts seen in past cycles and signals strong smart money positioning. He argues that Ethereum already played a key role in Bitcoin’s latest rally to new all-time highs, and now it’s Ethereum’s turn to shine. A sustained breakout above the $2,600–$2,700 range could trigger the next phase of the cycle, with $3,000 in sight as the initial target. With market sentiment recovering and BTC consolidating near highs, traders and investors are closely watching Ethereum’s next move to gauge whether an altseason is around the corner. The setup is in place — but ETH must deliver. Ethereum Builds Strength Ethereum is up 82% from its April lows, demonstrating strong bullish control as the price holds firmly above key demand zones. Despite recent volatility, ETH continues to trade within a well-defined range between $2,400 and $2,700, a structure that has persisted since early May. This tight consolidation suggests the market is preparing for a decisive breakout, one that could define Ethereum’s trajectory for the remainder of the year. Ted Pillows reveals that Ethereum is now undergoing a classic Wyckoff accumulation pattern. According to his analysis, this phase marks the transfer of ETH from weak hands to strong hands, and it mirrors past cycle setups that led to explosive rallies. Pillows argues that Ethereum helped push Bitcoin to new all-time highs, and now it’s Ethereum’s turn to take the spotlight. If this pattern plays out, Pillows sees a clear path: first a breakout to $3,000, followed by a healthy correction, and then a push to $4,000 sometime in Q3. Beyond that, the real parabolic move may begin, driven by renewed confidence, broader altcoin participation, and sustained demand for ETH as a core asset in the crypto ecosystem. Related Reading: Solana Tests Rising Channel Support – Breakdown Could Send Price To $128.50 Level ETH Holds Above Key Support Amid Tight Range Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,520, maintaining its position above critical support levels despite recent volatility. As shown in the 12-hour chart, ETH has acknowledged the $2,480–$2,500 zone multiple times since late May, signaling strong buyer interest at these levels. The price remains trapped within a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, with no clear breakout yet in either direction. ETH is currently trading near its 50- and 100-period SMAs, which are converging around the current price, indicating equilibrium and a potential inflection point. The 200-period SMA sits below $2,200 and continues to trend upward, supporting the longer-term bullish structure. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range Volume has remained relatively stable, with no spike suggesting institutional accumulation or mass distribution. For bulls to regain full momentum, ETH must reclaim the $2,600–$2,700 resistance and flip it into support. On the downside, a clean break below $2,480 could expose the $2,300 zone once again.

Bitrue, a well-known crypto exchange and vocal supporter of XRP , posed an important question to the community: “What price will XRP reclaim next?” The community shared varying targets, ranging from modest gains to highly optimistic forecasts, showing confidence in the asset’s future. What price will #XRP reclaim next? — Bitrue (@BitrueOfficial) July 4, 2025 Wide Range of Expectations Some community members expect a moderate rise, pointing to prices between $2 and $3. Specific projections such as $2.26, $2.28, $2.3, and more were repeated by several participants, indicating a belief that XRP will at least return to its 2021 range. The asset is currently trading at $2.2. Analysts recently highlighted $2.25 as a crucial resistance level to watch. If XRP breaches this resistance, a short-term bull run could start. Others forecast more aggressive price moves. One user suggested a return to $3 in the short term, $5 by November, and $10 by the end of the year . Another commenter pointed to $15.89 as the next target, and increasing institutional and retail demand could contribute to lofty targets like this. Calls for New Highs and Discovery Beyond specific figures, several replies conveyed a broader belief in XRP’s long-term potential. Multiple users declared that the next target should be the all-time high, with some expecting XRP to surpass it and enter a new phase of price discovery. A few replies offered more strategic takes, with one user stating he plans to offload 25% of his XRP holdings at the $10 mark, suggesting that profit-taking expectations are already set around that level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skepticism Still Present in the Community Not every response was optimistic. Some users placed targets below $1 or around current trading ranges. One reply suggested $0.8 as a near-term cap, while another pegged $1 as the most likely outcome in the short term, dismissing more aggressive targets. These replies serve as a reminder that, despite the bullish tone among much of the community, a subset of XRP holders remains either waiting for more concrete market signals or skeptical of quick rallies. XRP Community’s Confidence Remains High While opinions vary, the overarching tone of the conversation remains positive. Many participants view XRP’s future through a long-term lens, with the belief that external factors such as regulatory clarity or broader market sentiment will eventually fuel sustained upward momentum. One user summarized this mindset by stating that price is secondary to the broader movement XRP represents, tying value to utility and vision rather than daily fluctuations.

Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas shared the latest outlook, placing XRP among the top contenders for approval alongside Litecoin and Solana. Several firms including Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, 21Shares, WisdomTree, CoinShares, and Franklin have submitted applications for a Spot XRP ETF. The first official filing was made on January 30, 2025, and the SEC acknowledged it shortly after. The final decision from the SEC is expected by October 17, 2025. However, despite this positive regulatory momentum, XRP’s price remains stuck in a tight range. The token is trading between $2.19 and $2.35, repeatedly testing both resistance and support zones. Unless the price breaks above $2.35 or falls below $2.19, XRP is likely to continue moving sideways in the coming days or even weeks. A move below $2.19 could see the price retesting the $2.05 to $2.10 region, while a clean breakout above $2.35 might spark a short-term rally. XRP Price Prediction According to CoinCodex, XRP is expected to see steady growth in the second half of 2025. In July, the price could range between $2.16 and $2.47, offering a possible 11.14% return for buyers at current levels. In August, prices might rise slightly to a range of $2.18 to $2.50. By September, XRP could climb to around $2.47, with a trading range of $2.29 to $2.60. October is expected to stay positive, with prices between $2.32 and $2.56, although the average might dip a little. . The year might end strong in December, with prices forecasted to move between $2.28 and $3.20, which could mean a 44.10% return if prices reach the higher end.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-06 05:52:43

A prominent member of this group is EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), who has posted a detailed chart analysis focusing on XRP’s large-scale formation, one he believes has recently confirmed a significant breakout. XRP Key Targets EGRAG CRYPTO’s chart depicts a completed symmetrical triangle pattern on XRP’s monthly chart. This structure, spanning from 2017 to 2025, now appears to have resolved with a clear breakout to the upside. The symmetrical triangle is a classic consolidation setup, typically signaling a continuation of the prior trend once price breaches its bounds. In this case, the previous trend was bullish, and the breakout continues in that direction. The analyst included a simplified diagram of symmetrical triangles to clarify the implications of both upward and downward breakouts. He labels the pattern as a macro formation, highlighting the multi-year timespan involved. According to the post, this breakout suggests a large upside move is in play. However, he cautions that a potential macro retest is still on the table. #XRP – DO YOU COMPREHEND? The MACRO formation has broken out, and a potential MACRO retest is still on the table. The measured target is Bellissimo! Bellissimo in Italian means: ""Very Beautiful"" or ""Gorgeous."" pic.twitter.com/u22UFYPkcq — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 4, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The key figure from his chart is the measured move target, an extrapolated price based on the height of the triangle’s formation. That target points toward a projected price of approximately $120, reinforcing recent triple-digit targets and representing an increase of over 9,000% from the breakout point. The chart further outlines Fibonacci extension levels, including 1.272 ($9.13), 1.414 ($15.05), and 1.618 ($30.71), indicating staged potential resistance or consolidation points along the way. The earlier move from XRP’s 2017 low to its 2018 high is used as the basis for the projected breakout move. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the target is “Bellissimo,” a term he defines as “very beautiful,” suggesting optimism about what could come next. Retest and Present Price Action The chart shows that the breakout occurred with a strong upward move, followed by a pullback toward the triangle’s upper trendline, aligning with the textbook retest phase . If this retest confirms support, it could act as a launchpad for the next leg higher. XRP traded around $2.23 at the time of his analysis, putting it just above the triangle’s upper boundary and the $2.2 support level the analyst recently highlighted. The price has yet to make a decisive second move upward, but the technical structure remains intact, and the rally could begin at any time.

Currently, the price is consolidating just under a major resistance trendline on the daily chart. This level has held firm for several days, creating tension in the market as traders await the next decisive move. Interestingly, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that back in 2020, a huge government spending bill helped send Bitcoin to record highs. Now in 2025, another spending bill is on the way, and this one is even bigger, hoping that history might repeat itself. In a recent interview, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, shared his outlook for Bitcoin’s price over the next two to three months. According to Moreno, Bitcoin is likely to trade between $87,000 and $99,000 in the short term if current market conditions continue. Moreno explained that this range is based on on-chain data showing the average price at which traders brought their Bitcoin, known as the realized price. In bull markets, prices often correct toward this level before moving higher again. The upper resistance band, which would act as a potential top for now, sits at $138,000. Right now, demand for Bitcoin appears to be weakening slightly. Unless buying activity picks up in the coming weeks, Moreno said there’s a stronger chance of seeing a dip toward $99,000 before any major rally. He said that in order to see Bitcoin climb to $138,000, demand would need to strengthen. Moreno further explained that Bitcoin’s market cycle top could still reach around $190,000 later on, though he expects the current cycle to stretch into 2026. Historically, Bitcoin performs well in the final quarter of the year during bull cycles, so a strong finish to 2025 isn’t off the table.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-06 06:18:41

Similar to the crypto market leader (Bitcoin), the prominent altcoin and memecoin has registered significant market corrections since attaining a local peak of $0.249 on May 22. However, recent revelations by top analyst Ali Martinez has shown a bullish market condition that supports a price rebound for the DOGE market. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins DOGE Bulls Eye Return To $0.22 In an X post on July 5, Martinez provides some technical insights into the DOGE market highlighting an important requisite for the altcoin to rediscover its bullish form. Using the daily trading DOGEUSDT chart, the renowned analyst identifies an ascending trendline that stretches to 2023. At multiple instances of a retest, this trendline has acted as an efficient support consistently rejecting a further price decline. According to Martinez’s analysis, Dogecoin is trading around this trendline which presently runs through the $0.150 price level. The analyst explains market bulls must defend this price zone which not only fuels the chances of a price rebound, but essentially prevents a breakdown and complete transition to a bearish market. Interestingly, all retest of the highlighted trendline has always produced a price bounce resulting in a parabolic rally. This event is seen in price surges of $0.059 to $0.210 (≈255% gain) between 2023-2024, and $0.095 to $0.470 (≈395%) in 2024. However, Ali Martinez presents a conservative price target, stating a defence of $0.15 support level supports a quick bullish return to at least $0.220. Nevertheless, in the presence of a strong bullish pressure as seen in previous rallies, DOGE investors may expect a further rise to around $0.24 with a potential to return to the local market peak of $0.47. Related Reading: Litecoin Fate Tied To Bitcoin – Will $96 Resistance Crack? DOGE Price Overview At the time of writing, DOGE trades at $0.164 reflecting a modest price gain of 0.91% and 0.56% on the daily chart and weekly chart, respectively. Meanwhile, the memecoin has recorded a 56.81% crash in its daily trading volume indicating a significant fall in market interest. According to data from price prediction site Coincodex, general sentiment in the DOGE market is bearish. However, investors retain an healthy market demand as evidenced by a Fear & Greed Index of 67 i.e. significant amount of greed. For the short-term, Coincodex analysts expects DOGE to still maintain a price around $0.160 in the next five days while projecting a price gain to $0.193 in a month. Meanwhile, their long-term forecasts show little expected price growth in the far future as indicated by price targets of $0.197 in three months, and $0.169 in six months.

According to Buterin, the fact that Ethereum has not experienced a single second of downtime in its ten-year history is a great source of confidence for institutional investors. In his opening speech at the EthCC event in Paris, Buterin discussed the future development direction of the Ethereum network and the “test of value” encountered during this period of accelerating institutional adoption. Noting that institutions are focusing on issues such as “privacy” in particular for the future, Buterin stated that these issues are much more important than the technical infrastructure of the system. Related News: The US Government's Chief Advisor on Cryptocurrencies, Bo Hines, Reveals His Big Prediction About Cryptocurrencies The new co-executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, Tomasz Stańczak, also supported this view, saying that these core values are why institutions choose ETH: “Ethereum has not suffered a single second of downtime over the last decade. Along with constant upgrades, it has always remained true to security and censorship resistance.” Stańczak also noted that when institutions send orders to the market, they expect their transactions to be executed without discrimination, fairly, on time and without errors. With stablecoins and tokenized assets becoming increasingly mainstream, the importance of such deterministic assurances is also increasing. *This is not investment advice.

Yet beneath the surface, not all voices share the optimism. Over 10,000 BTC, worth more than $1 billion, was recently moved from a wallet that had been inactive since 2011 . Following that, multiple similar wallets were activated, and a total of 80,009 BTC, worth almost $9 billion, was moved to unknown wallets. The transfers prompted speculation among many crypto holders, but Bitcoin advocates largely dismissed the event as routine. However, XRP proponent Edoardo Farina views it as a sign of deeper instability. Farina’s Warning to Bitcoin Holders In a recent post , Farina stated that the Bitcoin community is “completely ignoring the red flags staring them in the face,” asserting that they are “blinded by arrogance” and unable to see the broader implications. For Farina, the timing and nature of these moves suggest something more than mere internal transfers. Though none of the funds appear to have entered centralized exchanges, the scale of the movement has unsettled some market watchers, and some anticipate an upcoming sell-off. Farina argues this is precisely the kind of event the Bitcoin community refuses to analyze critically. The BTC community is completely ignoring the red flags staring them in the face. Saylor is a government contractor paid to deceive the masses. Blinded by arrogance, they unable to spot the RED flags. But in time, their fall will be the lesson. We tried to warn them. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 4, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He went further in questioning the motivations of Bitcoin figureheads, alleging that Michael Saylor, who has been called Bitcoin’s Warren Buffett , is part of a coordinated effort to mislead. “Saylor is a government contractor paid to deceive the masses,” Farina wrote, reinforcing a narrative he has promoted in previous critiques of institutional involvement in Bitcoin. Possibility of Future Sell-Offs The suggestion that these dormant wallets could eventually be used to liquidate large holdings is not unprecedented. Historically, early miner wallets have rarely moved funds unless some form of realization, profit-taking, transfer of custody, or structural risk management was involved. A similar event occurred in March 2024 after a wallet that had stayed dormant for 14 years sold its BTC at an all-time high. The 2025 wallet reactivations mirror those concerns. If such holders begin to exit positions during heightened optimism, Bitcoin could be exposed to swift downward pressure. Is Bitcoin’s Downfall Coming? Critics of Farina often dismiss his perspective as tribalism. However, the scale and timing of the recent wallet moves lend some weight to his concerns. Farina has always believed that Bitcoin maximalists are not ready to admit XRP’s superiority , and their blindness in this case reinforces his point. For him, the issue is the Bitcoin community’s refusal to confront the possibility of an unfavorable outcome. “Their fall will be the lesson,” he warned. “We tried to warn them.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Recently, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, joined the conversation, revealing how early he invested in XRP. In a reply to a community post asking users to share their XRP entry price, Schwartz revealed that he purchased his tokens at “$0.006.” The comment came in response to a tweet by a community member, who had remarked that “Real OGs caught $XRP at $0.50.” $0.006 — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 5, 2025 Schwartz’s response stood out because at $0.006, his disclosed entry point suggests involvement with XRP going back to its earliest phases of availability. XRP has seen significant volatility since its inception, trading at various price points across multiple market cycles. By comparison, many consider $0.50 the benchmark for “early” participation. Schwartz’s entry point of $0.006 sets that bar significantly lower, as the last time XRP traded at such low prices was March 2017. Schwartz’s History With XRP As Ripple’s CTO, Schwartz has been a central figure in the development and technical direction of the company’s products and the XRP Ledger. His deep involvement with the project places him in a unique category, as he is not only a user or investor but also an architect of the technology itself. Given this context, it’s not surprising that his exposure to XRP predates much of the general public’s awareness of the digital asset. However, he didn’t follow the same path as other key figures in XRP’s development. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Instead of taking a substantial XRP stake like Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb, Schwartz decided to take a salary and maintain a 2% equity stake in Ripple. His decision not to accumulate XRP, like others in the company, has consistently sparked discussions within the crypto community. McCaleb has since sold his XRP holdings and has moved on to Stellar. Larsen is still an executive at Ripple, and Schwartz remains one of XRP’s most vocal advocates . While he did not initially accept any tokens, Schwartz previously revealed that his father bought over a million XRP in 2014 at $0.005 , with a lower entry price than Schwartz himself. However, Schwartz did not elaborate on how much XRP he acquired at that rate or whether his holdings have changed over time, and the community will continue to speculate on how much XRP the CTO holds.

In a new episode of the All-In podcast, host Jason Calacanis highlights that the US dollar index (DXY) witnessed its worst first-half performance in over 50 years after losing nearly 11% of its value against other major currencies in the first six months of 2025. While Calacanis describes the slump as “shocking,” Palihapitiya argues that the dollar has been in decline for decades, and it’s not a major concern because the gains from US assets have consistently outweighed the currency’s depreciation. “This has been a one-way trade for a very long time, and it’s probably important to understand why that is. And I think it generally has to do with the fact that the United States finances a lot of growth, and that has been the right decision. Unless you see a complete collapse in the currency, I suspect that this decay continues to happen. So the question is, is it a bad thing? And the answer is it depends. Because if asset prices increase faster than the dollar devalues, you’re still ahead… If you look at asset prices in the United States relative to asset prices any place else in the world, it is the flight to quality, which is to say it is the thing that everybody wants to own. And you see that in the equity markets, you see it in real estate, you see it in hard assets… The reality is that a lot of people still want to own these assets more than they want to own other assets and those assets are dollar-denominated.” Palihipatiya also highlights that there will be a constant demand for dollar-denominated assets as long as “there’s American ingenuity and American supremacy,” which would meaningfully offset the downside of holding USD.

US Stocks Outpaced Ethereum In June For the 30 day window ending Friday, Jun. 27, the S&P 500 Index gained +4.25%. The push overcame serious resistance from the tariff nail biters and took the broad US stock benchmark to a historic record close Friday. But after running from $76,200 on 4/8 to $111,600 on 5/22, a +46% gain in a little over a month, Bitcoin’s price took some time to cool down in June. The cryptocurrency charted minor gains, which could be seen as a positive in the face of massive international turmoils and geopolitical shocks. Meanwhile, Ethereum corrected by 24% before bouncing off the Jun. 22 support to finalize a 2% loss for the 30 days ending Friday, Jun. 30th. So does ETH have a problem that Bitcoin doesn’t? Not really. Ethereum is a smaller currency by market cap, about 14% of Bitcoin’s size. Traders still perceive it as a more speculative bet. So it tends to move in the same direction as BTC — by larger percentages. That means on the way down, losses are frequently greater. But on the way up, gains are often greater too. For example, during the crypto market’s rally from early April through early June, Bitcoin made a +46% gain. But during the same rally, Ethereum gained +100%, rising from the $1,400 handle to the $2,800 level. Bitcoin and Ethereum Rainbow Charts Double rainbow all the way across the sky? Bitcoin is by and large the biggest leading indicator for the rest of the crypto market’s prices, including Ethereum. It appears to have a long ways to go before topping out this year or next. Based on popular and authoritative analysts’ price targets for Bitcoin in 2025, it’s pacing to enter July and Q3 at 50% to 66% of its peak price before this cycle is over. That means it could double or gain by half again its June price levels before the year is over. Standard Chartered, Bernstein, Galaxy Digital, and Peter Brandt all expect $150,000 to $200,000 for BTC sometime in the next six months. Bitcoin’s long-term price trend rainbow chart confirms these projections. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s own long-term trend chart is shaping up to signal a three-peat of a multi-year trend. If it happens the way it did the last two major market cycles, this Ether prices could be primed to rise by more than Bitcoin’s during the next big monthly rally. Source: X If it turns out to be Bitcoin’s final push for its peak on this cycle as market watchers expect, Ethereum’s gains could signal the start of this cycle’s alt season in meme coins and Layer 2 app tokens. In addition to the market technical setup for ETH prices in Q3, here are four further bullish signals supporting the leading smart contract platform’s price gains in July. 1. Who Will Win Ethereum L2 Fee Wars? Ethereum’s price has taken time to absorb the shock of the Dencun upgrade on Mar. 13, 2024. The upgrade lowers rates for Layer 2 apps to lock in tranches of transaction updates with the base layer chain. In the 15 months since, developers have deployed a number of new apps with currencies that offer Ethereum services for lower fees. The base chain’s fee revenue dropped from $30 million annually to $500,000 by Q1 of this year. That saves users money, but a lot of Ethereum stakers who had their money parked in staking contracts to earn that fee revenue felt inclined to move it somewhere that it could still earn returns on their savings. This is a massive factor in Ethereum’s sluggish price growth compared to Bitcoin’s over the past year. But it’s not that the latter is falling behind its competitors like Solana and Ripple. When factoring in the growth of the post-Dencun L2 coins on Ethereum— like Mantle (MNT), POL (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Movement (MOVE), and Starknet (STRK)— the money mostly didn’t leave Ethereum and go to its competitors. It went to another layer, powered by and supporting the base chain. For that reason, Ethereum may be undervalued by a large number of the cryptocurrency market’s headline readers that don’t understand what happened. Ethereum Identity Crisis? Some have referred in the mean time to this awkward stage in Ethereum’s growth as an identity crisis. It’s an open platform and anyone can build on it in any way that the code can handle. The question for Vitalik Buterin and crypto market investors who show up to value early is: Will one of the slew of Ethereum scale and fee apps, some new app we haven’t heard of yet, or an upgrade be what implements the best ultra long term, future proof, platform-wide standardizations that define the network’s global advantages? Find the answer to that question and you’re doing some real work. 2. SharpLink $30M ETH Buy In another positive development, the corporate treasury race that started for Bitcoin supplies continues to rock the Ethereum markets. SharpLink Gaming, bought another $30 million worth of ETH just before the Ether price chart threw a small cup and handle pattern. But why does this matter? Well, let’s see what happened to STrategy. Led by founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, Tyson’s Corner, Virginia-based Strategy Inc. and Bitcoin have both benefited from the company’s pivot in 2020 to simply pile up as much BTC as it can hold on to forever. As a result of the cryptocurrency’s increasing popularity with investors since then, MSTR stock rallied 566% in under 11 months from $63 per share on Jan. 5, 2024 to a price peak of $420 on Nov. 22, 2024. Over that same time, the S&P 500 Index rallied 27% from the 4697 level to 5969. Every $100 spent on Strategy stock on Jan. 5 last year could be sold for $666 dollars on Nov. 22, paying back buyers $566 for saving their $100 with MSTR shares for a term of 11 months. That’s like a downpayment on a new car lease with a high credit score. Meanwhile, $100 spent on an S&P 500 ETF would have returned buyers $27. That’s more like a cheap dinner out for two. All for the same hundred bucks and the same 11 months. That suggests regulated Wall Street investors wanted on to the Bitcoin bandwagon and found a way in Strategy stocks. Seeing the bullishness of corporate finance, Internet crypto markets were now racing Strategy to accumulate a scarce supply of BTC tokens. Now, SharpLink is doing it again with ETH. The company’s stocks spiked over 8 days in late May from $3.76 per share to just under $80 a share as Wall Street rewarded the former gaming company for pivoting to accumulating a regulated corporate Ether treasury. 3. $39M ETH Whale Bite Meanwhile, an Ethereum whale took a $39 million chomp out of the crypto dip on 6/22. Ethereum’s forward outlook was too good for this whale not to bite at that 24% off discount tag. Every token is a vote with a daily trading value that fluctuates on a global open market of crypto exchanges. Participants “vote” by locking, unlocking, moving, and swapping currencies, as often as they like, any time they like. When crypto investors take Ether tokens off a crypto exchange, the remaining supply of ETH tends to attract higher prices at the point of sale. But when they stake ETH for yield, it creates even more support. 4. Bit Digital Drops $34M BTC for ETH Not to be outdone by SharpLink, publicly traded, New York-based blockchain company Bit Digital, announced on 6/25 it is giving up $34 million worth of BTC tokens to move the proceeds into Ether and develop staking strategies. They might profit well from determining in advance of the overall market which of the Ethereum scale and fee coins will deliver the most yield and gains together over timespans relevant to their balance sheet and calendar.

XRP Supporters Have Maintained Consistency Through Challenges Edoardo Farina, the founder of Alpha Lions Academy and Head of Social Adoption at XRPHealthcare, recently stated that XRP proponents have regularly demonstrated insight and resilience, even during periods of skepticism and market underperformance. His remarks follow several key developments that have placed Ripple and XRP back into broader market discussions. Farina pointed to the protracted legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which began in late 2020. Despite the uncertainty and XRP’s extended stagnation around the $0.50 mark during that time, supporters of the token continued to defend its legitimacy and utility. $XRP holders have been proven right time and time again. We had the courage to speak the truth, even when the facts pointed the other way. The SEC lawsuit and XRP stuck at $0.50 felt like an eternity. But we were on the right side of history. We deserve prosperity! — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 2, 2025 Recognition for the Community’s Track Record Farina argued that XRP holders have repeatedly advocated for positions that were initially doubted but ultimately proven valid. He claimed that this consistency, particularly in the face of external criticism, justifies recognition and reward. “We deserve prosperity,” he stated, underscoring his belief that XRP supporters have remained on the right side of industry developments. Among the latest validations for the XRP community was Ripple’s recent confirmation of its pursuit of a U.S. banking license. Additionally, the company, via its subsidiary Standard Custody, has applied for a Federal Reserve master account, which would allow it to hold reserves for its stablecoin, RLUSD. These developments support earlier claims by some XRP commentators that Ripple intended to operate more like a traditional financial institution to challenge the global payments infrastructure. At the time, such views were dismissed by many as speculative. However, Ripple’s current direction aligns with those prior assertions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Legal and Market Milestones Further Strengthen Community Confidence XRP advocates also previously contended that the token should not be classified as a security. This position was upheld in July 2023, when U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in Ripple’s favour regarding the classification of XRP in secondary market sales. That ruling was a major milestone, especially given the initial skepticism surrounding the case’s potential outcome. Furthermore, XRP’s price remained relatively flat between $0.50 and $0.60 for years, even as other digital assets experienced significant growth. Despite this, many within the community remained confident in its long-term potential. Their outlook proved accurate when XRP surpassed $2 in late 2024 after a long-awaited breakout. Future Expectations Remain Bold but Consistent Today, the XRP community continues to project ambitious goals for the token and its underlying technology. These include expectations that XRP will handle a portion of SWIFT’s daily transaction volume and that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) will play a central role in asset tokenization. Some even predict that XRP will eventually reach double-digit valuations. While these forecasts remain highly speculative, they are consistent with the community’s long-standing belief in the token’s transformative potential. If past trends are any indication, XRP holders will likely continue to defend their outlooks until further developments either validate or challenge them.

However, analysts are adamant that the asset can unlock major gains, as long as it reclaims a key resistance level. The key resistance level for $XRP is $2.38. Breaking above it could trigger a major move! pic.twitter.com/mwpqKBxJKV — Ali (@ali_charts) July 4, 2025 Basing his analysis on XRP’s UTXO, Ali Martinez determined that this pivotal level is situated at $2.38, where the fourth-largest cryptocurrency faced several rejections in the past few months. However, a conclusive breakout above it could send the token flying, he added. Shortly after, the analyst with almost 140,000 followers on X indicated that XRP can surge to $2.6 as long as it reclaims $2.33. BitGuru also outlined the significance of the same two major resistance lines, saying the asset was rejected at the lower one after it confirmed an “inverse head and shoulders and triple bottom pattern.” With XRP now testing the $2.23 support, the doors open for a surge back to $2.33 as long as it can remain above it, BitGuru added. Elite Crypto’s analysis is similar to that of Martinez, as they noted that XRP is “showing a strong bullish setup.” They added that “the price is consistently respecting the horizontal support and now approaching the downtrend resistance.” The analyst predicted that a breakout from this obstacle could result in a massive price surge for Ripple’s token, perhaps to and above the $3.4 all-time high. $XRP is showing a strong bullish setup as the price is consistently respecting the horizontal support and now approaching the downtrend resistance. A breakout from this zone could lead to a sharp upward move toward the $3.50 range which has acted as a previous resistance level.… pic.twitter.com/TRXv9tYe3n — Elite Crypto (@TheEliteCrypto) July 5, 2025 The post XRP Price Builds Bullish Momentum: Watch This Resistance Level Closely appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-07-06 07:40:52

But the tide may be turning. Since April, the Total 2 — a metric representing the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin — has climbed 35%, signaling a potential shift in momentum toward altcoins. This recovery marks one of the strongest altcoin performances in recent years and has reignited hopes of a broader market expansion beyond Bitcoin. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Top analyst Daan has weighed in on this development, highlighting a key technical formation: a higher low on the Total 2 chart during the recent market bounce. This structure is often seen as a bullish signal, suggesting that investors are stepping in to accumulate altcoins at increasingly higher price levels. If confirmed with a higher high in the coming days or weeks, this could mark the start of a sustainable altseason. As macroeconomic conditions stabilize and risk appetite returns, altcoins could see renewed interest from traders and investors. The next key test will be whether bulls can reclaim higher levels and flip the broader altcoin market structure definitively back to bullish. Altcoins Prepare For A Breakout Altcoins remain about 50% below their all-time highs, but bulls are setting the stage for what could be an expansive move in the coming weeks. After months of underperformance, the broader altcoin market is beginning to show early signs of structural recovery. Ethereum — the market’s leader among altcoins — has been consolidating between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May, and many analysts believe that a breakout in ETH could serve as the catalyst for a broader altcoin rally. Daan recently highlighted a key technical development: the Total 2 Altcoin Market Cap has made a higher low during the latest bounce, a structure that often precedes bullish continuation. This higher low suggests growing demand and reduced downside pressure, both of which are critical to establishing a sustainable uptrend. The key area to watch is the 2024 high setback in May. If bulls can push Total 2 above that level, it would confirm a higher high — the final piece needed to flip the high timeframe structure decisively back to bullish. That breakout would likely usher in renewed momentum across mid- and small-cap tokens, fueling what many hope will be the long-awaited altseason. For now, the market remains in a holding pattern, but signs of accumulation are growing stronger. If Ethereum can break out of its multi-month range, the altcoin market could rapidly reprice, erasing months of losses and opening the door to a new wave of capital rotation out of Bitcoin dominance. As long as key levels hold and risk appetite improves, the foundation is in place for altcoins to make a significant move higher. Related Reading: Solana Tests Rising Channel Support – Breakdown Could Send Price To $128.50 Level ETH/BTC Chart Signals Turning Point The ETH/BTC chart reveals a critical moment for the altcoin market. After a prolonged downtrend that began in late 2022, Ethereum has stabilized near the 0.023 BTC level, forming a potential bottom. While the pair remains well below the 50-week, 100-week, and 200-week moving averages—indicating continued bearish pressure—momentum appears to be shifting. Since bottoming out in mid-June, ETH/BTC has held its ground and is attempting to build a base, with early signs of accumulation. However, without a clear breakout above resistance zones, particularly around the 0.025–0.027 BTC range, bulls will struggle to confirm a trend reversal. A decisive move above these levels would be the first major confirmation of strength for Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern – $2,200 Support Back In Focus? This breakout is essential for altseason. Historically, altcoin rallies are triggered when ETH outperforms BTC, drawing capital into mid- and small-cap tokens. Without ETH leading, altcoins tend to lag as Bitcoin dominance remains high.

This forecast comes at a time when Ripple has taken a groundbreaking step toward transforming its role in the U.S. financial sector by applying for an official banking license. In response to a query on XRP’s short-term outlook, ChatGPT stated, “Given the current trajectory of XRP at $2.22 and the added positive sentiment from Ripple’s regulatory advancements, XRP could climb approximately 12.6% to $2.50 by July 31.” The prediction reflects not only the asset’s market performance but also the potential market reaction to Ripple’s new regulatory initiative. Ripple’s Application for a U.S. Banking License Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license marks one of the most consequential developments for the company and XRP in recent years. If approved, Ripple would become a licensed bank in the United States, allowing it to operate directly within the regulated financial system and offer payment and settlement services without relying on third-party intermediaries. This move is widely viewed as a strategic pivot to reinforce Ripple’s legitimacy and expand its services within the traditional banking ecosystem. Regulatory approval would mean Ripple could provide its technology — and XRP itself — as a trusted component in cross-border payments. Ripple’s approach signals confidence in its ability to meet stringent regulatory requirements and demonstrates its intent to work within established frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for XRP’s Use in Cross-Border Payments One of XRP’s primary use cases is facilitating cross-border money transfers by acting as a bridge currency. With a banking license, Ripple would gain the ability to integrate its services, and by extension, XRP, much more deeply into legacy financial systems. According to analyst commentary, this integration could significantly enhance the speed, cost efficiency, and reliability of international transfers. This potential for greater adoption of XRP in mainstream financial services strengthens the fundamental case for the token. Credibility and Regulatory Oversight Strengthen XRP’s Outlook Regulatory clarity and institutional trust are key factors that could bolster investor confidence in XRP. By aligning itself more closely with regulators and becoming subject to U.S. banking oversight, Ripple demonstrates its willingness to operate transparently and within legal boundaries. As ChatGPT highlighted in its forecast, the market often reacts positively to credible institutional moves that reduce risk and enhance the asset’s appeal to conservative investors. “The combination of strong recent performance, Ripple’s institutional strategy, and improved regulatory standing supports a realistic expectation of XRP reaching $2.50 by the end of July,” ChatGPT stated.

BofA’s Global Fund Manager Survey, which polled 190 respondents overseeing $523 billion in wealth, finds that 54% of managers believe that international equities will be the best-performing asset class in the next five years, reports Investing.com. Meanwhile, 23% picked US equities, 13% had their eye on gold and 5% chose bonds. Looking closer at the equities market, BofA’s monthly survey shows that fund managers are increasing their allocation in eurozone and emerging market (EM) stocks while trimming positions in US names. Specifically, they are bullish on stocks trading in the energy and banking sectors as they move capital away from staples, utilities and healthcare. As for the US dollar, the fund managers are at their most underweight position in the American currency since 2005, as 35% say they have larger positions in other currencies. BofA chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett says, “[The] biggest summer pain trade is long the buck.” The poll also finds that “long gold” is still the most crowded trade, with 41% bullish on the precious metal. At the same time, optimism for the Magnificent 7 appears to be waning, with just 23% holding long positions. Based on the results of the June survey, BofA says the most contrarian trades include long US dollar, short gold; long US equities, short eurozone stocks and long consumer stocks, short banks.

Holders of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP are expected to pay tax on profits generated from trading the assets, a rule that has been in place for a while. Meanwhile, under the new rules , crypto traders will face fines of up to £300 if they fail to provide their personal details to the cryptocurrency service providers they use to make sure they are paying the right amounts to His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The government expects that the new crypto tax rule, which is known as the Cryptoasset Reporting Framework and would take effect from January, to raise about £315 million by April 2030. Crypto tax evaders to face fines in the United Kingdom According to the new rules, any crypto service providers that also fail to provide accurate details about transaction and tax reference numbers are expected to also face fines. James Murray MP, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, talked about the new rules. “We’re going further and faster to crack down on tax dodgers as we close the tax gap. By ensuring everyone pays their fair share, the new crypto reporting rules will make sure tax dodgers have nowhere to hide, helping raise the revenue needed to fund our nurses, police, and other vital public services,” he said. The new rule comes after Rachel Reeves, Chancellor of the Exchequer, refused to rule out the possibility of tax increases after the United Kingdom government made a U-turn on welfare reforms. The Chancellor, whose tears in the Commons spooked the financial market, said she was not going to apologize for trying to make sure that the numbers add up. “But we do need to make sure that we’re telling a story and a Labour story. We did that well in the Budget and Spending Review, we increased taxes on the wealthiest and businesses,” she said. When asked whether she was prepared to rule out further tax rises, she said it was not going to happen, because it would be “irresponsible for a Chancellor to do that.” Crypto users criticize the new tax rules The new rules, which are expected to take effect in January 2026, will see crypto traders providing certain useful and identifying details to any service provider they use to buy, sell, transfer, or exchange digital assets. The information given to the service provider will ensure each trader’s details will be linked to their tax record, making it easier for the United Kingdom government to find out how much tax they need to pay. Users need to provide information like their full name, date of birth, address, and country where they stay (if they do not live in the United Kingdom). They are also required to present their tax identification number, and in the case of businesses, the legal business name and main business address. Crypto services required to collect this information include crypto exchange applications, online marketplaces where users buy and sell NFTs and services that manage crypto portfolios for users. The new rule has generated quite a buzz among crypto traders in the United Kingdom, with one user noting that it is a win-win for the government. “So you invest what savings you managed to save and buy crypto. If they make a profit, the government tax you but if you make a loss the government aren’t going to be interested, so it’s a win-win for the government,” the user said. Another user argued that they have paid tax on everything they used to set up their small-scale mining hardware, asking the need to pay tax on the profits from her business.

While most larger-cap alts have produced insignificant gains, TON and BONK have emerged as the biggest gainers on a relatively calm Sunday morning. BTC Calm at $108K It has been a quiet period for the primary cryptocurrency. In fact, the latest major price moves came about two weeks ago – on June 23 and 24 – when it dumped to $98,000 before it soared past $105,000 a day later as the Middle East war was going rampantly. Ever since then, though, the asset has been stuck in a tight trading range between $105,000 and $110,000. It tested the lower boundary on Wednesday, where the bulls stepped up and pushed it south toward the upper one. On Thursday, BTC showed signs of a breakout attempt when it spiked to a multi-week peak of $110,500, but the bears stepped up at this point and didn’t allow a surge to a new all-time high. The landscape has been somewhat unchanged since then, as bitcoin quickly returned to $108,000 and has not moved from that level for a few days. Its market capitalization stands strong at $2.150 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at over 63% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView BONK on the Run As the graph below will demonstrate, most larger-cap alts are slightly in the green on a daily scale. Such minor increases are evident from the likes of ETH, BNB, SOL, TRX, DOGE, ADA, BCH, LINK, and XRP. In contrast, HYPE and PI have lost some traction over the past 24 hours. The biggest gainers are TON and BONK. The former has risen by over 9% and sits at $3, while the meme coin has exploded by 20% and now trades at $0.000022.

Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor’s ambitious forecast of Bitcoin reaching $21 million has reignited speculation within the crypto community, including what this could mean for XRP. Saylor’s $21 Million Bitcoin Forecast Speaking at the BTC Prague 2025 conference, Michael Saylor outlined a future scenario where Bitcoin could attain a valuation of $21 million within the next 21 years. His outlook is based on a combination of factors, including evolving global regulatory frameworks and increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Saylor emphasized that these developments could contribute to unprecedented long-term growth in the asset’s price. While his prediction focuses solely on Bitcoin, it naturally invites speculation about potential impacts on other cryptocurrencies, particularly those that tend to follow Bitcoin’s general market direction. XRP, despite operating on a different infrastructure and use case, is often influenced by the broader market trends initiated by Bitcoin. How XRP Reacts to Bitcoin Trends Historically, XRP’s price behaviour has shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s movements . When Bitcoin experiences sustained growth or decline, altcoins like XRP tend to reflect similar patterns, although not always at the same scale. For instance, downturns in Bitcoin typically coincide with broader market corrections, while Bitcoin’s recoveries frequently spark renewed momentum across other assets. Given this correlation, a hypothetical increase in Bitcoin’s price from its current level of approximately $107,000 to $21 million would represent a growth rate of approximately 19,526%. If XRP were to appreciate at the same relative rate, its future value could be projected accordingly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Value in a $21 Million Bitcoin Scenario At the time of writing, XRP is priced at $2.22 . If XRP were to follow Bitcoin’s projected trajectory and experience a similar 19,526% increase, its future price would be approximately $431 per token. This estimate is purely theoretical and assumes a direct proportional relationship between the two assets’ price movements over the coming two decades. To illustrate the potential financial implications, an investment of $10,000 in XRP at its current price would yield approximately 4,545 tokens. If the token value reached $431, this holding would be worth over $1.95 million by 2046. However, this projection is speculative and dependent on numerous variables, including market adoption, regulation, institutional participation, and overall sentiment toward digital assets. Uncertainty in Long-Term Projections While optimistic forecasts like Saylor’s attract attention and can influence investor sentiment, it is important to recognize the uncertainty inherent in such long-term predictions. There is no assurance that Bitcoin will achieve a $21 million valuation or that XRP will appreciate in direct correlation. Market dynamics, competitive technology, legal developments, and macroeconomic factors all play a significant role in shaping outcomes in the cryptocurrency space. While theoretical calculations provide interesting insights into potential returns, they should not be mistaken for guaranteed outcomes.

This move underscores Ethereum’s growing appeal as a balance sheet asset, driven by its 3–5% staking yields and deflationary design. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in the crypto market, with its presale in Phase 5 at $0.03 per token. Having raised $11,700,000 and attracted over 12,700 holders with 580 million tokens sold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling DeFi opportunity.

Over 60% of Phase 5 is filled, signaling that the window to secure tokens at this price is narrowing. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, with the token set to launch at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return on investment. Analysts project a post-launch value of $2.50 in 2025, offering a potential 83x gain. This robust tokenomics structure positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to buy now. Innovative DeFi lending solutions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche with its dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to automate lending, adjusting interest rates dynamically. This ensures stability for both lenders and borrowers. Conversely, the Peer-to-Peer model fosters direct transactions, ideal for those navigating volatile crypto prices. Users retain full asset ownership, enhancing security and flexibility. Unlike centralized platforms, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prioritizes transparency and customization. The platform’s mtTokens allow users to earn interest while maintaining liquidity, tradable within the ecosystem. Moreover, a staking module rewards long-term holders through token buybacks, making it a standout in crypto investing. Security and stablecoin development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score. No vulnerabilities were found in its smart contracts. Moreover, no incidents occurred in the past 90 days. This bolsters investor confidence in the platform’s reliability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also launching a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, offering $50,000 in rewards across four severity tiers. Additionally, its upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, built on Ethereum, promises stability against volatile crypto prices. This fully collateralized asset will streamline lending and staking, reducing depegging risks. Consequently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) strengthens its position as a top crypto in the DeFi market. Engaging community initiatives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is boosting engagement with a $100,000 MUTM giveaway , split among 10 winners, each receiving $10,000. Participants need a $50 presale investment and must submit a valid wallet address while completing all required steps. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s institutional backing, like Bit Digital’s $162.9 million raise, highlights the market’s bullish sentiment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aligns with this momentum, offering a practical DeFi solution. Rallying with Ethereum’s surge As Ethereum gains institutional traction, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a top crypto to buy now. Its presale success, with $11,700,000 raised and a secure, audited platform, positions it for significant growth. The projected $2.50 post-launch price in 2025 signals strong potential for early investors. With innovative lending, a stablecoin in development, and community-driven initiatives, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a unique opportunity in the crypto market. Investors seeking the next altcoin to rally alongside Ethereum should consider joining the presale. Act now to explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its promising DeFi ecosystem.

In a new video update, PlanB tells his 215,000 YouTube subscribers that the crypto king’s rising relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator that measures when an asset is overbought or oversold, suggests that rallies are coming over the next several months. According to the analyst, based on historical precedent, if BTC can hit an RSI of 75 on the monthly chart, a months-long “hot” FOMO bull market will follow. “We had some FOMO and disappointment last year, and that’s why this RSI average shows a little wobble here. Well, I expected [that], and actually, that’s what we’re seeing last month. It picked up the upward slope again. So I expect [BTC] to continue toward [an RSI of] 75, because if you look here in 2019, after the wobble, it returned to the former levels before the wobble. We have seen 75 RSI already three or five times, so I think we’re going to return to that level… That means if that were to happen this month in July, then July would [see BTC] end at $125,000ish… And after that, of course, I expect some really hot FOMO bull months of 80 RSI, 80+ like we’ve seen in all the bull markets. Even the lousy 2021 bull markets had five months above RSI 80. So that’s what I expect.” Source: PlanB/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $107,992 at time of writing.

Firms like Gates Industrial and Generac are already expanding their sale of specialist equipment, offering backup power generators and cooling pumps for tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft. North Carolina’s Honeywell — a well-known manufacturer of aerospace and automotive products, as well as residential, commercial, and industrial control systems — also targets the data center market with its hybrid cooling solutions. During the firm’s last earnings call, the company’s CEO, Vimal Kapur, said that the firm will prioritize data centers, given that the market is growing despite current market conditions. Industrial investments surge as AI boom drives data center infrastructure spending Companies like Caterpillar, Cummis, and Johnson Controls invested in the data center market in the early days of Trump’s tariffs , a time especially filled with uncertainty and market drops. Though the market conditions are uncertain, there are no signs of a material pullback in demand for data center construction. Chris Snyder, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, even acknowledged AI and data center market growth, “We’re seeing supersonic growth on the back of AI, and in general over the past three years, the price that you can get from the data center customer has been stronger than the price elsewhere.” In November 2024, Vertiv Holdings Co., a producer of cooling and power backup equipment for data centers, projected a 14% surge in its annual sales, up from the previous 11% estimate. At the start of the year, tech giant Microsoft pledged $80 billion to increase its data center capacity. According to President Trump, the Damac Group, a Dubai-based real estate developer, will also spend $20 billion to build data centers in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana. According to Gartner, they expect over $400 billion will be spent on data center infrastructure this fiscal year, with hyperscalers like Microsoft driving the majority—over 75%—of the projected spending. Gates and Generac have adjusted their facilities to work on data center products In the last few months, Gates Industrial, a huge player in the automotive industry, expanded into pipe and pump design, typically used in cooling servers in data centers. Mike Haen, the vice president of global product line management at Gates, even noted that they had to customize their equipment slightly to work on the data centre products. Alongside Gates, Generac is betting on the hyperscale market to revive its share price, which has fallen 75% since its 2021 peak. The company has already invested around $130 million this year in facility upgrades to support large-scale generator production aimed at meeting hyperscaler demand. Ricardo Navarro, Generac’s data center chief, seemed optimistic about the company’s pivot to data centers, believing that the hyperscale market is “almost isolated” even during economic turmoil. Earlier, Barclays Plc analyst Julian Mitchell noted that it is difficult to predict whether manufacturers in the data center industry will see a significant rise in valuation. Still, it is equally challenging to foresee a decline, given this year’s elevated spending levels. He added that, with no clear factors likely to disrupt current momentum, it’s hard to anticipate when companies might scale back their investments. So far, the data center–driven upswing in adjacent industrial sectors has fueled robust stock performance and soaring valuations for some companies, including power corporations.

Key Takeaways: Hackers stole nearly $148 million from Brazilian banks by breaching C&M Software’s systems. At least $40 million was laundered into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, according to ZachXBT. Authorities froze $50 million linked to the hack, but much of the stolen crypto remains missing. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged the laundering after tracing large sums moving through Latin American over-the-counter desks and exchanges. The attack stands as one of Brazil’s most significant financial breaches to date. Hackers Target C&M, Key Link to Brazil’s PIX Payment Network The hack targeted C&M, a key intermediary connecting smaller banks and fintechs to the Central Bank’s infrastructure, including PIX, the country’s widely used instant payments system. According to Brazilian authorities, hackers exploited credentials sold by João Nazareno Roque , a 48-year-old IT worker at C&M, who received the equivalent of $2,770 for his corporate login details. Local news outlet g1 Globo reported that Roque didn’t just sell his credentials; he also assisted in building a system to facilitate the theft, netting an additional payment of about $1,800. Using this inside access, hackers orchestrated a coordinated attack early on June 30, siphoning approximately 800 million reais, or nearly $148 million, from reserve accounts of six financial institutions. $140M HACK in Brazil – Insider Sold Access for Just $2.7K?! ZachXBT reports a $140M breach in Brazil, where an insider allegedly sold system access for only $2.7K. Around $30–40M was funneled into crypto via LatAm OTC desks. One of the biggest insider leaks in recent memory?… pic.twitter.com/ehMqjuQGCi — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) July 4, 2025 The fraudulent transfers went undetected for nearly two and a half hours. The breach only came to light when BMP, one of the affected institutions, flagged suspicious transactions. BMP’s CEO, Carlos Benitez, said his bank alone lost roughly $73.8 million but managed to recover about $29.5 million. A Brazilian court has since frozen accounts suspected of receiving stolen funds, recovering approximately $50 million so far. However, the full scope of the laundering operation remains under investigation, with significant sums still unaccounted for. Following the incident, the Central Bank suspended parts of C&M’s access to its systems as authorities worked to contain the damage. Roque was arrested on July 3, two days after the hack, and remains in custody as the investigation continues. Officials said no retail customers suffered direct losses, as the stolen funds were limited to institutional reserve balances held at the Central Bank. Crypto Networks Emerge as Escape Route for Crimes The latest breach underscores growing fears about crypto’s role as a conduit for conventional financial crimes. Digital assets offer liquidity and a level of pseudonymity that traditional cash transactions can’t match, enabling swift movement of illicit funds at scale. Stablecoins, in particular, have drawn the attention of criminal networks. The Financial Action Task Force recently warned that stablecoins pose increasing risks when used by illicit groups, especially in the absence of coordinated global oversight. Brazil’s recent heist mirrors a series of high-profile crypto-related thefts this year, including North Korea’s record $1.46 billion ByBit hack and Chinese authorities dismantling a $136 million laundering ring that used digital currencies for cross-border money flows. Nevertheless, Brazilian officials are now working to trace the stolen funds across various blockchain networks, coordinating with international agencies to freeze assets and identify those responsible for one of the nation’s largest financial cyberattacks.

XRP Price Prediction As Ripple Moves Into Banking with FCC Filing,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/best-crypto-to-buy-now-xrp-price-prediction-as-ripple-moves-into-banking-with-fcc-filing,"All eyes are on XRP right now after the recent filing of Ripple's banking application to the FCC. Considering this has happened just after Ripple's decision to p112ut an end to its standoff with the SEC, hopes have risen that XRP could make a comeback, perhaps even cross its $3 resistance in the coming days. This has given weight to the view that XRP could topple Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. Does it mean XRP is the best crypto to buy now, or does it merely hint at the arrival of investor opportunities with a variety of assets to pick from? Ripple Applying for National Bank Charter from the OCC - Brad Garlinghouse The announcement about Ripple's banking application was made by Brad Garlinghouse, who, on X, posted the news stating that this approach could put more federal oversight on Ripple, which could bolster its trust factor, transforming it into the bridge to connect traditional and decentralized financial institutions. However, that's not all, as the company has also filed for a Fed Master Account via Standard Custody. This could help Ripple to hold $RLUSD (Ripple Stablecoin) directly from the Fed and gain an additional layer of security. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 Just as expected, community reactions to the news have been positive. Some have said this is a materialization of a dream consisting of Ripple becoming a bank, which clears the way for XRP to reach $100. However, others have asked how XRP will fit into the banking license. Impact of the News on the XRP Price While investors were expecting the news to have a major impact on the XRP price, that, unfortunately, wasn't the case. The DeFi token's value is still consolidating around the $2.2 level, and whatever green candles it was able to print were corrected the next day. That said, a macro-analysis of the price chart shows that the XRP price has been following an ascending channel ever since it dropped to the $1.9 level on June 22, and there have been no signs of the price action stopping. Furthermore, since the US government has been very progressive about crypto, chances are high that Ripple's application could be approved. That could help with streamlining crypto into the traditional financial space, giving XRP much-needed long-term upside. It is also possible for the crypto to reach $3 in the coming days. Does it mean XRP is the best crypto to buy now? The answer to this could arguably be yes. However, until the DeFi crypto crosses the $2.6 mark to retest the $3 level, investors should stay cautious, since it will only take one long red candle to change the course of the XRP price action. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Smart Investor Picks During the Current Ecosystem BTC Bull Ripple's growth would consolidate the market's belief that the altcoin season has indeed arrived. However, that does not mean Bitcoin would lose any of its shine, as despite all the news about Ripple's legal qualms, the apex crypto continues to be the major driver of the cryptocurrency market. BTC Bull is a project that taps into that particular market, offering users a standard meme coin experience with a robust touch. While no long-term use cases have been mentioned by the official website, the project has continued to delight customers thanks to its social media posts as well as unique mechanics. The project has tied its token burns and Bitcoin airdrop model with Bitcoin's growth, which is a subtle way to grow alongside the apex crypto. While this move could be seen as a gimmick by many, the fact that the project has managed to raise upwards of $8 million already means there could be more to the project than meets the eye. The token is launching soon, with an application to CoinGecko already filed. Furthermore, there are many analysts already bullish about the launch, stating that BTC Bull could achieve a 1000% growth after going live on the price charts. Snorter Another crypto that could be considered one of the top offerings among crypto pre-sales is Snorter . Snorter is a meme coin powering an automated crypto trading bot that lets investors find and trade top-performing Solana cryptos. What further elevates the appeal of Snorter is the fact that it is accessible via Telegram. Being one of the leading messaging apps for crypto gives it access to a range of unique attributes. Not only is the platform easy to use, but the automated sniping tool is also equipped with all kinds of security features. In addition to the perks that come with the bot, Snorter is also very up to the mark when it comes to highlighting its memes. The main animal chosen to highlight this project, an aardvark, has been used to draw an equivalence between an aardvark's snout that it uses to fetch and Snorter's approach to sniffing the best cryptocurrency investment projects. While Snorter's connection to XRP isn't direct, the fact that XRP has the potential to become the biggest altcoin ultimately means unique projects with niche perks could gain community attention quickly. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a cryptocurrency project whose core idea is to inject utility into the Bitcoin network, and it aims to accomplish this using Bitcoin's first L2 scaling solution. The tech-related documents of the project show that developers are hard at work, trying to make it a reality. Three technologies have been implemented for this purpose: L2 scaling solution, Solana Virtual Machine, and a Canonical Bridge. The L2 scaling solution will reportedly help the Bitcoin network's transaction mechanics through off-chain aid. With the Solana Virtual Machine, developers are hoping for more DeFi applications to be built on the Bitcoin network, and with a Canonical Bridge, communications will be established between Bitcoin Hyper and Bitcoin. It is the project's simple premise that has allowed it to gain so much momentum, and in presale it has raised close to $2 million already. So, for XRP fans looking for an offbeat crypto with a strong focus on utility, Bitcoin Hyper could be a good investment. Conclusion Ripple's entry into the banking sector could lead to a major shift in the world of crypto. It could signal crypto to become more mainstream, leading to increased participation. Tokens that are still available on presale could take advantage of this situation, surging upon launch. Therefore, this ""best crypto to buy now list"" focuses on cryptocurrency ICOs. Each ICO has its own unique attribute, giving traders the opportunity to diversify their investments. And as crypto goes mainstream, these picks could yield massive gains, both in the short and the long term. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Following the recent rejection at the $110,000 price range, the maiden cryptocurrency failed to break out of a descending consolidatory channel; therefore, fears on the current status of the bull market remain intact. Amidst the current mood of uncertainty, prominent market analyst Ali Martinez has identified two important support levels in the advent of a price downturn. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To ‘Very Bullish’ — What This Means On-Chain Data Reveals Strong Bitcoin Support At $106,500 And $98,500 In an X post on July 5, Ali Martinez shares a potentially impactful on-chain insight on the Bitcoin market. Using data from the In/Out Money Around Price (IOMAP) Chart from Sentora, the analyst shares that major support zones have emerged that could play a crucial role in shaping the BTC’s short-term price direction. The IOMAP chart analyzes Bitcoin wallet addresses and the average prices at which they acquired BTC, giving insights into potential zones of buying or selling pressure. Essentially, it shows where holders are currently in profit i.e. in the money” or at a loss i.e. out of the money. From the chart, it is observed that 1.68 million addresses bought 1.28 million BTC between $104,982 and $108,190, with an average acquisition price of $106,738. Historically, such large concentrations of buying activity tend to form strong support zones, as holders may defend their positions from slipping into loss. Therefore, this development makes the $106,700 range a formidable near-term support level. A second significant support level is identified in the $95,247 to $98,566 range, where 1.7 million addresses acquired 1.25 million BTC at an average price of $96,901. Should Bitcoin lose its footing above $106,000, this lower range would act as the next major cushion, potentially absorbing downward momentum. However, a decisive price close below $96,901 would confirm significant bearish intent by the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds – Details Bitcoin Market Overview According to data from the IOMAP chart, around 89.36% of all BTC addresses are “in the money,” meaning their holdings were purchased at a lower price than the current market value. This is generally considered a bullish signal, suggesting the majority of market participants are in profit and thus less pressured to sell. Meanwhile, only 10.36% of addresses are “out of the money,” highlighting the relatively low risk of widespread panic selling, unless Bitcoin were to break below these critical levels highlighted above. At press time, the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade at $108,154 reflecting a 0.24% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, it’s daily trading volume is down by 27.09% and valued at $31.04 billion.

As of press time, TON was trading at $3.02, marking an 11% rally over the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization has also jumped from $6.7 billion to $7.43 billion in just one day, an increase of approximately $730 million. TON one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Beyond the fundamental news, Toncoin’s price chart shows possible signs of a breakout. TON has decisively moved above its seven-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $2.83 and its seven-day exponential moving average at $2.81. Meanwhile, its relative strength index ( RSI ), which had dropped to an oversold level of 38.79, is now rebounding, suggesting room for further upside. Catalyst for Toncoin rally The catalyst behind the surge is Toncoin’s announcement of a first-of-its-kind UAE residency scheme built on blockchain technology. Under the program, investors can secure UAE residency by staking $100,000 in TON for three years through a decentralized smart contract in return for a 10-year UAE Golden Visa. The initiative is designed to lock up a significant supply: if 1,000 participants join, around $100 million worth of TON could be removed from circulation. Additionally, the program offers participants an annual yield of 3–4%, encouraging long-term holding. The visa process is fast-tracked, with approvals typically expected within seven weeks. Unlike traditional programs requiring $500,000 in real estate, this initiative offers a lower entry point and extends residency to the applicant’s immediate family. Staked TON remains under user control and is fully withdrawable after three years, with an annual yield of 3–4%, subject to market conditions. Overall, the UAE–TON partnership aims to attract crypto investors and entrepreneurs seeking more accessible residency options. Meanwhile, this is another initiative that will likely help Toncoin gain mainstream attention. For instance, as reported by Finbold, in late May, TON saw increased momentum after xAI announced a partnership to bring its Grok chatbot to Telegram. Under the one-year deal, Telegram will receive $300 million in cash and equity, as well as 50% of all xAI subscription revenue generated on its platform.

Key Takeaways: Drake compares his love life to Bitcoin’s price swings in his new song What Did I Miss?. His lyrics highlight Bitcoin’s growing presence in mainstream pop culture. Global BTC adoption sits at 4% today, far below forecasts of 10% by 2030. “I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I’m up next week,” the Toronto rapper raps . This isn’t Drake’s first dance with Bitcoin. In 2022, he wagered $1 million worth of BTC on the Super Bowl, a move that grabbed headlines and underscored his willingness to engage with crypto beyond casual name-drops. Drake’s Lyrics Show Bitcoin Breaking Into Pop Culture Drake’s latest verse signals how Bitcoin continues to weave itself into mainstream culture, appearing not just in financial headlines but also in music, television, and art. As Bitcoin references pop up more often in pop culture, some see it as a sign that the digital asset is edging closer to widespread recognition. Historical forecasts from Blockware predicted Bitcoin adoption could reach 10% of the global population by 2030, comparing its trajectory to transformative technologies like electricity and the Internet. However, a recent report from River pegged current adoption at just 4%, showing that while crypto has made strides, there’s still a long road ahead. The report highlighted that adoption tends to be stronger in developed economies, where access to financial infrastructure and regulatory clarity is more robust. Meanwhile, institutional interest has continued to rise. Firms like Strategy and Metaplanet have pivoted to holding Bitcoin as a key treasury asset, aiming to guard against inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. Bitcoin ETFs and other investment products have further opened the door to retail and institutional investors, lowering barriers to exposure by removing the need for self-custody or direct onchain transactions. Bitcoin Adoption Gains Ground With Texas State Reserve Last month, Texas became the first U.S. state to establish a publicly funded Bitcoin reserve, marking a significant step toward mainstreaming digital assets at the state level. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law over the weekend, setting up a standalone Bitcoin fund overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar. Unlike previous attempts in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas’s Bitcoin reserve will operate entirely outside the state treasury, providing legal protections against routine fund reallocations. A companion bill, HB 4488, further secures the fund’s status, ensuring it remains intact regardless of future Bitcoin purchases. State Senator Charles Schwertner, the bill’s sponsor, argued that Texas should consider Bitcoin as it does land and gold, highlighting its performance over the past decade. Texas’s move comes as other states pull back from similar plans. In May, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation , joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. Likewise, Arizona’s House Bill 1025, which had advanced further than any other similar bill nationwide, was vetoed on May 3 by Governor Katie Hobbs. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve .

In his assessment on the social media platform X, Krueger argued that Bitcoin will continue to strengthen with the deflationary pressures that artificial intelligence will create in a low interest rate environment. The following statements stood out in Krueger's statement: “Reducing interest rates to 1% would give the fiat money system a 10-year breath. However, at the end of this period, artificial intelligence will come into play and create a strong deflationary effect. Bitcoin could exceed $400,000 or even $1 million much earlier and easily in this time period.” Related News: Is the Whale Behind the Movement of 8 Billion Dollars Worth of Bitcoin Hacked? It Could Be the Largest Cryptocurrency Theft in History - Coinbase Executive Speaks Out Stating that Bitcoin follows a long-term “power law” curve, Krueger argued that companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets (e.g. MicroStrategy, RIOT, MARA) are in a much stronger position than their competitors. He stated that these companies will gain serious advantages in the coming years thanks to their Bitcoin-focused strategies. For these reasons, Krueger stated that he predicts that many more companies will buy Bitcoin in the next 5 years. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. SHIB and DOGE investors go all-in on XYZVerse, eyeing a bold 1000x return and shaking up the crypto community. Influential cryptocurrency investors, previously known for significant holdings in Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, have completely redirected their portfolio into XYZVerse with eyes set on massive returns. This unexpected shift underscores a strong belief in XYZVerse’s potential, aiming for an extraordinary 1000x gain. The move has caught the crypto community’s attention, leaving many curious about what lies ahead. You might also like: Experts favor XYZVerse over HYPE, ONDO for new investors seeking under-$1 crypto XYZVerse eyes 1,000x ROI for early backers XYZVerse (XYZ), a rising entrant in the memecoin ecosystem, is carving out a distinct niche by aligning crypto culture with the high-adrenaline world of sports. Branded as a token for die-hard fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, the project is not merely capitalizing on meme appeal; it’s positioning itself as a movement for those who treat sports not as entertainment, but as identity. With an ambitious “Greatest of All Time” (G.O.A.T.) narrative at its core, XYZVerse is targeting a legacy far beyond short-lived meme frenzies. That strategy appears to be resonating: the project was recently recognized as the “ Best New Meme Project ,” a signal that its blend of sports fandom and Web3 engagement is striking a chord with the market. XYZVerse has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token; it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. Presale gains set stage for potential breakout The numbers suggest strong traction. The presale, which opened with a $0.0001 listing, has already reached $0.003333, with the next pricing tier set at $0.005 and a final presale target of $0.02. According to project estimates, XYZ will debut on centralized and decentralized exchanges with a listing price of $0.10, implying up to a 1,000x return for those who entered early. Capital inflow supports that narrative. More than $14 million has been raised to date, reflecting significant retail appetite and a growing belief in the token’s upside potential. Early investors, already benefitting from steep discounts, are eyeing major upside as the token moves through its final presale phases. While the memecoin sector remains inherently volatile, XYZVerse’s alignment with a global passion point — sports — gives it cultural gravity that few tokens in its class can claim. As the market braces for the next breakout, XYZ is aiming not just for relevance but for dominance. Dogecoin Source: TradingView Dogecoin has experienced a rollercoaster ride lately. In the past week, its price saw a modest increase of about 4%, fluctuating between $0.1552 and $0.1766. However, over the last month, the coin faced a decline of over 12%. Looking at the bigger picture, the past six months have been tough for Dogecoin, with its value dropping nearly 55%. Analyzing the current data, Dogecoin’s future direction seems uncertain. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 55.07, suggesting the coin isn’t overbought or oversold. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) stands at $0.1729, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $0.1649, indicating a potential short-term upward trend. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level of 0.0023 shows only a slight bullish momentum. Key support and resistance levels are in focus. The nearest support level is at $0.1414. If the price falls below this, it could head toward the second support at $0.1200, representing a decrease of around 15%. On the upside, the nearest resistance is at $0.1842. Breaching this could push the price toward the second resistance level of $0.2056, which would be an increase of approximately 17%. Traders are watching these levels to gauge whether Dogecoin will break out or continue its downward trend. Shiba Inu Source: TradingView Over the past week, Shiba Inu’s price showed a modest increase of 1.89%. However, over the last month, it dropped by more than 10%. The six-month view is even more significant, with a decline of over 50%. Currently, SHIB is trading between $0.00001095 and $0.00001236. The coin’s price is near its 10-day simple moving average of $0.00001200 and slightly above the 100-day average of $0.00001153. The Relative Strength Index stands at 50.34, indicating a neutral market sentiment. The MACD level is slightly positive at 0.0000001129, suggesting minimal upward momentum. For SHIB to gain ground, it needs to break past the nearest resistance level at $0.00001287. If successful, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.00001428, which is about a 15% increase from current levels. On the downside, if the price falls below the nearest support at $0.00001005, it may drop to the second support at $0.000008649, representing a decline of around 20%. Based on this data, the coin’s price could move in either direction, so monitoring these key levels is crucial. Conclusion DOGE and SHIB have been impressive, but XYZVerse offers a unique sports memecoin experience, aiming for 1,000x growth in the 2025 bull run.

Despite 90% ETF approval odds and a Wormhole partnership boosting multichain interoperability, weak trading volume and negative funding rates signal bearish pressure. A breakout above $2.22 could drive a 1.3x rally to $2.70, but failure to hold $2.00 risks a drop to $1.90. While XRP (XRP) struggles to hold its ground after slipping 4.12% last week, seasoned investors are already shifting their focus to a token that’s priced far lower but offers significantly higher upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 5 of its presale at just $0.03, is gaining serious traction as capital begins to rotate from top-heavy large caps into low-cap protocols with real-world use and scalable DeFi infrastructure. With $11.7 million raised, 12,700+ holders onboarded, and 60% of this phase’s allocation already sold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is clearly on the radar of smart capital. Borrow, Lend, and Earn—All in One Protocol What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out will be its dual lending model, allowing users to either lend into stable liquidity pools via the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system or create custom loan agreements directly through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) setups. These features will let users access borrowing or lending functionality across a wide spectrum of assets, including meme coins, stablecoins, and major altcoins. A user who lends $15,000 in USDC through the Mutuum protocol will receive mtUSDC at a 1:1 ratio—mtTokens are yield-bearing assets that increase in value as interest accrues. If the average annual yield hits 15%, that same user will earn $2,250 in passive income by year-end. For borrowers, the process is just as efficient. Someone holding $1,000 worth of ETH can use it as collateral and borrow up to 75% of its value—depending on the assigned loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for ETH—without needing to sell the asset. That means they retain full exposure to any ETH price increases while getting the liquidity they need for other opportunities or expenses. In the P2P segment, lenders and borrowers will be able to negotiate interest rates, loan terms, and repayment durations directly, with no intermediaries involved. This setup is ideal for lesser-known or more volatile assets like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Pepe (PEPE), which wouldn’t qualify for pooled liquidity but are still in high demand for lending. The result is a flexible ecosystem that caters to both conservative and risk-tolerant users—without compromising the protocol’s structural safety. Protocol Revenue, Token Burns, and Real Fundamentals Mutuum Finance (MUTM) separates itself from most early-stage altcoins by building its ecosystem around real economic activity. Every time users borrow, repay loans, or interact with lending pools through smart contracts, they generate protocol fees. These fees will be routed for dividend distributions in MUTM for mtToken stakers by strategic token buybacks from the open market. With its $0.06 listing price already locked in, Phase 5 buyers will automatically see a 2x return by launch. But projections don’t stop there. Based on current growth indicators, platform demand, and the rollout of its beta platform and Layer-2 integration, analysts are forecasting MUTM to reach between $0.12 and $0.18 by Q4 of this year. That’s a 4x to 6x return for those entering before the price jumps to $0.035 in Phase 6. The platform’s roadmap shows clearly defined development stages: beta launch at listing, followed by the release of its overcollateralized stablecoin and its Layer-2 scaling infrastructure. These aren’t just ideas—they are functional upgrades that will improve transaction speeds, cut gas fees, and open the door for broader institutional adoption. And while competitors lean heavily on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) backs its ecosystem with investor protections and third-party oversight. A $50,000 bug bounty with CertiK is live, designed to harden the platform ahead of mainnet rollout. With each step, the project continues to align investor interests with long-term protocol health. With less than half of Phase 5 supply remaining and the $100,000 MUTM giveaway drawing more participants every day, entry at the current $0.03 price is rapidly narrowing. For buyers moving out of stagnant large caps like XRP (XRP), this may be the last sub-$0.05 gem that offers real fundamentals, long-term staking rewards, and true scalability inside a DeFi protocol built to last.

The DXY witnessed a 10.8% drop in the first six months of 2025, the worst since its 14.8% decline in the first half of 1973, back when Richard Nixon was the country’s president, reports Bloomberg. The dollar dumping comes as the US money supply has exploded to a new record high. The latest data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) shows that M2, which tracks the total amount of readily available money circulating in the US financial system, stood at $21.942 trillion as of May 2025, shattering its previous peak of $21.749 trillion recorded in April 2022. Source: FRED As the amount of money surges in the country, JPMorgan’s co-head of global FX strategy, Meera Chandan, says that the second half of the year will likely not be better for the American currency. In a new episode of JPMorgan’s Making Sense podcast, Chandan expects the dollar to perform poorly against other major currencies in the coming months amid Europe’s improving fiscal outlook and America’s rising deficits and national debt. “The outlook is still bearish across the board. I think it’s going to be very hard for us to move the needle here to change our view there. I mean to put specific targets, we’ve got the euro/dollar projected to $1.20 to $1.22, dollar/CNY (Chinese yuan) 7.10 CNY, dollar/yen 140 JPY. So as you can tell, it’s still a pretty bearish view and a broad-based one at that, including for cyclical currencies such as the Aussie dollar, we’re looking for a $0.68. And the reason behind it is very much the same reasons why we turned bearish earlier in the year, which is that the US data is going to moderate, catch down to the rest of the world. You have obviously the European fiscal policy, which has turned more growth-supportive, which is helping fiscal policy outside of the US wherever possible, will turn more growth-supportive. And finally you do have the US structural issues that one does have to assign some discount to, but overall, the view is unchanged and still squarely dollar bearish.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Michael Saylor plans to burn all of his Bitcoin ( BTC ), which means he is burning your lifeboat to safety from inflation, and that helps the few, not many. Saylor’s MicroStrategy plans to increase the number of BTC it holds. The accumulation plan again raises questions about Bitcoin’s scarcity, and the questions that arise when few entities acquire such a large percentage of the supply. You might also like: Cryptocurrency’s best ideas will never launch | Opinion Saylor has said himself that he wants to hold one percent of the overall Bitcoin supply. Surely, he is looking to acquire as many BTC as possible for himself. His plan to burn his entire stash should have raised more eyebrows than it has, while also igniting a fervent debate about the implications for Bitcoin’s overall resilience. Not that it’s any of my business, but I have been thinking lately about all the reasons why Michael Saylor, as a prominent Bitcoin advocate and holder through MicroStrategy, should absolutely not, under any circumstances, destroy his Bitcoin via burning. It is like burning the lifeboats on the Titanic as it sinks Burning Bitcoin refers to the process of taking BTC out of circulation forever by sending them to inaccessible addresses that cannot be accessed or used for transactions. Saylor could use his Bitcoin to further his legacy. He could donate the funds to Bitcoin’s developers, build libraries, hospitals, public squares, and more. His name could appear on public spaces the world over. There are many technical reasons, as well, as to why Saylor should not burn his Bitcoin upon his death, but instead use them to bolster his already impressive legacy and even invest directly into Bitcoin’s future. Many BTC have already been lost permanently, as a result of lost private keys, hardware issues, and so on. It is estimated that roughly 17-23% of all BTC have been lost, including wallets thought to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, untouched since 2011. Lost BTC contributes to the asset’s scarcity. Therefore, Bitcoin is even scarcer than the 21 million hardcoded to exist. Bitcoin is a non-reproducible asset, meaning once they are sent to an irretrievable Bitcoin address, there is no getting them back. You can’t mine more Bitcoin. That’s part of the brilliance of Bitcoin, as has been covered ad nauseum heretofore by the wide-ranging voices of the so-called Bitcoin Community. Bitcoin is about resistance to centralized control, a hedge against inflation, as well as state overreach. Bitcoin is financial emancipation. Burning Bitcoin symbolically undermines the rebellion. There would be less Bitcoin to save people from inflationary hegemony. Fewer lifeboats. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is sacrosanct. It mimics gold’s natural scarcity. Saylor destroying his BTC invites speculation about further burns and damages trust in Bitcoin’s predictable issuance, and introduces arbitrariness. If Saylor were to destroy the Bitcoin, the circulating supply of Bitcoin would be reduced. This would create scarcity that could undermine Bitcoin’s monetary function. Arbitrary supply shocks don’t help Bitcoin’s case for transparency. Burning his Bitcoin erodes confidence. Saylor supports Bitcoin’s legitimacy by preserving his holdings and putting them to good use. By not destroying his Bitcoin, Saylor encourages adoption and reinforces its value, because his adoption of Bitcoin signals that the digital asset enjoys historical acceptance. Saylor holding onto his Bitcoin and then putting them to some productive use in his will inspires others to also hold Bitcoin. Saylor should ensure Bitcoin remains part of the economic order for future generations in line with Satoshi’s vision of sound money. If Saylor preserves his Bitcoin by passing it onto heirs or placing them into a trust, Saylor bolsters Bitcoin as a monetary network. Saylor could use his BTC to support its role as a bulwark against statism and an example of sound money. Burning Bitcoin weakens both Saylor’s legacy and Bitcoin at the same time. Saylor might consider letting his Bitcoin remain in the market through inheritance or charitable allocation—or otherwise—to preserve private property and economic productivity. With that said, they are Saylor’s Bitcoin, and he can do whatever he wants with them, including add them to the millions of bitcoins which have already been lost for good in the history of Bitcoin, making the coming supply crunch all the more likely, and bitcoin less likely help the greatest number of people as possible.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to ride waves of social buzz and meme-fueled volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning heads for a very different reason. The project is valued at $0.03 during phase 5 of the presale, which is over 60% sold out. Investors who purchase at this time will get 100% returns on investment as soon as the token gets listed. A total of over $11.8 million has already been raised, and over 12,700 early investors are present. When the presale is in Phase 6, the token will be priced at $0.035, reflecting a 16.67% return on any phase 5 investment. For those not just chasing hype but aiming to ride the next big cryptocurrency backed by an actual use case, Mutuum Finance could be the breakout of the season. Shiba Inu Holds Ground, But Growth Depends on More Than Just Hype Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000012 and is still holding its position among the meme coins due to the support of dedicated communities and constant updates such as Shibarium and burns of the token. Although it does not have the viral momentum it had in 2021 anymore, SHIB has become more than a hype-oriented asset. Nevertheless, its price is not growing particularly high to expect any significant break out in the nearest future without the definite move in the market. Some analysts think that SHIB may reach $0.00003 in late 2025, provided the situation in the market changes and attractiveness of this ecosystem becomes a reality. The increasing interest by investors in newer prospects such as Mutuum Finance is an indication that the overall market has reached its equilibrium as the gains of SHIB have topped out. Presale Buzz Grows: Stage 5 of Mutuum Finance Takes Off More than $11.8 million has been raised and over 12,700 investors joined the presale. This points to increased confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project and its long-term perspective.

The system is a sustainable dual-lending system that balances the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. In the P2C model, lending pools are governed by a smart contract. The system is made sensitive to real-time market conditions, a feature that makes returns to lenders more ascertainable and borrowers financially sound. The P2P model on the other hand does away with middlemen. This direct lending is especially useful with highly volatile assets like meme coins because.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) may hold meme appeal, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading with real DeFi utility. Over $11.8M raised, 12,700+ investors, and Phase 5 60% sold out, the project is gaining strong momentum. Backed by CertiK audit, dual lending, and a $100K giveaway, MUTM is the smarter 2025 play.

Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Clearer Path to Bitcoin-Level Returns,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-xrp-a-good-investment-bitcoin-solaris-presale-offers-clearer-path-to-bitcoin-level-returns/,"In the world of crypto speculation, missing out on early Bitcoin is a badge of regret many investors still wear. The longing for the “next big one” has become a running joke in trading circles. But now and then, a project steps forward that doesn’t just hype the future, it builds it. That’s exactly what’s happening with Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), and this time, it’s trending for all the right reasons. XRP’s Status: Good Project, Slower Climb Let’s be fair. XRP has weathered more storms than most coins. Between SEC battles and community doubt, it’s earned its spot as a seasoned player. It still dominates cross-border payments and has loyal institutional backing. But here’s the catch: growth feels slow, boxed in by regulation and aging infrastructure. Even the most optimistic XRP price predictions for 2025 circle modest gains. For those holding long-term, it might deliver eventually. But if you’re eyeing explosive potential like early Bitcoin, XRP simply isn’t built for that kind of sprint. Enter Bitcoin Solaris: The Clearer Path Forward Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t just echo Bitcoin’s legacy. It expands on it. By combining energy-efficient Proof-of-Work with high-speed Delegated Proof-of-Stake in a dual-layer architecture, BTC-S unlocks real scalability and real speed. The system processes over 10,000 transactions per second with two-second finality, something unheard of in Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Here’s what makes BTC-S technically and financially irresistible: Dual-layer chain for simultaneous speed and security PoW-based base layer reinforced with DPoS for high efficiency Validator rotation and adaptive difficulty that reduce centralization risks Fully programmable smart contracts designed for modern DeFi apps Power-optimized mining built for mobile devices, including the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App This is not a concept. Testnet benchmarks are in, the code is functional, and development is active. While XRP crawls through courtrooms, Bitcoin Solaris sprints through milestones. No More Barriers, Just Scalable Wealth With Bitcoin Solaris This Is Why It’s Trending Crypto influencers have taken notice. In fact, detailed reviews by content creators like Crypto Show are laying out exactly why Bitcoin Solaris is making waves. They highlight its DeFi readiness, growing community, and disruptive potential as a decentralized finance backbone. This isn’t surface-level hype; it’s a serious technical analysis that confirms what early adopters already suspect: this could be one of 2025’s defining projects. And the buzz isn’t empty. The project has passed independent reviews from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , giving added weight to its technical credibility. The Presale Path to Bitcoin-Level Wealth BTC-S is currently in phase 10 of its presale. The price is set at $10, with the next phase rising to $11 and a launch target of $20. That’s a potential 150 percent return before the project even hits major exchanges. Only around 4 weeks left until launch Over $6 million already raised 13,650+ users joined and counting One of the shortest and fastest-moving presales of the year And this isn’t just about the token price. The infrastructure is being built for long-term utility, including a Mining Power Marketplace and wallet integrations. To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using wallets like Trust Wallet or Metamask for smooth delivery. Real Wealth Through Smart Mobile Mining This is where things get exciting. Unlike traditional mining that demands expensive rigs, BTC-S allows you to mine using your phone through the upcoming Solaris Nova App. It’s a gamified, lightweight process that doesn’t drain your battery or bandwidth. Check your potential earnings using the mining calculator . This isn’t just innovative, it’s revolutionary for users in regions with low hardware access. Mobile-first mining means easier entry for everyone Real-time leaderboard features add community engagement Smart contracts ensure secure mining rewards Whether you’re at home, in a café, or commuting, mining is now possible without needing a warehouse full of GPUs. And Yes, There’s a Referral Program Too Bitcoin Solaris takes it a step further by offering a double rewards referral system during its presale. Referrers get 5 percent in BTC-S, and the person they refer gets a 5 percent bonus in tokens. It’s a rare system that benefits both sides and fuels community growth. You can grab your referral link from your dashboard, share it across platforms, and earn passively while expanding the BTC-S network. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini-games for its holders for a chance to earn daily rewards. checkout all the details here. Conclusion: This Might Be the One Bitcoin Solaris isn’t trying to mimic Bitcoin. It’s building its own future, faster, more accessible, and ready for the world of decentralized finance. From its mobile-first mining to its explosive presale momentum, BTC-S is putting real tools into real hands. XRP might still deliver on its promises in time, but if you’re looking for the kind of opportunity Bitcoin once offered, Bitcoin Solaris is where the path begins.

Phase 5 Presale of Mutuum Finance is over 60% sold out with MUTM priced at $0.03. The presale has raised over $11.8 million and attracted more than 12,700 unique holders. This is the lowest MUTM will ever be priced, with a 16.67% jump scheduled when phase 6 kicks off. As momentum around legacy tokens like Cardano (ADA) slows, this new crypto coin is igniting serious FOMO among early investors and analysts alike. Don’t Miss Phase 5 of the Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum in Phase 5 of its presale. The project stands out from others by offering real-world use case over hype. Investor interest is gaining momentum with the project having raised well over $11.8 million already and having over 12,700 token holders. Mutuum Finance introduces a non-custodial liquidity protocol in which users retain their total ownership of assets. The project features a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending to foster increased flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to deliver automated lending without any human intervention and instead, the smart contracts respond to the market by offering dynamic interest rates. Through the assistance of this auto mechanism, the world of borrowers and lenders becomes stable and predictable. Peer-to-Peer model on the other hand cuts out middlemen and thus offers a direct link between lenders and borrowers. Mutuum Finance to Launch USD-Pegged Stablecoin A fully collateralized USD-pegged stable coin on the Ethereum chain is being developed by Mutuum Finance. The stablecoin is built to withstand market volatility and avoid depeg rsisks seen with algorithmic stablecoins like TerraUST. Top blockchain security company, CertiK, has also audited the smart contracts of the project. Besides making investors confident about the integrity and transparency of the code base, the conducted audit shows that the project is serious about the design of a secure DeFi protocol. To pursue this commitment further, the project has launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The program covers four levels of vulnerabilities including critical, major, minor and low. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced a mega $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded. As the users climb the ranks they will be rewarded in bonus tokens token holding fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and bootstraps ecosystem growth in high-gear. While legacy tokens like Cardano (ADA) face fading momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly becoming the most talked-about breakout contender of 2025. With over $11.8 million raised, 12,700+ holders, and Phase 5 already over 60% sold out, MUTM is igniting real investor FOMO. Its current price of $0.03 is the lowest it will ever be, with a 16.67% increase locked in for Phase 6. Backed by a powerful dual lending model, a CertiK-audited smart contract system, and a $50K bug bounty, Mutuum is engineered for long-term utility and explosive growth.

This selling spree hasn’t collapsed the market. Instead, institutions have stepped in, absorbing even more than the whales let go. Data from 10x Research shows that institutional players, including spot Bitcoin ETFs, corporate treasuries, and asset managers, snapped up nearly 900,000 BTC during the same period. That’s a staggering shift in ownership dynamics, signalling Bitcoin’s slow evolution from a speculative trade to a structured allocation in traditional portfolios. LATEST: Bitcoin whales have dumped over 500,000 $BTC worth $50B in the past year while institutions absorbed nearly 900,000 $BTC , signaling a control shift in the Bitcoin market per Bloomberg. pic.twitter.com/qkehBgsb2G — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) July 4, 2025 Whale Sell-Off: 500,000 BTC ($50B+) Institutional Buying: 900,000 BTC ETFs’ Net Inflows (Since Jan Approval): Nearly match whale exits Interestingly, much of this churn has been silent. Instead of open-market selling, many whales are now using BTC as collateral or directly contributing it to equity-linked financial vehicles. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Identity Is Quietly Changing Bitcoin’s price action tells a quieter story. Despite bullish headlines—including crypto-friendly policy shifts under the Trump administration and treasury announcements from firms like Figma—BTC has hovered below its $110,000 peak for months. According to Edward Chin, co-founder of Parataxis Capital, many whales are not just selling—they’re restructuring their exposure. “We’re seeing whales convert BTC into equity exposure through in-kind contributions,” he notes, pointing to growing activity in crypto-to-stock financing deals. This realignment means less wild price swings and more predictable accumulation, especially as institutional investors prioritise long-term holding over short-term speculation. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: $107.8K Support on Watch The Bitcoin price prediction is neutral, as BTC is currently consolidating just above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level ($107,840) from its recent swing move. The 2-hour chart shows a low-volatility “fib squeeze,” trapped between the 50% and 61.8% levels. Price sits between key moving averages: the 50-SMA at $108,624 and the 100-SMA at $107,944.

Traders should watch the charts, but also the wallets. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Nears $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised nearly $2 million in its public presale, with $1,980,292 out of a $2,452,414 target. The token is priced at $0.01215, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction.

The indicator, which measures momentum relative to recent range, has stayed above 80 on XRP’s daily chart since June 28. Past instances in 2025 show similar setups have led to 12% to 45% price drops, averaging a 25% decline. With the same pattern forming in July, analysts anticipate a near-term pullback. Descending Triangle Adds to Downside Risk XRP’s current chart structure suggests further pressure. A descending triangle pattern has formed following XRP’s previous upward trend, with bearish projections placing support near $1.14. This marks a potential 50% drop from current levels. Crypto analyst Xanrox warns of a deeper correction tied to a multi-year ascending triangle dating back to 2017. He points to a Fair Value Gap (FVG) created during XRP’s early 2025 rally, noting that such gaps are often revisited after sharp gains. Extreme Bearish Projection Targets $0.60 Xanrox believes XRP could retrace toward the triangle’s lower trendline at $0.60, suggesting a 70% drawdown from present prices. This prediction follows XRP’s 2025 peak near $3.40. However, not all analysts are pessimistic. Mikybull Crypto envisions a symmetrical triangle setup targeting $3.70 by September, while XForceGlobal projects a range between $8 and $27 based on Fibonacci analysis.

Although there are no clear announcements from the team that could have fueled this big surge, the crowd remains positive, and analysts believe more gains are on the horizon. BONKUSD. Source: CoinGecko It was just a few weeks ago when BONK’s price struggled at $0.000012, and hope was fading rapidly. However, the tides turned in a spectacular manner in the next weeks, especially in the last few days, and BONK is now fighting with TRUMP for the spot of the fourth-largest meme coin by market cap. There are no major announcements from the team that could be the actual reason behind this impressive price surge lately. However, the one that stands out the most (but is unlikely to be related to the price pump) is aimed at owners of the Gen1 Solana Mobile device. As it reads, the team urged users to claim tokens as all unclaimed ones will be returned to the DAO for “future incentives.” ATTENTION @solanamobile Saga owners With the launch of Solana Seeker, the Gen1 Solana Mobile device has finished it’s redemption period and is officially discontinued.

Despite its recent price surge, though, the meme coin is more than 60% away from its ATH, which was tapped on November 20 at $0.00005825.

The mention appears in the song’s first verse, where Drake draws a comparison between Bitcoin’s notorious volatility and the ups and downs of public perception. “I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I’m up next week. I don’t give a fuck if you love me. I don’t give a fuck if you like me,” Drake raps, capturing the resilience often associated with Bitcoin investors who continue to hold despite market swings. Drake’s connection to Bitcoin is not new. In 2022, the artist made headlines after wagering $1 million worth of Bitcoin on the Super Bowl matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams, reflecting his early interest in the asset class. Bitcoin Finds Place in Pop Culture Bitcoin references in popular music, television, and art are becoming increasingly common, signaling the digital asset’s gradual movement toward mass adoption. Similar to how past technologies like the internet and mobile phones crossed over into culture before widespread adoption, Bitcoin’s appearance in a Drake track adds another marker to its evolving narrative. In 2022, Blockware, a Bitcoin mining hardware provider, forecasted that global Bitcoin adoption would reach 10% by 2030, modeling the growth on historical adoption curves of paradigm-shifting technologies. Meanwhile, a March 2025 report by Bitcoin financial services firm River indicated that around 4% of the global population currently holds Bitcoin, with the asset still accounting for less than 1% of its total addressable market. River’s report also highlighted that adoption rates tend to be higher in developed nations, with institutional participation playing a key role in the current cycle of Bitcoin growth. Institutional Adoption Continues to Expand The increasing presence of Bitcoin-themed investment products , such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has further removed barriers to entry for both institutional and retail investors, enabling exposure without the complexities of self-custody or onchain transactions. Corporations including Strategy and Metaplanet have transitioned into Bitcoin treasury firms , while others have opted to hold smaller allocations as a hedge against inflation, geopolitical risks, and the uncertainty that comes with global fragmentation. These institutional moves align with Bitcoin’s emergence as a financial instrument with potential to protect value while signaling confidence in the asset’s long-term role. Drake’s lyrical nod to Bitcoin may be brief, but it underlines the asset’s ongoing shift from a niche financial experiment to a symbol within global culture.

In a video recently shared on X by Edoardo Farina, Gautam Jain, Global Head of Digitisation & Client Access at Standard Chartered’s Transaction Banking division, questioned the practicality of traditional payment infrastructure. Standard Chartered is a key Ripple partner , and Jain’s comments highlighted the inadequacies of SWIFT and Standard Chartered’s work with Ripple as part of a broader push to modernize finance. SWIFT Cannot Compete With Ripple (XRP) Jain began by framing the problem in simple terms: “We live in a day of instant gratification,” he said. “You won’t wait five seconds for a web page to load. Why would you wait three days for a payment to settle?” The question effectively captures a growing frustration among institutions and individuals alike, as the demand for real-time processing continues to rise across all sectors. Singapore @Ripple & Standard Chartered Bank “You wouldn’t wait 5 seconds for a webpage to load… so why wait 3 days for a payment to settle?” “We tested two powerful use cases with @Ripple .” $XRP — Mr. Gautam Jain, Standard Chartered pic.twitter.com/pVpEN28WuU — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 3, 2025 Jain’s remarks come at a time when financial institutions worldwide are reassessing the viability of existing frameworks. Many experts believe Ripple will take SWIFT’s place through XRP, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently predicted that XRP will capture 14% of SWIFT’s market share within five years, reaffirming the company’s commitment to changing the cross-border payments landscape using XRP and through partners like Standard Chartered. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Use Case 1: Enhancing Trade Finance with TradeSafe Standard Chartered has been exploring solutions to overcome these long-standing inefficiencies. According to Jain, the bank has already tested two separate use cases in collaboration with Ripple. The first was focused on trade finance. Under the code name TradeSafe, Standard Chartered worked alongside DBS Bank, which uses Ripple’s Custody solution , and Singapore’s Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) to address the problem of duplicate invoice financing. Use Case 2: Real-Time Cross-Border Payments The second use case directly targets cross-border payments, one of the most heavily criticized areas in traditional banking. Jain explained that the initiative aimed to make international money transfers “real-time, instantaneous, with full transparency.” These are precisely the areas where SWIFT, the current industry standard, has failed to keep pace with digital expectations. Ripple’s Blockchain Advantage Ripple’s involvement signals a meaningful shift. Unlike SWIFT, Ripple uses blockchain-based infrastructure that can settle transactions in seconds with clear visibility into the transfer process. As a result, XRP has been recognized by the World Bank as the most suitable asset for cross-border payments . Ripple’s technology places XRP within the scope of potential solutions being tested by the bank, and its speed and cost efficiency make it the best option to achieve this goal.

Prices hit $110,150 on July 3 and traded a little past $108,000 level at last check, showing a small 0.41% dip in 24 hours but a 1.20% rise over seven days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Social Surge: Rising Buzz And Network Use Spark New Interest This steady move higher has drawn voices from social media, stirring debate on whether Bitcoin is truly underpriced or in danger of slipping back below key levels. Undervalued At $110K According to Altcoin Daily, Bitcoin at $110,000 is “undervalued,” with the analysts arguing there’s plenty of room to run. That bold claim has fans cheering, and some even dream of $1,000,000 down the road. Bitcoin at $110k is undervalued! [screenshot this] — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) July 3, 2025 Other users have pushed back, asking what on‑chain data or metrics back up this view. They point out that until Bitcoin clears resistance at $110,500, a real breakout isn’t confirmed. Based on reports from market trackers, global liquidity is on the rise. Market observers picked up on that, saying more cash floating around can push Bitcoin higher. Rising liquidity often fuels big moves in risk assets. Still, traders keep an eye on futures funding rates and miner sell‑pressure, looking for clues if a pullback is brewing. Global Liquidity just hit a new ATH. Bitcoin will follow! pic.twitter.com/gH1Kl2D1Zw — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) July 3, 2025 Mixed Views Online Some followers argue that inflation and new tariffs could dampen Bitcoin’s rally. Others note that central banks are still buying time before any rate hikes, which may give crypto another boost. The back‑and‑forth on social media reads like a mini war room, with short comments and deep threads floating around. Plenty of voices, but few hard answers. Past Bull Runs Altcoin Daily wasn’t shy about past calls either. Just days earlier, they said that once Bitcoin tops $150,000, investors would wish they’d bought more at lower prices. That kind of hindsight talk can be stirring, but it doesn’t change the here‑and‑now charts or the macro calendar. Exec Calls For Hedge Based on remarks by Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, now could be a good time to buy Bitcoin. Hougan pointed to Ray Dalio’s warnings about US debt, which has swelled past $7 trillion in annual spending against $5 trillion in revenue. With each household on the hook for roughly $230,000, Dalio says holding Bitcoin can act as a hedge against future money‑print risks.

The 4-hour chart displays a tightening triangle, where ETH is forming higher lows while encountering horizontal resistance at $2,558. The trendline remains intact, and the 50-period simple moving average is currently at $2,494.95. Momentum is fading. A series of doji and small-bodied candles in the yellow demand zone shows a standoff between buyers and sellers. #Ethereum Technical Update $ETH is coiling within a tight triangle above key support at $2,478. RSI flat near 50 50-SMA holding the trendline Breakout zone: $2,560 Breakdown risk: $2,478 Next move could be sharp. #ETH #CryptoTrading #Altcoins #ETHUSD pic.twitter.com/C5i9UmpUU6 — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) July 6, 2025 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also sideways at 49, with no conviction on either side. If bulls can’t hold above $2,478, ETH will visit deeper support at $2,388 and $2,320. If above $2,558, the uptrend will continue to $2,639 and beyond. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The EMA structure remains bullish, with the 50-SMA above the 100-SMA, indicating a positive medium-term outlook despite recent hesitation. ETF Momentum Adds Fuel to the Setup While the price is sideways, Ethereum’s fundamentals are strengthening. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan recently said Ethereum ETFs could see up to $10 billion in inflows by the end of 2025. So far in 2025, ETH ETFs have seen over $1.5 billion in inflows, including a record $1.17 billion in June. Hougan attributes the surge in inflows to Ethereum’s growing role in tokenised assets, such as stocks and stablecoins. As Ethereum becomes the settlement layer for regulated finance, it’s getting serious attention from traditional asset managers. And a favourable SEC ruling that crypto staking is not a securities offering opens the door for staking-enabled ETH ETFs – products that will attract institutional yield-seeking capital in the coming months. Ethereum Key Trade Setup – Watching the Triangle Edge The Ethereum price prediction is currently neutral, as the market awaits a potential breakout. This is a defined risk-reward setup for both bulls and bears. Here’s what to watch: Long Entry: Above $2,560 with volume confirmation Upside Targets: $2,639 to $2,723 Stop-Loss: Below $2,478 support Short Entry: Below $2,478 with a strong candle Downside Targets: $2,388 to $2,320 In summary, ETH is at a crossroads. The price is still range-bound, with ETF flows and staking providing the wind in its back. Above $2,560, and it could be a momentum play, but traders should be prepared to pivot; whoever gives up first will set the tone for Q3. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Nears $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised nearly $2 million in its public presale, with $1,980,292 out of a $2,452,414 target. The token is priced at $0.01215, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction.

Projects combining strong narratives with real-world tools are seeing explosive growth—and these four tokens stand out. From DeFi infrastructure to AI-powered meme ecosystems, here’s what’s rising fast. HyperLiquid: DeFi + Exchange Innovation HyperLiquid is redefining on-chain trading with a high-speed, orderbook-based decentralized exchange. Its recent surge to $37 reflects growing user adoption and liquidity depth. The project’s fusion of DeFi mechanics with centralized exchange performance is setting a new standard for speed and reliability. Investors are drawn to its ability to deliver low-latency trades in a decentralized environment. It is quickly becoming a favorite for traders seeking performance without compromise. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Utility-Infused Presale Play FloppyPepe is aiming to be the next evolution in meme-fi by merging AI tools with presale access. Its ecosystem includes FloppyAI for meme creation, Meme-o-matic for automation, and FloppyX—a DEX for meme tokens. FPPE has raised over $2.5M in presale, with bonus codes like FLOPPY100 drawing early believers. Its rapid development cycle and utility-first roadmap position it well in the meme-fi sector. Investors see FPPE as a high-upside play bridging speculative energy and real functionality. Shiba Inu: Ecosystem Expansion and Token Burn Shiba Inu is evolving beyond meme status. The rollout of Shibarium, along with consistent token burns and a growing DeFi/NFT suite, is reinforcing SHIB’s position as a serious contender in the meme coin arena. Its massive holder base gives it continued liquidity and staying power. Developers continue to expand the utility of the SHIB ecosystem with platforms like ShibaSwap. The community’s dedication to long-term value adds confidence for sustained growth. Dogecoin: Memes That Actually Move Markets Dogecoin’s strength remains its cultural relevance and organic virality. With payment integrations and X (Twitter) support rumored, DOGE is building real-world use cases. It continues to attract both whales and retail, keeping its trading volumes high. DOGE’s ease of use and mainstream familiarity give it unique adoption advantages. Despite being one of the oldest meme coins, it still evolves with market demand. Comparative Metrics Table Token Price Core Utility Market Stage Innovation Layer Community Growth HyperLiquid ~$37 DeFi + Orderbook Exchange Live Trading High-speed on-chain CEX Rapid FloppyPepe Presale Meme tools (AI, DEX, automation) Presale Creator + Meme-fi Utility Growing Fast Shiba Inu ~$0.000017 Ecosystem + Token Burn Post-launch Layer-2 & Shibarium Utility Massive Dogecoin ~$0.164 Peer-to-Peer Payments + Culture Established Social and tipping utility Consistent Which Utility Nuggets Matter Most? While hype is what starts the fire, it’s utility that keeps it burning. Tokens like HyperLiquid and FloppyPepe are offering something unique to the market beyond price speculation. Their emphasis on tooling, automation, or exchange mechanics gives investors substance to hold on to. Community size, trading volume, and token velocity are all important—but tools, user interfaces, and early access perks now play a bigger role. Projects combining hype with infrastructure are seeing better traction than those with branding alone. Combining Hype & Tech In the altcoin space, balance is everything. Dogecoin and Shiba prove that narrative power and community matter, but newer entries like FloppyPepe and HyperLiquid highlight how integrating features can turn buzz into utility. Whether you’re looking for long-term platforms or high-velocity plays, blending meme energy with tech infrastructure could define the top gainers of 2025. With retail flows heating up again, now’s the time to position across sectors with a strategic mix of hype and real-world use cases.

According to Duong, these comments, based on data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), actually point to arbitrage strategies by institutional investors. According to CFTC cash-secured fund data, leveraged funds’ ETH short positions on the CME rose from $466 million in early May to $1.6 billion as of June 24. This $1.14 billion increase is almost identical to the net $1.16 billion inflow into spot Ethereum ETFs in June. Related News: Is the Whale Behind the Movement of 8 Billion Dollars Worth of Bitcoin Hacked? It Could Be the Largest Cryptocurrency Theft in History - Coinbase Executive Speaks Out Duong said this parallel is no coincidence, arguing that the increasing institutional interest in ETH spot ETFs is triggered by the base yield difference on the CME. The yield difference between spot and futures prices, which was 6% on an annual basis in February, increased to 8%-9% in May and June. According to Duong, this situation presented an attractive opportunity for institutional investors looking to arbitrage: buying spot ETH and selling futures ETH at the same time. Ultimately, according to Duong’s analysis, the increase in short positions on CME is not a reflection of negative expectations for Ethereum, but rather institutional arbitrage activity. Therefore, the presentation of this situation as “the largest short position in history” does not reflect market reality, according to Duong. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts Point to Audit and Utility as Key Drivers,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/could-ruvi-ai-ruvi-follow-binance-coins-bnb-successful-path-analysts-point-to-audit-and-utility-as-key-drivers,"Binance Coin (BNB) rose from its modest beginnings to become a dominant player in the cryptocurrency world, thanks to its utility and unwavering adoption across Binance’s vast ecosystem. Now, analysts believe Ruvi AI (RUVI) could chart a similar path to success. Driven by a combination of transparency, utility, and early-stage accomplishments, Ruvi AI is rapidly gaining traction as one of the most exciting blockchain projects on the horizon. With $2.2 million raised, more than 180 million tokens sold, and a fast-growing investor base of 2,000+ holders, Ruvi AI is creating waves. But can it follow in Binance Coin’s footsteps? Here’s why market watchers think it might. Transparency Builds Investor Confidence Unlike many speculative tokens, Ruvi AI focuses on creating trust through robust security measures and unparalleled transparency. A third-party audit conducted by CyberScope, one of the most respected blockchain auditing firms, has confirmed the integrity and security of Ruvi AI’s smart contracts. This audit guarantees that the project is free of vulnerabilities, giving early backers peace of mind that their investment is in safe hands. Further strengthening its position, Ruvi AI has announced a partnership with WEEX Exchange. This partnership ensures post-presale liquidity, eliminating concerns about trading opportunities once the token lists. Together, these measures establish a solid foundation of reliability, making Ruvi AI a safer and more appealing option for both retail and institutional investors. Utility-Driven Momentum One of Binance Coin’s most significant achievements was its integration across the Binance ecosystem, providing undeniable utility from the start. Similarly, Ruvi AI stands out as a solution-driven project, combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) to address challenges in high-demand industries. Key Applications Driving Demand Marketing Businesses utilize Ruvi AI’s AI-powered targeting tools to optimize digital ad campaigns. These tools cut wasteful marketing expenditures while ensuring stronger returns on investment, making them a game-changer for enterprises. Entertainment Ruvi AI empowers content creators with blockchain-secured payment systems, ensuring transparency and fairness in revenue-sharing. Additionally, AI-driven insight tools help creators analyze and engage audiences more effectively. Finance By combining blockchain security with AI’s predictive capabilities, Ruvi AI delivers fraud detection tools and streamlined transaction solutions. These offerings are vital for institutions looking to establish higher levels of trust and operational efficiency. Ruvi AI’s practical applications not only attract enterprises but also establish a sustainable demand for its token, making it much more than simply a speculative crypto asset. Early-Stage Milestones Show Strong Potential Ruvi AI’s early success signals its readiness for long-term growth. Highlights from the project’s ongoing presale include: $2.2 million raised, marking financial readiness for scaling and development. Over 180 million tokens sold, reflecting strong market interest. A base of more than 2,000 holders, highlighting its growing community and adoption curve. During Phase 2 of the presale, Ruvi AI tokens are being offered at just $0.015 per token. After the presale concludes, tokens will rise to $0.07, delivering a nearly 5x ROI for early backers. Analysts predict Ruvi AI could climb as high as $1 per token post-listing, equating to a staggering 66x ROI, a level of return that could rival Binance Coin’s upward trajectory. Unlock Exclusive Returns Through VIP Tiers Ruvi AI adds even more value for early investors by offering VIP investment tiers, allowing participants to amplify their returns. Here’s what these tiers offer: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These bonuses provide an incredible opportunity for both first-time and seasoned investors to maximize returns as Ruvi AI continues its growth trajectory. Why Ruvi AI Could Follow Binance Coin’s Path Binance Coin’s rise was largely attributed to its utility and consistent adoption within its ecosystem. Ruvi AI shares a similar focus on delivering value beyond speculation. By offering audited security, real-world utility, and multi-sector functionality, Ruvi AI is laying the groundwork for exponential adoption and token growth. With a presale price of $0.015 and an expected climb to $1 per token, Ruvi AI provides a rare opportunity to get in early on a high-potential project. Its transparent operations, innovative foundation, and scalability make it a standout investment option for those seeking the next Binance Coin success story.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is exploding onto the scene with presale momentum that seasoned traders are calling unmissable. The project is priced at $0.03 at its fifth stage of presale, over 60% now sold out. Phase 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed 100% ROI gain at listing. The project has already raised over $11.8 million and brought over 12,700 investors so far. While PEPE continues to ride hype-driven waves, Mutuum Finance brings substance, positioning itself as the next big crypto with serious 25x potential. PEPE Still Rides the Meme Wave, But Momentum Shows Signs of Slowing Pepe (PEPE) remains one of the most recognizable names in the meme coin market. PEPE is trading around $0.000011. It remains a community-driven token powered largely by online enthusiasm and speculative trading. While PEPE has delivered big returns in the past its recent performance has been marked by consolidation and reduced trading volume, leading some analysts to question its staying power. Without a clear roadmap or utility layer its price action remains highly dependent on social media buzz and meme cycles. Still if market sentiment turns bullish PEPE could attempt to retest previous highs later this year. For investors looking for growth beyond hype projects like Mutuum Finance are starting to draw more serious attention. Mutuum Finance Continues to Break Record in Presale With its revolutionary two-way lending framework, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted over 12,700 investors and collected $11.8 million. MUTM price will go up to $0.035 in Phase 6. Smarter Lending Begins Here Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, delivering customers huge returns and complete control over transactions, respectively. These lending protocols deliver end-to-end hassle-free DeFi experience most appropriate to user requirements and safer, more transparent, and more configurable than the conventional centralized lending products. CertiK-Audited and Certified Mutuum Finance is turning momentum into measurable credibility. A smart contract audit by CertiK has confirmed that the codebase meets high levels of transparency and safety, giving investors and users peace of mind. To further complement its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently working on creating an Ethereum-based, fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the USD. As opposed to the algorithmic models, which can depeg, the currently developed stablecoin will be designed to bring long-term liquidity, stability, and reliability to retail and institutional users. Mutuum Finance’s $100K Giveaway and $50K Bug Bounty Program The project is already audited by CertiK and paving the way for massive adoption, and the investors who buy in today will reap big at launch. To top it all off, the platform is organizing a $100,000 giveaway , and 10 lucky participants will get $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens each. In order to further emphasize its commitment to safeguarding its platform, Mutuum Finance has introduced its official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK, offering $50,000 USDT in rewards. The program has a four-level level of severity, which is critical, major, minor, and low and no level of vulnerability is excluded but is rather well-rewarded. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is dominating July’s crypto picks with over $11.8M raised and 12,700+ investors onboard. Now in Phase 5 at $0.03, buyers lock in a 100% ROI at launch, with a projected 25x upside in 2025. Buy now before Phase 6 hits and join the $100K giveaway.

Speaking on the Coin Stories podcast on Wednesday, Miller argued that Bitcoin’s structure challenges traditional assumptions about taxation. “For them to reach their hand in there doesn’t make a ton of sense,” Miller said, emphasizing that while traditional assets depend on government systems to enforce and record property rights, Bitcoin operates independently on its blockchain. Blockchain Enforces Ownership, Not Governments Miller, an early advocate for Bitcoin , explained that the digital asset eliminates the need for the administrative infrastructure typically required to manage ownership of assets like real estate. “When you buy or sell a house, all that recordation tax, all those taxes go toward keeping track of who owns what,” he said. He argued that taxes exist to enforce property rights within society, a function that Bitcoin’s blockchain already fulfills without government intervention. “The blockchain does that property automation for itself,” Miller noted. He also pointed out that since governments did not create Bitcoin, the idea of taxing it in the same way as physical property becomes questionable. Earlier this year, rumors circulated that Eric Trump, son of former President Donald Trump, had proposed eliminating capital gains taxes on certain cryptocurrencies in the U.S. While Miller acknowledged the discussion around exempting BTC from capital gains tax , he remarked, “Whether that ultimately happens or not, who knows, but it is very cool that there is no wash sale rule on Bitcoin.” When asked whether Bitcoin could ever face property taxes similar to those imposed on real estate, Miller noted there is a “good argument” for why it should not. Tax Uncertainty Shows It’s Still Early for Bitcoin Despite Bitcoin’s growing adoption, Miller highlighted that tax uncertainties continue to hinder institutional investors. “Even as fund managers, we still have huge impediments to actually buying it because taxation rules around bad income if we buy ETFs and sell them at the wrong time, so that all needs to be worked out,” he explained. “That’s why I continue to say it is still early because the taxation rules around it are really interesting,” he added, underscoring the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding BTC. Miller IV is the son of veteran investor Bill Miller III, who in January 2022 revealed he had allocated 50% of his net worth to BTC and investments in major industry players, including Michael Saylor’s Strategy and mining firm Stronghold Digital Mining.

The blockchain-based residency program, which integrates crypto investment with immigration policy, is the first of its kind in the UAE and costs less than similar investor visas. Toncoin and the UAE have partnered to offer a 10-year residency golden visa for investors who stake $100,000 in TON. Source: TON UAE taps Toncoin for golden visa program According to information on the official site, any investor looking to capitalize on this opportunity must stake at least $100,000 in TON tokens for three years via a decentralized smart contract on the TON blockchain. Aside from the TON to be staked , investors will also have to pay a one-time $35,000 fee. The fee is required for the visa processing, which can reportedly be completed within seven weeks, which is significantly faster than the present traditional alternatives. As it stands, the program is merit-based, with candidates expected to be chosen via a selective review process. There will also be no real estate or minimum income threshold, a perk that sets it apart from traditional UAE Golden Visa pathways, known to often require over $500,000 in real estate or fixed deposits. Those who apply and get picked will receive a 10-year UAE Golden Visa, which they claim is renewable and covers spouses, children, and parents at no extra cost (only the standard government fees apply). There are also financial incentives, including allowing stakers to earn an estimated 3-4% annual percentage yield (APY) during the staking period, though the returns may vary based on TON’s market volatility. Also unlike current property-based visa programs, the staked TON tokens will remain under the investor’s control and they will have the option to fully withdraw it after the lock-in period. Other countries have launched variations of golden visa programs While Toncoin’s new partnership with the UAE to offer a golden visa is a great innovation, several countries and platforms offer similar programs that integrate cryptocurrencies. Source: TON Some accept crypto directly and indirectly in their citizenship-by-investment (CBI) or residency programs, including Vanuatu, Dominica, St. Lucia and Portugal. Compared to the Toncoin-linked golden visa, Vanuatu’s CBI program requires a minimum investment of around $130,000 for a single applicant, and it usually comes in the form of a donation to the government’s development funds. However, Vanuatu’s CBI program demands that all payments be converted to fiat if an investor pays in crypto, with verified proof of funds and due diligence done. Those who get it are guaranteed visa-free travel to over 130 countries, including the Schengen Area and the UK, as well as a tax-friendly environment with no income or capital gains tax. Dominica’s version of it has similar requirements: a minimum investment of $100,000 in the form of a donation or $200,000 in real estate . Investors must also provide documentation of crypto assets to ensure legality and availability of liquidity. The visa also provides visa-free access to over 140 countries and a crypto-friendly tax regime. The UAE’s partnership with Toincoin stands out because it offers more than free access to other countries and a crypto-friendly regime. The perks extend to family, and investors get all their staked TON back at the end of the three years. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In a new interview with Bloomberg Television, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel says that a slowdown is approaching for the Bitcoin treasury business model as the market becomes too crowded and competitive. “The problem is what happens if the Bitcoin price stays flat or starts to go down? You said his stock was up over a five-year basis by a huge amount, which is true, but if you look at year-to-date at its performance compared to Bitcoin miners, you’re starting to see that that performance is running into headwinds. In theory, a Bitcoin treasury company’s price should increase by upwards of two times whatever the Bitcoin price is increasing on a daily basis because of the leverage that they’re driving. And that’s not the case anymore. I think what we’re starting to see is a saturation of the Bitcoin treasury business market because to your point, they’re not in any other business, they’re taking over a company with a marginally profitable business and they’re turning it into an accumulator for Bitcoin. At the end of the day, you have a bunch of people competing for capital, and that capital is going to the highest return, which means the lowest multiple to NAV (net asset value), and over time, that multiple to NAV is eventually going to go to zero…” Some of the recently launched BTC treasuries include Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC , Grant Cardone’s Cardone Capital , Gamestop and Japanese hotel company MetaPlanet .

According to ABC 7 News, Tracy Jeffords received a text supposedly from the toll fees payment platform FasTrak after a journey to San Francisco. Convinced the text was genuine, the Lake County, California resident entered his debit card details to complete the payment. But a day later, Jeffords received an actual letter from FasTrak saying he owed the toll fees payment platform money. It was then that Jeffords checked his bank account only to find that more than $3,300 was missing after a purchase on eBay was made using his debit card information, according to the report. ABC 7 News cites Jeffords saying, “It made me feel terrible. And the thing is, it’s going to happen to somebody else.” The Lake County resident disputed the charge with Wells Fargo but the trillion-dollar bank has so far refused to reimburse. His attempt to dispute the charge with eBay has also proven unsuccessful. According to an expert contacted by ABC 7 News, getting reimbursed for fraudulent debit card purchases is harder than for those made using a credit card. Jeffords has nonetheless vowed to fight on to get his money back, according to the report. He tells ABC 7 News, “It’d be everything to get it back, because it’s a lot for me.

However, we decided to take a different approach this time and asked four of the biggest AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, and Gemini) about their take on the matter. 2025 Price Targets All four AI solutions seemed very coherent about XRP’s price potential this year, as Perplexity explained it: “Ripple’s (XRP) price in 2025 is broadly expected to rise significantly from current levels, with expert forecasts varying but generally bullish.” Although Ripple’s cross-border token has stalled in the past few months and is actually slightly in the red since the start of the year, all AIs had similar conclusions about its price moves until the end of the year. ChatGPT laid out three potential scenarios, with the conservative one being at $3.4, which would match the asset’s all-time (and yearly) high. The optimistic is set at $5-$6, and the “aggressive forecasts” put the token at $10-$15 by the end of the year. Google’s Gemini had similar ideas in mind, saying that “a realistic high could be in the $5-$10 range.” Perplexity also joined the $5-$10 club, which could be reached under “favorable conditions” (more on that later). Grok was slightly more specific and was the only one that said XRP can finish the year lower than its current price tag. It noted that a “realistic price range” for the asset this year is somewhere between $1.8 and $5.81. Although that’s a pretty wide range, it concluded that the most likely peak will come somewhere between $3 and $4.5. The Favorable Conditions When it came down to outlining the factors that could impact XRP’s price moves this year, the AIs were once again aligned in their answers. First, they mentioned regulatory clarity and the official conclusion of the lawsuit against the SEC. Although Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated in March that the case had been resolved and there had been several developments on the matter, the judge overseeing the case has yet to agree fully . Second, the AIs brought up institutional adoption and bullish partnerships, such as those with Santander, SBI Holdings, and others. A spot XRP ETF will also play a significant role in the asset’s price trajectory this year, if approved, said the chatbots. According to ETF experts, the current odds stand at nearly 100%. Lastly, the AI solutions highlighted the overall crypto market trends: “Bitcoin’s post-halving performance and a pro-crypto U.S. administration under President Trump could fuel bullish sentiment across the crypto market, benefiting XRP,” – answered Grok, which was similar to what the others had to say. Despite these bullish predictions for 2025, all four chatbots clarified that these are just that – speculative forecasts that might or might not come to fruition. Investors should do their own research before allocating funds to any cryptocurrency (or other asset, for that matter).

Its price soared by 120%, and its capitalization reached $18 million. Trading volumes skyrocketed; speculators rushed to buy, expecting a repeat of the Dogecoin (DOGE) story. Traders have already dubbed AP the ”Dogecoin of politics,” although Musk himself has not endorsed the coin. At the time of writing, almost the entire ranking of the most popular cryptocurrencies on DEX Screener consists of tokens related to the America Party and Musk. In the last 24 hours, the price of the America Party (AMERICA) coin on Solana (SOL) has soared by more than 12,000%. The asset’s capitalization is over $7 million. Dogecoin—Musk’s favorite memecoin—was hardly affected by the news. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of DOGE fell by 0.3% to $0.1637 over the past day. Meanwhile, the coin’s trading volume dropped by 59%. Conflict between Musk and Trump The public conflict between Musk and Trump began after the billionaire left the position of head of the Department of Government Efficiency, a role the US president created specifically for him. At the time, the media reported that Trump criticized Musk in the Oval Office. Sources claimed that tension between the two had been building since the spring of 2025, when Musk publicly opposed Trump's sweeping tax bill, calling it a ”financial disaster.” The president, in turn, accused Musk of not understanding economic strategy. The situation escalated after Musk's statement about the possible curtailment of the Dragon program, to which Trump responded by threatening to renegotiate SpaceX's contracts with NASA. A heated exchange erupted on social networks: Musk hinted at Trump's connection with Jeffrey Epstein and called for impeachment, while Trump reportedly threatened to expel Musk or his companies from the United States. To counter the Republicans, whom Musk had previously supported, the billionaire announced the formation of his own party. On Independence Day—the Fourth of July—the businessman launched a poll on X (formerly Twitter). More than 65% voted in favor of forming a party.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|DOGE|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-06 11:49:44

This token is still trading at just $0.03,https://invezz.com/news/2025/07/06/preferred-by-whales-the-next-sol-this-token-is-still-trading-at-just-0-03/,"Solana (SOL) was once overlooked at $0.60—until it surged past $250 and delivered some of the most significant gains in crypto history. Today, a new low-cap asset is beginning to spark the same type of early conviction among serious investors. That token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading at just $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale. With more than $11.7 million already raised, over 12,700 holders on board, and 60% of this phase’s allocation already gone, the window to secure an early entry is narrowing. A token that’s structurally built for growth and yield What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from other presales is its token structure. The MUTM token is more than a digital asset—it will be the engine behind the protocol’s capital cycle. A portion of Mutuum’s future protocol revenue will be used to buy MUTM on the open market and redistribute those tokens to users who stake their mtTokens in designated smart contracts. This means active participants in the ecosystem will continuously benefit from protocol activity in the form of direct rewards—linking usage, growth, and value tightly together. This dividend mechanism is expected to gain significant traction as liquidity flows into the protocol, especially as more users begin supplying assets like USDT or ETH to earn passive income. The system is also designed to apply long-term upward demand pressure on MUTM, as constant buybacks reduce circulating supply while rewarding those who continue to stake mtTokens. Importantly, MUTM does not act as a governance token, nor does it rely on deflationary gimmicks. Its strength lies in real utility—yield participation, future buybacks, and smart contract staking infrastructure—making it a rare utility-first token still available under $0.05. Given this structure, several analysts are pointing to a 3x–5x projection post-launch, with more upside to follow as platform usage scales across DeFi. Layer-2 technology, lower fees, greater adoption Beyond token utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being engineered with scalability and efficiency in mind. The development team is building the protocol on a Layer-2 infrastructure, which will provide significantly faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum (ETH) mainnet. This is a major advantage for users who want to lend, borrow, and interact with smart contracts without facing high gas costs or sluggish transaction speeds. Layer-2 integration also opens the door for higher transaction throughput, setting the foundation for Mutuum to grow into a high-volume ecosystem without running into congestion issues. Whether it’s P2C lending with automated rate adjustment or P2P deals with custom lending terms, the protocol is expected to run smoothly from launch, reinforcing long-term adoption and usability. In addition to Layer-2 performance, the roadmap includes the rollout of a beta version of the platform in tandem with the token’s listing. That means investors won’t just be holding a token—they’ll be entering a fully built lending and borrowing environment where functionality meets token value directly. The protocol is also working on a decentralized stablecoin, backed by collateral, that will be minted when loans are issued and burned upon repayment. This feature will bring stable liquidity to the ecosystem while locking more assets into the protocol. Whale moves are already catching attention. From institutional desks to long-term crypto veterans, capital is flowing into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with the expectation of both platform adoption and price appreciation. Just last week, a high-net-worth wallet migrated $75,000 from SOL and AVAX into Phase 4 and has already locked in over 20% gains—now holding for a 5x move by post-listing price targets. The next major price milestone is $0.035 in Phase 6. Once reached, investors will look back at $0.03 the same way they once looked back at SOL at $0.60—with frustration that they hesitated. The current Phase 5 is already 60% complete, and with whales now circling, retail investors are moving fast to secure their spot before the next jump. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that early conviction can be rewarded—and this time, it’s those who act at $0.03 who stand to win big.

On Thursday, Williams tweeted that XRP is “going to 20,000 per coin,” a comment that, at first glance, appeared to endorse the notion of an extraordinary price surge. However, his follow-up responses made it clear that the post was intended to be sarcastic. XRP is going to 20k a coin. — Jason Ai. Williams (@GoingParabolic) July 3, 2025 The tweet was a direct commentary on recent claims by some XRP supporters suggesting that the token could experience exponential growth, with projections reaching as high as $20,000 . While the claim might seem bullish, Williams used it to criticize what he sees as speculative and exaggerated price predictions. Clarifying the “20,000” Comment Following his initial post, Williams responded to skepticism in the comments by sharing an image that showed 20,000 Lebanese pounds converting to approximately $0.22. His caption read, “It will happen,” indicating that his earlier statement was not a price prediction in USD. Rather, he was suggesting that XRP’s value could drop dramatically, drawing a comparison to a currency that has undergone significant devaluation. This sarcastic tone was a clear attempt to highlight what he considers the unrealistic nature of recent bullish projections made by certain XRP proponents. Instead of predicting a price surge, Williams implied the opposite, that XRP might lose value, not gain it. The tweet appeared to respond directly to a theory that has recently resurfaced within the XRP community. Originally proposed in 2022 by game developer Chad Steingraber, the theory suggests that XRP could reach $20,000 per unit under a scenario of massive institutional adoption. According to Steingraber, if major financial institutions begin to use XRP for global transactions, and if private ledgers absorb much of the token’s supply, a supply shock could occur. This, combined with increased demand from wealthy investors and hedge funds, could, in theory, cause the token’s price to rise dramatically. He also claims that public access to XRP would decline to below 100 million tokens, leading to panic buying. Steingraber frames today’s retail market as only the early stage of XRP’s future use as the core of a new global financial infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skepticism Around the Valuation Critics, including Williams, challenge the plausibility of such projections. A $20,000 price point would require an XRP market capitalization that exceeds the total value of the current global financial system. With XRP’s circulating supply of over 50 billion tokens, a price of $20,000 would translate into a market cap in the hundreds of trillions or more, a figure that is widely regarded as economically unfeasible. While some XRP advocates argue that market capitalization is not the best indicator of value and may not apply to XRP’s unique use case, there remains no widely accepted financial model that supports such extreme valuations. Jason Williams’s tweet serves as a direct critique of what he views as unrealistic optimism regarding XRP’s future value. While some supporters continue to speculate about massive institutional adoption and future price spikes, Williams’s sarcastic commentary underscores the importance of grounding such discussions in economic reality. The debate reveals the growing divide between XRP’s most enthusiastic supporters and those who urge caution and critical analysis.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $110,498 but quickly lost momentum after sellers overwhelmed buyers at higher levels. As a result, the price briefly fell below $108,000 before consolidating around current levels. Analysts believe bullish sentiment could return next week and BTC could retest the $110,000-$111,000 levels. Taxing Bitcoin Does Not Make Sense: Miller Value Partners Miller Value Partners' Chief Investment Officer, Bill Miller IV, believes the government has no right to tax Bitcoin because managing ownership rights does not require administrative efforts. Miller, known for his early advocacy of Bitcoin , stated that the flagship cryptocurrency does not require government infrastructure to verify or enforce property rights, unlike traditional assets such as real estate. Miller stated during a podcast, “For them to reach their hand in there doesn’t make a ton of sense. When you buy or sell a house, all that recordation tax, all those taxes go toward keeping track of who owns what. The reality is that if you think about why you pay taxes in society, it is to enforce property rights.” He added, “The government didn’t create Bitcoin, so that is an important point to keep in mind. The blockchain does that property automation for itself, right?” Miller also believes traditional asset managers face hurdles when buying Bitcoin due to the uncertainty around taxation. “Even as fund managers, we still have huge impediments to actually buying it because taxation rules around bad income if we buy ETFs and sell them at the wrong time, so that all needs to be worked out.” New Bitcoin Treasury Firms Could Struggle A crypto analyst has sounded an alarm over the Bitcoin treasury strategy, stating that newer firms could face significant challenges. The analysts stated that the strategy may not have the longevity many expect, warning that easy upside may already be behind new companies that have recently pivoted towards a Bitcoin treasury. The analyst stated, “My instinct is that the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect. For many new entrants, it could already be over.” According to the analyst, it's already an uphill battle for new Bitcoin treasury companies who are struggling to establish themselves as investors prefer early adopters. “Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company. I think we’re already close to the ‘show me’ phase, where it will be increasingly difficult for random company X to sustain a premium and get off the ground without a serious niche.” Analysts believe that some companies are employing a Bitcoin treasury strategy to generate a quick profit without fully understanding its long-term implications or the purpose behind it. “Many of the folks raising just see easy money and have no idea what they’re doing. I think it’ll take them some time to figure out. The weak ones might be acquired at a discount by the strong ones, and the trend could still have a few more legs in it.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) price action has remained subdued over the holiday weekend. The flagship cryptocurrency encountered considerable volatility over the week, dropping to a low of $105,328 on Tuesday. The price recovered on Wednesday to reclaim $108,000 and briefly crossed $110,000 on Thursday before losing momentum. BTC’s current range extends from $98,000 to $110,000. Analysts believe bullish sentiment could return once markets open, potentially pushing the price to a new all-time high. BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, crossing $106,000 and settling at $106,137. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC crossed $107,000 and settled at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, it lost momentum on Thursday, registering a marginal decline below $107,000 to settle at $106,980. BTC recovered over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. Source: TradingView Despite the positive momentum, BTC dropped over 1% on Monday, slipping below $108,000 and settling at $107,167. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 1.33% to $105,742. Bullish sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650, ultimately registering a 0.74% rise. BTC lost momentum on Friday as sellers overwhelmed buyers. As a result, the price fell 1.42% to $108,097. BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday but is back in the red during the ongoing session, trading around $108,145 as sellers look to drive the price below $108,000.

Crypto Michael’s Chart Hints at Explosive Move,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-is-consolidation-over-crypto-michaels-chart-hints-at-explosive-move/,"XRP is trading at $2.27, up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours and more than 3% over the past week. The recent momentum follows heightened speculation from technical analyst Crypto Michael, who highlighted XRP’s long-term consolidation phase. His chart, shared on X (formerly Twitter), shows XRP compressing for seven years inside a symmetrical triangle before breaking out in late 2024—a move that sparked a 700% surge from roughly $0.60 to over $2.00. XRP has been consolidating for 7 months since it pumped 700% after breaking out of the 7-year pennant, which I predicted. It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period. The next major move will begin soon and should align with Bitcoin breaking the 8-year line. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa pic.twitter.com/GSnXsghfbW — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 15, 2025 Since then, XRP has been range-bound for seven months in what Michael describes as “healthy consolidation.” The chart identifies this post-rally phase as critical, with a white-circled zone indicating that prices are stabilising just above key resistance levels. Michael argues this consolidation phase is nearing completion. Importantly, XRP’s technical stability is unfolding while Bitcoin hovers near its own historic resistance—an 8-year trendline. Michael suggests that Bitcoin’s move above this line could serve as the macro trigger that lifts altcoins, such as XRP, into a fresh leg higher. XRP Technical Signals Hint at Bullish Breakout On the 4-hour chart, the XRP price prediction appears bullish, as XRP has reclaimed the $2.2175 level, now acting as short-term support. Price is also riding along a well-defined ascending trendline from late June, creating a pattern of higher lows. This bullish structure is reinforced by a recent bullish engulfing candle and rising Relative Strength Index (RSI), which now approaches the 60 mark but remains below overbought levels. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-SMA currently sits at $2.2175 and has been reclaimed, a positive signal for trend continuation. XRP is also reclaiming the mid-range of its prior swing, positioning it well for a breakout above $2.285. Key technical takeaways: XRP/USD trades bullish above 50-SMA and ascending trendline RSI is rising, indicating growing bullish momentum Resistance at $2.285, followed by $2.337 and $2.406 Support levels: $2.2175, $2.146, and $2.080 If XRP holds above $2.2175 and gains traction beyond $2.285, traders could see a push toward the $2.40–$2.47 range. XRP Trade Setup: Breakout Retest in Focus This setup favours breakout traders looking for confirmation and continuation. As XRP approaches $2.285 resistance, volume and candle structure will be key. Entry (Long): $2.27–$2.29 on strong breakout close Targets: $2.337 to $2.406 Stop-Loss: Below $2.21 to manage downside With RSI rising, price above trendline support, and consolidation nearing its end, XRP appears well-positioned for a decisive move—especially if Bitcoin breaks its own resistance in tandem. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Nears $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised nearly $2 million in its public presale, with $1,980,292 out of a $2,452,414 target. The token is priced at $0.01215, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction. The post XRP Price Prediction: Is Consolidation Over?

The upside might still be there, but getting meaningful returns requires capital that’s out of reach for the average trader. That’s why attention is rapidly shifting toward early-stage tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently priced at just $0.03. It’s a strategic entry point for those looking to turn modest capital into something far more significant—just as early Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum investors once did. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now deep into Phase 5 of its presale, having already raised over $11.7 million from more than 12,700 individual wallets. Over 60% of the tokens allocated for this round have been snapped up. What makes this project stand out is not just its low entry price, but the layered financial utility built into its ecosystem—especially through its mtTokens. One trader who moved $3,500 from Bitcoin (BTC) into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) last month now holds over $5,400 in unrealized gains. That kind of growth, in just weeks, shows why smart capital is now rotating from high-cap legacy coins into more targeted, function-driven DeFi protocols. mtTokens deliver passive yield while expanding liquidity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has engineered a unique mechanism to support long-term investor gains through mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens issued when users deposit assets into the protocol’s peer-to-contract (P2C) lending pools. These tokens are designed to grow in value automatically as interest accrues. There’s no need to claim rewards or actively reinvest; the mtTokens themselves reflect both the principal and the interest. What separates this system from standard yield platforms is the dual-layered benefit. First, users who deposit stable assets like USDT or top-tier coins like ETH or BTC are issued mtTokens on a 1:1 basis. Over time, these tokens increase in value as lending activity rises. Second, those same mtTokens can be staked in smart contracts to earn a share of the protocol’s revenue, which is used to buy back and distribute MUTM tokens to mtToken stakers. This creates a powerful flywheel effect. More users enter the system to earn yield. That demand drives up borrowing volume, which boosts protocol revenue. The system then recycles that income to reward long-term holders, applying buying pressure to MUTM and incentivizing staking. This structure is what separates utility tokens from hype coins—and why large holders are entering early with confidence. Stablecoin architecture unlocks additional value layers While many projects launch without foundational utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized, crypto-backed stablecoin system. This stablecoin will only be minted when users post approved collateral like ETH, and it will be burned as soon as loans are repaid or liquidated. Only verified issuers will be able to mint the coin, each with a strict cap to prevent excessive risk. The protocol will adjust interest rates dynamically to keep the stablecoin close to its $1 peg. If the price rises above $1, rates will drop. If it falls below, rates will climb. Arbitrage incentives will further reinforce stability, ensuring the asset maintains its target price. The introduction of this stablecoin will not only enhance user functionality but also support broader treasury utility across the platform. Mutuum’s approach offers direct benefits to those who understand the value of structured lending and borrowing. For example, users who deposit $15,000 in DAI will receive mtDAI, which compounds as interest builds over time. If pool utilization drives the APY to around 10%, that user would earn $1,500 over a year without moving their position. And since mtTokens can be staked for extra dividends, yield potential multiplies without added complexity. With over 4 billion MUTM tokens in total supply and a Phase 11 listing price set at $0.06, the upside from today’s $0.03 level is already tangible. Investors entering now double their position value right at the exchange listing. And with real protocol usage on the horizon—including a beta platform release alongside token launch—the stage is set for accelerated growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not aiming to be just another DeFi token—it’s building a complete infrastructure. With CertiK audit backing, a $50,000 bug bounty in place, and Layer-2 integration under development, the foundations are in motion to support serious on-chain activity. When SHIB moved from $0.000001 to $0.00008, most ignored it early. When BNB was $0.10, few thought it was worth the risk. Now, with Bitcoin (BTC) priced out of reach for most, investors are hunting for the next asymmetric bet. At just $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be that bet.

47627764,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=784218,1751805012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/47627764.jpeg,"Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-must-hold-106000-and-98000-to-avoid-breakdown/,"Bitcoin is currently holding just above the $108,000 level and bulls are maintaining momentum after a volatile start to July. However, a closer look at on-chain data shows how fragile that position might be. Interestingly, two support levels, $106,738 and $98,566, are now the most important zones for bulls to defend. These levels represent clusters of addresses holding large amounts of Bitcoin, and losing them could trigger a deeper correction. Related Reading: XRP’s Time Is Now, Says Pundit—Don’t Snooze On The ‘Biggest Transfer Of Wealth’ Bitcoin’s Support Clusters Around $106,000 And $98,000 Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to two major support levels based on data showing Bitcoin’s purchase clusters. This data is based on Sentora’s (previously IntoTheBlock) In/Out of the Money Around Price metric among addresses that bought Bitcoin close to the current price. As shown by the metric, the most important current zones of purchase are at $106,738 and $98,566. These two zones are where massive buying activity has occurred in the past few weeks, and they could act as support in case of a Bitcoin price crash. The first zone, between $104,982 and $108,190, contains 1.68 million addresses with a total volume of 1.28 million BTC at an average price of $106,738. Below the first zone, a larger group of 1.71 million addresses holds a greater volume of 1.25 million BTC within the price range of $95,248 to $98,566, with an average price of $98,566. As long as Bitcoin continues to trade above these levels, the ongoing rally could continue to push upward. However, if these pockets of demand are broken with enough selling pressure, the leading cryptocurrency could enter into an uncertain price zone with little buying interest to provide support. Speaking of selling pressure, on-chain data shows a slowing sell pressure among large holders. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Sentora, Bitcoin recorded its fifth straight week of net outflows from centralized exchanges. The past week alone saw more than $920 million worth of BTC moved into self-custody or institutional products, mostly Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Needs To Break Weekly Resistance For New Highs Even with solid demand zones beneath, Bitcoin’s path to new highs is not yet confirmed. Analyst Rekt Capital weighed in with his analysis, noting that Bitcoin is currently facing a strong weekly resistance band just under $109,000. Particularly, Bitcoin is at risk of a lower high structure on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart. Rekt Capital noted that a weekly close above the red horizontal resistance line must be achieved in order for Bitcoin to reclaim a more bullish stance. That resistance, which is currently around $108,890, is acting as a ceiling for Bitcoin’s upward rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Social Surge: Rising Buzz And Network Use Spark New Interest As such, Bitcoin would need to make a weekly close above $108,890 to position itself for new all-time highs. Unless there is a convincing break of that level, the price action of Bitcoin could be erratic and susceptible to a retracement to $106,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,160.

In an X post on Friday, Arkham stated , “There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin,” providing reassurance to market participants closely watching the transaction. The transfer involved 10,000 Bitcoin at a time from eight wallets that had remained untouched since 2011, sparking curiosity across the crypto community. Arkham noted that the activity may have been driven by a technical reason, suggesting the Bitcoin owner could be upgrading from legacy wallets to Native SegWit addresses for enhanced security and lower transaction fees. Wallet Upgrade May Explain Whale Activity: Arkham “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses,” Arkham explained. The firm detailed that the Bitcoin was originally deposited into these wallets on either April 2 or May 4, 2011, and remained dormant for over 14 years before being moved to eight new wallets, where the funds have since stayed. While there is no evidence suggesting an imminent market impact, blockchain research firm 10x Research noted that its analysis has long indicated early Bitcoin holders may gradually offload their holdings to meet the demand from ETFs and corporate treasuries. However, it remains unclear if the current transfers are part of such activity. The event also drew commentary from prominent industry figures. PlanB, a well-known Bitcoiner, recently revealed in February that he converted all his Bitcoin holdings into spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing convenience and peace of mind. Speculation and Reactions from Industry Leaders While most interpretations of the whale transfer remain technical, Coinbase’s head of product, Conor Grogan, floated a cautious note, stating there is a slim possibility the massive movement could have resulted from a hack . “If true (again, I’m speculating on straws here), this would be by far the largest heist in human history,” Grogan commented. The unusual transfer caught the attention of former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who took a lighthearted approach, stating, “I got into crypto too late,” after observing the 2011 Bitcoin whales moving coins they obtained for around $0.10 each. Despite the intrigue, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable , reflecting market confidence that the movement of these dormant funds is not an immediate threat to the current trading environment.

The unified proposal, which is a first for the growing organization that aspires to represent the Global South, will be discussed at an IMF meeting later this year that will review the current quota system. BRICS finance ministers propose changes to the IMF The finance ministers of the countries forming the BRICS bloc are calling for reforming the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a joint statement presenting their shared stance on the matter for the first time, as reported by Reuters. Introducing a new formula for distributing voting rights and ending an informal rule to appoint European management of the fund are part of the proposal, approved at a meeting preceding the BRICS Leaders Summit in Brazil on Sunday. The ministers convened in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday and agreed to support the unified position for the upcoming IMF meeting in December devoted to reviewing changes to the fund’s quota system that also determines contributions. Insisting that the new distribution mechanism should increase quotas for developing countries, the government officials from BRICS stated: “Quota realignment should reflect members’ relative positions in the global economy, while protecting the quota shares of the poorest members.” The revised formula must be weighted by economic output and purchasing power, while taking into account the relative value of currencies, the finance ministers emphasized. That should better represent low-income countries, according to a Brazilian official, quoted in the report. BRICS influence grows with membership BRICS , which was founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, held its first ministerial meeting in 2006 and its first summit in 2009, before South Africa joined the group in 2010. The organization has since added Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates as full members. In 2024, it invited Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam to participate as “partner countries,” bringing the total of nations involved to 23. “That has added diplomatic clout to the group, which aims to speak for developing nations in the Global South, urging reforms of institutions long dominated by traditional Western powers,” Reuters noted. In that context, BRICS is also proposing to put an end to a historic tradition of picking a European to head the International Monetary Fund. Its finance ministers made that clear in their statement: “With full respect to a merit-based selection process, regional representation must be enhanced for the IMF management, overcoming the anachronistic post-World War II gentlemen’s agreement that is unfit for the current world order.” Group confirms talks on NDB guarantee mechanism The document also confirmed plans to establish a new guarantee mechanism backed by the group’s New Development Bank ( NDB ), which is supposed to cut financing costs and boost investment in developing countries. The main role of the BRICS-funded NDB is to support public and private projects through loans, guarantees and other financial instruments. The Shanghai-based bank was established a decade ago and has a dozen members now, expanding its scope beyond BRICS. On Friday, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, who is also in Brazil, revealed that the financial assets of BRICS nations have surpassed $60 trillion and urged for attracting more capital, including by employing digital financial assets. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Djiwandono was quoted by the Antara news agency as stating that the BRICS’ development bank will not evolve into a dominant institution like the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. Speaking to the Indonesian media outlet in Rio, he elaborated that the BRICS approach to governance, which emphasizes equality and mutual respect among member states, sets the NDB apart from traditional global financial institutions.

While asset management companies’ increasing optimism about US stocks is drawing attention, there are warnings that this excitement could lead to overly concentrated positions and cause sharp fluctuations, especially in the event of a negative development. The most important of these risks is Donald Trump’s customs tax review process, which will end on July 9. Next week, markets are expected to have a quieter data calendar, but markets will be closely monitoring the Fed's monetary policy meeting minutes, FOMC members' speeches and Trump's steps regarding tariffs.

In a new filing shared by FTX creditor advocate Sunil, the bankrupt crypto exchange has requested that the court approve a framework for addressing claims from 49 “potentially restricted foreign jurisdictions,” which include countries where cryptocurrency is banned or subject to legal restrictions. The move, which could affect billions of dollars in expected recoveries, comes as the recovery estate continues to process distributions to customers impacted by the November 2022 crash. Over 82% of the disputed claim value reportedly comes from users in China, with other affected countries including Russia, Egypt, Morocco, North Korea, and 44 more.

If the advice is negative, claims may be permanently denied, and the associated funds forfeited. FTX stated that it would notify affected users via email or mail, providing them with at least 45 days to object. To do so, users must submit a sworn statement and waive service of process, agreeing to the jurisdiction of the U.S. bankruptcy court. You might also like: Shaquille O’Neal Cuts $1.8M Check to Close FTX Lawsuit If no objections are made by the deadline, or if an objection is resolved against the creditor, the jurisdiction may be officially designated as “restricted.” At that point, any associated claim distributions, including interest, would be forfeited and returned to the FTX Recovery Trust. Even for allowed claims, final payouts depend on whether the creditor can meet pre-distribution requirements and open an account with a court-approved distribution provider. If the jurisdiction is still restricted on the distribution date, the payout will not be made. While the filing states that FTX will hire local lawyers to assess the legality of distributions in each region and continue efforts to reduce the number of restricted jurisdictions, the proposal has already drawn criticism from many. Community response Several creditors have raised dissatisfaction with the latest update, arguing that the proposal is unjust. On X, user Nicedy called the process “deeply discriminatory and procedurally unjust,” claiming that many creditors are being excluded based solely on nationality. “We are not passive victims, nor silent bystanders,” the user wrote, urging FTX’s recovery team and legal partners to establish a fair re-review process. Echoing the frustration, another commenter called the plan “fraudulent,” saying “FTX literally plans to use the funds from these restricted regions to make up their fund deficit,” warning that collective action from excluded victims could bring “serious consequences” for the recovery team if the current plan proceeds. The latest proposal is still pending and will require approval from the bankruptcy court before it can be enforced. The FTX scandal centers on the dramatic collapse of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges in November 2022. Founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX misused billions of dollars in customer funds to cover losses at its sister trading firm, Alameda Research. The company filed for bankruptcy , leaving over a million creditors in limbo. Bankman-Fried was later convicted on multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy, marking one of the most high-profile financial crimes in recent history and shaking trust in the crypto industry.

Meanwhile, Robinhood and Deutsche Bank pushed deeper into blockchain development, Ripple secured a key payments partner, and Bitcoin treasury giants like Strategy and Metaplanet doubled down on accumulation. Here’s a roundup of the biggest developments shaking up the digital asset world this week. Satoshi-era Bitcoin wallets activate after 14 years Eight dormant wallets each transferred 10,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) to new SegWit addresses Friday. This is one of the first movements of these funds since 2011 during Bitcoin’s “Satoshi era.” The transfers totaled approximately $8.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. Additionally, a suspicious transaction involving over 10,000 Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) tokens was flagged before the massive Bitcoin movements began. Brazilian bank hack proceeds laundered through crypto ZachXBT, an on-chain analyst, claims that hackers who gained unauthorized access to the Central Bank of Brazil’s service provider have begun using cryptocurrencies to launder some of the $140 million they stole. The researcher disclosed on Friday that over-the-counter desks and cryptocurrency exchanges in Latin America have converted between $30 and $40 million of stolen cash into Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ), and USDT.

That phrase used to spark both hope and fear across crypto circles. Today, it's no longer a future threat or a bullish promise—it's just reality. The original premise of bitcoin (or crypto in general)—an asset that is censorship-resistant and doesn't answer to any traditional financial institution or government—is fading fast as Wall Street giants (as well as powerful political figures) continue to establish their strong foothold in the digital assets space. During the early years of the digital assets revolution, bitcoin was celebrated as uncorrelated and unapologetically anti-establishment. TradFi asset classes like S&P 500 would rise and fall—bitcoin didn't care. What bitcoin did care about were the flaws in the traditional financial system, which are still here to this day. A major example in BTC’s history that’s not-so-talked about anymore is the 2013 Cyprus banking crisis. The crisis, which occurred due to overexposure of banks to overleveraged local property companies and amid Europe’s debt crisis, saw deposits above 100,000 euros get a substantial haircut. In fact, 47.5% of uninsured deposits were seized. Bitcoin’s response was to move sharply upward to, for the first time in its history, cross the $1,000 threshold. After a prolonged bear market over the collapse of Mt. Gox , the idea of mass adoption grew, with Wall Street's entry into the sector seen as a stamp of validation for bitcoin as it meant more liquidity, mass adoption and price maturity. That changed everything. The price might have matured, as evidenced by waning volatility . But let’s face it—bitcoin is now just another macro-driven risk asset. ""Bitcoin, once celebrated for its low correlation to mainstream financial assets, has increasingly exhibited sensitivity to the same variables that drive equity markets over short time frames,"" said NYDIC Research in a report. In fact, the correlation is now hovering near the higher end of the historical range, according to NYDIG's calculations. ""Bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. equities remained elevated through the end of the quarter, closing at 0.48, a level near the higher end of its historical range."" Simply put, when there is blood on the street (Wall Street that is), bitcoin bleeds too. When Wall Street sneezes, bitcoin catches a cold. Even bitcoin's “digital gold” moniker is under pressure. NYDIG notes that bitcoin’s correlation to physical gold and the U.S. dollar is near zero. So much for the “hedge” argument—at least for now. Risk asset So why the shift? The answer is simple: to Wall Street, bitcoin is just another risk asset, not digital gold, which is synonymous with ""safe haven."" Investors are repricing everything from central bank policy whiplash to geopolitical tension—digital assets included. ""This persistent correlation strength with U.S. equities can largely be attributed to a series of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, the tariff turmoil and the rising number of global conflicts, which significantly influenced investor sentiment and asset repricing across markets,"" said NYDIG. And like it or not, this is here to stay—at least for a short to medium-term. As long as central bank policy, macro, and war-linked red headlines hit the tape, bitcoin will likely move in tandem with equities. ""The current correlation regime may persist as long as global risk sentiment, central bank policy, and geopolitical flashpoints remain dominant market narratives,"" NYDIG's report said. For the maxis and long-term holders, the original vision hasn't changed. Bitcoin's limited supply, borderless access, and decentralized nature remain untouched. Just don't expect them to impact price action just yet. For now, the market sees bitcoin as just another stock ticker. Just balance your trade strategies accordingly.",Markets|Bitcoin|market analysis|NYDIG|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-06 13:00:00

Key Takeaways: Mercado Bitcoin will tokenize $200M in fixed-income and equity assets on the XRP Ledger. Ripple’s move comes amid forecasts of a $19 trillion tokenized asset market by 2033. Calls for clear U.S. tokenization rules are growing as major players push into RWAs. The move will bring tokenized fixed-income and equity instruments onto XRPL, as the exchange looks to tap into the growing market for digital versions of traditional assets, according to a statement released by Ripple on Friday . “Mercado Bitcoin’s integration with the XRPL shows how public blockchain infrastructure is being trusted by institutions and is becoming a reliable foundation for bringing regulated financial products to the market,” said Silvio Pegado, Managing Director, LATAM at Ripple. Push for Tokenization Rules Gains Steam in US Market Ripple’s announcement follows a Boston Consulting Group report forecasting the tokenized RWA sector to reach a market capitalization of $19 trillion by 2033, underscoring surging interest from both crypto-native and traditional financial players. The deal highlights momentum across the industry as asset managers and blockchain firms ramp up efforts to secure regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets, especially in the United States. Earlier this week, Ondo Finance, a decentralized finance protocol, acquired Oasis Pro , a regulated trading platform specializing in digital securities settlements, to deepen its footprint in the RWA market. Meanwhile, Centrifuge, another blockchain firm focused on real-world assets, unveiled plans to tokenize the S&P 500 index, offering decentralized access to a basket of America’s top publicly listed companies. WOW! THIS IS BULLISH FOR $XRP Mercado Bitcoin is unlocking $200M+ of real-world assets on XRP Ledger No hype, just regulated yield on-chain This is LATAM’s biggest tokenization wave, and it won’t stop there When $19T goes digital, will you still be on the sidelines? pic.twitter.com/QwGoRtTBeK — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 5, 2025 The rush into tokenized RWAs has also attracted attention from the biggest names in finance. In January, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink publicly called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve tokenization of stocks and bonds , arguing it could improve market efficiency. Last week, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins told CNBC that the “rules have not been clear” when it comes to regulating digital assets in the United States and hinted at the “imminent” boom in tokenization as a whole. Atkins claimed that tokenization is “the next step” in order to have “much more efficiency” across markets. Ripple Drops Cross-Appeal Against SEC to Resolve Case Last month, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed the company will withdraw its cross-appeal against the SEC, adding that the regulator is also expected to drop its own appeal. The announcement followed a U.S. district court decision rejecting a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to reduce Ripple’s $125 million civil penalty and overturn the ruling that classified Ripple’s institutional XRP sales as securities transactions. In her ruling, Judge Analisa Torres noted Ripple’s readiness to “push the boundaries” of the earlier summary judgment, suggesting a risk of future violations. Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the firm faced a choice between dropping the appeal or continuing to contest the finding. He emphasized that regardless of the decision, “XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged,” and assured that Ripple’s business operations would continue as usual.

At the same time, a new player, XYZVerse, is preparing for a notable launch price of $0.10, with projections suggesting potential gains as high as 15,000%. These developments have caught the attention of investors eagerly watching for the next big opportunity. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $14 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333 . At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits LINKing the World: How Chainlink Transforms Smart Contracts Chainlink is a network that helps smart contracts talk to the real world. Smart contracts are like digital agreements on the blockchain, but they usually can’t access data outside their network. Chainlink solves this problem using oracles, which bring data from external sources to the blockchain. This allows smart contracts to use real-world data, like prices or events. Chainlink ensures this data is accurate by checking it through multiple sources and using a reputation system. The potential of Chainlink is huge. By connecting blockchains to real-world data, it makes smart contracts much more useful. This is important for industries like finance, insurance, and supply chains. The LINK token is key in this system. It’s used to pay for data services and rewards those who provide accurate data. In the current market, LINK stands out because it offers real utility. While many other coins are just speculative, Chainlink has a working product used by many projects. With growing interest in decentralized finance, Chainlink’s technology could be very attractive to investors. Sui: The Rising Star Simplifying Blockchain for Everyone Sui is making waves as a new blockchain platform aiming for global use. It stands out by focusing on security, power, and the ability to grow as more people use it. At its core, Sui uses a unique way of handling data and a safe programming language called Move. These tools help Sui solve common problems that other blockchains face, making it a strong base for developers and users alike. But Sui isn’t just about strong technology; it’s also about making things easy for users. It removes barriers that often make blockchain hard to interact with. With features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks, Sui makes web apps more accessible and friendly. In a market where user experience matters more than ever, Sui’s approach could give it an edge over other coins. Its focus on both tech and ease of use might make it an attractive option for those looking for promising opportunities in the ever-changing crypto world. Conclusion LINK and SUI show strong potential, but XYZVerse stands out with its unique sports memecoin, aiming for massive growth and community-driven success in the current bull market.

The firm believes the whale transferred their assets for an address upgrade. In an X post , the firm said , “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses. There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin.” Whale transferred assets due to transition to a Native SegWit address Arkham had earlier revealed that a BTC whale executed eight transfers to relocate roughly 80,000 BTC purchased years ago for just $0.78 to $3.37 per coin. However, within the first few hours of the transfer, speculation swirled about potential sell-offs and a looming crypto market crash. Crypto community members questioned the trader’s intentions, leading to a brief period of Bitcoin price consolidation. While some interpreted the transfer as a calculated effort to take advantage of Bitcoin nearing its all-time high, others viewed it as a potential ploy to sow FUD in the market before pumping their prices for greater returns. Some also believed that the trader needed to update their cold storage solution, and others went as far as to associate the move with the government. Arkham, however, suggests the eight transfers were made as a technical move to transition from a legacy wallet to a more secure and fee-efficient Native SegWit address. The firm claimed there were no signs that the whale intends to sell the assets. Nevertheless, blockchain research firm 10x Research noted that although there’s no indication that the tokens are being readied for sale, the past few months have shown early holders slowly selling into ETF and corporate treasury demand. For instance, in February, Bitcoiner PlanB disclosed that he had converted all of his Bitcoin holdings into spot Bitcoin ETFs. He argued that not dealing with keys anymore is much easier, adding, “I guess I am not a maxi anymore.” Coinbase’s Conor Grogan suggests wallet compromise The Bitcoin transfer also drew the attention of major crypto players, some weighing in on the possible cause or just giving their general opinion on the matter. For starters, Conor Grogan, Coinbase’s head of product, suggested that the $8.6 billion transfer might result from a hack, warning that if confirmed, it could represent the largest theft in crypto history. He further argued that before the assets were moved, a single BCH test transaction was done, possibly indicating that the actor was testing the private key discreetly, as BCH tends to attract less attention from whale-tracking services. On the other hand, Binance’s former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao stated that he “got into crypto too late,” citing how 14 years ago most whales bought their BTC for roughly $0.1. Some analysts hinted that Roger Ver could be the whale responsible for the transfer. They believe he made similar Bitcoin purchases in 2011 and recently bailed out of a Spanish prison on June 5. However, nothing about the whale’s identity has been confirmed. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The scammers told the recipients that their relative had died in another country and left them with a multi-million-dollar inheritance. The bad actors also told their victims that if they wanted to receive the inheritance, they would need to pay delivery fees, taxes and other bills to avoid any friction with the government. The scammers then raked in the money and never followed through on any promise. Akhimie faces 20 years behind bars after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. As stated by Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division, “The Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch will continue to pursue, prosecute and bring to justice transnational criminals responsible for defrauding US consumers, wherever they are located. This case is a testament to the critical role of international collaboration in tackling transnational crime.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

47633777,https://invezz.com/?p=2789909,1751808900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Top 2 altcoins to accumulate before July closes, one is priced at just $0.03",https://invezz.com/news/2025/07/06/top-2-altcoins-to-accumulate-before-july-closes-one-is-priced-at-just-0-03/,"With July winding down, traders are scanning for high-upside altcoins that are still reasonably priced. While Polkadot (DOT) remains on many watchlists due to its robust cross-chain vision, attention is rapidly turning toward a new DeFi project that’s picking up serious momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 5 of its presale, is priced at just $0.03 and offers an entirely different value proposition—complete with passive lending tools, tokenized interest rewards, and a developing stablecoin infrastructure. The entry window is narrowing as Phase 5 is already 60% filled, with over $11.7 million raised from 12,700 holders and growing. A small retail trader who entered Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 3, when the price was $0.02, allocated $2,000 to the presale. At that rate, they secured 100,000 MUTM tokens. Now that the presale has progressed to Phase 5 at $0.03, the paper value of their holdings has already increased to $3,000—a 50% gain before listing day. With market demand rising and over 60% of Phase 5 already sold, the same tokens will be worth $6,000 when listing hits at $0.06, delivering a clean 3x return. Rather than wait for launch to increase exposure, the trader has begun dollar-cost averaging additional capital during Phase 5 to deepen their long-term position. This strategy is aimed at capturing both the immediate 2x listing gain and the broader 6x–8x upside forecasted by analysts for the first few post-launch months. The growing use case of MUTM, the rollout of the Layer-2 upgrade, and the beta platform expected at listing have all strengthened this investor’s conviction in holding through 2025 and beyond. Passive yield without complexity: P2C lending pools One of the key innovations driving interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its P2C (peer-to-contract) lending model. This mechanism allows users to deposit stable and known assets like USDT, ETH, or BTC into pooled smart contracts. Those deposits generate real interest returns over time as borrowers take overcollateralized loans against them. Interest rates adjust dynamically based on pool usage, so when borrowing demand rises, so do yields—automatically pulling in more lenders. In exchange for deposits, users receive mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio—mtUSDT for USDT, mtETH for ETH, and so on. These tokens increase in redeemable value as interest accumulates, allowing users to track their gains without actively managing their position. The entire system is designed for a true “set-and-forget” experience. Over time, users can withdraw their assets along with earned yield, subject to available liquidity in the pool. Unlike yield farming or staking on many other platforms, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) doesn’t require complicated lockups, pairings, or third-party interfaces. Everything operates through audited smart contracts that issue real-time interest and transparent rewards. It’s a clean, non-custodial solution that provides stable APY directly from lending activity—not token inflation or hype mechanics. The real-world potential is already drawing in users who are tired of speculative coins and want consistent returns. A user depositing $5,000 in USDC into one of Mutuum’s P2C pools would receive mtUSDT in return. At an estimated APY of 15%, that position would earn $750 annually in passive income—without ever touching the principal. That kind of reliable return has become rare in today’s unpredictable DeFi landscape. Stablecoin framework adds long-term strength In addition to its lending pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch a decentralized stablecoin designed to complement its lending infrastructure. This stablecoin will be created only when users borrow against approved collateral like ETH. It will be burned once loans are repaid or liquidated, maintaining tight control over supply and supporting ecosystem stability. The interest rate charged on this stablecoin will not fluctuate freely but instead be adjusted strategically by the protocol to help the coin maintain its peg to $1. This type of rate targeting will help reduce volatility and create additional arbitrage opportunities that stabilize the token organically. Only authorized issuers will be able to mint it, each with a defined cap, further enhancing safety. This kind of structure lays the foundation for a highly secure treasury ecosystem—where every coin minted is backed by overcollateralized debt and stabilized through interest mechanics, arbitrage, and controlled issuance. Combined with the protocol’s smart contract logic and risk controls, this innovation puts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into the rare category of platforms actually building usable financial tools ahead of launch. The roadmap includes the beta release of the platform in alignment with the token’s listing phase, which will give real-time access to P2C and P2P lending, mtToken issuance, and additional components in development. The foundation for this next-gen ecosystem is already taking shape through smart contract work, bug bounty programs, and Layer-2 enhancements for scalability. At $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) still trades well below the projected listing price of $0.06, offering a built-in 2X upside before any utility or speculation is factored in. And with fewer than six phases remaining in the presale, time is running out to enter before prices rise again. Polkadot (DOT) is still a solid long-term hold, but for those hunting asymmetric upside heading into August, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a more affordable entry point with a stronger token-to-utility alignment. Don’t forget—Cardano was $0.04 before it ever touched $1. The same thing is about to happen again.

Somewhat expected, the underlying asset experienced a sudden price pump when the news came out, hitting a multi-week peak. The details from the announcement read that the $100,000 worth of TON, which will be staked for three years, will remain “fully yours” and will be available to the user after the period ends. Moreover, the team offers an estimated APY of 3-4% during this timeframe. The entire process is done “through a decentralized smart contract, fully verifiable on [the] TON blockchain.” Users need to submit their application and stake the assets, which will lead to a confirmation and review process. Toncoin’s visa issuing partner in the UAE will review the details and “guide you through the final steps.” The entire procedure should take up to seven weeks, the statement said. Future UAE residents do not need to purchase real estate ot meet income thresholds. Moreover, the visa will include their spouse, children, and parents for no extra cost (only the standard government fee applies). According to the announcement, staking TON will be significantly less expensive and time-consuming than receiving a traditional golden visa, which could take up to six months and cost over $500,000. TON’s price reacted immediately after the news started trending, and surged by double digits at one point. Consequently, the asset tapped a 19-day peak of well over $3 before it corrected slightly to $2.93 as of press time. TONUSD.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.5402 Market Cap $946.99M Trading Volume $102.26M Circulating Supply 1.75B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.5389 24-hour Low $0.5198 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.48% 50-Day SMA $0.6493 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 66 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $1.021 Optimism price analysis: TL;DR Breakdown: The MACD and OBV suggest potential for a short-term reversal. OP is stuck between $0.520 support and $0.546 resistance. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP sees mild bullish momentum amidst a broader bearish trend On the 1-day chart for July 6, OP is experiencing a mild positive divergence, which indicates some short-term upward momentum and a momentary shift in market sentiment. However, the overall trend remains negative, with the price hovering around $0.537. The PPO histogram supports the mild divergence, but it remains relatively weak, highlighting an overall bearish market sentiment. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView While a slight recovery is observed, OP’s price continues to struggle beneath the $0.546 resistance level. Unless there is a more significant momentum shift or an external market catalyst, the coin is likely to continue consolidating within a range between the $0.520 support and the $0.546 resistance. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP eyes resistance near $0.563 but faces immediate obstacles The 4-hour chart also corroborates OP’s recovery attempts from its recent dip. OP/USDT has started to form a mild upward movement, and the MACD shows signs of a potential crossover, although it’s still close to neutral. The OBV (On-Balance Volume) is showing a steady increase, which could indicate that there is some buying interest at these levels. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The immediate resistance is sitting at the $0.541-$0.563 zone, and if OP can push past this range, a test of the $0.590 area might be in play. However, without a solid move above $0.541, the price might continue to range, consolidating until clearer market trends or news emerge.

OP shows slight positive momentum with the PPO histogram at 0.63, but the overall trend remains bearish. The price is consolidating around $0.537, facing resistance at $0.546 and support at $0.520. Without a strong breakout or catalyst, OP is likely to remain range-bound in the short term. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February. OP peaked at $0.9346 in March, $0.8523 in May, $0.7478 in June, and is trading around $0.5198 to $0.5356 in July.",Crypto Price Predictions|Optimism,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|ICO|BLOCKCHAIN|OP|FORKS|MARKET|LUNA|RESEARCH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-06 13:45:25

Aave ( AAVE ) price was trading at $272 on Sunday, July 6. That’s up by 140% from its lowest level in April. This rebound has brought its market cap to $4.1 billion and its daily volume to over $250 million. On-chain metrics compiled by Nansen indicate that whales have continued to buy AAVE over the past few days. Whales have increased their holdings by 3.4% over the last 30 days to 198,535, a sign that they expect the trend to continue rising. More data from Santiment reveals that the supply of AAVE on exchanges has been in a free fall this month. It has dropped to 2.9 million, its lowest level since February 2021. It has been crashing since peaking at 4.53 million in November 2023. AAVE balances on exchanges | Source: Santiment The falling AAVE balances on exchanges is a sign that investors continue moving their tokens to self-custody. It also signals that these investors expect the price to be robust over time. You might also like: Ethereum price stalls, but ongoing accumulation points to a surge The main bullish factor for Aave is that it is the biggest player in the decentralized finance industry. DeFi Llama data shows that the total value locked has increased by 7.8% over the last 30 days to exceed $26 billion. This growth has made Aave one of the most profitable players in the DeFi space. It has generated cumulative revenues of over $233 million and $3.3 million in the last 24 hours. AAVE price technical analysis AAVE price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily timeframe chart shows that the AAVE price bottomed at $114.65 in April and then embarked on a bull run, pushing it to $323 in May. AAVE then pulled back to a low of $213 in June and has now bounced back to $273. The coin has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, a sign that bulls are in control. It has also formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. Therefore, the token is likely to experience a bullish breakout, with the initial target being $323, the highest level reached in May. A move above that level will signal further gains, potentially reaching the psychological point at $400, the highest level in 2024. The AAVE coin was created by Stani Kulechov, a Finnish entrepreneur who founded the project originally as ETHLend in 2017. In 2020, ETHLend — a decentralized peer-to-peer lending platform on Ethereum — was rebranded as Aave (which means “ghost” in Finnish). The AAVE token was introduced as part of the protocol’s transition to a more robust decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for borrowing and lending crypto assets.

Based on reports , the US Secret Service has created a cold wallet containing nearly $400 million over the last 10 years. Investigators at the agency’s Global Investigative Operations Center tracked every move on the blockchain. They used open‑source tools, old‑fashioned patience and a few missteps by scammers to follow the money back to its source. Secret Service Builds Its Crypto Trove According to a Bloomberg, the agency’s GIOC has seized coins from a string of fraud cases. One investigator noted that romance‑investment sites often show small gains before they disappear with deposits. That pattern showed up again when victims saw their balances climb by hundreds of dollars, only to find withdrawals halted and customer support gone silent. Many of those cases ended with funds frozen in one single cold‑storage wallet. Is This the End of Crypto Scams? The U.S. Secret Service just launched a global crackdown on rug pulls, phishing scams, and stolen crypto — seizing over $400M so far. They’re teaming up with 60+ countries and top exchanges to clean up the space and hunt scammers. Comment &… pic.twitter.com/TCIkyNg7n7 — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) July 6, 2025 In one example, analysts traced about $4.1 million in scam proceeds to an account tied to a Nigerian passport. A brief VPN slip revealed an IP address. That clue led British police to arrest a suspect in Guildford. An American teenager who lost $300 twice in a sextortion case also played a key role as an unwitting money mule. Online, an investigator sent a photo of a model‑looking person to hook the victim. It turned out to be an older man in Russia. Scammers will go to great lengths to mask their real identities. Hype and confusion are fueling a rise in crypto-related crime.

Kali Smith, who runs the crypto team, has trained officials in over 60 countries. Some of those nations had no idea these schemes were happening on their soil until the classes began. Law enforcement officers learned how to read domain records and follow blockchain trails. Now local agencies are shutting down scams faster than before. Industry players have chipped in too. Coinbase and Tether helped trace transactions and freeze suspect wallets in high‑profile cases. One of the largest single recoveries involved $225 million in USDT linked to romance scams. These partnerships show that a few slip‑ups by criminals can lead straight to frozen funds. Crypto Fraud Ranks At The Top Fraud involving digital coins now tops the list of US internet crime losses. Americans reported $9.3 billion stolen in crypto scams in 2024, which was more than half of the $16.6 billion lost to all internet crimes that year, according to FBI data. During the first six months of 2025, victims lost $2.50 billion to hacks, scams and exploits—already topping the $2.41 billion wiped out over all of 2024, according to reports.

47633360,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=784197,1751810403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/47633360.jpeg,Are Bitcoin Retail Traders Back In The Market? On-Chain Data Suggests So,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/are-bitcoin-retail-traders-back-in-the-market-on-chain-data/,"Bitcoin started the month of July with a convincing rally to the upside, suggesting a sustained bullish sentiment amongst investors from its performance by the end of June. The upward rally, however, cooled off following the release of positive employment data by the United States. Traders might have expected this data to be typically bullish, but that has hardly been the reality for the Bitcoin price. Nevertheless, a certain investor cohort, as shown by on-chain revelation, has decided to return to the market and bet on the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Retail Investors In, Long-Term Holders Out? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha highlighted the increasing divergence between retail and institutional behavior in the BTC market. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Taha started by pointing out that Binance Bitcoin futures Open Interest (OI) has remained below $11.5 billion. The crypto pundit explained that this price level has been acting as strong resistance, as Bitcoin traders have repeatedly closed positions near this price threshold. Interestingly, these levels are very close to the same price region around which resistance was observed on June 10th. Taha stated that this could mean the bullish momentum is beginning to wane for the flagship cryptocurrency. On another hand, short-term holders (STH), who are typically the retail traders, have increased their exposure to the market by about 382,000 BTC. This can only mean that there has been renewed retail interest in the flagship cryptocurrency. Contrary to the short-term holders’ actions, the long-term holders (LTH) reduced their holdings by an amount similar to the STH exposure. Taha explained that this could be a result of profit taking or risk management within this investor class. In essence, the retail investors are “buying the dip,” while the more experienced are seemingly reducing their risks. Bitcoin Whales Enter Distribution Phase Also supporting the conceived idea of caution in institutions and whales, Taha reported that large holders (holders with over 10,000 BTC) offloaded about 12,000 BTC on the 3rd of July. This kind of move, according to the analyst, signals potential profit taking or perhaps strategic reallocation. Besides what they might signify, large transactions tend to have a substantial impact on market dynamics, as significant amounts of BTC are involved in each trade. However, the large holders were not the only profit takers. According to Taha, mid-sized whales (those holding 1,000-10,000 BTC) also shed some of their holdings. From June 30th, approximately 14,000 BTC were sold by this class. Deducible from these transactions is the idea that the whales seem to be in their distribution phase, either because they anticipate further bearish momentum or await better positioning opportunities. If macro conditions remain favorable, the Bitcoin market could resume its bullish rally, but this ultimately falls on the renewal of larger players’ confidence. For now, the road ahead remains uncertain. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $108,152, with no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

The outlook is based on Ethereum’s long-term weekly charts, which show the asset has been consolidating in a descending triangle pattern since peaking in November 2021. Despite multiple failed attempts to break out of this structure, most recently in December 2024, the pattern of rising lows from June 2022 to April 2025 suggests mounting upward pressure, according to a TradingView analysis by Master Ananda on July 5. ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The expert noted that April 2025 marked a lower low, forming a rounded bottom structure at the $2,425 support level. While ETH briefly dipped below that level, it quickly reclaimed it, signaling strong buying pressure. This move is seen as marking the end of a long bearish phase that began in March 2024. The key resistance level to watch is around $3,068, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement , followed by the $3,800 to $4,000 range, where price could revisit previous highs. However, the real target lies at $5,791, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, expected to be reached before the end of 2025. Ananda noted that momentum could potentially carry ETH as high as $8,500. “Now, if we really want to talk about minimum because we really don’t care about worst case scenario, the fundamentals are improving and everything is getting better, consider $5,791. This would be the minimum. With the Ethereum ETFs and the 2025 bull market, we then open up $8,500 and so on,” he said. Ethereum’s key support level Meanwhile, analysis by Ted Pillows in an X post on July 6 highlighted the importance of Ethereum maintaining the $2,500 support zone. He observed that the second-ranked cryptocurrency continues to show resilience, holding firmly above this level, now viewed as a key pivot for potential upside momentum. ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In his outlook, the analyst noted that the digital currency is finding consistent buy-side interest between the $2,500 and $2,600 range. This period of consolidation follows a volatile June, during which the price briefly dipped below $2,400 before quickly recovering. Currently, the next major resistance lies near the $2,800 and $2,900 range, a supply zone ETH has struggled to break above since May. A successful retest and bounce from $2,500 could pave the way for a breakout toward those levels. Ethereum price analysis At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,522, having remained relatively stable over the past 24 hours, but was up more than 3% over the past week. ETH seven-day price chart.

In a new post on the social media platform X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas says that IBIT needs to grow its fund’s assets by less than $10 billion to rank as BlackRock’s top revenue-generating exchange-traded fund (ETF). “IBIT is now the third-highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock out of 1,197 funds, and is only $9 billion away from being #1. Just another insane stat for a 1.5-year-old (literally an infant) ETF. Here’s the top 10 list for BlackRock (aside, how about the forgettable IWF at the top spot, who knew?).” Source: Eric Balchunas/X Based on the analyst’s data, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETF is already producing an estimated revenue of $191 million per year at $76.314 billion in fund assets while charging 25 basis points annually to investors. Balchunas appears to posit that if the net assets of the fund grow by $9 billion, IBIT will produce an annual revenue of about $213 million, enough to surpass the revenue generated by IWF. BlackRock’s IWF or iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF offers exposure to US firms whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. It has been around since May 2000 and is generating $211 million in yearly revenue, charging 19 basis points per year to investors. Meanwhile, the firm’s iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) – which gives investors exposure to a broad range of equities trading in the European, Australian, Asian and Far Eastern markets – was launched in 2001 and is generating $207 million in revenue annually with an expense ratio of 0.32%.

With over $11.7 million raised, 60% of Phase 5 tokens sold, and a growing community of 12,700+ holders, many now see it as the next token with 20x potential—especially as utility meets scalability in its decentralized lending ecosystem. One SHIB whale has already entered the scene, shifting $15,000 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with the intention to ride the full presale curve through Phase 11 or beyond. At the current Phase 5 price of $0.03, this investment secures 500,000 MUTM tokens. With the listing price fixed at $0.06, that position will already double in value by launch day—locking in a guaranteed $30,000 valuation before public markets even open. However, the investor’s strategy isn’t built around short-term flips. Based on forecasts placing MUTM between $0.60 and $0.90 within 12–18 months after launch, the $15,000 stake could transform into $300,000 to $450,000. That represents a full 20x–30x gain, fueled by real lending activity, mtToken growth, staking dividends, and the introduction of Layer-2 scaling and stablecoin issuance. For this whale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents more than hype—it’s a structured DeFi asset with scalable utility and unmatched entry pricing under $0.05. Full-spectrum lending with total flexibility What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from typical presale projects is its dual lending design. At the core is a powerful peer-to-peer (P2P) system that will give users complete control. Lenders and borrowers will be able to create customizable terms and execute contracts using any supported asset—including popular tokens like DOGE and SHIB, which rarely get native support in lending protocols. This flexibility opens the gates for untapped liquidity from retail users who often sit outside traditional DeFi networks. For users who prefer simpler setups, the platform will also feature peer-to-contract (P2C) lending pools. These pools will allow lenders to deposit assets like USDT or ETH and earn automated interest through smart contracts as others borrow from the pool. In both models, loans are always overcollateralized, ensuring risk is managed tightly through on-chain logic and liquidation triggers. As users deposit into these lending systems, they receive mtTokens—such as mtETH or mtUSDT—which automatically grow in value as interest is collected from borrowers. These tokens are not just placeholders but income-generating assets. Users can also stake them in designated contracts to earn a portion of protocol revenue, creating a compound effect where deposited assets earn in two ways: through interest accrual and revenue-sharing. Massive giveaway for early believers To further boost early momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway designed to reward presale supporters. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, amplifying the incentive to participate before prices increase. With each phase, the presale rate moves higher, and with Phase 5 already past the halfway mark, the current $0.03 entry won’t last long. The stablecoin, which will be issued against overcollateralized assets, will further support platform utility and financial control. This new asset will play a key role in Mutuum’s treasury strategy by backing new lending channels, powering liquidity, and generating consistent interest revenue for the protocol. As more users mint the stablecoin by borrowing against their collateral, protocol volume is expected to surge—further enriching mtToken holders and staking participants. Those who laughed at SHIB early on eventually had to buy back in at 10× or 100× the price. At $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sits in the same sweet spot—still small enough to be overlooked, but already gaining traction from serious investors. The token’s final presale price is $0.06, and with platform rollout and exchange listing still ahead, early entries below that level will have already doubled on day one. While many eyes stay locked on large caps like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), real wealth will be made in identifying breakout stars early. With its real utility, reward-generating architecture, and wide token accessibility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving it’s not just the next SHIB—it’s the first of its kind.

Orion has jumped by 409.9% in the last 24 hours, trading at $1.25 from a low of $0.2344. This massive surge has left the traders puzzled, though the reasons behind the pump remain unclear. Adding to the mystery, the project’s official X account appears to be suspended. This makes it difficult to verify any recent announcements or developments that might explain the price movement. Despite the uncertainty, some market analysts remain optimistic about the technical setup. One crypto analyst posted on X: “ORN another nice looking chart.

In a new op-ed for Time , Jones says that while we can celebrate technological progress, there should also be consideration, or even “vigorous debate,” of the societal cost of game-changing technologies like AI. The Tudor Investment Corporation founder references a recent warning from Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, who said AI could eliminate about half of all entry level white collar jobs in the next one to five years. Even if Amodei is only half correct, Jones says such a transformation would create “unprecedented social upheaval.” “If we follow the playbook of the last 45 years where over 92% of productivity gains went to shareholders over workers, and if Amodei is even half right on his unemployment prediction, you can bet we will face unprecedented social upheaval. In the worst-case scenario, the safety-net strains that high unemployment will place on states and municipalities will force many into bankruptcy. The federal government won’t be a good backstop because with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120% it won’t have the borrowing power it once did. Bond markets will tank and take stocks with them.” The investor calls for several responses to AI, including a federal law requiring AI content to be watermarked so it’s clear it’s AI-generated. Otherwise, Jones says “humans will become irrelevant in the world we are headed for if we don’t demand human authenticity.” Jones also calls for a bipartisan commission that addresses issues of productivity sharing, as well as bilateral talks with China to “start establishing shared AI safety protocols to protect the entire world from mistakes and bad actors.” “None of this is radical. It’s rational. The unemployment data on entry-level jobs is a call to action. The first signs of the societal disruptions of AI are already here.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Amid the usual chatter around Dogecoin, one project is quietly building a real case for being the best crypto to buy in 2025, and it’s not what you’d expect. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol with real-world lending utility, is quickly turning heads as the top crypto to buy before summer ends. Currently priced at $0.03 MUTM is moving fast through its presale phase. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 60% is already sold out because of huge demand. The project is priced at $0.03, the lowest it’ll ever be before a 16.67% jump in the next stage. Over $11.8 million has been raised to date and over 12,700 investors have secured their tokens. While Dogecoin continues to enjoy community-driven support, it’s Mutuum Finance that’s emerging as a serious player. Dogecoin Holds Ground, But Growth Remains Tied to Sentiment Dogecoin (DOGE) has managed to sustain a stable position in the crypto market and the current price of the coin stands at approximately $0.17. Although DOGE still is yet to recover its old high of almost $0.73 in May 2021, it is supported by a large community. However, despite limited technical development, the price of Dogecoin is still likely to gain, especially when there is a surge in interest among retail investors. With the wider market primed for a possible breakout in the Q3, it is possible that DOGE can once again experience volatility, but most of its performance will be speculative in essence. In the meantime, grandiosely has increased among long-term investments, with utility such as Mutuum Finance. $11.8M Secured: Mutuum Finance Accelerates Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well on its path to being one of the hottest projects in DeFi. With an astonishing $11.8 million raised and over 12,700 investors already joining, the presale is gaining serious traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next round will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already determined official launch price of $0.06, early investors already enjoy a 100% profit before the token is even available for trading. Some even foresee a post-launch price bounce of more than $2.50 before the bull run of 2025 is finished. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway . 10 lucky participants will each win $10,000 in MUTM tokens. In addition the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded through the project’s leaderboard mechanism. MUTM holders will earn bonus tokens for climbing ranks and holding their positions in the top 50. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and bootstraps ecosystem growth in high-gear. Mutuum Finance Announces $50,000 Bug Bounty In order to strengthen security, Mutuum Finance has already introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program together with CertiK, rewards such that every vulnerability will be rewarded in the four stages, the first level will be critical, second-level will be the major, third level will be minor, and fourth level will be low. More than $11.8 million has been raised, over 12,700 investors have already joined, and Stage 5 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is 60% sold out, making it one of the most promising DeFi investments of 2025.

Among the best crypto coins to buy, BlockDAG is catching attention with its powerful DAG-based technology that brings unmatched speed, strong scalability, and high security. BlockDAG’s design is different from traditional blockchains. It supports fast parallel transactions with confirmations under a second, solving the usual speed issues. Its strong presale numbers and solid roadmap are setting the stage for big things. As more users turn to DeFi and dApps, BlockDAG’s potential in 2025 looks hard to ignore. 1. BlockDAG: A Fast-Rising Name Set for a Big 2025 BlockDAG stands out as one of the best crypto coins to buy in 2025. Its DAG-based system is built to process multiple transactions at once, with lightning-fast confirmation speeds. This setup handles more volume without delay, making it great for DeFi tools and dApps that need efficiency. So far, BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised $332 million, and over 23.6 billion coins have been sold. Batch 29 is now priced at $0.0276, but the GLOBAL LAUNCH release brings a limited-time price of $0.0016, available through August 11. It’s one of the best deals seen since early batches. BlockDAG’s tools, like EVM support and simple no-code contract builders, add more reasons to watch closely. Since Batch 1, some have seen a 2,660% ROI, with a public launch price planned at $0.05. Analysts are predicting possible jumps to $1 in 2025 and even $30 over time. All signs point to BlockDAG being a name to keep high on the radar. 2. Solana (SOL): Fast Tech with a Comeback Story Solana (SOL) holds its ground as one of the best crypto coins to buy, even after a -23.8% performance this year and a current price of $144.30. With a $76.7 billion market cap, it bounced back after taking a major hit from the FTX crash in 2022. Traders still believe in its future, thanks to its unique “proof-of-history” system. Solana’s real power is its speed. Blocks are created every 400 milliseconds and it handles about 3,500 transactions per second. That kind of performance makes it a top choice for people needing scalable blockchain tools. If this momentum continues, 2025 could be a huge year for Solana’s climb. 3. Stellar (XLM): Easy Access and Big Ideas Stellar (XLM) has carved out a space for itself, even with a -26.05% performance this year and a price of $0.25. Backed by a market cap of $7.72 billion, Stellar is known for its low-energy blockchain and direct peer-to-peer payments that skip the middleman. Launched in 2014, Stellar takes a different path with its friendly user setup and focus on global access. It remains an appealing pick for users who want smooth and simple transfers. Its drive for financial inclusion could help fuel a strong rebound and make it one of the best crypto coins to buy in the long run. 4. Chainlink (LINK): Smart Contract Connector on the Rise Chainlink (LINK) has faced a -35.2% slide this year, now priced at $13.37 with a $9.06 billion market cap. Even so, it remains vital in the DeFi world. LINK powers the Chainlink network and helps smart contracts link up with real-world data, making it key to running many blockchain apps. As more tools and platforms rely on data pulled from outside sources, Chainlink’s role keeps getting bigger. The price may be down now, but with DeFi expanding fast, LINK could still see strong gains ahead. Its position in this space keeps it on the list of best crypto coins to buy. Why BlockDAG Still Leads the Race BlockDAG is pushing hard to stand out among the best crypto coins to buy in 2025 . Its next-gen design and strong presale results show the momentum is real. With $332 million raised and more than 23.6 billion coins sold, it’s gaining ground fast. Early buyers have already seen major gains. Analysts expect even more value to come, pointing to BlockDAG’s growing role in changing how DeFi works. With top-level speed, scale, and a fresh approach, BlockDAG could be a game-changer for 2025.

The so-called Unprofitable 858, those money-losing names inside the Russell 300, have started driving the market’s latest high-stakes rally. The obsession with profits is gone. Investors are now throwing cash at companies with big risk, no earnings, and serious volatility. Since April 8, the day the market bottomed out, 10 of the 14 stocks that tripled on the index haven’t made a single dollar of profit. That stat came straight from Bespoke Investment Group, and it’s changing the entire conversation. Through late June, this same batch of 858 unprofitable companies delivered 36% average gains, beating profitable peers who actually generate income. Avis Budget Group, Carvana, and Aeva Technologies are three of the biggest names riding this wave. Avis has jumped 188% since April. Carvana has climbed 98%, and Aeva, a maker of lidar sensors for self-driving cars, is up 457%. This is the same type of manic rally that powered the meme-stock craze in 2021, back when cheap money and government stimulus pumped the market to extremes. Traders ditch cash flow for thrill stocks The signs are everywhere. A Goldman Sachs tracker for retail traders’ favorite stocks just hit a fresh high, the first since November 2021. That’s when speculation peaked before rate hikes started wrecking fragile plays. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said the movement isn’t rooted in fundamentals anymore. “We’re not yet seeing a full-fledged ‘flight-to-crap,’ but it is clear that the motivation behind many of these stocks’ activity is something other than disciplined considerations of discounted cash flows,” Steve said. Inside Interactive Brokers’ own trading data, the trend gets even more insane. Traders have been pouring into names like Cyngn, a self-driving vehicle firm with barely any revenue and a valuation under $100 million. Despite that, Cyngn’s stock has almost tripled in three months. It’s still down 90% year-to-date, but that hasn’t stopped the trades. These are names investors would’ve dumped a year ago. Now they’re at the top of trading dashboards. The pandemic-era favorites are back too. Avis, once a meme darling during lockdowns, is leading again. Carvana, the used-car dealer that crashed hard during the downturn, has now nearly doubled since April. Aeva’s 400%+ run shows how far this rally is spreading. It’s not just mega caps or AI names moving the indexes. It’s companies with no earnings and little business stability. Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said this bounce in unimpressive names could become a real problem. “If you do see that low-quality, speculative part of the market lead for an extended period, it can be concerning,” Kevin warned. Still, he admitted this is what retail investors have been trained to do. “They’ve been conditioned to buy the dip and not look back, and for the most part that’s been a sound strategy for them.” Retail crowd piles in as macro data eases fears on Wall Street What’s feeding the beast? A mix of optimism around rate cuts, economic resilience, and political easing under President Trump. The belief that the White House will take a softer stance on trade and inflation has helped bring bullish energy back. June’s jobs report was the latest upside surprise. Payroll growth held steady, and unemployment dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%, even though Wall Street Journal economists had expected an increase. Those numbers gave traders more confidence that the second half of 2025 could deliver strong growth without spiking inflation. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs just before the holiday break. That momentum has killed the fear that dominated just three months ago, when retail sentiment hit its lowest level since 2009. Now, traders are only scared of missing the next pop. The “YOLO trade” is alive and foaming at the mouth. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, said the second-quarter attitude shift was loud. “When the attitude shifted to risk-on in the second quarter, it seems like the traditional players moved back into the Apples and Amazons and Microsofts of the world,” Art said. “And now you’ve got the cohort of the ultra-risky, ‘you only live once’ gang rushing back into their selection of equities.” That risk-heavy crowd is also fueling leveraged ETFs. Invesco’s ProShares UltraPro QQQ, which tries to triple the daily return of the Nasdaq-100, saw record inflows in early April. It’s now up more than 100% since April 8. That kind of result is only possible when retail traders ignore warnings and throw size at momentum. Still, the risk of collapse is real. Josh Jamner, senior analyst at ClearBridge Investments, said the long-term reality hasn’t changed. “While some of this speculative stuff can go on huge runs, in the long run, the vast majority of stock returns come back to earnings,” Josh said. “Investors need to keep that in mind.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-06 15:17:52

According to reports, he raps, “I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I’m up next week.” Related Reading: XRP’s Time Is Now, Says Pundit—Don’t Snooze On The ‘Biggest Transfer Of Wealth’ That line isn’t just catchy—it’s another sign of how Bitcoin references are moving past finance blogs into hit songs. Adoption Numbers And Hype Based on reports from River, nearly 5% of the world’s population has used or owns Bitcoin so far. That’s a long way from Blockware’s forecast that 10% could be on board by 2030. Those numbers show that while the buzz is loud, real wallets holding Bitcoin remain few. For many, Bitcoin is still a headline rather than a habit. State Level Moves Shift Policy Last month, Texas became the first US state to set up a public Bitcoin stockpile. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21, creating a standalone fund run by state’s comptroller. That setup keeps the reserve out of the normal state treasury, so it can’t be raided for other expenses. A follow‑up bill, HB 4488, cements its legal protection, making sure the fund stays intact no matter what. Not every state has pushed ahead. In May, Florida dropped its crypto legislation, joining Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana and Oklahoma in pulling back. Arizona’s House Bill 1025, despite getting farther than any similar measure, was vetoed by US President Donald Trump on May 3. Bitcoin Lyrics Hit Home Drake’s new verse isn’t his first high‑stakes play with crypto. Back in 2022, he put $1 million worth of Bitcoin bet on the Super Bowl. That bold wager grabbed headlines and showed he takes crypto chances seriously. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Now, by weaving Bitcoin into his music, he’s giving millions of listeners a taste of what traders already know: prices can swing hard, fast, and without warning.

The pop‑culture nods pull attention, while real‑world policies test whether Bitcoin can move from hype into everyday use. If both trends keep climbing, Bitcoin could win more hearts—and wallets—in the years to come.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now making waves with over $11.7 million in presale funding raised and 60% of Phase 5 tokens already claimed. With 12,700+ wallets now holding MUTM, interest is rapidly growing, and the clock is ticking before the price moves to the next level. Mutuum’s buyback-driven staking is attracting strategic capital Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will not rely on inflated emissions or hype cycles. Instead, it implements a revenue-sharing model that delivers dividends to stakers directly from actual activity on the platform. The way it works is simple: holders who will stake their mtTokens into designated smart contracts earn a portion of the lending fees in the form of MUTM collected through the protocol buybacks form open market while using the system generated revenues. This structure incentivizes both holding and participation, creating a loop where the protocol’s growth directly benefits its community. While many projects lose momentum after the presale phase, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed to enter its beta launch window just as presale closes. That means those who accumulate early are positioned to experience staking rewards right from the platform’s release, not months later. Real DeFi infrastructure: P2P and P2C models give power to users The innovation behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just its token design—it’s the protocol architecture. Instead of choosing between P2P and P2C lending, Mutuum is building both. Its P2P model will allow lenders and borrowers to set custom terms and execute secured contracts on-chain with full transparency. These contracts will support a wide variety of lesser known and volatile tokens , allowing broader participation across different investor types and asset preferences. On the other hand, the P2C model—Mutuum’s P2C feature—will offer a hands-off option for users who want consistent yield without active management. By depositing into decentralized lending pools, users will receive mtTokens that earn interest automatically as the platform allocates capital. These mtTokens also enable staking, unlocking an additional layer of revenue without adding complexity. This dual-system approach means that both risk-tolerant and conservative users can find a home on the platform, expanding its user base and boosting protocol volume. And with the project planning major roadmap milestones in 2025, including the platform beta and additional Layer-2 integrations, the ecosystem is positioned to rapidly scale. Every new user adds demand to mtTokens and deepens liquidity across both lending modes. The projected Layer-2 expansion is particularly relevant, as it reduces gas fees and increases throughput for users interacting with smart contracts. This keeps borrowing and lending costs low while encouraging broader engagement. As more volume flows through the system, protocol earnings scale up, which in turn drives more dividends back to MUTM holders. Many are calling Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the best-kept secret of the current DeFi presale cycle. With smart contract infrastructure backed by a $50,000 CertiK Bug Bounty and a roadmap leading to live platform functionality, it’s not just another coin hoping for hype. It’s building out tools that connect capital with yield and return profits to the community driving it forward. Chainlink (LINK) showed what’s possible when real utility and token economics align—and early buyers at $0.18 never looked back. Today, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at $0.03, but with the presale moving rapidly and the next phase around the corner, entry points at this price range are vanishing fast. When the market looks back six months from now, the ones who acted at $0.03 won’t be the ones saying, “I should’ve.” For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below: Website: https://mutuum.com/ Linktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance The post What to buy before July ends: LINK is booming, but this crypto is catching fire appeared first on Invezz",Crypto|Sponsored,EN,0,0,LINK|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-07-06 15:40:00

With $20.9 million raised and tokens priced at a fixed $0.007, Lightchain AI is gaining significant market fire, attracting investors and developers focused on its intelligent blockchain design and scalable utility. Unlike XRP’s headline-driven volatility, Lightchain AI’s progress is steady and purpose-driven, building momentum through real engagement and accumulation. As XRP navigates uncertainty, Lightchain AI stands ready to capitalize on its completed presale phase and strong community backing for the next wave of growth. XRP Navigates Ongoing Legal Challenges Amid Market Volatility XRP has seen continued volatility in the wake of the legal challenges and market fluctuations. Coverage of the highs of March 2025 was how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dismissed its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, which caused the price of XRP to rise above $2.50. But there have been new dynamics since then. In May 2025 it dipped from $2.65 to $2.27 after the SEC rejected a motion to change a different ruling. Nonetheless, Ripple CEO is still positive on XRP's behalf and is hoping it will be added to the (U.S.) strategic reserve as well as an XRP-ETF before the end of 2025. Lightchain AI Completes All 15 Presale Stages With Steady Progress Lightchain AI has completed all 15 presale stages with steady progress, raising over $20 million and building a solid foundation for its ecosystem. A key development is the reallocation of the original 5% Team Allocation to fund developer grants and ecosystem incentives, underscoring the project’s community-first approach. Its efficient workflow and data flow leverage federated learning and cryptographic verification to securely execute AI tasks in real time without exposing sensitive data. The platform’s $150,000 grant pool supports builders, researchers, and emerging projects, accelerating innovation. Together with dynamic resource allocation and performance optimizations, Lightchain AI is positioned for scalable, decentralized AI applications. Lightchain AI- Sparking a Revolution Beyond Headlines The buzz is real— Lightchain AI is making waves with groundbreaking innovation that goes far beyond the hype. Its cutting-edge cross-chain capabilities allow seamless interoperability, connecting multiple blockchains like never before. Add to that smart gas optimization, where fees adapt dynamically to the complexity of AI tasks, and you’ve got a game-changer for cost-effective and efficient operations. This winning formula is driving real adoption, capturing the attention of builders and investors alike. With a focus on long-term, sustainable growth, Lightchain AI isn’t just riding the trend—it’s shaping the future.

He said the second half of the year will bring weaker growth and possibly even a recession, while interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve won’t happen before December. Roubini said the economic slowdown will look like a “mini stagflationary shock” and warned that inflation is still running too hot for the Fed to pivot. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures index, remains stubborn. Roubini believes it will stay well above target, which keeps the Fed stuck. Growth slowing while inflation remains high is a setup he’s seen before. The economist also said he expects global trade talks to cool off, but not in a way that avoids economic damage. He predicted a “mild” outcome where many countries end up slapped with 15% tariffs. Fed stands still as economy slows and trade tariffs linger When asked about possible market fallout, Roubini said he doesn’t think the US is headed for another April 2 moment . That date, in 2025, saw President Donald Trump announce aggressive tariffs that triggered a 20% market drop. Roubini said, “I’m not expecting, certainly, anything close to April 2.” But the warning still stands. He made it clear the economic path is narrowing, and the Fed has limited room to act. Roubini earned his nickname “Dr. Doom” for predicting the 2008 crash and the 2020 virus-induced recession early. While his accuracy isn’t flawless, his timing on those calls made him hard to ignore. He’s spent years in academia, government, and private investing, and he’s currently a portfolio manager at the Atlas America Fund (USAF), an ETF launched late last year. That fund was built to shield investors from threats like inflation, economic shocks, and climate instability. Despite being small, just $17 million in assets as of now, the fund has held up under pressure. Since launching in November, USAF has gained more than 5%, even though that trails the S&P 500. When the stock market fell apart after April’s tariff news, USAF only dropped under 3%, showing some defense against broader turmoil. Roubini said the goal of the fund isn’t to chase big wins. “It’s not a portfolio for doomsday,” he explained. The fund is built for people who expect slow-moving, long-term instability instead of sudden collapses. It’s trying to stay steady, not spectacular. Atlas America Fund adds gold, cuts real estate, eyes inflation Puneet Agarwal, another manager at USAF, said their focus is on steady returns. “We don’t particularly want outsized returns in one month. We’d rather have the slow and steady uptick, which is exactly what we’ve been seeing,” he said. The ETF holds a mix of gold, short-term US government debt, and agricultural commodities. That lineup has helped at times, but also slowed performance during calmer months like June. Since launch, the portfolio has shifted. USAF recently added more exposure to cybersecurity and defense technology . They also bought short-term inflation-protected bonds and reduced their stake in real estate. The bet on gold gave the fund an edge earlier this year, but became a drag in recent weeks. Still, it reflects a bigger idea Roubini has been pushing. He believes the global economy is slowly drifting away from the US dollar, and investors are starting to prepare for that. “We’re not expecting things to crash. But the trend is clear and it is going [in] one direction,” he said. That direction, according to Roubini, includes elevated inflation, slower growth, geopolitical uncertainty, and tighter financial conditions worldwide. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) recorded a $61.1 billion shortfall in the January-March quarter, its first across-the-board loss in all asset classes since mid-2022, reports the Japan Times. The depreciating dollar, down 4.6% against the yen, significantly reduced the value of GPIF’s international holdings. Global stock markets also faltered, with the MSCI All-Country World Index declining 1.7%, the S&P 500 falling 4.6%, and Japan’s Topix index dropped 4.5%. The deficit reduced GPIF’s assets to $1.73 trillion, a 3.4% quarterly drop, as escalating US trade tariffs fueled concerns about a worldwide economic conflict, further weighing on equities. Meanwhile, Japanese bond yields rose, in contrast to declining US Treasury yields amid the Federal Reserve’s higher-for-longer interest rates. Despite the setback, GPIF achieved a positive annual return of 0.7% for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. With roughly half its assets tied up in foreign markets, the GPIF will likely face ongoing risks from currency fluctuations and trade tensions in the months ahead, while the US and Japan try to hammer out a new agreement on trade.

The UK government is tightening its grip on the crypto economy with new tax compliance rules that require users to provide identifying information to exchanges and platforms. The Cryptoasset Reporting Framework, designed to close loopholes and capture unpaid capital gains, is expected to raise £315 million by April 2030. The fines—targeting both individual holders and non-compliant service providers—are part of a broader push to bring digital assets under traditional financial oversight and align UK regulations more closely with U.S. policy than the EU’s approach. According to the Daily Mail , holders of Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and other cryptocurrencies must supply accurate information to exchanges and platforms they use for trading. Service providers that fail to report transaction details and tax reference numbers will also face penalties. You might also like: Crypto VC funding: BitMine secures $250m, TWL Miner bags $95m ‘I’m not going to apologise’: Chancellor Reeves Exchequer Secretary James Murray MP stated the rules will help “crack down on tax dodgers as we close the tax gap.” The minister emphasized that comprehensive reporting will ensure “tax dodgers have nowhere to hide” while generating revenue for essential public services including healthcare and law enforcement. The new framework forms part of broader government efforts to increase tax compliance across digital asset transactions. Current UK tax rules require cryptocurrency holders to pay capital gains tax on profits, but enforcement has been limited by reporting gaps. The timing coincides with Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s refusal to rule out future tax increases following recent welfare reform reversals. Reeves defended the government’s fiscal approach, stating, “I’m not going to apologise for making sure the numbers add up.” The tax compliance measures complement the UK’s broader cryptocurrency regulatory framework, with draft legislation published in April 2025. This brings crypto exchanges, dealers, and stablecoin issuers under traditional financial services oversight.

UK authorities are extending existing financial regulations to crypto firms through phased implementation expected to be complete by 2026. The first phase focuses on stablecoins while the second phase will expand to broader cryptoasset categories and activities. Key rules and requirements are already being implemented throughout 2025. Cryptocurrency service providers will need to implement customer data collection systems and regular reporting procedures to avoid penalties. The compliance burden may increase operational costs for smaller exchanges and trading platforms. Users trading on non-compliant platforms or failing to provide required documentation face direct financial penalties. The £300 fine structure creates clear incentives for voluntary compliance while generating revenue from non-compliant actors.

But while SHIB’s movements stir short-term excitement, investors are turning their attention to a new crypto coin that’s making waves in the presale arena, Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sits at phase 5 of presale for $0.03. The phase is already over 60% sold out. Having already raised more than $11.8 million raised and attracted over 12,700 investors, Mutuum Finance showing strength. For those wondering what’s the best crypto to buy now, the answer might not lie in familiar names like SHIB but in innovative newcomer Mutuum Finance reshaping the DeFi market. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shows Signs of Recovery as July Begins, Can It Rally to $0.000015? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is gradually recovering after its uncertain June, sitting at the price between $0.000012. With the new month comes a slight price increase with the popular meme coin since the new month, due to the interest back in the community and speculation behind developments coming up in the ecosystem. Although a long ways off its previous peaks, Shiba Inu is once again up on the radar as investors look to get into breakout plays. Nevertheless, since meme coin sentiment remains delicate, others are still looking at new developments, such as Mutuum Finance, which is becoming popular in its presale. Mutuum Finance Presale Surpasses $11.8 Million Milestone Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has reached above 12,700 investors in a presale that exceeds more than $11.8 million. Project hype is at its peak and this is certainly a great sign of the future of the project. MUTM tokens are currently priced at $0.03 in phase 5 but will soar 16.67% in phase 6. This phase is over 60% sold out as investors scramble to get in at the lowest price possible. The demand is becoming exponentially high and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a game-changer in DeFi is all the more valuable considering that it will be amongst the top-trending crypto investments of 2025. MUTM Giveaway: $100,000 in Rewards Up for Grabs Mutuum Finance is set to reward the early supporters it has on its platform and has established a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be chosen and rewarded with $10,000 MUTM tokens. It will be a reward to the quickly expanding community inside the project and gratitude for early investors. But time’s running out. Mutuum Finance Prioritizes Trust with New $50K Bounty Following its consistent effort to embrace the culture of security and transparency, Mutuum Finance has officially introduced its Bug Bounty Program in conjunction and support with CertiK, where a reward pool of up to 50,000 USDT will be allocated. The reward is split into four categories critical, major, minor, and low, so it will be guaranteed that all levels of vulnerability will have its reward. This is another step that proves Mutuum has an active attitude to safety and its commitment to the creation of a reliable financial environment. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) regains bullish momentum and eyes a July target of $0.000025, some investors are setting their sights on a potentially bigger breakout: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $11.8 million raised, 12,700+ investors onboard, and Phase 5 already more than 60% sold out at $0.03, Mutuum is shaping up to be a top DeFi coin.

The move demonstrates SharpLink’s strong commitment to blockchain-based assets and its goal to lead in digital finance. SharpLink’s move to use Ethereum as a treasury asset is part of a growing trend . More companies are now adding cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets. SharpLink Unveils Bold ETH Strategy Backed by Big Industry Player On July 4, SharpLink revealed its plan in a post shared on X. The company wants to grow its ETH holdings, stake them on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, and increase the amount of ETH each investor owns. To SharpLink, ETH is more than just a digital coin. It is a scarce and secure asset that can also earn rewards when staked. The company sees it as a smart long-term investment. This plan started in May 2025 with a $425 million private investment led by blockchain firm Consensys. The company used the funds to buy ETH. Joseph Lubin, Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO, also joined SharpLink’s board as Chairman. His support adds strong credibility to this strategy. SharpLink’s Growing ETH Wallet Since launching its ETH plan on June 2, SharpLink has rapidly built up its holdings. Between May 30 and June 12, the company purchased over 176,000 ETH, valued at $463 million. In mid-June, the firm added more than 12,000 ETH, bringing the total holdings to 188,478 ETH by June 24. By July 1, SharpLink’s Ethereum treasury reached 198,478 ETH, all of which were actively staked and already generating returns. In just a few weeks, the company earned over 220 ETH in rewards. This proves its strategy is working and shows how digital assets can be productive. Ethereum Price Shows Strength The Ethereum market has responded positively in recent days. Between July 4 and 5, ETH increased by 2.2%, reaching a value above $2,530. Although there was a slight dip, it remained strong above $2,500. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,563.01, up 1.82% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Analysts say ETH has been rising since late June, and recent price action shows stability and growing demand. SharpLink’s move is bold, but it is far from isolated. Other firms are also beginning to explore digital assets beyond Bitcoin , adding tokens such as Ethereum, Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), and XRP to their financial strategies. This marks a shift from Bitcoin-only strategies to a broader embrace of crypto diversity.

Ethereum continues to make gains, helped by strong upgrades and fresh institutional interest. ONDO is moving up too, thanks to wider adoption of tokenized assets and a bullish technical setup. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is winning attention for a different reason. Instead of only price charts, it’s proving that blockchain can work in real life through cultural and community partnerships that add real value. With over $332 million raised so far and a new partnership with the Seattle Orcas, BlockDAG is merging blockchain tech with a strong fan community. For anyone looking beyond short-term moves, BlockDAG’s practical use and growing reach make it stand out as a serious option for the long run. Seattle Orcas Partnership Shows BlockDAG Means Real Fan Connection The Seattle Orcas have confirmed a new collaboration with BlockDAG.Network that promises to reshape how cricket fans connect with their team. After two big wins, the Orcas are channeling that energy to engage fans off the field. Through this tie-up, supporters will soon be able to grab team-themed NFTs, earn tradeable fan rewards, and get special behind-the-scenes videos. A co-branded video series will also deepen the bond between fans and players, offering closer and more interactive moments. This Orcas partnership highlights how BlockDAG is more than hype, putting real-world uses front and center. The project has already secured over $332 million in presale, sold 23.7 billion coins, and delivered a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. Though currently in batch 29, BlockDAG offers early buyers a limited time opportunity to lock in BDAG coins at $0.0016 until August 11. This rare window gives them a shot at a potential 3,025% profit at the $0.05 launch price. BlockDAG’s blend of utility, real partnerships, and an active community gives it an edge as one of the best altcoins to buy now. Its collaboration with the Seattle Orcas shows how blockchain can bring real value to sports, culture, and everyday life. Ethereum Builds Strength with Validator Upgrade Boost Ethereum’s price strength is showing solid signs of growth. After bouncing back to hold the $2,500 support level, ETH rose another 3% and now aims for the $3,000 zone. This fresh rally comes alongside a major upgrade to Ethereum’s validator system, improving security and decentralization. On-chain data also reveals over $2.9 billion flowing into ETH-focused funds, while the amount staked has climbed to a record 35 million ETH, all pointing to strong institutional backing. Looking at charts, ETH is now in an upward channel with support between $2,750 and $2,760 and resistance near $2,900 to $3,000. Lower inflation signs and positive macro signals add more fuel to the bullish trend. If ETH closes above $2,900, the next move toward $3,000 could gain extra strength from improved validator performance and heavy inflows. ONDO Climbs Higher on Tokenized Asset Demand ONDO’s price is moving up too, rising 1.5% to $0.7671 and breaking past key resistance levels near $0.765. It’s now sitting in a bullish channel with support holding around $0.755, showing traders are backing its real-world progress. This climb follows Ondo Finance’s June 17 announcement of a new Global Markets Alliance to standardize tokenized securities and open up U.S. stocks and ETFs for global users. Technical data shows ONDO’s price rose from $0.749 to $0.769 in just a day, with trading volume spiking to over 8.9 million during the surge. Even after a slight dip, the coin settled firmly around $0.768, proving that buyers still see potential. The Bottom Line While Ethereum and ONDO are showing solid gains thanks to market trends and smart upgrades, both still rely heavily on price movements and timing. BlockDAG is taking a different path. It’s proving that blockchain can do more than boost a chart. Its $332 million presale, 23.7 billion coins sold, and recent Seattle Orcas partnership deal show real progress that buyers can see and use. Instead of short-term spikes, BlockDAG’s strategy is clear: build an ecosystem with real fans, useful tools, and cultural tie-ups that matter. This practical approach makes BlockDAG stand out for anyone seeking the best altcoin to buy now with long-term growth.

According to CNBC, large firms have already begun piling more of the crypto onto their balance sheets while Capitol Hill inches closer to passing long-delayed legislation. The price climbed about 30% in Q2, even though most traders called it a consolidation phase. The reason? Monthly returns kept fading, and the coin barely moved from its tight range for most of the quarter. But that didn’t stop it from racking up a 15% gain in H1, even if that’s weaker than the 45% jump during the same period last year. Still, Bitcoin’s staying power above $100,000 since May 9 is keeping bulls aggressive. The coin traded at $108,000 on Sunday, about 3% short of its May record at $111,999, per CoinGecko data . Devin Ryan, who heads financial tech research at Citizens, said, “There’s still an acceleration coming here around ETF adoption… there’s more money coming into those.” Ryan said people are still moving from owning nothing to owning some, adding that the old walls around Bitcoin access are disappearing. “We’re moving closer to the end of the consolidation,” he said. “The path is higher from here.” Public companies set up for massive Bitcoin inflows A group of firms now known as Bitcoin treasury companies is driving that push. These are publicly traded companies that either already hold Bitcoin as a main asset or are planning to. Some of them, including Nakamoto, Twenty One, and Strive Asset Management, are going through mergers with other listed companies to raise capital by offering equity and using it to buy Bitcoin. Steven Lubka, the VP of investor relations at Nakamoto, told CNBC that a lot of that capital hasn’t even touched the market yet. “They’re waiting on SEC approval on the mergers, so there’s way more money that’s coming, that’s trying to buy Bitcoin but has not currently bought it,” Lubka said. “We have not yet seen the full impact of even just the money that’s already lined up.” Lubka said adoption isn’t the only driver right now. The broader macro setup is turning bullish too. He pointed to rising fiscal spending, surging stock prices, and a White House under Donald Trump that appears supportive of crypto. “Bitcoin’s maturity as an asset class intersects with a huge amount of capital coming in through new financialization vehicles,” Lubka said, referring to the treasury companies. “You’re going to see a ton of fiscal spending, and you also have an administration that’s pro-Bitcoin,” he added. “These four factors are going to intersect together to produce a pretty material bull market.” Legislation and Fed drama add fuel for Q3 surge Bitcoin’s next leg higher could be helped by Washington. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, said the political landscape could play a major role in the third quarter. If President Trump replaces Jerome Powell as Fed chair, markets could start betting on earlier rate cuts, which may boost investor confidence in the central bank’s independence. Kendrick also flagged a potential law: the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill now working its way through Congress. He believes it could pass in Q3 and trigger a ton of new retail demand. “It could encourage more retail investors to make their first investments in crypto, with Bitcoin the prime beneficiary,” Kendrick wrote in a research note last week. But not everyone’s completely calm. Kendrick said prices could get messy around late September because of fears tied to Bitcoin’s four-year cycle. In that cycle, the coin usually dumps around 18 months after a halving, when the rate of new supply is slashed. The last halving happened in April 2024, which puts that potential correction window directly into H2. Still, Kendrick isn’t backing off his forecast. He believes the current demand, especially from ETFs and treasury companies, will be enough to hold up the price even if some long-term holders start unloading. “The key this time will be whether increased ETF and Bitcoin treasury flows are enough to offset any other selling by long-term holders,” Kendrick said. “We think they will be.” By Kendrick’s estimate, Bitcoin could rise to $135,000 by the end of Q3, and then finish the year at $200,000. He expects that once investors stop worrying about another cycle repeat, the crypto will keep rising. “Once market concerns about this have passed, we expect Bitcoin to continue to rise to our end-Q4 forecast,” he wrote.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, gained over 1%, briefly topping $109,000. Payments-focused XRP and Solana's SOL token gained over 2% each, with meme token dogecoin (DOGE) rising 3%, according to data source CoinDesk. Ethereum's ether, the second-largest token, rose 1.5% to $2,550. In an interview with CNN, Bessent stated that the U.S. is close to finalizing several trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline, when the temporary pause in higher tariffs initially announced on April 2 is set to expire. ""President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,"" Bessent said, per Reuters . Bessent explained that July 9 remains the deadline for negotiations, failing which higher tariffs, announced in early April, will take effect from Aug. 1. ""We are saying this is when it's happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice,"" Bessent told CNN, adding that some countries were 'foot-dragging' on getting to deals. Since taking office early this year, President Donald Trump has been focused on making the U.S. wealthy again by imposing tariffs on goods imported from other countries, a coercive tactic aimed at rebalancing trade relations and reducing the U.S. trade deficit. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, starting with a 10% base tax on all trading partners and additional amounts on many countries, with some ranging as high as 50%. The so-called Liberation Day announcement triggered a sell-off in financial markets, with U.S. stocks taking a significant hit alongside a sharp decline in bitcoin, which fell to $75,000. The panic likely prompted the Trump administration to announce a 90-day pause a week later. Since then, the so-called U.S. exceptionalism has resurfaced in financial markets, lifting major U.S. equity indices to record highs. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have outperformed their global peers, with BTC rallying to trade above $100,000.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|XRP|DOGE|Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|XRP|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-06 16:08:30

This CEO Shares Honest Opinion",https://timestabloid.com/what-could-trigger-110000-xrp-price-rally-this-ceo-shares-honest-opinion/,"In a recent video shared by Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), Jake Claver, a crypto expert and CEO of Digital Ascension Group, addressed the intriguing scenario of XRP reaching a price of $2,500. While the figure seems extreme, he argued that under specific conditions, it isn’t entirely out of the question. However, he was clear that this wouldn’t be the result of simple speculation or market hype. “A lot of people just say, oh, you know, flip a switch. Get out of here with that stuff,” he said, pushing back on oversimplified takes. Instead, he pointed to the need for global macroeconomic shifts and a significant supply shock . #XRP TO $2500 ?? What's your opinion on this pic.twitter.com/UtQK4VD2VV — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 5, 2025 Supply, Demand, and Liquidity Dynamics Claver’s argument relies heavily on demand and supply economics. While critics often point to XRP’s market cap as a limiting factor, like other experts, he dismissed the idea that total market cap alone determines price. According to him, what matters is the circulating supply available for purchase, as this determines liquidity and price. In this view, a price spike to $2,500 would only be possible if the available supply of XRP on the open market were drastically reduced, creating conditions for a supply shock. Such a scenario might involve high-volume institutional usage or massive demand driven by adoption in international financial infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Fixed Supply and Deflationary Mechanism Unlike many cryptocurrencies that allow minting of additional coins, XRP’s supply is fixed. Claver noted that 100 billion tokens were minted when it was created, and the original minting account was “blackholed,” meaning no one can access it, and no new XRP can ever be created. In addition to being capped, XRP also has a built-in deflationary mechanism. He stated that around 5,000 tokens are burned daily through transaction fees, and described the asset as “the only deflationary asset besides like uranium,” underlining its uniqueness in the crypto space. How Can XRP Reach $2,500? While XRP’s supply mechanics create scarcity, scarcity alone won’t drive it to $2,500. He emphasized that for such a valuation to be reached, significant global developments would need to occur. This could include XRP being adopted as a settlement layer in cross-border finance or being used at scale in real-time liquidity systems. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, recently stated that XRP is on the cusp of mass institutional adoption , and this major shift could contribute to XRP’s growth and potentially help it reach that target.

Recent market fluctuations have generated a lot of fearful controversy whether the bull cycle has topped out or not. While some institutional investors are still holding strong with optimism of one last leg up, many traders are pessimistic as they panic for a potential price crash. As a matter of fact, the overall market is technically reaching an extremely overbought condition as several meme coins enter a mini bearish phase since the start of the year. Although Bonk and Pengu have regained momentum and continued to show strength amid the latest market drops. Few Meme Coins Defying Market Odds Aside from Bonk and Pengu, which have consistently charted major gains for a week, many meme coins are seriously bleeding out today as Bitcoin loses footings again after almost retesting its recently marked all-time high (ATH). Other meme coins that follow trends are Fartcoin, Useless Coin and AI Agents. Moderate gains from Turbo, Pepe and Shiba have also put their prices in a green zone over the past hours, although they may record losses if Bitcoin’s price continues to drop. Few Binance Alpha tokens, and most especially assets on Dex are not left behind in the daily posting gain as they registered a significant profit at the time of writing. What To Expect With The Current Market Behaviour The fate of the entire market lies in Bitcoin’s future direction. However, if BTC calms or even resumes bullish, the meme coin market may see a strong recovery with Doge and others rising back above their key monthly high. Otherwise, a huge breakdown can be expected in the long term. Further drops in the flagship asset could lead to a serious decline of meme coins in the future with Pengu and Bonk joining the ride.

Most people would say that Bitcoin will end because of quantum technology, however, I believe there’s another answer. Ever since Bitcoin debuted in 2009, people have speculated about the survival of this digital currency. Many people believed that it would go to zero, but 16 years later, governments are recognizing its potential as gold 2.0. Let’s be real. Bitcoin has proven its reliability as an asset after reaching almost $112,000 per coin. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies hit an all-time high of $3.91 trillion, and most of this money was in Bitcoin. At the peak, BTC had a market cap of $2.227 trillion, while the remaining $1.68 trillion was in the 17,000-ish altcoins. Bitcoin is an asset class—other altcoins aren’t included in this category. This is because BTC is among the top 10 assets ranked by market cap according to data from Infinite Market Cap. Despite the massive success of Bitcoin, there’s a technological phenomenon I believe that would kill the crypto king. Quantum computing isn’t the Bitcoin killer Quantum computing is considered a major threat to Bitcoin. More specifically, quantum computers could break the complex mathematical algorithms that support modern cryptography. It could also make it possible to access dormant wallets and spend any Bitcoins from the Satoshi era. Quantum computing originates from two fields: quantum mechanics and computer science. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics. It examines the physics of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic levels. The behavior of atoms and subatomic particles is unique and classical physics laws like Newton’s laws can’t fully explain it. There are specific principles and phenomena that explain quantum mechanics such as superposition, quantization, etc. Computer science is the study of computational systems and it includes algorithms, data structure, programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, etc. Quantum computing takes principles from quantum mechanics and applies them to computing for superior processing power. But how could quantum computing crack the Bitcoin algorithm? Could it really make it possible to access dormant BTC coins? Theoretically, if someone builds a powerful quantum computer and obtains your public key, they could derive your private key, forge a valid signature, and spend your BTC. This scenario depends on the type of wallet address used, whether the public key has been revealed, and the processing speed of the quantum computer . All BTC in pay-to-public-key (p2pk) addresses and reused pay-to-public-key-hash (p2pkh) addresses are vulnerable to a quantum computer attack. In a p2pk address, the public key is exposed on the blockchain by default, even before any coins are spent. In a p2pkh address, the public key is not revealed until the coins are spent. P2pk and p2pkh addresses were dominant in the early days of Bitcoin. The BTC mined by Satoshi Nakamoto are stored in p2pk addresses. In 2020, the number of Bitcoins in p2pk addresses was around 2 million coins, while p2pkh addresses had 2.5 million coins. A total of 4.5 million Bitcoins is equivalent to around $490 billion. In terms of processing speed, a quantum computer must derive the private key and broadcast a competing transaction before the next block is mined, typically within 10 minutes. So if a quantum computer takes two hours to derive a private key from a publicly available public key, it won’t be able to spend the Bitcoins—because transactions are typically confirmed within 10 minutes. However, if the address is reused and receives new coins after the public key has already been revealed, those new funds become vulnerable, and the quantum computer could potentially spend them. The technological phenomenon that could catalyze Bitcoin’s demise NEMP stands for nuclear electromagnetic pulse. It’s considered both a technological phenomenon and a weapon. As the name indicates, an NEMP generates a pulse of electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosion, especially one detonated at high altitude. Instead of causing physical damage, an NEMP is intentionally detonated to generate an intense electromagnetic pulse. This results in an extremely high voltage and current surges into anything that conducts electricity — wires, antennas, power lines, computers, electronics etc. In other words, an NEMP will fry every electrical and electronic equipment and device. Because of the high altitude, an NEMP explosion can affect thousands of kilometers and impact an entire country or even continent. This means servers, data centers and Bitcoin mining farms are gone in a fraction of a second. According to a YouGov poll , around 68 to 76% of Europeans and Americans believe that nuclear arms will be used in World War III. Analysts also point to growing tensions between major nuclear powers, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and the US. The recent Israel–Iran conflict , along with US-supported strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, is the closest the world has come to a nuclear war in recent years. If a global-scale NEMP attack happens, it could wipe out Bitcoin mining equipment, nodes, internet infrastructure and modern technology as we know it today. In 1949 Albert Einstein said “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.” In such a scenario, one would not be wrong to assume that Bitcoin was not spared.",OP-ED|Bitcoin|BTC|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN|ASIA|MINING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-06 16:30:17

Most of the agency's assets are held in a single cold wallet, making it one of the largest cold wallets in the world. The agency accumulated these assets as a result of a series of investigations. GIOC specialists tracked the funds using open source tools, blockchain analysis, and other methods. A significant portion of internet crime losses in the United States is due to digital currency-related fraud. In 2024, Americans lost $9.3 billion—more than half of the total $16.6 billion—to cryptocurrencies. A significant portion of the losses is attributed to the elderly, who lost nearly $2.8 billion, mostly to bogus investment sites. In such schemes, victims are lured by promises of profitable cryptocurrency investments through online communication. The first deposits bring a modest but steady income. When enthusiastic clients increase their investments, often with borrowed funds, the platform closes and their balances disappear. The largest seizure in GIOC history—more than $225 million in Tether (USDT) stablecoins—is linked to this scheme. In one such case, agency investigators identified a domain name registered by the scam organizers after taking advantage of a brief VPN failure. In another case, an unknown person blackmailed an Idaho teenager by threatening to send an intimate photo of him to his relatives. The victim paid $300 twice before contacting the police. GIOC experts reconstructed the extortion using blockchain data, screenshots, and receipts, and employed a dummy payer. As a result, they traced an account, registered to a Nigerian passport, that processed about 6,000 transactions worth nearly $4.1 million. The suspect was apprehended by UK police upon arrival in the United Kingdom. According to Bloomberg, GIOC relies on the help of partners in the crypto industry in operations to recover stolen digital assets.

Recent data reveals one of the largest whale transfers of 105.9 million LTC and Cardano surpassing 111 million transactions. Investors are keen to know if these developments signal an imminent bull run. Discover which coins might be primed for growth. Litecoin Market Outlook: Past Trends and Key Price Levels LTC price action over the last month shows a modest increase of 3.97% with a slight weekly gain of 0.71%. Over a six-month period, the coin experienced a significant drop of 23.75%, reflecting extended pressure on price stability. The figures suggest that once steady gains were overshadowed by a broader decline in momentum. Historical movements capture brief rallies amid an overall retreat, defining erratic behavior that has kept investors watchful over recent cycles. Current trading levels are defined by a working range between $76.79 and $94.60, with bulls meeting resistance at $103.26 and a tougher ceiling at $121.07. Support levels are marked near $67.65, while a second support appears around $49.84, setting clear boundaries for potential moves. The Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator reflect indecision in the market, with RSI close to 50. Traders may explore opportunities by targeting minor breakout moves within these levels, taking care to balance recent gains against the underlying weakness. Cardano: Recent Price Drops and Key Market Levels Cardano dropped around 8% during the past month and nearly 47% over the last six months. The sustained decline highlights reduced investor confidence and slower price recovery. Price movements during these times reflect a challenging phase, marked by volatility and diminishing momentum. Such shifts underscore the coin’s struggle to regain strength and signal a cautious approach among traders. Currently, Cardano trades between a range of about $0.48 and $0.70, with the nearest resistance close to $0.83 and immediate support around $0.38. Bears have been influential in keeping prices subdued, though there are pockets of buying interest nudging prices within this range. Indicators like a slightly negative Awesome Oscillator and a weak moving average signal a cautious outlook, while the Relative Strength Index near 44 suggests neutral conditions. Traders should watch the support at $0.38 for recovery signs or test the upper resistance at $0.83. A breakout above the current ceiling could invite buying interest, while failure to maintain support may lead to further declines. Conclusion The record transfer of 105.9 million LTC and the milestone of Cardano surpassing 111 million transactions are significant signals. Such large movements and increased usage suggest growing interest and activity. These developments could hint at a potential bull run for both LTC and ADA. The increased activity and high-value transfers reflect strong market confidence in these cryptocurrencies. Investors and traders might see these signs as a reason to keep a close watch on the upcoming trends in the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The program requires applicants to stake $100,000 worth of toncoin for three years and pay a one-time processing fee of $35,000. After the three-year lock-up period, staked funds can apparently be unlocked, and during this time, applicants reportedly earn an estimated 3–4% annual percentage yield (APY) on their staked tokens. The TON Foundation’s website highlights several key alleged benefits: fast approval within seven weeks from document submission, a simple process without the need to purchase real estate or meet income thresholds, and inclusion of family members — spouse, children, and parents — at no extra cost beyond standard government fees. The staking is conducted through decentralized smart contracts on the TON blockchain, which it argues ensures transparency and security. The program claims to offer a capital-efficient alternative to traditional UAE Golden Visa routes, which the TON Foundation says typically require a minimum investment of approximately $540,000 in real estate or fixed deposits, often tied to illiquid assets and longer processing times. The TON Golden Visa initiative is touted as a faster, more affordable, and digitally native pathway to UAE residency, aligning with the country’s ambition to become a global crypto and Web3 hub. The announcement had an immediate impact on toncoin’s market performance. Shortly after the news broke, toncoin’s price surged by 12%. At the time of writing, the token trades around $2.8944, reflecting a 5.36% increase over the past 24 hours. Additionally, the current 24-hour average trading volume is approximately 251.54% higher than the 30-day average, signaling heightened market interest and activity, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Despite the enthusiasm, the announcement has generated controversy within the crypto community. Bobby Ong, co-founder and COO of CoinGecko, praised the partnership as an “amazing story” that could attract whales and provide strong buy support for toncoin, although he expressed hope that the initiative is not a temporary scheme. Conversely, ""Joe HedgedHog"" (""@JoeHedgedHog"" on X), an investment partner at Sigil Fund, pointed out that this is not an official UAE government partnership but rather a third-party legal firm using TON as a proxy to assist clients applying for the Golden Visa under the entrepreneur category. He noted that the firm could have used any cryptocurrency and that the staking requirement serves more as a token utility sink than a government mandate. Further skepticism came from ""ivangbi"" (""@ivangbi_"" on X), the Head of Strategy & Business Development at Gearbox Protocol, who described the announcement as misleading. According to this perspective, the legal firm receives the non-refundable $35,000 fee and attempts to submit applications to the UAE government, which ultimately decides on approval. He argued that the staked TON balance is only one of several requirements and may no longer be relevant under updated rules. He went on to say that the absence of blanket approval for TON stakers means that acceptance is uncertain, and the program may primarily serve as a marketing tool coupled with token utility. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), co-founder and former CEO of Binance, expressed cautious interest in the TON Foundation’s UAE Golden Visa announcement but highlighted several uncertainties. He noted conflicting information about the program’s legitimacy, including claims that the $35,000 fee mainly goes to a legal agent rather than the government, and that the website’s language may misleadingly suggest a guaranteed visa upon staking $100,000 in toncoin. CZ also mentioned that theUAE regulators classify staking as a regulated activity for which TON may lack licenses. Importantly, he pointed out that official UAE government channels do not currently recognize staking toncoin as a visa qualification, listing the standard Golden Visa categories instead. In a follow-up post , CZ reiterated his cautious optimism, emphasizing the need to “trust but verify.” He acknowledged the potential benefits of such a program but stressed that official government partnerships and announcements are essential for legitimacy—none of which have yet been confirmed. His stance balances support for innovation and TON founder Pavel Durov with prudent skepticism about the program’s current status. The UAE entrepreneur visa category, which this program appears to target, is designed for individuals owning economic projects of a technical or innovative nature. Applicants must provide approval letters from an accredited UAE auditor confirming the project’s value (at least 500,000 AED), local authorities verifying the project’s innovative character, and an accredited UAE business incubator to establish the proposed activity in the country. Technical Analysis Highlights Price surged from $2.75 to a peak of $3.06, representing an overall range of $0.34 (12.4%). Rally began abruptly during the 7:00 hour on 6 July, when volume spiked to nearly 13 million. Extraordinary 57.5 million volume surge in the 8:00 hour propelled TON to its high. Support has formed around $2.86-$2.89 with high-volume buying. Resistance appears at $3.03, suggesting the token has established a new trading range. In the last 60 minutes from 6 July 15:12 to 16:11, TON experienced a significant price surge of 2.4%. Dramatic breakout occurred at 15:48 when volume spiked to 1.68 million tokens. Token reached a peak of $2.93 at 15:50 before establishing a new support level around $2.90-$2.91.

After a small rally earlier, the token has faced strong resistance and is now moving sideways, raising concerns about whether a price drop could be on the way. Key Resistance Level at $2.30 On the XRP price chart, a clear upside breakout hasn’t appeared yet since the recent pullback started on July 3rd. There is a strong resistance trendline around the $2.30 level. This area has rejected XRP several times in the past, on May 24, May 27, June 16, June 30, and now again. If XRP can break above this level soon, it could open the door for a bigger rally. But as long as it stays below, traders expect the sideways movement to continue. What Happens Next? Popular analyst Dark Defender also shared his view, saying the upcoming weekly candle close is important. He explained that if XRP can close this week above $2.28–$2.33, it will be a positive sign for next week’s price action. However, if it fails, the sideways movement could continue for a few more days. His Targets: Upside: $2.33, $2.46 Downside Supports: $2.19, $2.07, $1.99 Right now, XRP’s price movement remains choppy and indecisive, bouncing between resistance and support without clear direction. Although a small rally happened recently, it wasn’t strong enough to confirm a real trend reversal. For XRP to keep its current market structure intact, it must stay above the June 27 low of $1.99.

Foreign-born workers, who have played a major role in filling jobs across multiple industries, are disappearing fast. For the third month in a row, the foreign-born labor force shrank, even though the U.S. added 147,000 jobs in June. This is happening as Trump pushes his $150 billion “Big Beautiful Bill,” a legislative beast loaded with new cash for border enforcement, more deportations, and extra funding for detention centers. According to Politico, it’s the largest immigration enforcement effort in decades, and it’s now colliding head-on with the needs of the U.S. job market. White House says native-born workers will fill gaps Inside the West Wing, officials are brushing off concerns. The logic from Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers Chair Stephen Miran is that there’s a large group of unemployed Americans ready to work if the right incentives are in place. “There’s plenty of labor supply waiting to be brought in by the right incentives,” Miran said in an interview, adding that the jobless rate for 20-to-24-year-olds is over 8% and over 14% of working-age teenagers are out of work. Miran pointed to new tax cuts on overtime and tighter rules for Medicaid recipients as tools that might drive these workers back into jobs. But others in the economic world are not buying it. Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, said, “If the job market slows, then we should expect economic growth to follow.” He’s one of many economists arguing that the current U.S. workforce, especially native-born, can’t fully replace the gap left by missing immigrant labor. The concern is that if immigration slows down too much, job growth can’t keep up, even if the unemployment rate stays at its current 4.1%. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made the same point to lawmakers last month. “When you significantly slow the growth of the labor force, you will slow the growth of the economy,” Powell said. “Growth will slow, and actually is slowing, and that’s one of the reasons.” Economists warn of long-term slowdown The bigger issue is what happens next. A report from Deutsche Bank sent to clients this week suggested that the “breakeven rate” of job growth could fall to 50,000 jobs a month, way lower than the levels seen during Joe Biden’s presidency when immigrant labor was climbing. If that rate drops and job creation stalls, it would mean slower GDP growth. Trump has been clear he sees the labor gains under Biden as fake, driven by “an unchecked flow of undocumented immigrants.” That’s why he’s doubling down on deportations. His immigration czar Tom Homan said this week, “We need more agents to arrest them. We need more beds to hold them. And we need more transportation contracts to move them out of the country.” On Tuesday, Trump visited a Florida immigrant holding facility nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where new operations are ramping up. So far, that agenda hasn’t crushed job numbers. But it’s already shrinking the size and share of foreign-born workers in the economy. And the sharp drop in migrant encounters at the southwest border shows that the labor pipeline is drying up. The Congressional Budget Office has also flagged this. It projected that slowing immigration would weaken long-term output, even though it could boost wages slightly. A 2024 CBO report said the immigration surge after the pandemic had a positive effect on economic growth while leaving inflation almost unchanged. A separate study released Wednesday by the American Enterprise Institute, which leans conservative, warned that if net migration flatlines in 2025, it could shave 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points off GDP. That’s a huge hit, especially when growth is already slowing. Even Trump himself has shown signs of worry. He recently told aides that farmers and hospitality business owners are pressing him about how they’ll find workers under these new rules. Those industries depend heavily on foreign-born labor, and the options to replace them are thin. Miran admitted in the interview that “weaker numbers” may show up for a while. But he insisted it’s not proof of a broken system. The administration’s position is that once the changes kick in, more Americans will enter the workforce. Economists say that’s wishful thinking.

The two men, Raymondip Bedi (35 years old) and Patrick Mavanga (40 years old), were sentenced for a combined 12 years for committing fraud. The pair cold-called people, masquerading as financial advisers, but leading people to their scam websites. The scam occurred between 2017 and 2019. Police estimate that the pair scammed around $2 million from 65 victims. The UK courts released a statement about the case, naming Raymondip Bedi and Patrick Mavanga as the scammers who extorted £1.5 million from investors, equivalent to approximately $2 million. The FCA prosecuted the two individuals and found them guilty of fraud. Bedi was sentenced to 5 years and 4 months in prison. Mavanga was sentenced to 6 years and 6 months in jail. Both men operated under companies CCX Capital and Astaria Group LLP. The court revealed that the pair sought to undermine the financial regulatory system and continued to extract their illicit gains after the scam was complete. The court requested that victims of the fraud reach out for support and receive assistance with identifying scams in the future. The high-pressure sales scam targeted retail investors with little experience using cryptocurrencies. The pair sold their fake assets, pretending to offer a legitimate investment opportunity. The pair enticed investors with attractive sales materials and outlandish claims of future profits. Investors often would give the pair thousands of pounds in the hope of making a profit. The court case included victim impact statements. Some investors developed mental health symptoms after the scam. Others had to go into debt to pay off their losses. Some investors used their life savings for the investment and lost everything. Judge Griffiths, who presided over the case, said that the two men were equally involved in the scam and intended to disregard the laws related to financial regulations. The pair pleaded guilty in 2023. However, Mavanga was caught committing extra offences, hiding phone recordings of Bedi and himself discussing the scam. The court slammed the two for defrauding customers. It was mentioned that dozens of people had sought investment opportunities to generate a return on their investment. The two men pleaded guilty in 2023 for defrauding 65 investors of around $2 million. The case took a long time to resolve because the FCA had a large backlog of cases, some going back to 2016. The FCA has been focusing on crypto cases and has a long list of cases involving false advertising of crypto investments.

A big event is on the horizon that could shake up Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. The U.S. Congress is preparing for “Crypto Week” from July 14 to 18, and the decisions made during this week could have a major impact on the crypto market. What’s Happening in the Market Right Now? In the past week, the price of Bitcoin and altcoins has barely moved. Bitcoin is up just 0.6%, Ethereum by 2%, and most of the altcoin market has stayed flat. Some meme coins managed double-digit gains, but overall, it’s been a slow, sideways market. Historically, this kind of price action often happens before a big breakout, and all attention is now on what Congress will decide in the coming days. Why Crypto Week Matters During Crypto Week, U.S. lawmakers will discuss and possibly pass several important bills related to cryptocurrency: The Clarity Act: This bill will finally create clear rules for how crypto assets are traded, invested, and regulated in the U.S. The Stablecoin Bill (Genius Act): Focused on regulating dollar-backed stablecoins, it has already passed the Senate and is expected to pass the House as well. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act: A bill aimed at blocking government-controlled digital currencies that could invade financial privacy. While some bills, like the Stablecoin Act, are likely to move quickly, others like the Clarity Act, which deals with more complex areas like DeFi, staking, and crypto taxes, might take longer to finalize. Why This Could Trigger a Market Pump Alongside these bills, the U.S. government recently approved a massive $5 trillion debt ceiling increase. This move means more money could flood the financial system, which historically tends to benefit risk assets like crypto. Plus, crypto-friendly policies and clear rules can attract new institutional investors and bringing fresh capital into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Ethereum’s Big Moment Is Coming While Bitcoin has been surging for months, analysts say Ethereum is about to get its turn. Big names like Bitwise predict that Ethereum ETFs and tokenized assets built on the Ethereum network could see massive growth in the second half of 2025. New projects like Robinhood’s blockchain network and the rise of tokenized stocks and stablecoins on Ethereum’s platform are expected to fuel demand for ETH.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ETH|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-06 16:51:39

Solana and Avalanche are both vying for attention with promises of rapid transactions and high scalability. This article dives into which of these two might offer greater returns, fueling curiosity about the top picks for exponential growth in the near future. Solana Price Overview: Past Trends and Current Key Levels Over the last six months, Solana has seen a significant drop with a decline of 32.40%, while the past month brought a modest rebound of 2.22% after a short-term correction of 2.12% in the last week. The coin experienced rough market conditions over half a year, reflecting strong downward pressure, though the recent monthly gain indicates brief upward movement amid lingering bearish sentiment. Price behavior has remained volatile with gradual signs of stabilization emerging recently. Current price levels for Solana fall within a range of $131 to $173, with key resistance levels marked at $191.77 and $233.73. Support stands at $107.88 initially and further down at $65.93. The Awesome Oscillator reading of 0.62 and the momentum indicator value of 8.46 signal a cautious setup, while the RSI at 48.18 points to a near-neutral condition. The lack of a strong clear trend gives both bulls and bears room for action. Traders might consider testing the support area near $107 for potential entry opportunities with aims to reach the first resistance level, yet caution is advised if prices slip below that first support, which could trigger further declines. Avalanche Market Update: Price Range, Levels, and Trend Dynamics Avalanche recorded a -5.17% shift over one month with a drastic -59.59% decline over six months. Price movements reveal a steady downward path with gradual erosion of value. The monthly drop signals short-term stress while the half-year period shows considerable long-term pressure on the coin. This behavior sets a cautious backdrop for market watchers as current sentiment continues to reflect selling pressure and reduced investor confidence without a significant rebound. Avalanche currently trades within a reduced price range of $14.82 to $21.92, with key trading levels in focus. The nearest resistance sits at $25.89, while the closest support lies at $11.69. Indicators present an uneven picture, with a mildly negative summary recommendation near -0.376. The RSI reading of 44.81 adds to the uncertainty, pointing to neither strong overbought nor oversold conditions. Traders could look for potential buying opportunities near the support level while remaining cautious of upward moves toward resistance. The mix of indicators hints at a range-bound period, where both bulls and bears wait to commit, making short-term trades within the defined levels an appealing strategy. Conclusion After comparing SOL and AVAX , it is clear both have strong fundamentals and unique strengths. SOL boasts high-speed transactions and low fees, making it attractive for developers. AVAX provides flexibility with its subnets and consensus mechanism. Both have growing ecosystems and active communities. Predicting which will deliver a 2x return by Q3 2025 involves considering market trends, technological advancements, and user adoption rates. Either project could achieve this milestone, but the choice will depend on specific investment goals and risk tolerance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose above $110,000 for the first time in a month and then pared back those gains, ending the week at $108,000. The market capitalization of all coins ended the week at $3.30 trillion. Here are some of the top catalysts for Bitcoin and most altcoins. Tariff deadline The most important catalyst for the stock and crypto markets will be the end of President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on tariffs, slated for July 9. The US has reached preliminary trade agreements with a few countries, including Vietnam, China, and the U.K. Other top trading partners — Canada, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea — may revert to the high tariffs he announced in April. A restart of his “retaliatory tariffs” will likely be bearish for Bitcoin, altcoins, and the stock market. For example, Bitcoin price plunged to $74,000 after the Liberation Day speech , and then bounced back after he announced the 90-day pause. You might also like: XLM price at risk as Stellar Lumens’ funding rate crashes FOMC minutes Bitcoin and altcoins are also expected to react to the Federal Open Market Committee minutes, scheduled for release on Wednesday. These minutes, for the May 6-7, 2025 meeting, will provide more information about the last meeting, in which officials left interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50%. The Fed minutes will provide hints on when officials expect to cut interest rates, which would be bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins. Still, the odds of a rate cut in July have decreased recently due to the strong nonfarm payrolls data. The data showed that the economy added over 147,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%. Most traders anticipate the bank to cut rates in September if inflation data continues falling. Bitcoin price potential breakout The other key catalyst for Bitcoin and the crypto market will be the potential BTC breakout. The chart below shows that Bitcoin has remained below the all-time high of $111,900 in the past few weeks. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin has also formed a bullish flag pattern, shown in black, and a cup-and-handle pattern. These two patterns often result in greater gains over time. Therefore, a breakout this week could push it to its all-time high, leading to further gains among altcoins. The other top catalysts in the crypto market include upcoming token unlocks by prominent altcoins such as Aptos ( APT ), Flare ( FLR ), and Ethereum Name Service.

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 868,800 followers on the social media platform X that he sees the crypto markets rallying this month amid a slew of bullish catalysts. “It’s the start of a new quarter and a new month. It’s also Jubilant July. I gotta say. I feel extremely refreshed for the first time in a long time with all the positives happening. Stablecoin legislation is moving forward. More rails are being connected with traditional finance, banks and consumers. Crypto will continue to grow as a focus in global markets. Let’s also not forget the fiscal and monetary tailwinds that are coming.” As for the fiscal tailwinds, the analyst says that the US is positioning to ease monetary policies to stimulate economic growth, while Bitcoin and US equities are in a strong uptrend. “If you’re bearish, consider this. The market has, for now, failed to prove a bullish bias to be incorrect. When there is FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), it V reverses into new highs each time. No matter how extreme the FUD. Market structure is intact on high time frames. BTC and stocks are at or around all-time highs. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing outgrowing its debt by spending more. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing lowering interest rates, which in this instance would likely stoke both inflation/growth. If the market proves these ideas to be incorrect, then you can pivot. I see no reason to be bearish on markets with this in mind.” Turning to altcoins, Pentoshi says he’s keeping a close eye on the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market capitalization of crypto, excluding the 10 largest digital assets and stablecoins. The analyst predicts that OTHERS will soar close to $400 billion, indicating massive upside potential for altcoins. “I do think many alts will likely cook for the next few weeks. Just feels like… sellers have run out of momentum. Many of them look better than they have in quite some time. I think you could essentially use last week’s lows as a point we shouldn’t lose on most of these… I think we see others play out something like drawn below.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, OTHERS is trading at $229 billion.

The single is released at a time when Bitcoin’s future remains uncertain, particularly regarding regulatory support from the US government. It could very well reach an All-Time High (ATH) in the coming months. Drake’s new single addressed themes of betrayal, fake friends, and conflict. Drake released a new single titled “What did I miss” ahead of an upcoming album release. Bitcoin traders have taken a keen interest in the album due to its lyrics—the new single references Drake’s ongoing feud with rapper Kendrick Lamar. Drake refers to his conflict with Lamar as being similar to the price volatility of Bitcoin, which can fluctuate significantly from one day to the next. Drake is also a keen gambler and has been referred to as the ‘Drake Curse’ due to his unfortunate picks on UFC, NBA, among other high-profile sporting events. Blockwave, a Bitcoin hardware provider, predicted in 2022 that it would use data from previous innovations that scaled over time, such as automobiles, electricity, and the internet, to forecast Bitcoin adoption. Blockwave predicted that Bitcoin would hit 10% adoption by 2030, using the listed scalability models for technological innovation. It is estimated that Bitcoin currently has a global adoption rate of 4%, meaning that approximately 4% of the world’s population holds Bitcoin. Therefore, using a back-of-the-envelope analysis, we can safely assume that Bitcoin will double from 4% to 10%, which corresponds to a roughly 2x increase in adoption. This could lead to a 2x price increase from $100k to $200k if the scalability model of technological innovation holds. This forecast supports the Bitcoin traders who have been pointing to a $200,000 price target. Drake’s reference to Bitcoin’s volatility may be timely if the price continues to make large returns for crypto traders. Drake released the new single during a YouTube stream titled “ICEMAN EPISODE ONE,” where the Canadian rapper addressed the issue of betrayal and feuds. In the stream, Drake plays the character of a worker on his lunch break. The song is about a friend who has betrayed his trust. He describes this as being similar to the price of Bitcoin, which sometimes serves as an ally when the price rises, but then becomes a traitor when the price falls, leaving Drake with less money. He could be describing his relationships as being similar to gambling, with one moment being on top, and then being betrayed when he is down on his luck. His lyrics describe friends who once stood by his side and now hang out with people who are his enemies. He describes friendship like the price of Bitcoin, which can fluctuate without warning. Bitcoin has been a complicated asset to forecast, changing direction within the blink of an eye and causing much suffering for traders who speculate on margin. The ‘Drake Curse’ refers to the rapper’s history of taking large bets on the NBA and UFC. Drake has lost over $1 million in Bitcoin, betting on NBA games. Drake took a bet on the Dallas Mavericks taking the NBA title. He lost his $ 500,000 Bitcoin bet because the Boston Celtics beat the Mavericks. Within weeks of this failed bet, Drake bet another $500k on the Edmonton Oilers winning the NHL Cup. However, the Panthers beat the Oilers, adding another Loss to Drake’s gambling tally. Maybe Drake could release his gambling blockchain that gives all proceeds to a ‘0% admin fees’ charity such as GiveDirectly? This would transform Drake’s gambling losses into charity donations. The more he loses, the more he gives. The UFC has been of great interest to the Canadian rapper. His most notable loss was betting $450,000 on Israel Adesanya to defeat Dricus du Plessis in 2024. However, he has had some notable successes, such as betting on Alexander Volkanovski to beat Diego Lopes. This was a good bet because Volkanovski had experienced some major losses and appeared to be on the verge of retirement. However, recently, Drake bet on Oliveira beating Topuria, which cost him $ 200,000. Topuria achieved a knock-out in the first round, which would have been very disappointing for Drake to watch. Drake, therefore, has a lot of experience with Bitcoin and gambling, earning the title ‘Drake Curse’. The reference to Bitcoin in his latest song is a reflection of how cryptocurrencies have become a mainstream phenomenon, no longer a fringe movement.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-06 16:55:34

We asked ChatGPT which crypto is a better buy for 2025 H2,https://finbold.com/xrp-or-xlm-we-asked-chatgpt-which-crypto-is-a-better-buy-for-2025-h2/,"With the second half of 2025 now underway, the cryptocurrency market is in a consolidation phase, led by Bitcoin ( BTC ), which is trying to establish support above the $110,000 level. In this environment, investors are possibly weighing which cryptocurrencies offer the best upside. Two tokens, XRP and Stellar ( XLM ), are emerging as notable contenders. Both are designed to enable fast, low-cost cross-border transactions, but they differ in their market positioning, use cases, and adoption strategies. To help determine which asset shows more promise for the remainder of the year, Finbold asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT for its insights. XRP As of July 6, 2025, XRP is trading at approximately $2.27, with a market capitalization of roughly $134 billion, placing it among the top-valued cryptocurrencies. XRP one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Backed by Ripple, ChatGPT noted that XRP has cemented a strong presence in the institutional financial sector, driven by integrations with banks, involvement in central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects, and its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services. XRP’s recent bullish momentum, according to ChatGPT, is supported by solid fundamentals, high liquidity, and increased regulatory clarity following Ripple’s partial legal victory against the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. If market conditions remain favorable, the token could retest the $3 to $4 range, buoyed by its expanding institutional footprint. XLM Meanwhile, Stellar’s XLM is trading at approximately $0.244, with a market cap of about $7.4 billion. Although much smaller in scale than XRP, ChatGPT noted that XLM focuses on financial inclusion, peer-to-peer transfers, microtransactions, and remittances, primarily through its partnership with MoneyGram. XLM one-week price chart. Source: Finbold XLM may appeal to investors seeking higher percentage-based returns, particularly during altseason rallies or periods of speculative activity. However, ChatGPT noted that the token has historically underperformed compared to XRP and remains less prominent in the institutional space. Its future growth will likely depend on Stellar’s ability to strike new partnerships and grow its ecosystem. The verdict Given the differences in scale, adoption, and investor sentiment, ChatGPT offered a clear conclusion: XRP stands out as the stronger buy for the second half of 2025. Ripple’s institutional reach, improving regulatory outlook, and deep exchange liquidity all contribute to a more stable, lower-risk investment profile. Still, for investors with a higher risk tolerance, ChatGPT acknowledged that XLM could serve as a speculative addition to a diversified portfolio, especially if market sentiment shifts or the Stellar network gains meaningful traction. Ultimately, while both assets aim to reshape global payments, ChatGPT’s analysis suggests that XRP is better positioned to deliver consistent returns in the months ahead.

Both the EU and China are escalating measures to sever ties and reliance on each other in critical sectors such as green technologies, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing. China has begun restricting the imports of high-value medical devices from the European Union, intensifying a growing trade dispute between the two countries as a result. China bans high-value EU medical devices On Sunday, China’s finance ministry announced that government procurement of medical equipment from the EU worth more than 45M yuan, approximately $6.3M, will no longer be permitted. This announcement is a direct response to the European Union’s decision last month to limit Chinese participation in public tenders for medical devices within its member states. That was the first time the EU invoked the International Procurement Instrument (IPI). The EU stated that they had unequal access to China’s medical market and so were justified in the ban, saying European companies were routinely denied fair opportunities to compete in Asia’s largest and most lucrative healthcare sector. Notably, the EU’s medical device sector rakes in $70B per year. Tensions have been building between both countries over recent months due to back and forth trade restrictions. The EU’s restrictions fall under its International Procurement Instrument, a law that came into force in 2022 and is aimed at enforcing reciprocity in public procurement markets. In a separate statement, the Chinese commerce ministry criticized the EU’s actions, stating that the EU has insisted on going its own way. “Regrettably, despite China’s goodwill and sincerity, the EU has insisted on going its own way, taking restrictive measures and building new protectionist barriers.” In addition to banning direct procurement of EU-made medical devices valued above 45M yuan, Beijing is blocking imports of devices from other countries that include more than 50% EU-made components by contract value. These measures came into effect immediately on Sunday, July 6. The commerce ministry clarified that the new policy will not affect products made by European firms operating within China. Trade frictions persist Tensions have been building between the EU and China over the past months. Last month, the European Commission announced new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. The European Commission cited subsidies that distorted the global market as a reason for the decision. In retaliation, China launched an investigation into EU brandy imports , which concluded just days ago with the imposition of duties of up to 34.9% on EU-origin brandy, most notably French cognac. Other major French producers like Pernod Ricard, LVMH, and Remy Cointreau were exempted from these duties under undisclosed conditions. Analysts view the medical devices ban as a strategic means of protecting Beijing by signaling its willingness to push back forcefully against European restrictions. China’s finance ministry emphasized the principle of reciprocity, saying it had no choice but to implement countermeasures after repeated diplomatic overtures were met with resistance. “China has no choice but to adopt reciprocal restrictive measures,” the ministry stated bluntly. So far, the European Union has not issued an official response. The EU delegation in Beijing also did not immediately respond to media requests for comment following China’s announcement. A planned EU-China leaders’ summit is scheduled to take place in China later this July. The gathering is expected to focus on economic relations, climate change, and global security, but the deepening trade rift could overshadow the intended agenda. Observers say the timing of Beijing’s announcement could be a deliberate effort to apply pressure ahead of the summit. While both countries have emphasized the importance of dialogue and cooperation, the current trajectory of trade policy points to growing fragmentation between the second and third largest economies in the world. For European medical device manufacturers, the new Chinese restrictions could deal a significant blow, especially for companies that relied on large government contracts. Multinational firms will also need to evaluate whether or not to localize more of their production in China or seek alternative markets. Likewise, the EU’s restrictions will likely continue to exclude Chinese firms from a share of public healthcare tenders in Europe.

The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $108,000 mark, showing signs of indecision amongst the investors. With the coin’s indecisive price action, the conversation has been about when the Bitcoin price will return to its all-time high. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data shows that investors are becoming increasingly confident in the long-term promise of the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio Below 1: On-Chain Analyst In a July 5 post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost revealed that Bitcoin has continued to flow out of centralized exchanges over the past few months. The online crypto pundit mentioned that this trend reflects the growing confidence of investors in the long term. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins This on-chain observation is based on the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio 30DMA, a metric that measures the volume of BTC flowing in and out of centralized exchanges over a period of 30 days. A high ratio (>1) indicates more inflows than outflows into exchanges, signaling increased selling pressure for the premier cryptocurrency. On the other hand, a low ratio (<1) implies that more coins are flowing out of rather than into centralized exchanges. When the Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio has a low value, it suggests that investors are accumulating and holding their coins in the long term. According to Darkfost, the Bitcoin monthly outflow/inflow ratio recently fell to around 0.9, its lowest level since the bear market of 2023. With the metric now beneath the 1 threshold, it means that Bitcoin exchange outflows are dominant, reflecting a strong and sustained demand on the spot market. The on-chain analyst said: As of today, demand remains present as outflows continue to dominate, with a growing number of long-term holders stepping in. Ultimately, Darkfost believes that the confidence being shown in Bitcoin’s long-term promise is expected, considering the growing adoption by major corporations and governments, most notably in the United States. “BTC is gradually evolving into a store of value, increasingly used to strengthen treasury strategies,” the crypto analyst added. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $108,103, reflecting a mere 0.3% increase in the past 24 hours.

As a result, market analyst Tektonic believes that SHIB is poised for an 18% rally as its burn rate surges. The market analyst pointed out, “ Shiba Inu is currently holding a bullish technical structure, signaling the potential for an 18% price rally. The sharp spike in the SHIB burn rate—up over 12,000%— reflects growing supply reduction pressure, which could act as a catalyst for upward price movement. All eyes are now on whether this momentum will trigger a breakout.” At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at the $0.00001179 zone. Therefore, the $0.0000119 level should be given a watchful eye because it might trigger the next leg up for Shiba Inu. Crypto enthusiast Degen Profit acknowledged, “SHIB price could see a 24% rally if it breaks the $0.0000119 resistance at the upper trendline of its falling wedge pattern, a bullish signal suggesting weakening bearish control. A successful breakout might push SHIB toward $0.0000148, or even $0.0000177 in a stronger rally.” Source: Degen Profit Given that SHIB’s burn rate has been skyrocketing to the tune of 12,833%, the meme coin’s total supply has been diminishing. In line with basic supply-demand economics, lower supply with steady or rising demand typically drives prices higher. Therefore, this paints a bullish Shiba Inu picture, given that 410 trillion SHIB tokens were recently permanently removed from circulation, shrinking the meme coin’s total supply by 41%.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-06 17:22:00

According to a post by Coin Bureau, this valuation comes ahead of what could be a 2026 initial public offering (IPO), as noted in the bank’s latest Crypto Digest. Ripple has often faced regulatory hurdles due to its use of XRP, especially in the U.S. This new valuation from DBS signals a possible shift in how major institutions view its long-term potential, and Coin Bureau believes Wall Street will follow suit. Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Support Market observers and analysts quickly picked up on the implications of this valuation. Many interpret DBS’s assessment not just as a financial endorsement, but as a sign of increasing regulatory clarity around Ripple and XRP. Participants in the crypto community noted that institutional narratives, along with ongoing legal developments, are aligning in Ripple’s favor. This latest move adds to growing speculation that Ripple may finally be approaching mainstream financial acceptance, especially with discussions about ETFs and large-scale investor interest. The valuation could be viewed as institutional recognition of Ripple’s foundational role in cross-border payments infrastructure and its expanding global footprint. XRP Community’s Reaction Reactions across the crypto community ranged from impressed to strategic. One user emphasized that such a move likely indicates that large financial institutions are watching XRP and Ripple, and this interest could extend to inclusion in future financial systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While the IPO is still tentative and dependent on several regulatory and market variables, the confidence expressed by DBS is being read as a broader market signal, and the community has expressed excitement. Some community members also believe Ripple is undervalued, as its escrowed XRP is worth over $76 billion. However, what’s more important is institutional trust , and this level of validation could trigger capital rotation from speculative assets into more established crypto-based infrastructure. IPO Speculation and Market Strategy For Ripple, a 2026 IPO would represent a major evolution in its public profile and investor access. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed in early 2025 that there would be no IPO in 2025 , and the community is looking toward 2026 for this major step that could give XRP a notable boost. Ripple’s ecosystem has matured substantially over the past few years, with increasing adoption in international remittance corridors and partnerships with central banks for central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Calling out this development, leading market analyst Javon Marks pointed out, “ADA, fairly fresh off of a recent breakout, still looks to be on track to have a significant upside move in the works, consisting of an over 120% surge. We continue to target $2+.” Source: Javon Marks Crypto analyst Lingrid is of a similar opinion that Cardano is gearing up for a bullish run as price continues to hold the $0.55-$ steadily.56 zone. She noted, “ADA is testing a strong support zone after a prolonged downtrend, showing early signs of potential reversal. The price is stabilizing around 0.55–0.56, a zone that previously acted as a base for bullish impulse. A breakout above the descending target line could push price toward 0.68–0.70 in the short term.” Source: Lingrid At the time of writing, Cardano was sitting at $0.58 with a daily trading volume of $353 million. Cardano’s Open Interest Goes Through the Roof Cardano futures traders have staked over $723 million in open interest, signaling growing conviction despite just a 0.99% daily uptick, according to CoinGlass data. With favorable funding rates and leveraged positioning, the Cardano market sentiment is showing optimism. This is because more traders, especially institutional investors, are entering ADA futures, signalling deeper market engagement. Therefore, the uptick in Cardano futures OI reflects significant confidence from large investors and traders betting on future price appreciation, which is being fueled by ecosystem growth, speculative momentum, and technical triggers. For instance, Cardano is already in oversold conditions, given that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to the 23 level, indicating that an uptrend may be on the horizon. Meanwhile, Bloomberg analysts recently speculated that the Cardano ETF approval rate stood at 90% , with an exchange-traded fund deemed a game-changer in the ADA ecosystem.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-06 17:25:36

This phase is attracting serious investors who recognize the project’s AI-native blockchain architecture, featuring a dedicated virtual machine and a consensus model rewarding meaningful computation. Unlike Dogecoin, which continues to rely solely on meme buzz and viral hype for attention, Lightchain AI is drawing traction through tangible milestones and growing developer interest. As the July 2025 mainnet launch approaches, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a technology-driven contender, gaining momentum where real value and innovation matter most. Dogecoin Rides Social Waves Without Strategic Market Direction Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to experience price fluctuations driven primarily by social media trends and celebrity endorsements, rather than by substantial technological advancements or strategic market positioning. As of May 30, 2025, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.21, reflecting a slight decline from recent highs. Analysts suggest that while the coin has witnessed a 40% rally recently, its price remains susceptible to volatility due to its reliance on community-driven momentum . Despite efforts by the Dogecoin Foundation to enhance its utility, such as the development of Dogebox for decentralized payments, the coin’s long-term viability remains uncertain without a clear and sustainable development path. While Dogecoin’s community engagement and media presence contribute to its short-term price movements, the absence of a robust technological framework and strategic direction may limit its potential for sustained growth. Lightchain AI Activates Bonus Round Right After Completing 15 Presale Stages Lightchain AI has officially entered its Bonus Round after successfully completing all 15 presale stages, raising over $21 million. This phase offers the final opportunity to acquire LCAI tokens at a fixed price of $0.007125 before the mainnet launch in July 2025. The Bonus Round is strategically designed to support validator onboarding, infrastructure deployment, and developer grants, marking a significant step toward the project’s full-scale activation. Notably, the original 5% team token allocation has been eliminated and reallocated to fund a $150,000 developer grant program, incentivizing the creation of decentralized AI applications and protocols. With the mainnet launch approaching, Lightchain AI is poised to deliver a robust and scalable platform for decentralized AI applications, offering early supporters a unique opportunity to participate in the project’s growth.

The 5th stage of presale has already sold over 60%. The current size of funds that Mutuum Finance has already collected exceed the mark of over $11.8 million with over 12,700 holders. Although TRON (TRX) still remains one of the top altcoins, it is Mutuum Finance that is catching everyone going as a promising next crypto to explode, creeping much lower than its estimated price. Mutuum Finance has a potential of soaring towards $1 and beyond. TRON (TRX) Maintains Momentum Amid Bullish Market Outlook TRON (TRX) has been demonstrating its strength on the crypto market, where it is trading at a price of $0.28. TRON features a high-throughput blockchain and significant role in decentralized applications (dApps) and stablecoin ecosystems, making it one of the busiest Layer-1 blockchains in terms of the transaction volume. Although reaching the mark of a dollar at the time of writing is not a feasible prediction concerning TRON in the short-term, it may be a wise choice in the new bull run because its consistent results and adaptive potential in the real world can be considered good pieces of evidence. In the meantime, another low-cap competitor Mutuum Finance is attracting the interest of investors as well. Mutuum Finance Presale Achieves Milestone More than $11.8 million and more than 12,700 investors have been drawn to the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. This kind of winds is the sign of increasing confidence of investors in short-term success of the project and its long-term vision. MUTM is priced at $0.03, which is the lowest-possible price before a 16% hike in the next presale stage. $50K Bug Bounty Unveiled as Mutuum Finance Charges Ahead Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty with CertiK. It is inclusive in the sense that, it is distributed according to the four variable degrees of severity that are, critical, major, minor and low. It is also the form of communicating the fact that the project is interested in security and transparency. Proven Dual-Lending Formula Transformation of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a hybrid lending platform that will serve the active as well as passive DeFi users. Users can earn passive income by lending their USDT via smart contracts pools which provide stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending mechanism. In addition, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model permits lenders and borrowers to be as engaged as they could ever be in reciprocating terms of a transaction and do not require a third party to act on their behalf. The paradigm is more prevalent for the clients of less secure assets. Leaderboard and $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance values its first-time investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will see 10 winners receive $10,000 MUTM. This is to celebrate the investors’ first trust in the project. As the next bull run approaches, low-cost tokens with high growth potential are in the spotlight, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a standout contender. With over $11.8 million raised and 12,700+ holders already on board, the project has sold out more than 60% of Stage 5 at just $0.03 per token. Investors in this stage are positioning for serious upside, especially with a projected surge toward $1 and beyond. Backed by a CertiK-audited dual lending protocol, a $50K bug bounty, and a generous $100,000 giveaway, Mutuum is blending innovation with investor rewards. Secure your MUTM tokens now before the price increases in the next presale stage.

After a period of slowed momentum, digital collectibles have rebounded with a 10.44% increase in total sales volume, reaching $136.5 million. This marks the second straight week of growth for the sector, signaling renewed interest among traders and collectors. Strong Crypto Prices Support NFT Growth The rise in NFT sales is coinciding with the broader crypto market’s upward trend. Bitcoin (BTC) has climbed to $108,000, while Ethereum (ETH) has also gained 3.6% over the past week. The global crypto market cap is now $3.33 trillion, higher than last week’s $3.21 trillion. This growth in top crypto assets is revitalizing the NFT sector, attracting both seasoned investors and newcomers. Although the sales volume has increased, the number of NFT transactions has dropped by nearly 20%. However, the number of buyers stayed the same, and the number of sellers increased by 8.09%. This means that fewer trades are occurring, but the trades that do take place are larger in value. Immutable Leads as Polygon Gains Ground Among all blockchains, Immutable remains the leader in NFT sales. It generated $43.9 million this week, representing a 30% increase from the previous week. Its growth continues to be helped by popular gaming collections. The platform also has very low wash trading, meaning most of the activity is real and organic. Polygon, now known as POL (formerly MATIC), moved into second place with $25 million in sales. That is a 51.53% increase from last week. However, Polygon’s wash trading rose sharply, reaching over $564,000. Ethereum blockchain dropped to third place with $22.5 million in NFT sales, a 8.63% decrease. Wash trading on Ethereum also increased slightly. Still, the Ethereum network remains one of the most used blockchains in the NFT space. Other blockchains, such as Mythos, BNB Chain, and Bitcoin, also remained active. Mythos experienced a slight increase in sales, while BNB saw a corresponding drop. The Bitcoin network reached $8.7 million in sales, representing over 12% growth. In terms of buyers, Polygon saw the highest increase, followed by Bitcoin and Mythos. Gaming NFTs are also gaining ground, with top collections like Guild of Guardians Heroes and The Courtyard seeing strong sales growth. CryptoPunks Reclaim the Spotlight CryptoPunks, one of the oldest and most well-known NFT collections , is rising again. It climbed to ninth place with $2 million in sales, and the collection has seen improvements in both activity and user interest. Some CryptoPunks were sold for very high prices. One Punk sold for 150 ETH, equivalent to approximately $389,000. Others sold for between $150,000 and $200,000. This shows that collectors are still willing to pay large amounts for rare NFTs.

Scott said Elon simply isn’t well-liked enough to pull off a political movement and should instead focus on running his companies. Elon, who leads Tesla and SpaceX, has been pushing the idea of a third party on X for around two weeks and has decided to go ahead with it after breaking ranks with President Trump and Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Trump signed the bill into law Friday. Elon, furious over its long-term financial costs, said it undermines all the work done by his now-defunct Department of Government Efficiency project (DOGE). Bessent tells Elon to stop embarrassing himself “Elon was never popular in the polls,” Scott said. He praised the policy goals of DOGE but said Elon himself doesn’t have national support. Though this tension between the two men isn’t anything new. Elon quit his special government role in May after clashing with Trump. And while Scott kept it diplomatic at first, this latest interview shows the gloves are off. The Treasury Secretary told CNN he believes the board members at Elon’s companies “wanted him to come back and run those companies,” implying they weren’t happy about his political adventures. “They will be encouraging him to focus on his business activities, not his political activities,” Scott said. Elon’s beef with Trump centers on the deficit projections of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is expected to blow a $3.9 trillion hole in the national debt over the next decade. The estimate came from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Elon posted that the bill “makes a mockery” of everything his DOGE team built while inside the government. He also said DOGE had become a “whipping boy for everything.” After Trump won the election, Elon lobbied hard for his buddy Howard Lutnick, the former Cantor Fitzgerald CEO, to become Treasury Secretary. Trump chose Scott instead and gave Howard the Department of Commerce post. Elon, as always, had a public meltdown over that, though he made sure to keep it strictly about Scott, not Trump. Shouting match, body-check, and threats of deportation In April, things got physical. After a tense meeting with Trump, Elon allegedly body-checked Scott, according to Steve Bannon, a MAGA-aligned podcaster. Scott hasn’t confirmed the incident, but he hasn’t denied it either. Weeks later, on the Pod Force One podcast, Scott compared himself to a “ninja” and said Elon “fancies himself more of a Viking.” Trump hasn’t fully turned on Elon yet, but he hasn’t stayed silent either. The president has publicly floated the idea of cutting federal subsidies to Elon’s companies and once said he might explore the option of deporting him. Elon, originally from South Africa, is now a US citizen. Republicans think Elon’s opposition to the megabill may have more to do with the removal of Biden-era green energy subsidies, something that hit Tesla hard. Elon denies that’s the reason, saying his main concern is the massive spike in federal debt. The America Party, which Elon says will focus “extremely concentrated force at a precise location on the battlefield,” is expected to target just a few tight House and Senate races. His explanation referenced a Greek military strategy used by Epaminondas at the Battle of Leuctra. Elon hasn’t named any candidates or races yet but confirmed his team has officially filed to make the party real. He claimed the plan is to break the “uniparty system,” referring to both Democrats and Republicans. His followers on X had voted in favor of the idea during a poll Elon ran before making the announcement public. Elon hasn’t said whether he’ll run for office himself, but he’s made it clear he wants to change the balance of power in Congress. For now, the billionaire seems to be focused on finding pressure points rather than building a full national coalition. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Now, smart money is targeting what many are calling the most asymmetric play of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently priced at just $0.03 in its Phase 5 presale, is attracting fresh capital from both DeFi whales and retail investors. With 60% of Phase 5 tokens already sold, $11.7 million raised, and more than 12,700 holders on board, this early-stage DeFi protocol is heating up fast. One Avalanche (AVAX) trader who swapped into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) early this month is already sitting on a 30% value increase. While Avalanche (AVAX) might have given its best gains to early adopters, MUTM is still in the runway phase, gearing up for liftoff with a full roadmap packed with real DeFi milestones. It’s not another meme coin hoping for a listing—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a complete lending and yield ecosystem with all the infrastructure that serious DeFi investors demand. A DeFi framework with real expansion plans Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is far more than a single-feature project. Its roadmap outlines a comprehensive development trajectory, including the launch of a beta lending platform, the creation of a protocol-backed overcollateralized stablecoin, upcoming Layer-2 integration, and the deployment of yield-generating staking via mtTokens. These features are designed to bring real-world adoption and functional utility to the DeFi ecosystem. Unlike tokens that rely solely on market sentiment or temporary hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured around long-term sustainability. The stablecoin in development will be backed by overcollateralized positions within the protocol, supported by protocol-owned assets. This system is designed to reinforce the treasury and stabilize lending operations, enhancing trust for users. The stablecoin will serve as a core liquidity instrument—expanding collateral options and improving borrower flexibility. Scalability is also a central component of the project. The upcoming Layer-2 integration will reduce gas costs and increase throughput for all transactions—particularly useful for high-frequency lending, borrowing, and staking operations. By leveraging Layer-2 technology, Mutuum aims to deliver an institutional-grade experience for retail participants, removing common frictions found in first-generation DeFi protocols. Token utility is built into every layer of the protocol. Stakers of mtTokens—representing interest-accruing deposit positions—will be eligible to earn dividends paid from protocol fee revenue. These rewards are distributed through smart contracts, funded by real economic activity rather than inflationary emissions. Additionally, part of the collected fees will be used for ongoing token buybacks, creating consistent purchasing pressure and long-term value support for the MUTM token. This model ensures that every lending cycle strengthens the token’s economic foundation and incentivizes long-term participation from both lenders and borrowers. Security, stability, and a balanced lending ecosystem Security is a top concern in decentralized finance, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) addresses this with a $50,000 CertiK Bug Bounty Program. This program encourages whitehat developers to scrutinize smart contracts across all modules and report vulnerabilities before they become threats. It’s part of a broader effort to ensure that both capital safety and contract integrity are at the foundation of the protocol’s growth. Mutuum’s lending structure will operate on a dual engine. First is the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system that will allow users to deposit into decentralized lending pools and earn interest passively through mtTokens. These mtTokens are yield-bearing assets that auto-accrue lending rewards and can also be staked to unlock additional dividends. For those looking for customizable lending, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) feature will enable users to structure direct agreements, define terms, and use a variety of supported assets—including tokens like SHIB or DOGE—as collateral. For those who missed Avalanche (AVAX) under $5 or LINK under $0.50, this is the moment to act. At just $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still early enough to capture real upside before major milestones start landing in Q3 and Q4 2025. Once the beta platform goes live, and lending volumes start feeding into staking pools, the numbers will begin to reflect what early buyers already know: this isn’t another presale—it’s a protocol in motion. Every summer brings its breakout star. Avalanche (AVAX) already had its moment. Now, the spotlight is shifting. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is next—and entry at $0.03 might not last much longer.

By 2028, the minimum WLD price might drop to $3.37 while its maximum can reach $4.01. The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $6.55 in 2031. Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure, which aligns with the world’s prediction. In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency. Overview Cryptocurrency Worldcoin Token WLD Price $0.8788 Market Cap $1.46B Trading Volume (24-hour) $131.42 Circulating Supply 1.69B WLD All-time High $11.82 Mar 09, 2024 All-time Low $0.5817, June 2, 2025 24-hour High $0.88 24-hour Low $0.865 Worldcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 0.671451 (-24.86%) Price Volatility 10.49% 50-Day SMA $ 1.093934 14-Day RSI 47.29 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days $ 1.2833 Worldcoin WLD Sees Bullish Movement as Price Climbs to $0.8893, Marking a 2.26% Increase. Bullish Breakout WLD broke out of consolidation near $0.8704, signaling renewed buying momentum. Strong Support The $0.8574 support held firm, confirming solid buyer interest. Testing Resistance WLD is nearing the $0.8906 resistance; a breakout could trigger further gains. Worldcoin (WLD) has recorded a positive price shift, trading at $0.8893 on July 6th, 2025, which reflects a 2.26% intraday gain. The recent upswing is drawing investor attention, especially with the asset approaching a key resistance level. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that resistance is positioned at $0.8574, while support is marked at $0.8906, indicating a near breach of short-term technical boundaries. The ongoing price action signals renewed buying interest as bullish momentum continues building. Worldcoin is gaining traction again, with social metrics and market interest rising. The platform’s activity on Ethereum and Optimism chains is being monitored closely, although it’s important to note that data under Analytics excludes tokens on the World Chain. The current market behavior is supported by low volatility and a steady increase in volume, as shown in the visible price pattern. WLD has moved steadily from an intraday low of $0.8574 to a high of $0.8906, demonstrating a controlled but persistent uptrend. Worldcoin 1-day price chart: WLD approaches key resistance after bullish rebound The daily chart presents a clear picture of consolidation followed by a breakout. The session opened with sideways action near $0.8704, maintaining slight bullish sentiment early on. As the market progressed, sellers briefly took control, pushing prices into a red zone where WLD dipped toward its daily low. However, support of around $0.8574 was held firm, preventing any breakdown and stabilizing the price trajectory. WLDUSD Chart By TradingView The 24-hour trading cycle saw a consistent battle between buyers and sellers, yet the buyers gained control after a prolonged consolidation. Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) may now be trending higher, reflecting increased buying pressure. Momentum indicators also suggest sustained strength, with volume rising toward the final hours of the session. WLD’s resilience above $0.870 underscores strong market confidence as bullish traders eye higher targets. Worldcoin 4-hour price chart: WLD short-term trend reversal confirmed as buyers regain control The 4-hour chart further confirms a bullish reversal pattern, initiated from a solid support zone at $0.8574. The price formed a base at that level, attracting buyers and triggering a steady climb. The structure shows higher lows and sustained upward pressure, with strong green candles breaking past minor resistances during late session hours. WLDUSD Chart By TradingView Momentum continues to build with a clean move above $0.880, bringing WLD close to testing $0.8906, now acting as short-term resistance. The consistent upward slope on lower timeframes suggests a continuation is likely if bulls manage to secure a close above this threshold. With short-term consolidation zones now acting as support, the price is trending toward a new potential high. What can you expect from the Worldcoin price next? With Worldcoin (WLD) now trading near the key resistance level of $0.8906, price action in the coming sessions will be critical. A confirmed breakout above this level could open the door for short-term upside, potentially pushing the price toward the $0.90 psychological barrier and beyond. On the other hand, failure to close above resistance may lead to minor pullbacks, with $0.8704 and $0.8574 serving as immediate support zones. Market participants will be closely watching whether bulls maintain momentum or if sellers step in to defend overhead resistance.

Worldcoin (WLD) continues to attract attention due to its unique identity-based blockchain model and expanding ecosystem. While recent price action shows short-term bullish strength, its long-term investment potential depends on broader adoption, regulatory clarity, and integration across supported networks like Ethereum and Optimism. Traders may find opportunity in current volatility, but long-term investors should evaluate fundamentals beyond price, such as network utility, development roadmap, and tokenomics. As always, risk management is essential, given WLD’s sensitivity to market cycles and sentiment shifts. Why is WLD Price up today The rise in WLD’s price to $0.8893, marking a 2.26% increase, can be attributed to a combination of technical breakout and renewed market interest. The asset broke above its recent consolidation zone near $0.8704, triggering fresh buying activity as it approached the next key resistance at $0.8906. Increased trading volume and improved sentiment across the broader crypto market may also be contributing to the bullish momentum. Activity on the Ethereum and Optimism chains, along with growing visibility for the Worldcoin ecosystem, is helping support short-term gains as traders react to the positive shift in structure. Will Worldcoin reach $50? Reaching $50 for Worldcoin would be a significant challenge, requiring substantial adoption, demand, and market growth. Given its current price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics, a jump to that level by 2025 seems unlikely without breakthroughs or widespread use. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. What will be the value of Worldcoin in 2025? Based on current trends and market conditions, Worldcoin’s average value is predicted to be $1.86, with the potential to reach a high of $1.92 by 2025. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; hence, many may consider investing in the token as it may have a promising long-term future.

Pepe ( PEPE ), the second-largest Ethereum ( ETH ) meme coin, has dropped to $0.000010 — down 40% from its highest point in May. Here are the top three reasons why it will bounce back soon. Pepe Coin price forms falling wedge The first main reason why the Pepe token may rebound soon is that it has formed a falling wedge, a popular bullish reversal pattern. A falling wedge comprises two descending and converging trendlines, which have neared their confluence levels. A wedge is one of the most bullish patterns in technical analysis. Pepe price has also remained above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since March this year. It has also remained above the ultimate support of the Murrey Math Lines at $0.000005960. You might also like: XLM price at risk as Stellar Lumens’ funding rate crashes Therefore, the token is likely to experience a strong bullish breakout, with the following key point to watch being at $0.00001625, representing an increase of over 70% from the current level. A drop below the weak, stop-and-reverse level at $0.000007450 will invalidate the bullish view. Pepe price chart | Source: crypto.news High volume and open interest There are signs that Pepe’s demand and popularity is still high. CoinGecko data shows that its 24-hour volume was over $400 million on Sunday, July 6. While this volume was lower than its historical levels, it was significantly higher than that of other popular meme coins. For example, Shiba Inu (SHIB) had a 24-hour volume of less than $70 million. CoinGlass data shows that Pepe’s futures open interest has remained steady in the past few weeks. It had a 24-hour open interest of $522 million, higher than the year-to-date low of $173 million. A high open interest is a bullish catalyst for an asset because it indicates increased demand. Pepe open interest | Source: CoinGlass Pepe’s exchange balances in a free fall Further data shows that investors are not selling their Pepe Coins despite their recent crash. Santiment data shows that Pepe’s reserves on exchanges have dropped to a multi-year low of 101.7 trillion. This is a significant decline from the year-to-date high of 158.9 trillion tokens. Pepe exchange balances | Source: Santiment The falling exchange supply and the rising whale accumulation mean that the token may rebound soon. According to Nansen , the number of Pepe tokens held by whales has increased by 4.1% over the last 30 days to 7.6 trillion.

Ethereum has spent a majority of the past two months consolidating above the $2,425 support zone, in what might be an accumulation phase before a major breakout. Nonetheless, MasterAnanda’s analysis suggests that Ethereum is on the verge of entering its strongest bullish wave in years, with a breakout target that starts at $5,791. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Ethereum To Break Out To At Least $5,791 MasterAnanda’s weekly candlestick chart shows a large ETH wedge pattern with consistently rising lows from June 2022 to April 2025. On the other hand, price highs have been relatively flat, specifically around the March and December 2024 peaks. Ethereum’s behavior since April has been marked by low volatility and sideways movement, which often precedes large market moves. The most interesting move was when its price dropped to as low as $1,470 on April 9 before quickly rebounding and establishing a rounded bottom formation. Nonetheless, the analyst noted that Ethereum is due a major, major bullish wave. The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will. Now that the current consolidation is sitting right above trendline support, MasterAnanda argues that this formation will soon give way to a powerful bullish wave. The target is a minimum of $5,791, which is based on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. Interestingly, the analyst noted that it is possible for the Ethereum price to reach $8,500 or higher in the longer term if it breaks above the resistance trendline, which is currently at $4,000. This prediction is backed by improving fundamentals and current on-chain data showing accumulation through Spot Ethereum ETFs. Wyckoff Accumulation Says It’s Ethereum’s Turn Crypto analyst Ted Pillows shared a separate but related analysis on the social platform X that’s based on a Wyckoff accumulation pattern playing out on ETH’s weekly chart. Pillows called the selloff to the $1,470 low in April as the “Spring” phase of Wyckoff accumulation, followed by a successful “Test” of a September 2024 support around $2,145, and the gradual move back to resistance now. According to his projection, Ethereum’s breakout will unfold in stages. The first stage is a push to $3,000, then a correction, followed by a rise to $4,000 in Q3. Only after these steps will the parabolic leg truly begin. The parabolic leg, in this case, should take Ethereum above $5,700, if the price action plays out as predicted. Related Reading: XRP’s Time Is Now, Says Pundit—Don’t Snooze On The ‘Biggest Transfer Of Wealth’ His analysis closely aligns with MasterAnanda’s call for a minimum $5,791 target. Just as the Wyckoff accumulation pattern pumped Bitcoin to its most recent all-time high, Ethereum may be on the verge of its own spotlight moment in this ongoing 2025 bull cycle. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,516.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is at a low price of $0.03, the lowest it’ll ever be ahead of upcoming price increases. Phase 5 Presale of Mutuum Finance is currently more than 60% sold and is available at just $0.03. Over 12,700 investors participated in the Mutuum Finance presale. It has already raised the amount that exceeds more than $11.8 million. While Wall Street speculates on the regulatory future of XRP and potential ETF approval, investors are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance which could hit $1.5, a 50x from its current price. XRP Poised for Uptick as ETF Hype Peaks XRP is trading around $2.29. The recent SEC approval of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF, which includes XRP, has ignited excitement, boosting perceptions that a standalone XRP spot ETF could soon follow, with analysts now placing approval odds at around 95%. Additionally, Ripple’s launch of an Ethereum-compatible sidechain on the XRP Ledger adds tangible utility potential. XRP recently broke above the $2.23 ceiling and reclaimed the 100-day EMA, setting the stage for a move toward $2.50 and possibly the $3.00–$3.50 range by Q3, contingent on ETF momentum and macro factors. That said, some traders are diversifying into early-stage tokens like Mutuum Finance as they search for potentially larger short-term returns. Investors Rally Behind Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is gaining significant momentum in Phase 5 of the presale. The project stands out from others by offering a scalable system of finance with a real-world use case. Investor interest is gaining momentum with the project having raised well over $11.8 million already and having over 12,700 token holders. Introducing a DeFi Lending Model Mutuum Finance introduces a non-custodial liquidity protocol in which users retain their total ownership of assets while they participate in decentralized lending. The project adopts a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending to foster increased flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to deliver automated lending without any human intervention and instead, the smart contracts respond to the market by offering dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model removes middlemen and thus offers a direct link between lenders and borrowers. The model is highly favored by users in dealing with volatile assets where flexibility and tailor-made terms are required. CertiK-Audited with a $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is also operating on the development of the fully collateralized Ethereum-based USD-backed stablecoin. The project incorporates smart contracts that are audited by security company, CertiK. Besides the guarantee of ensuring good maintenance of the code, this audit signifies that the team will be persistent to build a safe protocol DeFi. In order to reinforce this commitment, Mutuum Finance has implemented its Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK through which it has allocated $50,000 in USDT rewards. The program has four levels, critical, major, minor, and low, and makes sure that any level of vulnerabilities are discovered and rewarded. While XRP’s ETF buzz and technical breakout hint at a potential run toward $3.50, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight among investors hunting for exponential gains. Priced at just $0.03 and already 60% sold out in Phase 5, Mutuum has raised over $11.8 million from more than 12,700 participants. With its DeFi lending protocol, dual lending models, and a CertiK audit backed by a $50,000 bug bounty, MUTM is positioning itself as a serious coin in the market. Early projections now place its price target at $1.50, a potential 50x rally from today’s level. Join the presale now and lock in before the price climbs.

Both once held great promise but have faced challenges. Could this be the moment for their resurgence? This article explores their potential for a comeback, diving into the factors that could propel these cryptocurrencies back to the forefront of the market. Polkadot Price Downtrend: Recent Lows and Key Price Levels Polkadot experienced a monthly decline of about 12.3%, with the past six months reflecting a larger slide of roughly 56.8%. Weekly trends show a smaller dip near 2.33%, indicating persistent downward pressure that has kept prices subdued. Historical performance reveals a coin struggling to recover from losses, with trading activity demonstrating a steady erosion of momentum. Price movements over these periods show that sellers have taken control, leading to a prolonged bearish regime without any significant corrective surges. Currently, Polkadot trades within a range of approximately $2.83 at the low end and $4.16 at the high end. Key levels include a primary resistance near $4.92 and a secondary resistance around $6.25, while immediate support is evident near $2.26 with another level around $0.93. Technical readings such as an RSI of 41.45 and indicators like the Awesome Oscillator at -0.232 underline the dominance of bearish sentiment. Traders might look for buying opportunities if prices approach the support around $2.26, but a break above the $4.92 resistance could signal a potential reversal. The market appears to be in a sideways pattern, although prevailing indicators suggest further caution and controlled short-term trades within these defined price levels. Cosmos (ATOM): Past Trends and Current Price Levels Analysis Cosmos has experienced a modest decline over the last month with a drop of -2.27%. In the past six months, the coin's value has contracted significantly by -46.34%, highlighting a period of persistent downward movement. Over the week, a minor adjustment of -0.038% indicates minimal short-term shifts compared to longer-term trends. This behavior points to the coin's volatility and emphasizes the need for cautious market entry. The transition from higher price levels into a compressed range reflects overall investor uncertainty, suggesting that recovery will depend on renewed buying interest. Cosmos trades within a range between $3.56 and $4.63. Key levels include primary resistance around $5.16 and secondary resistance at $6.22, while nearest support is at $3.03 with additional safety near $1.97. Currently, bulls and bears are balanced, with no side dominating price action. Mixed technical indicators show the Awesome Oscillator is slightly negative, the Momentum Indicator modestly positive, and RSI around 46.15. This indicates no clear trend, suggesting cautious trading. Traders might consider long positions if prices surpass resistance, while a drop below support could trigger further downside risk. Adaptive trading strategies are recommended to manage risks effectively. Conclusion DOT and ATOM both show potential for strong performance in the upcoming altcoin season. Their innovative features and robust platforms set them apart. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, their solid foundations suggest promising prospects. Attention to their development will be key in judging their future success. Both coins have unique strengths that could help them reclaim previous highs. Their future trajectory will depend on continued innovation and market conditions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Analysts Make Bold Call,https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-price-to-hit-6k-this-year-analysts-make-bold-call/,"If pseudonymous analyst Weslad is to be believed, Ethereum (ETH) is caught in a tug-of-war between wildly differing futures: a historic surge past $6,000 or a soul-sapping plunge to $1,800. The market technician claims that ETH is completing a massive ABCDE wave structure within a years-long “symmetrical pennant,” which can only mean one thing: explosion. The Roaring Bull Case In a recent breakdown , Weslad explained that Ethereum’s price action since its $4,851 all-time high has formed a giant consolidation pattern. According to him, this structure is now approaching a critical inflection point known as wave D, testing its upper boundary. At the same time, a bullish Inverse Head and Shoulders (IH&S) pattern is emerging on the daily chart, with its neckline acting as stubborn resistance near $2,855. This technical confluence suggests a coiled spring ready to unleash tremendous energy into the market, leading the analyst to state unequivocally: “A confirmed breakout above the neckline [$2,855] would likely validate both the IH&S and the breakout from wave D, setting the stage for a potential expansion move toward the $6,000 target and beyond.” Weslad’s audacious target found an ally in fellow strategist Jeremy Fielder, who declared in a video posted on X: “We’re looking at $6,500 Ethereum by the end of the year and then a possible 10,000 Ethereum in early next year… Regulation is now pro-crypto. That’s all you need to know.” He based his argument on the accelerating adoption of Web3 and a favorable regulatory shift, dismissing granular metrics in favor of a sweeping bullish tide. While not as lofty a milestone as Weslad’s and Fielder’s, market watcher Titan of Crypto’s $4,100 target is not far off the ballpark. His thesis is hinged on Ethereum’s successful recovery back inside its crucial weekly trading range, noting that momentum is building towards the range high. Looming Bear Trap But don’t celebrate just yet. Weslad’s otherwise bullish analysis also comes with a stark warning for the downside scenario. He suggested that if ETH faces rejection at the critical $2,855 neckline resistance or the upper boundary of the pennant, a retracement into wave E becomes highly probable. According to him, this trajectory would drag the price down towards a “high-confluence demand zone” spanning $1,400 to $1,800. That’s a potential 40% collapse from current levels.

In a press release, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Illinois says that former Tempo Bank senior loan officer Francis Eversman and construction company owner Gregg Crawford pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud in a scheme that spanned between 2011 and 2020. Prosecutors say that Crawford recruited straw purchasers to serve as loan applicants in name only for properties that were often extremely overvalued. His brother-in-law, Eversman, would facilitate the approval process of the loans. Crawford used the proceeds of the loans for purposes other than the purchase of the properties. He also provided fake lease agreements in an effort to show rental income from the properties in question. When the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency became suspicious of the loans during an audit, Crawford told a straw purchaser to provide the regulator with fraudulent information. FBI Springfield Assistant Special Agent in Charge Karen Marinos says the duo violated the people’s trust by carrying out self-serving schemes to increase their wealth. “Every American citizen deserves to walk into their bank and trust the people behind the counter. In southern Illinois, these people are usually our neighbors and friends, people that we trust with our money and wellbeing. “ Eversman and Crawford will be sentenced on October 14th. They face up to 30 years in prison, five years of supervised release and fines of up to $1 million.

While most eyes remain on high-cap plays like Polkadot (DOT) and ChainLink (LINK), many investors are now quietly loading up on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi project that’s just entered the spotlight. With over $11.7 million already raised in its presale and more than 12,700 wallets participating, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already completed 60% of its Phase 5 offering. The entry window at $0.03 is beginning to narrow, and for traders watching on-chain activity, the signal is clear: smart capital is flowing in before Phase 6 increases the price to $0.035. Just last week, one Shiba Inu whale reallocated $9,800 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), citing its upcoming platform launch, real revenue model, and dual lending engine as the main reasons for the move. With a listing price set at $0.06 and projected targets ranging between $0.09 to $0.12 within the first 30 days post-launch, this is the type of asymmetric setup seasoned DeFi traders look for. Dual lending structure that works for everyone The real power behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its dual lending structure. It’s being built to serve both the flexible needs of peer-to-peer (P2P) borrowing and the scalable convenience of peer-to-contract (P2C) lending pools. The P2P model will allow users to lend or borrow directly with customized terms. Participants can negotiate repayment duration, interest rate, and even collateral types—whether it’s Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), or others. This flexibility opens the door to lending arrangements that feel more like direct agreements than rigid, protocol-driven deals. The P2C model, in contrast, caters to passive participants. It allows users to deposit funds into smart contract-based lending pools. These users receive mtTokens in return—automated yield assets that increase in value as interest payments flow in from borrowers. mtTokens can also be staked in designated smart contracts to earn dividends from overall platform activity, creating a second layer of passive income. This structure doesn’t just support lending activity—it will create an ecosystem. Protocol volume supports yield generation, staking pools return real protocol revenue to holders, and buybacks from revenue loops apply upward pressure to the token. It’s a sustainable and growth-aligned model, a step away from inflation-based emissions or speculative gimmicks. Momentum building toward platform launch and layer-2 expansion While many presale tokens promise future products, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aligning token sales with tangible development. Its beta platform is scheduled for launch before the end of Q4 2025, giving users actual lending and staking functionality out of the gate. This means trading activity won’t be based on hype but on access to a live, revenue-producing protocol. The project’s roadmap also includes Layer-2 integration, which will improve transaction speed and reduce gas costs—key for scaling high-volume lending pools and keeping costs low for borrowers and lenders alike. Layer-2 compatibility will allow Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to operate on infrastructure that matches the speed of centralized platforms, without giving up decentralization. Security is also being taken seriously. A $50,000 CertiK Bug Bounty Program is currently live, incentivizing developers to test and report vulnerabilities in Mutuum’s smart contract system before full launch. The protocol is built to be secure, scalable, and modular—ready to grow without compromising performance or user trust. Tokenomics play a critical role in sustaining any DeFi ecosystem, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out by avoiding unnecessary complexity. Instead, all token utility is built around real engagement—staking, mtToken rewards, and platform dividend distributions. This clarity makes it easier for investors to understand where value is generated and how it’s returned. The total supply stands at 4 billion tokens, and each presale phase increases price incrementally by $0.05 until reaching $0.06 at listing. Currently, buyers in Phase 5 are still securing tokens at $0.03, but with 60% of the round already sold and rising volume from both whales and retail investors, the clock is ticking. Investors who missed earlier cycles in Avalanche (AVAX), Polydon (MATIC), or Chainlink (LINK) know the pain of watching a 10x unfold from the sidelines. With momentum building around the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem, presale entry is becoming the new frontier for early positioning. When the beta platform drops and liquidity arrives at launch, the presale price of $0.03 will feel like a relic of the past. Before July ends, strategic investors are already making their move. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) might still be a quiet name, but the numbers suggest it won’t stay that way much longer.

In 2028, SHIB can reach a maximum value of $0.000075. The price of Shiba Inu is predicted to reach an average value of $0.000231 in 2031. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency, originally a meme coin, has transformed into a comprehensive Shiba Inu ecosystem, significantly impacting Shiba Inu’s value and utility. Key components include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution to enhance scalability. These developments have boosted SHIB’s adoption and functionality. As SHIB’s ecosystem grows, questions arise about SHIB’s future and its price trajectory. Will the advancements in ShibaSwap and Shibarium drive SHIB to new highs and influence the price action in the market? Can SHIB sustain its current price momentum and strengthen its position in the crypto market by flashing bullish signals? Will SHIB ever reach $1? In this Shiba Inu price prediction, analyzed by Cryptopolitan, we’ll determine future SHIB price trends. Overview Cryptocurrency Shiba Inu Token SHIB Price $0.00001142 Market Cap $6.73B Trading Volume (24-hour) $89.61M Circulating Supply 589.24T SHIB All-time High $0.00008845(Oct 27, 2021) All-time Low $0.0108165(June 4, 2025) 24-hour high $0.00001144 24-hour low $0.00001111 Shiba Inu coin price prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Volatility 5.85% 50-Day SMA $ 0.00001308 14-Day RSI 39.18 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 63(Greed) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 200-Day SMA $ 0.00001477 Shiba Inu Surges to $0.00001160 With Bullish Momentum and Investor Activity SHIB is testing the $0.00001160 level, which could determine the next move. A breakout may signal further gains, while rejection could stall momentum. The $0.00001135 support held firm, providing a base for the current uptrend. This level remains key if the price pulls back. SHIB is forming higher lows on both daily and 4-hour charts. If current levels hold, the structure supports a bullish outlook. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00001160, marking a 1.58% daily increase on July 6th, 2025. The meme coin has displayed signs of a short-term bullish reversal following an intraday low of $0.00001135, bouncing back to test a key resistance level at $0.00001160. With rising momentum, SHIB’s market participants are closely watching this threshold, which may determine its next directional bias. Shiba Inu 1-day price chart: SHIB Eyes Breakout as Bulls Defend Key Levels The daily chart for SHIB shows a clear upward push beginning around mid-session on July 6, with the price reclaiming critical territory above the $0.00001150 range. Bulls are pressing against resistance at $0.00001160, a level that has not been breached on the current chart. A daily high touch at this point underscores the potential for a breakout, especially if volume sustains or increases. If buyers can maintain this momentum and close the day above $0.00001160, it may open the door for a test of higher zones near $0.00001180 or $0.00001200 in the near term. SHIBUSD Price Chart by TradingView The support at $0.00001135 has held firm throughout the trading day, forming a base for this upward movement. The price action reveals a tight range consolidation during early hours, followed by a breakout in the afternoon session. The transition from red to green on the price graph indicates a change in sentiment. Market structure now leans bullish on the daily timeframe as higher lows begin to form. Technical traders are likely to monitor if SHIB can sustain this structure in the coming sessions, especially as accumulation signs strengthen. Shiba Inu 4-Hour Price Chart: SHIB momentum builds after resistance flip On the 4-hour chart, SHIB flipped short-term resistance into support near $0.00001145, triggering renewed upside. Momentum indicators on this timeframe suggest further gains if the asset closes above the $0.00001160 threshold. SHIBUSD Price Chart by TradingView The market reaction to this resistance zone will be pivotal in the next 8–12 hours. With rising interest from whales and vigorous defense of the $0.00001135 support, SHIB’s short-term outlook remains favorable. If bulls sustain pressure above this week’s range, further upside could be expected. However, a rejection at the $0.00001160 level could send the price back to retest lower support areas. Traders are advised to monitor intraday volatility and volume confirmation before entering fresh positions. What can you expect from the SHIB price next? If SHIB breaks above $0.00001160 with sustained buying pressure, it could open a move toward the $0.00001180 to $0.00001200 zone in the short term. This would confirm a breakout from the current range and reinforce the bullish trend forming on both daily and 4-hour timeframes. However, if $0.00001160 acts as a firm resistance, a pullback could retest the $0.00001145 intraday support or even return to the $0.00001135 base. A loss of $0.00001135 would invalidate the bullish setup and shift control back to sellers. Whale accumulation and broader market sentiment will remain key drivers. Traders should watch for volume confirmation around $0.00001160 to gauge breakout strength or potential rejection.

SHIB is a high-risk, speculative asset best suited for short-term traders and risk-tolerant investors. Its current price action shows bullish momentum, but long-term value depends on the adoption of projects like Shibarium. Price is driven more by community hype and whale activity than fundamentals, making it volatile. It’s not ideal for conservative investors, but if momentum continues, it may offer trading opportunities. Invest cautiously, and only with funds you can afford to lose. Why is Shiba Inu up today? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is up 1.58% today, trading at $0.00001160 as of July 6, 2025, due to a combination of renewed buying interest, whale accumulation, and strong support at $0.00001135 holding firm. The price rebounded from an intraday low and is now testing a key resistance at $0.00001160, which has attracted technical traders. This level is viewed as a breakout point, and bullish sentiment has returned as SHIB forms higher lows on both the daily and 4-hour charts, indicating positive momentum building in the short term. Recent News on Shiba Inu The Shiba Inu ecosystem has announced a major performance upgrade to its metaverse project, SHIB: The Metaverse, reinforcing its commitment to real development with the mantra “ We’re deploying, not dreaming .” The update significantly improves three core hubs—Bark Park, Tech Trench, and Shib Station—by reducing lag, fixing crashes, and cutting load times. Developers achieved this by optimizing over 200 texture files, merging redundant texture maps, standardizing shaders, and applying smarter mip-streaming, resulting in a 15–25% drop in GPU memory usage and smoother gameplay, even on mid-range PCs. The enhancements ensure a crash-free, stutter-free experience without sacrificing visual quality. Currently available on Windows PCs and web browsers, the metaverse is also developing a mobile version and a fishing mini-game tied to a future in-game economy. Since its early access launch in December 2024, SHIB: The Metaverse has steadily progressed, signaling that Shiba Inu aims to evolve beyond meme coin status by delivering functional and immersive products in the metaverse space. Will Shiba Inu recover? Buyers are vigorously defending a drop below the immediate support channels on the price chart. If the SHIB price holds its momentum above the $0.000014 level, we might see further surges. Will SHIB reach $0.00005? Yes, according to the long-term SHIB price prediction, the current Shiba Inu price is projected to reach up to $0.00005 by 2027. Will SHIB reach $0.0001 Yes, according to crypto experts’ long-term predictions, SHIB is projected to reach $0.0001 by 2029. Will SHIB reach $100? SHIB’s goal of reaching $100 is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply in the meme coin market. Additionally, to get the $100 mark, SHIB would require a strong push in its market cap, which is beyond imagination for a meme coin. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? The Shiba Inu price made headlines in January 2025 after Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer, stepped down. However, SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will depend on partnerships, broader market adoption trends, and other regulatory developments. You are advised to do your own research and form expert opinions before investing in the highly volatile crypto market.

Pepeto Rivals DOGE for the Top Memecoin Spot in Q3,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/looking-for-the-next-crypto-to-buy-pepeto-rivals-doge-for-the-top-memecoin-spot-in-q3/,"As the Web3 market matures, investors are moving beyond hype and speculation, searching instead for crypto assets with substance. In this shifting landscape, two prominent memecoins, Pepeto and Dogecoin, are igniting interest. While Dogecoin attempts a technical rebound, Pepeto is emerging as a fresh contender with bold utility plans and a fast-growing community. With Q3 already showing volatility, these two tokens are shaping very different narratives in the battle for memecoin dominance. Pepeto: A Rising Star with Real Utility Pepeto’ s story begins with its explosive presale momentum. Having held a micro-entry price of 0.000000139 and raised more than 5.5 million dollars, it cannot just be a meme anymore; it intends to be relevant in the long run. Overall, the project is developed on audited smart contracts, has community governance, and could provide up to 270% APY by staking. These characteristics have been designed to appeal to serious investors but not to short-term speculators. Besides offering staking rewards and governance, Pepeto delivers on infrastructure. Its demo exchange has already been opened with the tools of the swap, bridge, and advanced charts. According to the team, it offers access to more than 850 reviewed tokens, which marks early proof-of-concept that makes it stand out among conventional meme tokens. A first sneak peek into the $Pepeto Exchange is finally here. Live trading charts, swap and bridge features, and over 850 high-quality tokens already approved for listing once $Pepeto secures its Tier 1 exchange. While markets remain uncertain, the team behind the God of Frogs… pic.twitter.com/ndk5gYs6y4 — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) June 23, 2025 Additionally, Pepeto’s tokenomics are carefully structured. Thirty percent of its 420 trillion supply will be allocated as presale and staking and the remainder will fund liquidity, marketing, and development. What makes Pepeto particularly relevant now is its alignment with the Web3 push for decentralized value. With the platform design, the transparency and scalability of memecoins is made available to an asset category that currently lacks both. This positions Pepeto to benefit from the current market climate, where utility-focused altcoins are outperforming even Bitcoin. Dogecoin: Technical Momentum Faces Market Hesitation Dogecoin, the original memecoin, is showing signs of life again. The token has developed a bullish double-bottom pattern around the $0.15 following months of trading between the price levels of $0.13 to $0.25. This tendency, combined with an ascending triangle on the week-long chart, means traders are gearing to push the price above $0.20. The recovery, though, is weak. Brand new breakouts will have to move through resistance in 0.18 and 0.19 to be sustained. As long as DOGE has support above the price of $0.16, a breakdown can push it into the price of $0.14 or less. Due to market uncertainty and confused technical signals, it could take a long time before it makes its next big move. Get in on the presale today, connect your wallet at pepeto.io, buy tokens, and start staking before major exchange listings go live. Don’t miss early-tier access to Pepeto’s ecosystem and rewards. About Pepeto Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

The key catalysts for the industry this week will be the upcoming Federal Reserve minutes and President Donald Trump’s tariff deadline, set for July 9 . Some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week are Bonk ( BONK ), Aptos ( APT ), and Pi Network ( PI ). Bonk Bonk price chart | Source: crypto.news Bonk, the biggest meme coin on Solana (SOL), will be in the spotlight this week as its surge continues. It has already rallied for five consecutive days and is hovering at its highest level since May 23. Bonk has already moved above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00002095 and is nearing the crucial resistance level at $0.000025, the highest swing on May 12. Bonk has also moved above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, a sign that bulls are in control. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have all trended upward. Therefore, the Bonk price will likely continue rising, with the next point to watch being the 50% retracement point at $0.00003453. Aptos APT price chart | Source: crypto.news Aptos, a top layer-1 network, will be in the spotlight this week as it unlocks tokens worth $50 million. Cryptocurrencies often drop after their token unlocks since this normally increases the number of tokens in circulation. Aptos price has been in a downtrend this year, moving from a high of $15.28 in November to $4.48 today. It has formed a descending channel and moved below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. The MACD has moved below the zero line, while the Relative Strength Index has dropped below the neutral point at 50. Therefore, Aptos price will likely continue falling this week, with the key level to watch being the year-to-date low of $3.82. Pi Network PI chart | Source: crypto.news Pi Network will be in the spotlight this week as it hovers at a crucial support level, which could trigger a rebound. The token crashed to a low of $0.46 on July 6, a key price since it was the lowest level in April and June. Its crash has coincided with the Bollinger Band squeeze, as the spread between the three lines has narrowed. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the token will bounce back this week as long as it holds above the support at $0.46. A rebound could see it retest the important resistance level at $1.

According to the update , TON is offering a 10-year Golden Visa to the UAE for investors willing to stake a portion of their holdings on the platform. Key Details of the Golden Visa Offer Via Crypto Route Notably, the offer is for those willing to use a crypto-based route to obtain a visa to the UAE. The benefits of this long-term residency in the region include exemption from income tax, flexibility in business setup, and access to various other services. To enjoy these benefits, a Toncoin holder needs to stake $100,000 worth of TON for a minimum of three years. They will also need to pay a one-time processing fee of $35,000. Once this is done, within seven weeks after the submission of relevant documents, they will secure the Golden Visa for the UAE. Interestingly, the Golden Visa provides coverage to the holder’s immediate family members, including spouses, children, and parents. These beneficiaries will not incur further costs beyond the official government fees. Notably, applicants retain control of their staked assets while earning between 3% and 4% interest on them. TON’s Bold Push Into Real-World Utility The move could trigger an increased shift toward staking for Toncoin. The ecosystem’s offer is significantly incentivized, as the conventional UAE cost implication is much higher than TON is requesting. To obtain it via the regular route, an applicant would require a minimum of $540,000 investment in the form of illiquid assets. Traditionally, the UAE Golden Visa requires real estate investments or business ownership. This route enables crypto investors to leverage their holdings, allowing them to enjoy the same benefits at a substantial discount of approximately 80%. Toncoin whales might likely leverage the offer to obtain the UAE’s Golden Visa. Notably, Dubai in the UAE stood out as the leading destination for crypto businesses in 2024. Toncoin Price and Market Reaction In the cryptocurrency market, Toncoin’s price spiked by a significant 10% after the announcement by TON. As of this writing, Toncoin is exchanging at $2.88. It had earlier peaked at $3.05 before witnessing a slight pullback. Meanwhile, trading volume has soared by 430.52% to $596.01 million within the same time frame as market participants engage the asset.

In June, DeFi, AI, and hybrid trading infrastructure startup companies attracted significant amounts of capital despite recent slowdowns in some areas of the market. Though some companies struggle to raise fresh funds, large segments — including blockchain infrastructure, tokenization, and real-world assets (RWAs) — remain attractive to investors, according to industry leaders. Rails Raises $20M for Hybrid Exchange Model Rails, the Kraken and Slow Ventures-backed exchange , has raised $20 million across two rounds. The exchange marries centralized velocity and decentralized custody. It is likely to resonate with professional traders who desire CEX performance without compromising on control over their assets. Slow Ventures termed Rails as a “hybrid perpetual exchange” designed for speed, security, and non-custodial trading. Beam Raises $7M to Expand Global Stablecoin Payments Beam, a Visa Direct and FedNow connected stablecoin payments service provider, raised a $7 million funding round from Castle Ventures. Beam will use the funds to expand its network in Latin America, Africa, APAC and the EU, targeting fintechs and banks. Frachtis Launches $20M Crypto-Native Fund Xavier Meegan, former Chorus One executive, started Frachtis, a $20 million fund backing early-stage ventures in decentralized AI, infrastructure, and DeFi. The fund has already closed eight deals and is seeking to help founders find long-term blockchain use cases. Inference Labs Raises $6.3M to Build AI Trust Layer Inference Labs raised $6.3 million to construct Proof of Inference — a cryptographic overlay to authenticate AI outputs with zero-knowledge proofs. The funding was led by DACM, Delphi Ventures, Arche Capital and Lvna Capital. The testnet is live, and mainnet deployment will occur Q3 2025. Gradient Network Raises $10M for Decentralized AI Gradient Network secured $10 million from Multicoin Capital and Pantera Capital. The company is building decentralized AI infrastructure on Solana, including Lattica and Parallax — tools to scale large AI models. Gradient’s Solana architecture attracted the attention of leading investors. OKX and Story Announce $10M IP Innovation Fund OKX crypto exchange and blockchain startup Story launched a $10 million ecosystem fund to support IP-related Web3 innovation . Initiatives are available for funding with Story’s native token, IP. PIP Labs, the company building Ethereum-based sidechain Story, has raised $140 million to date, including $80 million on its Series B round last August. Yupp Raises $33M from a16z to Evaluate AI Models Yupp raised $33 million in seed funding led by a16z Crypto. The platform allows users to experiment with outputs from leading AI models like ChatGPT and Claude and get crypto rewards for contributing. Yupp’s model aims to create human judgment a useful economic layer for blockchain. Blueprint Finance Adds $9.5M for DeFi Expansion Multichain DeFi infrastructure development company Blueprint Finance closed a $9.5 million round led by Polychain Capital. The funds will be utilized to cover new products in addition to its existing platforms — Concrete on Ethereum and Glow Finance on Solana. Blueprint’s raise comes as DeFi is rebounding, though TVL still lags its 2022 peak. Units Network Raises $10M to Enhance Web3 Scalability Units Network, built on the Waves protocol, has raised $10 million from Nimbus Capital to expand its validator network and AI integration. The platform will enhance crosschain liquidity and address scalability bottlenecks in the Web3 ecosystem. Nimbus Capital is backed by In On Capital, which has more than $1.2 billion in assets under management. Conclusion: Infrastructure and AI Drive VC Activity June’s VC move is a sign of investor enthusiasm in particular crypto verticals — particularly infrastructure, DeFi and AI. With top backers like a16z, Pantera and Multicoin continuing to deploy capital, the future generation of blockchain innovations will continue to be fueled by ventures that are working on real-world use cases and decentralized smarts.",Blockchain|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-07-06 19:04:48

DeFi Graphite Network’s Phonebook MVP is a practical, real-world application of decentralized tech built to introduce transparency and reputation scoring to phone numbers. Business Stablecoin issuer Circle has formally applied to establish a federally regulated national trust bank in the United States, a move aimed at enhancing oversight of its USDC stablecoin reserves and aligning with evolving regulatory frameworks for digital assets. BlackRock’s flagship spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT , has become the asset manager’s third-highest revenue-generating fund, sitting only behind the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. The FTX Recovery Trust has suspended repayments to creditors in 49 regions where cryptocurrency operations face legal restrictions, with Chinese users accounting for the majority of the disputed claims. Fresh disclosures reveal the Trump family’s cryptocurrency holdings have swelled to over $620 million, with memecoins, token sales, and blockchain ventures rapidly becoming one of the most lucrative segments of their portfolio. Trump-affiliated American Bitcoin has raised $220 million to upgrade its mining infrastructure, expand its Bitcoin treasury, and advance plans for a public listing amid growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency mining. Germany’s largest banking group, Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe , will introduce cryptocurrency trading by mid-2026, integrating the service into its flagship banking app while maintaining a cautious stance on digital assets.

According to Arkham’s analysis, the Bitcoin whale in question is moving its assets from the traditional “1-” address format to the more modern and secure Bech32 address format, which starts with “bc1q-.” This is thought to provide increased security, lower transaction fees, and long-term storage for Bitcoin users. Analysts explained the situation as follows: “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were most likely related to address format upgrades. There is a shift from 1- addresses to bc1q- addresses. There is no indication that the whale is selling.” Related News: Coinbase Executive Responds to Claims That the Largest Ethereum Short Position in History Has Been Opened Address formats have changed over time on the Bitcoin network: Addresses starting with “1-” (P2PKH): Bitcoin's first address format. Although shorter and more widely used, it does not support SegWit (Segregated Witness), which leads to higher transaction fees. Addresses starting with “3-” (P2SH): Provides multi-signature (multisig) and SegWit compatibility, but still does not offer full throughput. Addresses starting with “bc1q-” (Bech32 format): The latest format that supports full SegWit features. It offers advantages such as lower transaction fees, faster transaction processing, and greater resistance to typos. *This is not investment advice.

This article delves into a carefully chosen array of cryptocurrencies set for long-term growth. Without using the exact words from the title, it promises insights into key tokens with strong potential. Readers can expect to discover which coins might bring substantial returns over time. Bitcoin: Steady Gains and Key Price Levels Signal Bullish Potential Bitcoin gained 6.38% over the last month and advanced 5.74% in the past six months. Its price moved within a defined range that shows gradual yet reliable growth. Data reflects a mix of small spikes and minor pullbacks, indicating steady accumulation over time. Price movements kept within set boundaries helped stabilize market sentiment and reinforced a cautious approach among traders. Consistent technical measures bolstered confidence without dramatic rallies or severe drops, suggesting manageable volatility. Historical action underscores a balanced strength that has gently pushed prices upward while keeping fluctuations moderate. Current prices range from $100,204.94 to $112,346.90, with immediate support at $93,224.22 and clear resistance at $117,508.14. A second layer of key levels shows support near $81,082.26 and resistance around $129,650.10. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator at 2,277.57 and the Momentum Indicator at 1,123.41 hint at a market nudged by buyer interest, even as the Relative Strength Index holds a near-neutral value of 54.82. Bulls seem to be in modest control, yet the market does not display a sharp trend. Trading ideas include considering long entries near the support level, with tight stops just below $93,224.22, while a move toward $117,508.14 could signal a moment to scale back or exit. A cautious stance remains wise as price tests key levels, suggesting that both bulls and bears are testing the market’s balance. Ethereum Sees Rebound Amidst Mixed Market Signals Ethereum saw a modest rebound over the past month with a 4.08% gain and a 3.18% increase over the last week. A significant downturn occurred over the past six months, with prices falling approximately 31.84%, highlighting a period of sustained pressure. Price swings have underscored both a short-term recovery effort and a long-term descent, keeping traders on edge. Volatility in the market has been evident as brief rallies have been met with sharp declines, reflecting contrasting trends. Recent performance showcases gains against a backdrop of prior losses, illustrating the ongoing struggle between optimism and caution among market participants. Ethereum currently trades within a range of roughly $2111 to $2870.69. The closest barrier to upward movement is around $3254, while a sturdy support level is near $1735. A secondary resistance and support extend to levels of roughly $4014 and $975, marking key zones for potential price action. The RSI near 51.85 indicates neutrality. Despite some bullish signals, such as the Momentum reading at 98.90 and the Awesome Oscillator at 19.67, the market lacks a clear trend. Traders might consider buying near support at $1735 and taking profits around the $3254 resistance, while remaining cautious of the broader range-bound market conditions. Solana Price Overview: Past Trends and Current Key Levels Over the last six months, Solana has seen a significant drop with a decline of 32.40%, while the past month brought a modest rebound of 2.22% after a short-term correction of 2.12% in the last week. The coin experienced rough market conditions over half a year, reflecting strong downward pressure, though the recent monthly gain indicates brief upward movement amid lingering bearish sentiment. Price behavior has remained volatile with gradual signs of stabilization emerging recently. Current price levels for Solana fall within a range of $131 to $173, with key resistance levels marked at $191.77 and $233.73. Support stands at $107.88 initially and further down at $65.93. The Awesome Oscillator reading of 0.62 and the momentum indicator value of 8.46 signal a cautious setup, while the RSI at 48.18 points to a near-neutral condition. The lack of a strong clear trend gives both bulls and bears room for action. Traders might consider testing the support area near $107 for potential entry opportunities with aims to reach the first resistance level, yet caution is advised if prices slip below that first support, which could trigger further declines. XRP Navigates Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Volatile Trends Over the last month, XRP enjoyed a modest uptick with a 6% rise, marking a period of short-term optimism. Over the past six months, the coin has recorded an 8% decline, reflecting a volatile market sentiment. Price movements have oscillated, showcasing isolated bullish surges amid broader downward trends. Weekly gains of 1.6% signal transient strength, while the longer-term pullback hints at underlying pressures. These shifts in sentiment have prompted traders to reexamine risk-reward balances, especially following immediate bounces and prolonged slumps. Current price activity for XRP centers within a steady trading range between $2.00 and $2.50. Primary support around $1.73 and secondary support near $1.31 offer potential entry points for traders expecting a rebound. Resistance is observed at $2.59, with a higher ceiling at $3.02 that may signal a breakout if cleared decisively. Technical indicators show a balanced stance, with an RSI near 52 and momentum readings indicating gradual upward movement without strong bullish conviction. Cautious buyers may consider entering on a retest of support levels, while sellers might look for opportunities near resistance. Monitoring these benchmarks along with volume trends could aid in timing trades effectively. A break below $1.73 might invite further pressure, while a move above $2.59 could encourage bullish activity. Traders should manage risk closely, utilizing stop-loss orders and targeting incremental profits in a fluctuating environment. Conclusion BTC , ETH , SOL , and XRP together offer a balanced and diversified portfolio approach. BTC provides stability and is a strong contender for long-term growth. ETH presents opportunities with its smart contract capabilities. SOL is notable for its fast transaction speeds and growing ecosystem. XRP is known for its utility in facilitating cross-border payments. This combination allows for potential growth across different areas of the crypto space. With their unique strengths, these coins form a robust foundation for long-term investment. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, LILPEPE is showing massive potential due to its unique Layer 2 blockchain ecosystem and ambitious aspirations to disrupt the industry. Is Little Pepe really a threat to PEPE in 2025? Pepe Coin (PEPE): A Giant with Mixed Signals According to CoinCodex, PEPE will move between $0.000006557 and $0.000009556. The upper end has a small upside of 2.24%, but the market is pessimistic about it; thus, it might plummet by 23.27% to $0.000007332. Changelly also thinks that the price will stay between $0.00000715 and $0.0000127 in July 2025. Prices are expected to fluctuate, and they may decline by 17.25% in the first part of the year. But not all of the predictions are awful. InvestingHaven believes things will improve, with an average price of $0.0000198 in 2025 and a potential surge to $0.00044 by 2026 if the market remains bullish. These estimates, on the other hand, are tempered by warnings of big corrections and market fatigue among long-term holders. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Explosive Demand Enter Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—the rising star of the meme coin universe, and possibly the biggest threat to PEPE’s dominance. Far from being a mere derivative, LILPEPE combines meme culture with real blockchain innovation. Built on the ERC chain, this project offers zero taxes, no rug pulls, and a roadmap steeped in humor, creativity, and strategic vision. The project raised more than $2.5 million in the presale stage 3, which was significantly ahead of plan. This showed that investors were interested. The token is now in stage 4, and it costs $0.0013. It has now raised over $690,000 in new money, and demand isn’t slowing down. This quick fundraising, especially in a competitive market, demonstrates the attractiveness of LILPEPE to both small and large investors. LILPEPE is distinct from other meme coins, as it focuses on making them useful. LILPEPE is different from other tokens that rely solely on hype. It is constructing a Layer-2 blockchain that gives developers and users more control, making it a key part of the next meme-fueled Web3 age. Investors who are sick of vaporware and hollow promises will find this mix of usefulness and enjoyment to be quite appealing. Bold Predictions and High Hopes Analysts and top crypto prediction platforms are starting to take notice. Several sources indicate that LILPEPE could reach $0.50 by the end of the third quarter and potentially exceed $1 by the end of the year. This would be a massive increase from its current presale price. A strong community backing, a good presale performance, and a well-structured ecosystem all work together to provide a stable base for explosive growth. A Community-Driven Ecosystem The LILPEPE community is one of the project’s biggest strengths. With over 19,000 entries recorded in its $770,000 token giveaway (10 winners receiving $77,000 each), it’s clear that this isn’t a flash-in-the-pan project—it’s a movement. The developers have adopted a tongue-in-cheek yet genuine tone, referring to their roadmap as the “cryptowomb” stage and promising maximum vibes as “Mumma Pepe” brings her baby into the world. Yet behind the memes lies a real structure. LILPEPE plans to list on two major centralized exchanges (CEXs) shortly after the presale completion and is already targeting the world’s largest exchange for future listings. The Verdict: Is LILPEPE the Next King? While PEPE still commands significant brand recognition, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is rapidly proving it’s not just riding coattails—it’s rewriting the meme coin playbook. By combining humor with a purpose-built Layer 2 ecosystem, LILPEPE is offering something meme investors have rarely seen: genuine value. If PEPE continues to experience only modest growth while LILPEPE capitalizes on its innovative approach and viral appeal, the crown could be up for grabs. With predictions pointing to over 75x returns by the end of 2025, early LILPEPE investors may look back on this presale as the moment they got in before the rocket took off. In 2025, the battle for meme coin supremacy won’t just be about price—it will be about purpose, community, and innovation. And in that arena, Little Pepe is punching well above its weight.

47654364,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=761287,1751830547,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47654364.jpeg,Vitalik Buterin proposes lower ETH transaction gas limit through a new EIP,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/vitalik-buterin-low-ethereum-gas-limit/,"Vitalik Buterin along with fellow researcher Toni Wahrstätter have proposed EIP 7983 which caps the Ethereum transaction gas limit to 16.77 million or (2^24). The proposal was created on GitHub in late June and was finalized today. EIP 7983 states that the gas limit will affect the Ethereum network at the protocol level. The new gas cap will help in securing and stabilizing the Ethereum network while making transaction costs more predictable. EIP 7983 will protect the network from DoS attacks Theoretically, a single transaction on the Ethereum network could consume the entire block’s gas limit. For example, a smart contract interaction might fill a block completely, leaving no room for other transactions. This could pose several risks including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks which impact the Ethereum network stability. Capping the gas limit will break transactions into smaller fragments, hence improving zkVM compatibility. This design change will lead to faster zero-knowledge proofs and more participants to help verify work. In addition, a stable gas usage will balance parallel execution across threads in future Ethereum scaling models. Overall, having a maximum gas limit of 16.77 million will help stop denial-of-service attacks, make zkVMs easier to design, and allow gas to be shared more fairly between transactions in each block. EIP-7983 further states that the transaction cap limit will be enforced regardless of the block gas limit set by validators. Moreover, any transaction that exceeds the gas limit of 16.77 million will be rejected with a specific error code. According to the proposal, the EVM behavior will change and will not include any transaction with a gas limit more than 16.77 million in the txpool. A txpool is defined as a waiting room for ETH transactions . At the block validation level and before the processing stage, the EVM will reject any block that has a transaction with a gas limit greater than the specified limit. Why 16.77 million Ethereum gas limit? In the proposal, Buterin and Wahrstätter wrote that the transaction gas limit of 16.77 million or (2^24) “provides a balance between allowing complex transactions while maintaining predictable execution bounds.” Selecting this value will make use cases like smart contract deployments and complex DeFi transactions run smoothly without causing unpredictable slowdowns. EIP-7983 is not the first proposal to introduce a cap on ETH gas limit. EIP-7825 was the first proposal to introduce a gas limit for Ethereum transactions of 30 million. The proposal was published in November of last year and the 30 million gas cap was selected at the time because it is based on the average size of Ethereum blocks today. Many Ethereum developers supported EIP-7825 however they pushed for a lower gas limit. According to the Gas Tracker on Ether Scan, the average Ethereum gas cost is 0.266 gwei while ETH is priced at around $2,550. At the time of writing, a transaction that uses the full 16.77 million gas would cost approximately $11.38.

These investors, operating on the decentralized derivatives exchange Hyperliquid, have opened a combined $2.17 million in 20× leveraged long positions on XRP , entering the market at over $2.24 per token. The scale and precision of these trades signal strong confidence in an imminent XRP breakout. Why the Hyperliquid Whale Activity Matters Hyperliquid is quickly becoming a hotspot for large, on-chain leveraged positions. Whales on the platform have made headlines before for massive bets across top-tier cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Now, attention has turned to XRP, one of the few digital assets with real-world utility and enterprise adoption. Xaif’s report highlights that these whales are not gambling. Instead, they appear to be executing a high-conviction strategy based on market signals, historical behavior, and possibly insider insight into macro or regulatory developments. With $2.17 million in exposure at 20× leverage, these traders are effectively betting on a major price surge, any small move upward could yield enormous returns. XRP WHALES ALERT Two Hyperliquid whales just opened $2.17M in 20x long positions at $2.24+ entry! They're not guessing — they're expecting a major move! #XRP breakout incoming? pic.twitter.com/Tar3udfiEL — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 6, 2025 Technical Outlook Suggests a Breakout Is Near XRP has been trading in a tight range between $2.20 and $2.30, repeatedly testing resistance around $2.30. Historically, similar periods of consolidation have preceded significant breakouts, especially when accompanied by large whale activity. Just weeks ago, whales accumulated more than $780 million in XRP before prices surged, providing a striking precedent. A breakout above $2.30, especially on strong trading volume, would confirm bullish momentum and likely trigger additional buying from traders and institutions alike. These new whale positions could be the early signal of such a move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 High Leverage, High Stakes While 20× leverage offers the potential for massive profits, it also carries significant risk. A mere 5% decline in XRP’s price could wipe out these positions. However, whales of this caliber typically base their trades on deep analysis, tracking order books, sentiment shifts, and funding rates. Their move suggests confidence, not recklessness. Macro Backdrop Supports Bullish Bias Beyond technicals, XRP is riding a wave of positive fundamentals. Ripple continues to expand its enterprise and central bank partnerships , and speculation around an XRP spot ETF remains strong. Together, these elements provide a powerful backdrop that could fuel the next leg up in XRP’s price. Xaif’s alert is more than a data point, it’s a signal of shifting sentiment at the highest levels of crypto trading. The whales’ actions reflect growing confidence in XRP’s upside potential . If momentum builds and the $2.30 resistance gives way, this could mark the beginning of a powerful breakout rally. All eyes are now on XRP.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $86.47 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $283.84 by 2031. Ethereum Name Service is a network that allows crypto-enthusiasts to rename their crypto addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $18.66 Market Cap $682.53M Trading Volume (24-hour) $42.07 Million Circulating Supply 100 Million ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $18.74 24-h Low $18.14 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day Volatility) $ 13.08 (-25.54%) 50-Day SMA $ 21.78 14-Day RSI 30.71 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 45 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $ 19.91 Ethereum Name Service price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : ENS is consolidating under bearish pressure with weak momentum on both timeframes Price is struggling to break above the $19 to $20 resistance zone Indicators suggest sellers still dominate and a drop toward $17 support is possible if recovery fails Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart ENSUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day chart on July 6, ENS (Ethereum Name Service) is showing early signs of consolidation following a recent downtrend. The price currently sits near the middle band of the Bollinger Bands, suggesting a period of equilibrium with potential for volatility. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is positioned at 46.09, slightly below the neutral 50 line, indicating neither oversold nor overbought conditions. A break above the $20.17 upper Bollinger Band resistance could signal a short-term bullish reversal, while a drop below $17.31 would reinforce the bearish momentum. Traders should monitor volume and macro sentiment closely for confirmation of directional strength. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis ENSUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, ENS (Ethereum Name Service) is displaying a sideways consolidation pattern with slight bearish undertones. Price movement remains bound between the lower and upper Bollinger Bands, with resistance at $19.36 and support near $17.87. The Balance of Power indicator shows negative values around -0.50, hinting that sellers currently have more control. Meanwhile, the MACD line is crossing below the signal line, which is typically interpreted as a weakening bullish momentum or the beginning of a short-term downtrend. Unless buying volume increases meaningfully, ENS may continue trading in a narrow range or dip slightly before the next directional breakout. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $20.13 BUY SMA 5 $21.33 BUY SMA 10 $22.14 BUY SMA 21 $ 21.45 BUY SMA 50 $18.44 BUY SMA 100 $ 19.58 BUY SMA 200 $21.92 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 20.40 BUY EMA 5 $18.95 BUY EMA 10 $ 17.40 BUY EMA 21 $16.96 BUY EMA 50 $19.04 BUY EMA 100 $ 22.17 BUY EMA 200 $23.59 SELL What to expect from ENS? Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, ENS (Ethereum Name Service) appears to be in a consolidation phase with mild bearish pressure. On the 1-day chart, RSI hovers below the 50 level, indicating weak momentum, while the price struggles below the 20-day SMA, capped by resistance around $20.17. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, signaling reduced volatility and a possible breakout setup. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD shows a bearish crossover and the Balance of Power remains negative, suggesting that sellers retain control. If ENS fails to reclaim the $19–$20 zone, it may drift toward the $17 support level. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $100.37 on average by 2029. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending to $241.53 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest. Recent news/opinion on Ethereum Name Service ENS Users Can Now Display Their .eth Names Across Web3 Apps Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has introduced an easy way for users to personalize their web3 identity by setting a primary ENS name—such as yourname.eth —instead of the default hexadecimal address. Users can do this by visiting app.ens.domains , selecting their preferred name, and confirming the update in their wallet. Once set, platforms like Uniswap, OpenSea, and Etherscan will display the user’s ENS name in place of the wallet address. Only one primary name can be linked per address, and while not necessary for transactions, it enhances user visibility across ENS-supported platforms. Want wallets or dapps to show yourname.eth instead of a 0x? → Go to https://t.co/5tArNzDa07 and choose your preferred name → Click “Set as primary name” → Confirm in your wallet Now every ENS-enabled wallet and dapp displays yourname.eth, not the hex. pic.twitter.com/11TzqzoGvi — ens.eth (@ensdomains) June 3, 2025 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has been integrated into SheFi’s curriculum, empowering Cohort 13’s 3,000+ members to personalize their crypto experience.

According to Bloomberg , its Global Investigative Operations Center has seized nearly $400 million in digital assets—stored in a single cold wallet—through operations targeting scams, fraud, and extortion. One recent case illustrates the agency’s evolving reach: after a teenager was sextorted for $600, agents traced the crypto through a money mule to a Nigerian national allegedly responsible for thousands of illicit transactions. The agency, led by investigative analyst Jamie Lam, specializes in digital financial crimes using software, subpoenas, and spreadsheets rather than traditional law enforcement tools. The team traces cryptocurrency fraud through domain registrations, wallet connections, and blockchain analysis.

Older victims suffered the largest losses at nearly $2.8 billion, primarily through fake investment platforms. The Secret Service’s Kali Smith, who directs the agency’s cryptocurrency strategy, has conducted training workshops in over 60 countries to help local law enforcement unmask digital crimes. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn’t even realize that this is occurring in our country,'” Smith said during a recent Bermuda training session. Recent cases show the agency’s investigative capabilities. An Idaho teenager received sextortion demands after sending inappropriate photos online, paying $600 before contacting police. Secret Service analysts traced payments through an American money mule to a Nigerian passport holder who had processed $4.1 million across nearly 6,000 transactions. British authorities arrested the suspected extortionist upon landing in England, where he awaits extradition. The case involved reconstructing the crime through screenshots, receipts, and blockchain data analysis. It also underscores how digital sleuthing is redefining modern law enforcement—and how online exploitation has become a billion-dollar crimes. The Secret Service collaborates with cryptocurrency companies for trace analysis and wallet freezes. Coinbase and Tether have publicly acknowledged assisting investigations, with one recovery involving $225 million in USDT linked to romance-investment scams. “We’ve been following the money for 160 years,” said Patrick Freaney, head of the agency’s New York field office. “This training is part of that mission.” Read more: NFT sales jump 10% to $136.5m, CryptoPunks shows 26% pop",News|Blockchain|Crime,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-07-06 20:00:00

While top cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) show signs of weakness amid a broader crypto correction, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gathering bullish steam, catching the eye of investors seeking the best crypto to buy now. The project has sold more than 60% of presale stage 5 at $0.03. MUTM has mobilized in excess of $11.8 million and has attracted over 12,700 investors. With Solana possibly entering another leg down, attention is shifting to Mutuum Finance, which has gained momentum thanks to its real-world asset lending framework and rapidly growing presale buzz. Solana Faces Bearish Signals as Market Shifts Focus Solana (SOL) is showing signs of weakening momentum, with the price currently hovering around $150. After failing to hold above key resistance levels, technical indicators are flashing bearish, suggesting that SOL could be headed for a pullback toward the $145–$140 range if selling pressure continues. Analysts point to a double-top formation and declining volume as warning signs that a deeper correction may be on the horizon. As Solana struggles to maintain its footing, some investors are looking elsewhere for near-term growth potential, turning their attention to emerging projects like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 5 Presale Sees Growing Traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it soars in Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,700 early adopters and well over $11.8 million in funds raised, the project is taking giant strides as a major player in the DeFi. USD Stablecoin Launch & $50K Security Bounty Mutuum Finance, in its plans to build more on its DeFi, is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to highly risk-exposed algorithmic stablecoins, this token has been designed in such a manner that it will guarantee its value even during market volatility. The project itself is about integrity and security. Mutuum Finance platform is already audited by CertiK as well, which once again shows team dedication to transparency, reliability, and sustainability. Mutuum Finance also introduced Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, where a reward of 50,000 USDT is offered. The bounty comes in four categories, namely the critical, major, minor, and low. This will level out all the tiers of vulnerability and reward it alike. Investor Incentives In appreciation of the presale mania and as a token of appreciation to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will distribute a $100,000 giveaway . Ten such winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for being part of the early backers of the project. With the community growing exponentially, the early backers are being rewarded, not only with possible future gain, but with real, present-time rewards. While Solana (SOL) struggles to hold support and faces a potential drop toward the $140 zone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is charting a much different course, one filled with momentum and mounting investor confidence. With over 12,700 investors, $11.8 million raised, and 60% of Stage 5 already sold, MUTM is quickly emerging as a top coin in the DeFi market. Backed by a CertiK audit, a $50K bug bounty, and plans to launch a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin, the project blends innovation with security. Add in a $100,000 early adopter giveaway, and it’s clear why many see MUTM as the best crypto to invest in right now. Join the presale today before Stage 5 closes out.

Hyperliquid’s price has jumped in the past year because of strong trading volumes and controlled supply, yet recent dips raise concerns about keeping interest long term. SUI’s high targets look impressive, but slowing user activity makes its near future less certain. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) keeps moving ahead with steady growth backed by strong user support. Its new tie-up with the Seattle Seawolves and presale funding crossing $332 million with 23.6 billion coins sold shows clear trust. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. Now, coins are offered at $0.0016 until August 11th, making BlockDAG one of the best long term crypto investments. Seattle Seawolves Partners with BlockDAG to Redefine Web3 Fan Engagement In a major move, the Seattle Seawolves have teamed up with BlockDAG.Network to introduce blockchain features for their fans. This step is set to boost fan involvement by giving them special digital ownership options like NFTs, tradable digital items, and exclusive team-based collectibles. BlockDAG will also serve as the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves for the 2025 season. This partnership plans to launch a co-branded monthly series on the Seawolves’ social media, sharing match insights, forecasts, highlights, and behind-the-scenes clips to connect fans more deeply with players. Fans can also own and trade digital items securely through blockchain. Altogether, these plans bring fans closer to the team while adding digital value to their loyalty. This news comes while BlockDAG’s presale remains strong. So far, over $332 million has been raised, with 23.6 billion coins sold. At present, batch 29 coins are available at a special price of $0.0016 until August 11th, with early buyers already gaining 2,660% returns since batch 1. This strategic sports tie-up boosts BlockDAG’s progress and highlights it as one of the best long term cryptos. Together, BlockDAG and the Seawolves are shaping a digital fan zone that blends online interaction with lasting benefits. Hyperliquid Price Forecast: HYPE Continues Its Climb The Hyperliquid price forecast is gaining attention as HYPE token’s price jumped over 1,000% in a year and rose 300% since April. This rise is backed by active users, as Hyperliquid holds around 70% of on-chain perpetuals volume with daily trades of about $420 million. This growth is not purely speculative but driven by user demand and limited token supply. One main reason is its buy-and-burn plan, which uses trading fees to buy back tokens, cutting supply. The airdrop method also reduced early sell-offs by distributing tokens among many active users. Technically, indicators now show a recovery after falling back from its $45 peak, suggesting the climb may continue. SUI Price Forecast: Targets Remain High Despite Cooling Activity SUI’s price forecast has triggered debate after Raoul Pal set a bold target of $22, though current trends suggest a slower path. Short rallies have taken place, including a recent 40% jump, but trading volumes on decentralized exchanges show a fall. This hints at profit-taking and weak momentum, which could slow growth soon. From a technical side, there is strong resistance at $1.50. If SUI does not break above this level, further growth may pause unless demand picks up strongly. However, its main features and utility keep it on the watchlist for many, showing that long-term potential remains if usage trends recover. Final Thoughts! Short-term surges may draw eyes, but strong long-term value comes from consistent results and user experience. Hyperliquid’s gains are impressive, but it needs strong trading volumes to keep rising. SUI shows promise, but its user activity does not fully support its price hopes. BlockDAG, however, is moving forward with real progress. With over $332 million raised, 23.6 billion coins sold, and partnerships like the Seattle Seawolves, BlockDAG shows a solid approach. Its current $0.0016 price offer until August 11th and early buyer gains of 2,660% highlight why it is viewed as one of the best long-term crypto investments .

The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office has filed a lawsuit to seize shares of billionaire Konstantin Strukov’s gold mining company, Yuzhuralzoloto, state-owned media Tass reports . Strukov, who has been a deputy of the Legislative Assembly of the Chelyabinsk Region for 25 years, while also the deputy chairman of the Legislative Assembly, acquired the firm through a bankruptcy procedure. He was also the company’s CEO between 1997 and June 2001 before he became chairman of the board of directors. The government’s lawsuit alleges that Strukov violated a ban on all public officials from engaging in business activity. The rule also requires politicians to sell all their securities, shares, or stakes in companies before taking office. According to Tass, Yuzhuralzoloto produces over 450,000 ounces of gold per year, which is $1.505 billion annually with a profit of 34 billion rubles – $432.43 million. Prosecutors allege that Strukov frequently takes profits from the mine and transfers them abroad to Montenegro, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Latvia, Estonia and Turkey where he and his family purchased houses, yachts and other luxury items. The Russian government is requesting that 100% of Strukov and his daughter’s ownership of the company be transferred to the state.

47656232,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=29328,1751832600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png,Vitalik Buterin Proposes Gas Cap to Strengthen Ethereum Security and Stability,https://btc-pulse.com/vitalik-buterin-proposes-gas-strengthen-ethereum/,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and researcher Toni Wahrstätter have put forward a new proposal, EIP-7983, which tries to cap the gas usage per transaction at 16.77 million units. The proposal is proposed to make Ethereum more robust against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, increase stability, and enable higher compatibility with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Why Ethereum Needs a Gas Cap With Ethereum’s current configuration, one transaction may exhaust the entire block’s gas limit. This makes it a vulnerability wherein one high-demand transaction can jeopardize the network by tying up resources, raising DoS vulnerability and uncertainty. The proposed EIP-7983 attempts to do this by setting a hard cap of 16.77 million gas (2²⁴) per transaction. “By doing so, Ethereum can raise its resistance to some DoS vectors,” the proposal states. Impact on zkVMs and Network Efficiency The proposed limit is not just a security issue—it’s an issue of licensing as well. EIP-7983 will contribute to increasing Ethereum’s compatibility with zkVMs by encouraging developers to split large transactions into small, manageable transactions. Transactions requesting gas over the 16.77 million limit would be rejected at the block validation level so they would never even get onto the network. This measure operates independently of the block-level gas maximum, which remains variable at the hands of validators. Balancing Innovation and Security Buterin and Wahrstätter point out that 16.77 million is a conscious choice of a limit that can serve most current decentralized finance (DeFi) and contract deployment applications with the additional aim of reducing unnecessary risk. While not backward compatible for addresses above the cap, the vast majority of existing Ethereum transactions are already below the threshold, avoiding excessive disruption. EIP-7983 is the culmination of earlier work like EIP-7825, aiming to make Ethereum handling of transactions more predictable and friendlier to users. Simplifying Ethereum’s Future This concept is one of Buterin’s larger plans to simplify Ethereum. In May, he argued in favor of a simplified protocol on the lines of Bitcoin’s minimalism to make it more efficient, secure, and easier to use. His five-year plan involves simplifying Ethereum’s execution, consensus, and shared pieces. Alongside, Buterin is exploring new ideas such as “pluralistic identity,” a digital identity system that strives to maintain privacy while enabling equal online engagement.",Ethereum|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-07-06 20:10:00

The proposal includes a protocol-level limit where each transaction can use a maximum of 16.77 million gas (2^24). The aim is to increase the network’s resilience against denial of service (DoS) attacks, provide a more stable network structure, and increase predictability in transaction pricing. According to the new proposal, transactions will no longer be able to exceed 16.77 million gas on their own, regardless of the block gas limit set by the network. This limit will be applied by Ethereum clients during the transaction verification phase, and transactions exceeding this limit will be considered invalid and will not be included in the transaction pool. Similarly, blocks containing transactions exceeding this limit will also be considered invalid. Related News: Coinbase Executive Responds to Claims That the Largest Ethereum Short Position in History Has Been Opened The following items stand out in the details of the proposal, which has a “Draft” status on Github: Gas Cap: A gas cap of 16.77 million will be applied to all transactions. Txpool Validity: Ethereum transactions exceeding this limit will be rejected during the verification phase. Block Validity: Blocks containing transactions exceeding the gas limit will be considered invalid. Independence: This transaction limit will not be directly related to the block gas limit; blocks may contain higher total gas limits, but no single transaction will exceed 16.77 million. The justification for the proposal includes three main points: Reducing DoS Attacks: Risks such as a single transaction consuming all block gas will be eliminated, thus preserving the balance of the network. zkVM Compatibility: Structures that are divided into smaller processes will be more suitable for zero-knowledge proof (zk Proof) systems. Parallel Transaction Performance: ETH fixed gas limit will provide more balanced workload distribution in parallel transaction execution.

According to community analysis, the 36.4 billion XRP currently in escrow accounts could be fully released within the next six years. According to data from XRP analytics community XRPwallets, if Ripple continues to release 300 million XRP every month at its current rate, it will take 10 years for the entire supply to be depleted. However, if the monthly release amount is increased to 400 million XRP starting in 2026, this period could be reduced to 7.5 years, and if a more aggressive strategy is adopted by increasing the monthly release amount by 100 million XRP every year, it could be reduced to just 6 years. Additionally, predictions that Ripple may abandon its past strategy of “releasing a certain amount and then locking it up again” also indicate that it may accelerate this process. Related News: List of the Most Searched Altcoins in Recent Hours Published - Altcoin That Made a Big Deal Today Takes the Top Spot Signals of this change have already begun to be seen in the market. Ripple released a total of 1 billion XRP from its escrow account on the 1st and 4th of this month. 700 million XRP of this was re-locked, while the remaining 300 million XRP was allocated for on-demand liquidity (ODL) services, exchange-traded products (ETPs), and blockchain infrastructure projects. XRPwallets noted that Ripple adjusts the circulating supply according to market demand, “increasing the likelihood of adopting a more flexible strategy rather than a conditional fixed release and lock-up method.” This strategy change is of great importance not only in terms of distribution volume, but also in terms of liquidity and infrastructure expansion of the XRP ecosystem. How and how quickly Ripple distributes escrow volume, and whether it continues its re-locking strategy in this process, can play a decisive role in XRP price and market dynamics. Currently, a significant portion of the XRP supply is held in escrow accounts controlled by Ripple. *This is not investment advice.

As highlighted by Paul Barron on X, Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, will now be accepted as collateral across all services provided by prime brokerage firm Hidden Road. According to Garlinghouse, RLUSD is “the first stablecoin enabling efficient, large-scale cross-margin trading between virtual assets and traditional markets, with 24/7, year-round availability.” This integration opens the door for institutional players to engage in real-time trading across asset classes with improved capital efficiency. A Strategic Alliance for Institutional Crypto Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road marked a major step in the company’s broader institutional strategy. Hidden Road serves over 300 major clients and processes roughly $3 trillion in annual trading volume. At a Singapore press conference, @bgarlinghouse announced: “Ripple’s stablecoin $RLUSD will be accepted as collateral for all services at Hidden Road. RLUSD is the first stablecoin enabling efficient, large-scale cross-margin trading between virtual assets and traditional… — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) July 6, 2025 Backed by Ripple’s robust balance sheet, the acquisition positions Hidden Road to offer enhanced infrastructure, more liquidity, and new financial instruments that bridge the traditional and digital worlds. Garlinghouse emphasized that Ripple is capitalizing on a unique market opportunity as U.S. regulatory conditions evolve. With the SEC litigation largely behind the company, Ripple is doubling down on its mission to build real-world utility. The RLUSD announcement is a central part of that vision, targeting institutional needs for liquidity, transparency, and seamless trading between fiat and crypto assets. RLUSD: A Stablecoin Built for Institutional Use Unlike typical stablecoins, RLUSD is designed from the ground up for enterprise use. Launched in December 2024, it offers regulatory compliance, full backing with U.S. dollar reserves, and deep integration into financial markets. What sets RLUSD apart is its role as collateral in cross-margin trading, something no other stablecoin currently enables at scale. This means clients using Hidden Road can now use RLUSD to post collateral on both traditional and digital asset trades, unlocking significant efficiencies. For institutions managing complex portfolios, this reduces the need to move funds across platforms, lowers capital requirements, and speeds up execution in volatile markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRPL and the Power of Tokenized Infrastructure The partnership is expected to bring more than just stablecoin support. Hidden Road also plans to integrate Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL) into its post-trade infrastructure , enabling fast, low-cost settlement and clearing of transactions. XRPL’s scalability and decentralization make it well-suited for handling institutional volumes, and its integration could drive a substantial increase in on-chain activity. Analysts view this move as a real-world use case that proves the value of blockchain-based settlement systems. As more institutions gain exposure to XRPL through RLUSD and Hidden Road, Ripple’s network could see higher liquidity and deeper adoption. Ripple’s Expanding Vision Ripple has also applied for a national banking license in the U.S. and secured a Federal Reserve master account, positioning itself to issue and manage RLUSD directly under federal oversight. These steps reinforce its long-term commitment to regulatory clarity and institutional trust. With RLUSD now accepted by one of the largest digital asset prime brokers, and full integration with XRPL on the horizon, Ripple is charting a new course for stablecoins, one that prioritizes institutional readiness, financial interoperability, and round-the-clock efficiency.

Spotlighting projects like Bittensor (TAO) , Filecoin (FIL) , and IOTA , this article will delve into the potential these cryptos hold. With innovative technology and strong market moves, these coins are stirring substantial interest. Discover which digital assets could make headlines in the coming months. TAO Uptrend Hopes Amidst Bearish Pressure in Bittensor Bittensor experienced a weekly decline of about 2.85% and a one-month drop of nearly 8.85%. Over six months, the coin faced a sharper downturn of roughly 42.35%, indicating a sustained period of poor performance. Price movements highlight continued bearish pressure with little upside momentum. Investors have navigated choppy conditions characterized by high volatility and weak buyer sentiment. Currently, Bittensor trades within a range between approximately $267 and $422. Resistance levels are at $511 and $667, acting as barriers to bullish movements. Support is found near $199, with a stronger level at around $44. An RSI of 42 and an Awesome Oscillator reading of -27 suggest a lack of bullish momentum while bears maintain control. Traders might look for buy opportunities near support if stabilization occurs, while a break above $511 could spark renewed optimism. Caution is advised as market sentiment fluctuates. Filecoin Market: Past Decline Sets the Stage for Key Level Testing Filecoin dropped roughly 5% over the last month, narrowing its price movement to a range between $1.93 and $2.73. Over the past six months, the asset has seen a dramatic decline of over 60%, showing significant weakness that has affected investor confidence. Price swings indicate heavy selling pressure, with a longer-term downturn remaining a critical concern. Historical trends suggest limited signs of a quick recovery, with consolidation near lower thresholds indicating any change in sentiment may be gradual. Current trading shows Filecoin clustering between critical support and resistance levels that frame its near-term outlook. The nearest support is at $1.55, while resistance stands at $3.15. Bears dominate due to the lack of a strong upward trend, as indicated by a slightly negative Awesome Oscillator (-0.072) and a low RSI near 44. Weak momentum and negative moving averages suggest ongoing caution. Short-term buyers may consider entry points near support zones, while sellers could capitalize within resistance boundaries. A focus on observing a firm breakout might help identify when bulls could gain momentum. IOTA Market Pulse: Price Action and Key Levels in Focus IOTA experienced a decline with a 1-month drop of 8.93% and a 6-month fall of 59.12%. Weekly activity showed a modest drop of 2.27%, while prices moved within a range of $0.13 to $0.19. The half-year behavior indicates that price weaknesses have deepened over time, reflecting a challenging environment for investors as corrective moves have dominated the scene. Price adjustments have been consistent across different timeframes, marking a period of persistent downward pressure and cautious trading activity. The current trading range for IOTA sits between $0.13 and $0.19, with key levels at resistance of $0.23 and support of $0.11. A second resistance is noted at $0.28, and support exists at $0.05. Price indicators show a bearish bias, with a momentum reading of 0.00270 and an awesome oscillator at -0.00870. An RSI of 42.63 reinforces a subdued sentiment among traders. No clear trend is evident, allowing for tactical trades within these levels. Traders may consider buying near $0.11 support and looking for exits at $0.23 resistance, while maintaining careful position sizing as market dynamics can shift. Conclusion Bittensor (TAO) , Filecoin (FIL) , and IOTA are emerging as key players this summer. Each offers unique features that could drive significant interest. TAO focuses on decentralized AI, FIL specializes in data storage, and IOTA provides solutions for the Internet of Things. These cryptos hold potential due to their innovative approaches and market relevance. With the increasing demand for decentralized technologies, they are well-positioned for growth.

Co-founder Vitalik Buterin says they are choosing it not because of hype, but because they trust it to work well and stay reliable. Speaking recently at the Cannes Lions event, Buterin said institutions are turning to Ethereum because it is stable and dependable and has never crashed. The network has operated without downtime for over ten years, and that strong track record is now its most significant advantage. Ethereum Records Ten Years of Continuous Operation Ethereum has been running for over ten years without a single outage. It has processed millions of transactions and supported many applications without stopping. This is rare in the world of digital technology, where other digital platforms often crash or slow down. Adding to this fact, Vitalik Buterin noted that many institutions now choose Ethereum because it is a dependable platform. This is particularly important when large organizations manage money, sensitive data, and digital services. Ethereum Network Transitioned From New Idea to Trusted System In the early years, many viewed the ETH network as a novel and high-risk concept. Today, Ethereum is seen as one of the strongest and most trusted platforms. According to analysts at Bernstein, it represents the future of blockchain innovation. Developers and early users no longer adopt the platform. Now, it supports real-world systems used by companies, governments, and investors. Some blockchains are faster or cheaper, but they often have issues with security or maintaining a stable online presence. Ethereum takes a slower, more deliberate approach to ensure things are done correctly. Buterin says this is one reason why many institutions trust Ethereum for the long term. A Safe Bet for Institutions The digital asset market changes quickly. Prices can fluctuate significantly in a short period. In this uncertain space, institutions are careful. They want to work with platforms that are tested and safe. Public companies are also beginning to see ETH as more than just a digital asset. Firms like Bit Digital and SharpLink are now incorporating ETH into their financial strategies , not only for its value but also for the rewards that come from staking. As Ethereum has moved to a proof-of-stake system, it offers companies a way to earn consistent returns while holding a secure and trusted asset. Even during big changes, Ethereum continued to run smoothly. This careful and steady progress has made institutions more confident in the network. With over ten years of non-stop performance, Ethereum has proven that it can meet the needs of serious, long-term users.

Referring to it as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Stellar Rippler characterized the package as Trump’s largest spending and tax initiative to date. On its surface, the bill appears to promote growth and strengthen national priorities. However, Stellar Rippler maintained that it is designed to deliberately accelerate the collapse of the outdated monetary system, for a new, blockchain-based infrastructure to emerge, with XRP and XLM at its core. According to the thread, the bill includes permanent tax cuts, sharp reductions in Medicaid and food stamp funding, record-high allocations for border security, and a quiet restructuring of fiscal oversight, alongside trillions of dollars added to the debt ceiling. While Trump publicly presented the measure as an effort to restore the economy and empower Americans, Stellar Rippler asserted that the underlying goal is to hasten the end of the current financial order to replace it on terms favorable to U.S. sovereignty. (1/ ) Trump Just Signed the One Big Beautiful Bill… And It Might Trigger the Final Phase of the Financial Reset. Massive tax cuts. Trillions in new debt. Elon’s warning. Republicans split. $XRP & $XLM Were Built for This Moment Here’s what they don’t want you connecting pic.twitter.com/HkydBCps6g — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) July 5, 2025 Concerns From Opponents Stellar Rippler noted that prominent figures, including Elon Musk, Senator Rand Paul, and some Republican lawmakers, criticized the bill on fiscal and ethical grounds. Critics pointed to $2.8 trillion in permanent tax cuts, disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest 10 percent, $850 billion in Medicaid and food stamp cuts over the next decade, and an estimated $6.4 trillion added to the national debt by 2035. The bill also funds expanded border surveillance and rolls back long-standing fiscal oversight mechanisms. Despite these concerns, Stellar Rippler dismissed the idea that Trump is unaware of the risks, describing the policy as intentional and calculated. In his view, Trump is not destroying the system to harm the United States but to rebuild it using infrastructure already in place, specifically highlighting Bitcoin, Ripple, and Stellar technologies. XRP, RLUSD, and XLM as Strategic Tools Stellar Rippler argued that XRP, RLUSD, and XLM were developed precisely for moments like this. He wrote that the financial turbulence triggered by the bill weakens centralized banks and pressures the Federal Reserve, creating a need for “American alternative rails.” Ripple, he noted, is uniquely positioned to meet this demand, operating a private ledger for central banks and a public ledger for broader use, with the potential for these two systems to merge. The commentator described Ripple’s XRP and RLUSD as critical to ensuring that the United States maintains control of the emerging global financial system, as opposed to ceding influence to competing solutions such as IMF digital assets or gold-backed BRICS currencies. He also highlighted the role of Stellar’s XLM as an international bridge asset. Stellar’s infrastructure, already integrated in Africa and Asia, allows U.S.-denominated remittances to flow into markets where banking systems are failing. It’s a fast, low-cost, and decentralized network that provides stability and liquidity to weaker economies while maintaining U.S. technological control over cross-border flows. Expanding Into Healthcare and Tokenization In his analysis, Stellar Rippler also drew attention to related developments beyond finance. He connected Trump’s cuts to Medicaid and food stamp funding with the emergence of blockchain-based healthcare solutions such as XRP Healthcare and DNA Protocol. These projects aim to provide decentralized medical services, biometric identification, and encrypted health records while enabling global, instant payments for healthcare claims. As public healthcare systems weaken, he suggested, these blockchain-based alternatives could fill the gap in a way that is more efficient and user-controlled. The commentator also referenced the upcoming July 14 ISO20022 implementation and recent moves by Ripple, including its application for a U.S. banking charter , the tokenization of U.S. debt on the XRP Ledger through ONDO, and its strengthened global partnerships. He pointed to Stellar’s leadership in stablecoin adoption and tokenization efforts in emerging markets as further evidence that both networks are already functioning as critical components of the new monetary system. Prepared for a Coordinated Reset Stellar Rippler concluded his thread by characterizing these developments as a coordinated transition. According to his view, the signing of Trump’s bill sets the stage for a deliberate reset of the financial system, leveraging U.S.-built blockchain infrastructure. XRP and XLM, he argued, were never intended merely as speculative assets for bullish markets but as foundational infrastructure for a redesigned global economy. He maintained that the bill’s fiscal measures, combined with the readiness of Ripple and Stellar networks, demonstrate how the United States is prepared to lead the world into a tokenized, decentralized financial future.

Technical indicators still give strong bullish signals, and the price charts also project a bullish market scenario for the day. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $662.99. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.42 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,108.65 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May. Heading into July, BNB is trading approximately $653.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-06 20:55:00

Has Litecoin’s steady run left any chance for new buyers? The focus in crypto right now is shifting from hype to practical value, strong tech, and real-world usage. Amid all the chatter, one project combines low pricing, huge presale numbers, and a growing network better than most: BlockDAG. This list looks at these four most popular crypto coins that are showing strength among both traders and early buyers. Whether it’s smart partnerships, powerful upgrades, or the potential for serious gains, these cryptos are topping watchlists for good reasons. If you’re hunting for the most popular crypto coins to buy today, this guide has what you need: a complete guide with current prices and project updates you can actually use. 1. BlockDAG: Rare $0.0016 Entry with Strong ROI Potential BlockDAG is closing in on its last presale phases, and the response has been huge so far. The project has raised more than $332 million, with over 23.6 billion BDAG coins sold to date. Right now, the coin is available at $0.0016 for a limited time until August 11. With the final launch price locked at $0.05, buyers at this level could see up to 3,025% profit. From batch 1 to batch 29, the total ROI already stands at 2,660%, making BlockDAG (BDAG) one of the most popular crypto coins for those looking at big gains and strong fundamentals. It’s not just the price that makes BlockDAG a standout. Its mobile mining app now has 2 million active users. The hardware plan is rolling out with X30 and X100 mining rigs to begin shipping from July 7, followed by the X10 in August. That means the ecosystem is not just an idea; it’s actually up and running. Behind the scenes, trust and security are top priorities. BlockDAG’s security has been audited by CertiK and Halborn, adding more confidence for buyers. Plus, listings on major exchanges like MEXC, LBANK, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart are already lined up. There’s also a referral system and live leaderboard to keep community activity high. If you’re looking at the most popular crypto coins to buy today, BlockDAG’s rare entry price, working tools, and clear roadmap push it right to the top of the list. 2. Toncoin: Telegram’s Support Drives Real-World Use Toncoin is fast becoming one of the most popular crypto coins because of its deep link to Telegram. With millions of daily users, Telegram’s integration makes crypto transfers and micro-payments super easy. This real-world use makes Toncoin’s role more valuable each week. Toncoin recently climbed back toward $7 and has stayed stable even when the broader market wobbled. It’s no longer a hidden gem, but its roadmap shows more integrations are on the way, helping its utility grow. That’s what keeps Toncoin high on the list of most popular crypto coins today for people watching practical adoption. 3. Hedera: Big Names Back Hashgraph’s Growth Hedera is gaining renewed traction as one of the most popular crypto coins for its unique tech and big partners. Unlike a normal blockchain, Hedera uses Hashgraph tech, which helps process transactions faster and with less energy. That’s why giants like IBM and Google sit on its governing council, backing its long-term plans. At around $0.075, Hedera has been making slow but steady progress. Its strong partnerships and stable development path make it appealing for buyers who prefer less drama and more progress. With use cases from supply chains to ID solutions, HBAR proves why it remains one of the most popular crypto coins for those balancing growth with reliability. 4. Litecoin: Legacy Coin Proves Stability Still Counts Litecoin may be older, but it still stands among the most popular crypto coins today. Often called “digital silver,” it’s known for fast transactions and low fees. This keeps Litecoin useful for payments, with plenty of support from exchanges and merchants. Currently trading near $73, LTC is slowly recovering from past dips and holding strong. Halving events and its transaction focus keep it relevant while newer coins come and go. If you’re looking for the most popular crypto coins to hold for stability, Litecoin offers exactly that: trust, real use, and a history of staying in the game. The Bottom Line There’s plenty of variety among the most popular crypto coins to buy today, from up-and-comers like BlockDAG with its 3,025% ROI to long-timers like Litecoin. BlockDAG’s low price, working tools, and major exchange listings make it a strong choice for big gains. Toncoin and Hedera bring real-world utility and trusted backers to the table. And Litecoin proves that sometimes the best bet is the one that’s proven itself for years. If you want to pick the most popular crypto coins today, go for projects with substance, and BlockDAG’s limited-time entry point shows what smart timing looks like. The other three fill out a well-rounded list of options you can trust as the market heats up.

According to Bloomberg, neither leader showed up, and neither sent anyone with presidential weight to fill the gap. The two-day summit brought together leaders from the group’s expanded roster, but the image that stood out was the one without China, Russia, Egypt, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Lula stood at the center of the summit’s family photo, with India’s Narendra Modi and South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa flanking him. On the outer edges stood Sergey Lavrov of Russia and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian of Iran. The photo, taken in front of Rio’s Sugarloaf Mountain, looked better organized than the chaotic Group of 20 photo back in November, where Joe Biden, Giorgia Meloni, and Justin Trudeau were all no-shows. But even with ten men posing for the shot, the absence of the most influential figures in the bloc made the group look half-baked. Putin stays away as Russia’s war economy runs out of gas Putin’s absence comes at a time when Russia’s economy, pushed forward for two years by weapons spending and oil money, is showing clear signs of collapse. The cracks are no longer subtle. Industrial production is falling. Inflation is high. Consumer spending is shrinking. The central bank already slashed its key rate in June and is preparing to cut again this month. The budget is deep in the red. Maxim Reshetnikov, Russia’s economy minister, said last month that the country is on the “verge of a recession.” Anton Siluanov, the finance minister, described the situation as a “perfect storm.” Putin, for now, denies the damage. “Reports of its death are greatly exaggerated,” he said, borrowing a line from Mark Twain. But in the same breath, he admitted that recession or stagflation “should not be allowed under any circumstances.” Russia’s economic performance in early 2025 says everything. The first quarter GDP grew by just 1.4%, compared to 4.5% in Q4 2024. Manufacturing just clocked its sharpest contraction in more than three years, data from S&P Global revealed. New car sales in June dropped 30% year-over-year, according to the Association of European Businesses. Russian firms cut output as energy revenues nosedive Russia’s real economy is bleeding. Rostselmash, the largest maker of tractors and harvesters in the country, announced in May that it would slash production and force its 15,000 workers to take annual leave early due to weak demand. Over in Siberia, electricity company Rosseti Sibir said it’s close to bankruptcy because of high debt. It froze new investments and asked for higher tariffs on industrial customers in multiple regions. The ripple is hitting banks. A report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies explained that after the war began, the Kremlin ordered big banks to hand out war-related loans at rates they didn’t choose. Now, with borrowing costs way up, companies can’t pay those loans back. If they start defaulting, the state will have to cover the fallout. A separate May report from the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting warned that the country faces a “moderate” risk of a full-blown banking crisis in 2026, and the risk is rising. Military and security spending this year is expected to eat 40% of the government’s total budget, the highest since the Soviet Union days. That’s over 6% of GDP, which dwarfs the 3% spent by the U.S. and 2% by Germany. For a while, that spending fueled growth, even as sanctions from the West mounted. On paper, Russia was outperforming most major economies. But it didn’t last. The spending spree led to runaway inflation. That forced the central bank to jack up interest rates to 21%, making it almost impossible for businesses to grow or borrow. Even the oil lifeline is fraying. Russia relies on energy for around a third of its national income. But oil prices have been weak all year. The crude Russia sells has stayed below what its budget needs to break even. The country’s oil-and-gas revenue in June hit its lowest point since January 2023, according to the Finance Ministry. China, through Xi, had helped cushion some of the blow by taking in discounted oil and sending critical goods like electronics and industrial equipment. But with Xi also skipping the BRICS summit, that alliance suddenly looks less solid. The financial pressure on Moscow keeps rising.

Crypto analyst CrediBULL is pushing a bold message to the XRP community: the market is still underestimating the altcoin’s bullish setup. In a post on social media platform X, he noted that XRP is currently going on its eighth month of consolidation above its previous all-time high monthly close, which is a feat that few assets in the market can match. He pointed to this extended sideways movement, especially after a strong impulse off the $0.50 level in late 2024, as evidence that XRP is preparing for a continuation of the breakout. Notably, its monthly candlestick chart shows a tight cluster of monthly candles hovering above the $2.00 range. According to CrediBULL, this structure is one of the cleanest in the crypto space, second only to Bitcoin. Image From X: CrediBULL Another major contributor to the current bullish narrative is an analyst known as Ripple Pundit, who projected a 35,000% price surge for XRP the moment Ripple announces a banking license. In his post on the social media platform, he predicted that a regulatory greenlight and the final resolution of XRP’s regulatory overhang with the SEC could trigger a significant increase in price. Similarly, market commentator SMQKE drew attention to the explosive XRP price surge in late 2017 and early 2018, during which Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen briefly became one of the wealthiest individuals in the world due to XRP’s quick rally from $0.00065 to $2.5. SMQKE noted that the last cycle was merely a glimpse of what’s coming. The next wave of adoption will be global, fully regulated, and built for scale. In his words, “2018 was just a warm-up.” Technical analyst Ali Martinez added further credibility to the bullish case by pointing out the $2.38 level as the next major resistance. This is based on on-chain data from Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), which shows a significant XRP volume concentrated at this price level. If XRP manages to clear this area with strong volume, it would not only overcome heavy resistance but also trigger a cascade of buying interest and a major rally. Image From X: @ali_charts Mercado Bitcoin Tokenization Deal On XRPL XRP’s underlying utility is also gaining traction beyond price charts and predictions. Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America’s largest digital asset platforms, recently announced plans to tokenize over $200 million worth of real-world assets (including fixed income and equity instruments) directly on the XRP Ledger.

BNB Could Find a Deal with the United Arab Emirates, Similar to Toncoin As it is known, Toncoin (TON) announced today that it has entered into a collaboration with the United Arab Emirates and that those who make a payment of $ 35,000 and stake $ 100,000 in TON for three years will have a golden visa valid for 10 years in the United Arab Emirates. The development in question was also retweeted by Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram, the company behind Toncoin. Related News: BREAKING: This Altcoin Has Reached an Agreement with the United Arab Emirates and Will Grant Gold Visas to Token Holders After this, Binance founder Chanpeng Zhao evaluated the development and said that if this is true, they will try a similar initiative for BNB. In other words, in the near future, BNB holders can receive a golden visa from the United Arab Emirates if they pay a certain amount of money and additionally stake their BNB for a certain period of time. Of course, this depends on whether Changpeng Zhao and other BNB officials reach an agreement with the United Arab Emirates. However, Changpeng Zhao is still not sure about the authenticity of Toncoin’s announcement. According to Zhao, such an initiative should have come with a government partnership and announcement. Zhao said that it could still be true, but he has not received direct confirmation. *This is not investment advice.

However, these purchases have had no major impact on the price of the leading digital asset. This has sparked concerns among market participants. Many are wondering why BTC has been stuck within a tight range since it hit an all-time high (ATH) in late May. A recent report by the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant revealed the reason for the weak price momentum despite persistent institutional demand, which analysts say is currently not enough. BTC Stalls Despite Institutional Demand According to CryptoQuant, BTC purchases from U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries belonging to firms like Strategy have declined this year compared to the period from November to December 2024. ETF purchases have decreased from 86,000 BTC in early December to 71,000 BTC in mid-May, and are currently at 40,000 BTC. The trend represents a 53% decline over this period. At the same time, Strategy’s acquisitions have also dropped from 171,000 BTC in December to 16,000 BTC currently. This shows a 90% plunge over the period. Although institutional purchases and ETF flows have kept BTC above $100,000 for a while, further declines could slow price gains. This could be exacerbated by the fact that ETF and institutional buys represent a fraction of the overall BTC demand, which seems to be contracting. At the market’s peak in December, ETF and institutional purchases represented 33% of total Bitcoin demand growth. These entities purchased no more than 257,000 BTC out of the total 771,000 BTC. This indicated that the Bitcoin market had a bigger and unobservable demand coming from other sources. Overall Demand is Contracting Currently, the overall demand for BTC is contracting , having declined by 895,000 BTC over the last 30 days. This metric needs to expand for a sustainable price rally to occur. However, the demand level from institutions right now is not enough to trigger that expansion. CryptoQuant stated that Bitcoin’s annual growth chart reflects how ETF and institutional purchases account for only a portion of demand. Apparent demand has also contracted by 857,000 BTC, significantly offsetting the expansion of ETF and institutional demand (377,000 BTC and 371,000 BTC, respectively). “The bottom line is that ETFs and MSTR’s Bitcoin purchase, while overall positive for Bitcoin price gains, are not sufficient to drive prices to fresh all-time highs,” the market intelligence firm added.

But is this optimism justified, or is it another echo of hype in an already volatile market? JacktheRippler’s Bold Forecast JacktheRippler is known for his high-conviction predictions and passionate advocacy for XRP. In past statements, he has envisioned XRP reaching triple- and even four-digit price levels, suggesting that holders could see life-changing wealth. #XRP IS ABOUT TO PRINT MULTI MILLIONAIRES! pic.twitter.com/FsFlMa5hBk — JackTheRippler ©️ (@RippleXrpie) July 6, 2025 He had previously made headlines by declaring that 100 XRP could one day be worth $1 million, a projection that assumes XRP reaching $10,000 per token, an extreme but symbolic figure of his confidence in the asset’s future potential. His most recent statement echoes that same belief, suggesting that XRP is about to create a new wave of multimillionaires. While many in the XRP community share his enthusiasm, market analysts advise investors to balance hope with realistic expectations. Institutional Interest and Market Momentum XRP’s current valuation reflects not only investor sentiment but also growing institutional interest. Analysts from Bitget have predicted that XRP could reach $5 by late 2025 , driven by institutional adoption, Ripple’s expanding partnerships, and integration into cross-border payment systems. Ripple’s push for a U.S. banking charter, the launch of RLUSD stablecoin, and increasing engagement with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) add weight to the asset’s long-term value proposition. However, technical indicators show mixed signals. XRP has recently faced resistance above $2.30 and is vulnerable to downside pressure if it fails to hold above $2.20. Some analysts warn that if bearish patterns take hold, XRP could retrace to $1.60 or lower. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Can XRP Create Multimillionaires? JacktheRippler’s assertion depends heavily on XRP achieving unprecedented price levels. To become a multimillionaire solely from XRP, an investor would need to hold a significant amount of the asset—or the price would need to skyrocket well beyond previous highs. A realistic target of $5 to $10 per XRP could deliver substantial returns, but it may not be enough to “print” multimillionaires unless backed by large holdings. Still, if key catalysts align, such as a favorable SEC resolution , the approval of XRP-based ETFs, and broader adoption of Ripple’s technology, then XRP’s upside could surprise even cautious investors. In this scenario, early believers like JacktheRippler may be proven right. JacktheRippler’s statement captures the high hopes and bullish sentiment that continue to surround XRP. While the road to creating multimillionaires is uncertain and depends on regulatory and market-driven factors, the potential for significant gains remains. XRP is at a critical juncture, and whether it fulfills its boldest forecasts or not, it is poised to play a major role in the evolving crypto-financial ecosystem.

By 2028, SPX may achieve a peak price of $5.87 and an average trading price of $5.50. In 2031, the target price for SPX is between $8.80 and $9.53, with an average price of $9.17. SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stock market, equities, or securities. The meme coin generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading on different decentralized exchanges; the latter is not recommended for non-professionals due to its high risk and highly volatile nature. SPX6900 is traded on different centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The most popular centralized exchange for trading SPX tokens is Bybit, which has the highest trading volume for this meme coin. SPX6900 (SPX) can be stored in various wallets, including Trust Wallet, Bitget Wallet, and hardware wallets like Ledger. It can also be stored on a centralized exchange like KuCoin and another option could be Kraken, providing easy access to the coin. Early users attest to its credibility and remarkable price performance; however, the meme token still holds the interest of many investors with a daily trading volume in millions and a current circulating supply of 930.99 million SPX, which is also its total supply, although its max supply will be 1 billion tokens. Starting as a non-serious venture, the coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to a 9000% return following its ascent through September 2024.

Per SPX price prediction, it has a chance of reaching $3 by 2026 if positive sentiment prevails, which makes SPX tokens a good purchase option. Will SPX reach $5? To reach $5, SPX’s value along with its market cap will have to increase fivefold. Though not impossible, there are chances of reaching this level by 2028. Does SPX6900 have a good long-term future?

SPX6900 historic price sentiment SPX6900 price history SPX6900 was launched in August 2023 by its primary creators with an opening price of $0.003 but remained under the radar for over a year. In October 2023, SPX’s value spiked to $0.023 under bullish control, which was a considerable growth trajectory, but still, it remained far from market attention. December of 2023 saw a low price of $0.008, which was quite low as compared to the price in October as per crypto market historical data. SPX6900 saw a stagnating price movement from January to May 2024, only to rise periodically to $0.015. In September 2024, SPX6900 gained an enormous 5600% from September 12 to October 14, reaching $0.913, resulting in a massive market capitalization. The token made higher spikes till November 7, 2024, adding significantly to its market cap; however, the token’s price has deteriorated afterwards. On November 21, SPX6900 stooped to $0.450, losing 50% of its value, which made holders cautious. However, the token regained its lost value and ended the year at $0.856. The meme token entered January 2025 with a price tag of $0.866, but it soon jumped to $1.55 as its circulation and acceptance increased. It corrected strongly in search of support at the start of February, attaining an average price of $0.66, but came down to the 0.46 range in March. In April, the coin was trending near $0.386 on the lower side, while in May, it saw a fabulous recovery, peaking at $1.11 along with some other cryptocurrencies. On June 11, the meme coin attained its all time high of $1.73, and at the start of July, SPX is trending above the psychological mark of $1, trading at $1.2 under complete bullish dominance, proving itself a reliable asset.",Crypto Price Predictions|SPX,EN,0,0,TRADING|ZRX|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|PYUSD|SNX|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-06 21:55:00

Scott confirmed Trump will begin sending letters this week to around a dozen countries, warning them that failure to reach an agreement will bring the full weight of the earlier tariffs crashing back into effect. Scott said, “President Trump’s going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don’t move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level.” Those letters are expected to go out Monday. Trump warns trading partners with Monday letter deadline Scott made clear that August 1 isn’t a suggestion or another deadline to kick down the road. “We are saying this is when it’s happening,” he said. “If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that’s your choice.” Scott rejected the idea that this was just another extension or political posturing. The 90-day pause that Trump announced in April, after revealing sharp new tariffs on most major partners, expires this Wednesday. The clock is out. The temporary pause was originally meant to give time for renegotiations. But that window’s closed now. “They’ll start to pay on August 1. The money will start to come into the United States on August 1, in pretty much all cases,” Trump told reporters on Friday. Scott confirmed those payments will start unless something changes this week. Asked if any deals are close, Scott hinted at movement but didn’t name countries. “I would expect to see several big announcements over the next couple of days,” he said. That would put any major updates right before the Wednesday cutoff.

47663381,https://thecoinrise.com/galaxy-digitals-mike-novogratz-issues-bold-bitcoin-call/,1751839204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/47663381.jpeg,Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz Issues Bold Bitcoin Call,https://thecoinrise.com/galaxy-digitals-mike-novogratz-issues-bold-bitcoin-call/,"Mike Novogratz, a well-known Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Galaxy Digital, has made a bold call to investors in the cryptocurrency space. In response to a post on X, Novogratz claimed that there is growing pressure on Jerome Powell, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. This, he maintained, could impact the country’s fiat currency value, hence the need to invest in crypto. Mike Novogratz On Political Interference and Bitcoin as Safe Haven Notably, Novogratz says market participants need to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, as a hedge. He believes that Bitcoin will serve as a safe haven asset for investors if the U.S. dollar weakens due to political pressure on Powell or reckless monetary policy. Given that Bitcoin is decentralized with a limited supply, Novogratz has urged investors to “Buy BTC” as it will become more valuable in the future. According to the Bitcoin advocate, Bill Pulte’s call for Powell’s removal from office, an influential figure with political clout, will not end well. He considers the call to be heading in a financially dangerous direction. Primarily, Novogratz believes that politicizing the Federal Reserve could lead to rate cuts that would negatively impact the dollar. However, such a move to undermine the Fed supports his advocacy for Bitcoin. Is Political Tensions Threatening the Fed’s Independence? For clarity, Jerome Powell’s reluctance to further cut interest rates has sparked hostility towards him. Some Republicans in the U.S. are calling for his resignation . This includes Bill Pulte, who claims there is evidence incriminating Powell. Regardless, Novogratz considers the allegations against Powell as characteristic of a “ Banana Republic move ” which could further weaken the nation’s currency. According to Novogratz, potentially, the move could reduce confidence in U.S. institutions or trigger political instability. Powell had earlier emphasized that interest rate decisions must be based on facts and data, not political predispositions. Amid mounting pressure, some in the financial sector have argued that if Powell gives in, it could compromise the Federal Reserve’s independence. Community Reacts to Novogratz’s Call However, reactions have trailed Novogratz’s post on social media. A user, John Lilic, opines that nothing justifies using $2.5 billion for a renovation. Another user, Jefferson, alleged that Powell was not factual with Congress on the renovation and might face grave issues.

With fresh presales, important tech rollouts, and ETF launches, a few stand out as the best crypto to buy right now. This list skips empty hype and focuses on real signals that matter. From scalable projects to major upgrades, these four choices show what real growth can look like. If you’re ready to get in early on what could bring strong gains through 2025, start with this rundown of the best crypto to buy right now: BlockDAG, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. 1. BlockDAG: Limited-Time $0.0016 Entry Fuels Massive User Rush BlockDAG sits firmly among the best crypto to buy right now, thanks to its $0.0016 offer that runs until August 11. The project has raised over $332 million so far and sold more than 23.6 billion coins. With a locked-in $0.05 launch price, buyers can aim for gains of up to 3,025%. That’s a solid draw for anyone searching for the best crypto to buy right now. Unlike many presales, BlockDAG (BDAG) already has real traction. Its X1 mining app has over 2 million active users. The hardware side is on track, too, with the X30 and X100 mining rigs shipping on July 7, followed by the X10 on August 15. Its upcoming listings on big exchanges like MEXC, BitMart, CoinStore, and LBANK add extra trust. On top of that, security audits from CertiK and Halborn confirm the project’s solid foundation. With short-term price drivers and a working ecosystem, BlockDAG stands out as the best crypto to buy right now for anyone wanting a fair entry with big upside. 2. Solana: ETF Approval and 2 M Stakers Fuel Momentum Solana (SOL) is back on the radar as one of the best cryptos to buy right now, especially after launching its U.S. staking ETF on July 2. This new REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF lets buyers tap into SOL’s staking rewards, which is a first in the U.S. for crypto funds. SOL’s network growth adds to its case as the best crypto to buy right now. Wallets holding over 0.1 SOL have reached 11.4 million. Plus, Sol Strategies, a fund focused on Solana, is aiming for a Nasdaq uplisting, boosting trust in the ecosystem. Prices have bounced to around $149.55 after dipping to $145. If SOL can break through the $157–160 resistance, analysts expect more upside. Strong infrastructure and new financial products make Solana a clear pick among the best crypto to buy right now. 3. XRP: EVM Sidechain and Smart Supply Moves XRP’s price action might look calm, moving around $2.19 between $2.15 and $2.20, but its fundamentals tell a different story. Ripple completed its July 1 escrow shuffle, unlocking 500 million XRP and relocking 400 million to manage supply. What really makes XRP one of the best cryptos to buy right now is the live launch of the XRPL EVM sidechain. This upgrade brings Ethereum-like smart contracts to XRP’s network, opening up new use cases. Analysts predict XRP could push above $3 if the ETF market gains wider approval. While a climb to $5 will take more time, the building blocks are there. With smart contract support, careful supply controls, and real use cases, XRP deserves its spot on any list of the best crypto to buy right now. 4. Dogecoin: Loyal Community and Breakout Pattern Ahead Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to attract attention as one of the best cryptos to buy right now, trading at around $0.163 after rebounding from $0.157 support. Technical charts show a double bottom pattern, which many see as a bullish signal. If DOGE breaks through the $0.175 – $0.180 range, it could target $0.192 – $0.205 next. If not, it might slide back toward $0.138 – $0.150. Despite the lack of major tech updates, its loyal community keeps it strong among the best crypto to buy right now. Some chart watchers believe DOGE could touch the $1 mark again, with projections up to $1.17 based on Fibonacci patterns. A bounce from its long-term support adds weight to the argument that Dogecoin remains the best crypto to buy right now for traders who like big swings. In Summary BlockDAG, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin each stand out as the best crypto to buy right now because they bring more than just price swings; they have clear user traction, strong tech upgrades, and solid community support. Whether you want early-stage potential like BlockDAG’s $0.0016 entry or proven projects like SOL, XRP, and DOGE, timing is key. Watch their roadmaps, track their levels, and position smartly for the next big run.
