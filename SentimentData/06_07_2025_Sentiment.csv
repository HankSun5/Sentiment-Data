Hyperliquid’s HYPE token has surged over the last year, driven by significant trading volume and supply control. However, recent dips have raised questions about whether this momentum can be sustained. SUI, another rising contender, has attracted attention with bold price targets, but its user activity has slowed, leading to doubts about near-term growth. In stark contrast, BlockDAG’s recent partnership with the Seattle Seawolves and an impressive presale raising $331 million, with over 23.5 billion coins sold, reflects growing trust in the project. BlockDAG (BDAG) ROI since Batch 1 is 2,660%, and the special offer of purchasing tokens at $0.0016 has made it one of the most enticing long-term crypto investments available. Hyperliquid Price Outlook: Token Surges, and Momentum Hyperliquid has gained attention with a massive 1,000% surge in the HYPE token over the last year, backed by steady user demand. It has secured around 70% of the on-chain perpetuals volume and averaged $420 million in daily trading activity. This growth is largely attributed to the platform’s buy-and-burn model, where trading fees fund token buybacks, limiting supply. Despite the gains, recent price corrections raise concerns about sustaining this momentum. Hyperliquid’s airdrop strategy has helped avoid early sell-offs, but with the HYPE token experiencing fluctuations, it remains uncertain whether this rally will continue. Technical indicators suggest recovery after a brief dip from its $45 peak, but maintaining this growth will rely on consistent user engagement and managing supply efficiently. SUI Price: Bold Targets vs. User Momentum Slows The price potential for SUI has sparked debates, especially after Raoul Pal set an ambitious target of $22. However, the data suggests a more measured growth trajectory. While SUI has experienced short-term rallies, such as a 40% increase recently, its trading volume has cooled, indicating a possible slowdown in user interest. From a technical perspective, resistance around the $1.50 level remains a challenge. SUI’s price has yet to break through this ceiling, and without renewed demand, it may struggle to gain further upward movement. While SUI’s long-term fundamentals still hold promise, its immediate price potential will depend on overcoming these technical barriers and rekindling consistent usage. BlockDAG Joins Seattle Seawolves in Web3 Revolution The Seattle Seawolves have partnered with BlockDAG.Network to introduce blockchain-powered fan experiences. This collaboration aims to enhance fan interaction by offering unique digital ownership opportunities such as NFTs, tradable tokens, and exclusive collectibles linked to the team and its players. In addition, BlockDAG has become the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves for the 2025 season. This partnership will include co-branded content, providing match previews, predictions, and exclusive behind-the-scenes moments across Seawolves’ social media channels. Fans will have access to blockchain-based digital assets, allowing them to collect and trade items securely. This partnership represents the merging of digital ownership with sports fan loyalty. The collaboration also underscores BlockDAG’s rising momentum, with its record-breaking presale continuing to attract attention. BlockDAG’s presale has raised over $331 million and sold 23.5 billion coins, with Batch 29 priced at $0.0276. For a limited time, buyers can purchase at just $0.0016, offering the potential for substantial returns. With the increasing adoption of Web3 technology, BlockDAG continues to solidify its status as one of the best long-term crypto investments. Conclusion While the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies often leads to unpredictable price swings, BlockDAG’s stable approach sets it apart. By locking its presale price at $0.0016, BlockDAG offers a clear, predictable entry point for buyers. This structured approach to its presale, currently in Batch 29 at $0.0276, eliminates the fear of missing out and gives participants confidence in their purchase. In the evolving landscape of crypto, where quick price spikes often distract from long-term value, BlockDAG offers a solid and stable investment opportunity. Its recent partnership and continued presale success show that its path is guided by real adoption and tangible progress, making it one of the best long-term crypto options for 2025.

But for investors chasing explosive growth, newer opportunities like Ruvi AI (RUVI) may hold greater potential. Analysts are pointing to a highly favorable set of circumstances that could see Ruvi AI reach a $1 valuation faster than expected , perhaps even challenging Binance Coin’s renowned growth trajectory. With $2.2 million raised during its presale, a robust foundation of more than 2,000 holders , and a utility-centered model, Ruvi AI is well-positioned for breakout success. Here’s how Ruvi AI is catching the attention of experts and why it could surpass expectations. Trust and Transparency Set Ruvi AI Apart At the center of Ruvi AI’s appeal is its commitment to security and transparency, qualities that are critical for early-stage crypto projects building investor confidence. Ruvi AI’s smart contracts have successfully passed a third-party audit by CyberScope , a respected blockchain auditing firm. This detailed inspection confirms the system’s functionality and safeguards against vulnerabilities, giving investors peace of mind. Ruvi AI has further solidified its reputation by partnering with WEEX Exchange , ensuring guaranteed post-presale liquidity . This allows investors to trade their tokens seamlessly once the project goes live. Together, robust auditing and liquidity strategies highlight Ruvi AI’s reliability, making it a sound investment for both newcomers and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. Real-World Applications Cement Value While speculative hype has often been a hallmark of rapid crypto growth, Ruvi AI focuses on delivering real-world utility . Combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI provides scalable solutions that address core challenges in industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance . Practical Use Cases Driving Demand Marketing Businesses struggling with inefficient advertising budgets are utilizing Ruvi AI’s AI-tools for precision targeting and campaign optimization. This ensures higher returns on investment while minimizing costs.

Presale Momentum Signals Strong Market Enthusiasm Ruvi AI’s presale metrics indicate a promising future: $2.2 million raised , showcasing solid community support. Over 180 million tokens sold , signaling widespread market interest. More than 2,000 holders , highlighting its growing investor base. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , Ruvi AI is priced at an attractive $0.015 per token . Once the presale ends, the price will jump to $0.07 , giving early participants a nearly 5x ROI . Analysts have even predicted Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token post-listing, equating to a life-changing 66x return on investment for initial backers. VIP Tiers Offer Massive Bonus Opportunities A unique feature of Ruvi AI’s presale is its VIP investment tiers , which offer substantial bonuses. These tiers make it possible for investors to amplify their returns significantly. Here’s the breakdown: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000.

These tiers allow early supporters to maximize their financial gains by capitalizing on Ruvi AI’s rising token valuation. Why Ruvi AI Could Overtake Binance Coin’s Momentum While Binance Coin remains a solid investment for those seeking steady long-term growth, its established position limits its potential for meteoric short-term gains. By contrast, Ruvi AI’s early-stage potential, combined with its trusted audit , liquidity assurance , and real-world applications , makes it a more dynamic opportunity for investors seeking substantial returns. Priced at just $0.015 , Ruvi AI delivers a compelling entry point, offering exponential growth possibilities as it targets a $1 valuation and beyond. Thanks to its innovative approach, demand-driven utility, and investor-focused presale structure, Ruvi AI is setting itself up as a breakout player in the cryptocurrency space.

Outset PR Uncovers an 82% Media Meltdown That Could Block Your Reach,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/trying-to-scale-your-web3-project-in-europe-outset-pr-uncovers-an-82-media-meltdown-that-could-block-your-reach,"As crypto adoption surges across Europe, you'd expect media visibility to follow suit. But according to Outset PR’s latest report , the opposite is happening. Between January and March 2025, 82% of crypto-native media outlets in Western Europe lost traffic. The platforms that once shaped narratives and drove awareness for Web3 startups are now struggling to survive under the combined weight of regulation, algorithmic change, and shifting user behavior. If you’re trying to scale your Web3 project in Europe, this meltdown might be the invisible force throttling your reach. The Paradox: Rising Interest, Shrinking Visibility Crypto interest across the EU is rising: ownership in some countries like Slovenia, Italy, and Croatia exceeds 15%, and Europe's total on-chain crypto value exceeded $500 billion last year which accounted for over 21% of the global value. Source: Chainalysis Yet, while the audience grows, media channels are losing their grip. Outset PR analyzed 133 media outlets across the region, 87 of which were crypto-focused, and found that 82% suffered traffic losses in Q1 2025. The reasons, though varied by country, point to a common denominator: the convergence of regulatory pressure, algorithmic change, and market volatility. At the center of this shift is MiCA , the European Union’s new crypto regulation framework. While full enforcement is still rolling out, its early impact has already reshaped how crypto content is written, published, and ranked. Under MiCA-aligned interpretations, regulators from Paris to Rome began scrutinizing tone, affiliate disclosures, and investment-style language — effectively forcing outlets to recalibrate both editorial and monetization models. Some regional regulators interpreted MiCA differently, so the impact of this new framework verified depending on the country: Source: Outset report Outset’s report also revealed that just 7 outlets across the region crossed the 1 million monthly visits threshold, and accounted for 60.26% of total traffic. Another 6 made up most of the mid-tier. But beyond that, 58 outlets drew under 100K visits each, showing how fragmented and vulnerable the long tail of crypto media has become. Real Numbers, Real Fallout Outset PR’s traffic tracking via SimilarWeb and Ahrefs shows just how deep the cuts go: Italian outlets: Over 70% saw visibility drop, despite high local interest. Dutch-language media: 76% lost search traffic after Google’s March update. German-speaking sites: Nearly 40% of total outlets, yet most failed to hold their audience. UK platforms: Though not subject to MiCA, many got hit by the FCA’s expanded financial promotions regime. Source: Outset report Only a few outliers — like Bit2Me News (Spain, +149.4%) and CoinJournal DE (Germany, +23.9%) — managed to grow, thanks to multilingual content, regulatory awareness, and technical SEO strength. Algorithmic Gatekeeping: The Discover Problem Beyond traditional search rankings, Google Discover has emerged as a powerful channel for crypto media distribution. But here too, the visibility crisis is deepening. Outset PR’s report reveals that only 22.99% of crypto-native media outlets in Western Europe maintained consistent presence in Google Discover throughout Q1 2025. By comparison, 32.61% of generalist finance, tech, and economic platforms — the kind that cover crypto as part of broader business reporting — held steady in Discover. This seemingly narrow percentage gap translates into a massive disparity in reach. For Web3 founders, this shift has immediate consequences. Even the most compelling project announcements, protocol updates, or ecosystem news may never surface in front of their intended audience if they rely on media partners that are excluded from Discover. Why This Blocks Your Growth If you’re relying on crypto media in Europe to boost your brand, here’s the harsh truth: your message may never reach the audience it deserves. With fewer high-traffic platforms, limited Google Discover inclusion , and increasing compliance pressure, traditional media outreach is no longer enough. Worse still, many remaining outlets under 100K monthly visits now lack the editorial firepower or domain authority to move the needle — especially for token launches, exchange listings, or major product drops. Conclusion The European Web3 opportunity is enormous with rising user adoption, institutional momentum, and a unified regulatory framework under MiCA. But Outset PR’s latest report makes one thing painfully clear: the infrastructure for visibility is collapsing right when it’s needed most. Crypto-native media outlets are bleeding traffic. Google Discover is excluding a growing number of them. And regional regulators are rewriting the rules of public communication. For founders and marketing leaders, the implications are strategic. Getting covered is no longer enough — you need compliance-ready storytelling, multilingual editorial alignment, and a targeted outreach strategy that prioritizes quality over quantity. That’s where Outset PR comes in. As the only data-driven communications agency, Outset builds visibility strategies that match the new rules of engagement. In this new cycle, the winners won’t just be the loudest. They’ll be the most visible to the right audience, through the right channels and at the right level of credibility.

Outset PR's recent findings indicate a significant drop in traffic across crypto-specific media outlets, with an impactful 82% experiencing a decline in the first quarter of 2025. This decline in media engagement occurs despite a growing interest in cryptocurrency throughout Europe, presenting a paradox for Web3 founders. The urgency to adapt and find new avenues for visibility is crucial. Understanding the Media Decline Outset PR's research uncovered that various factors contributed to the downturn in media traffic, including regulatory pressures from the new MiCA framework, algorithmic changes in search engines, and overall market volatility. The European Union's MiCA regulations have started reshaping public communication rules, affecting how crypto content is published and distributed. Such regulatory shifts have led media outlets to alter their content strategies, impacting their visibility and traffic. Source: Chainalysis While the audience for crypto content grew, the platforms that once served this audience are now losing their ability to reach them effectively. Regional Variations and Impact The impact of these changes isn't uniform across all countries. Each country's regulatory body has interpreted and implemented MiCA differently, leading to a varied impact on media outlets within those regions. Source: Outset report Strategic Adaptations for Web3 Projects Given these challenges, Web3 founders must rethink their outreach strategies. Traditional media may no longer suffice to gain the necessary exposure. Instead, integrating compliance-ready narratives, leveraging multilingual content, and focusing on platforms that still maintain significant traffic is essential. Some platforms, like Bit2Me News in Spain and CoinJournal DE in Germany, have seen positive growth by aligning their content with regulatory standards and focusing on SEO enhancements. Concluding Insights The landscape for crypto media in Europe is rapidly evolving under new regulations and market dynamics.

After its launch in 2023, SUI surged past $1, reaching $2.18 by March 27, 2024. Despite a dip afterward, the token rebounded impressively in autumn 2024, hitting a new high of $2.36 on October 14. By the end of 2024, SUI's value soared to $5.35. This growth was fueled by a significant increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) within its system, surpassing $2 billion. Christian Williams, managing director of the Sui Foundation, expressed pride in the ecosystem's growth, noting the remarkable development from the community and DeFi activities. As of January 6, 2025, SUI hovered around $5.20. Named after the Japanese element of water, the Sui platform aims to bring fluidity and adaptability to the Web3 landscape. Built on Sui Move, derived from the Move programming language, it offers a flexible network for developers and users alike.

Some analysts foresee FET reaching $35 by 2026; others predict more modest growth. By 2030, forecasts range from $3 to $4.66. Projections for 2050 suggest significant potential, but investors should be cautious due to market unpredictability. In today's market, Fetch.ai is appealing for those interested in AI and blockchain fusion. Its innovative technology, strategic partnerships, and potential for industry disruption make FET a cryptocurrency to watch as it evolves.

Aiming to bring top-tier financial products to everyone, this protocol offers innovative solutions for tokenized real-world assets. ONDO's value surged in the early months, peaking in June before a slight dip. Later in the year, interest in real-world asset cryptocurrencies reignited ONDO's momentum. This enthusiasm propelled the token to an all-time high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, ONDO was trading at around $1.45, showcasing its resilience and growing adoption. Looking ahead, predictions suggest a promising future for ONDO. By the end of 2025, forecasts estimate the token could range between $1.50 and $3.50.

Amid a revival of memecoins, its presale has soared by an incredible 3,333%. Crypto traders are hurrying to invest in this new token, drawn by its impressive gains. Excitement is building, and many are wondering what's next for XYZVerse. What is driving this meteoric rise? Explore the factors behind its rapid ascent. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $14 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333. At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits From Meme to Market Star: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. It was created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They chose a popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which is rare, Dogecoin is plentiful. There is no limit to how many can be made. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined. At first, people saw it as a ""memecoin."" But in 2021, its value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Its total value went over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and support from Elon Musk. It showed how online communities can impact markets. Dogecoin's technology is simple and easy to use. Transactions are fast and cheap. Its abundant supply makes it accessible. With growing acceptance, some think it has potential. However, its value is heavily influenced by trends and social media. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features. In the current market, it's important to be cautious. The crypto market is unpredictable. While Dogecoin has a strong community, its future depends on continued interest. For those looking for a fun and community-driven coin, Dogecoin remains an option. But as with any investment, it's wise to do your research. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender Shiba Inu, or SHIB, started as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency but has grown into much more. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work smoothly within the larger Ethereum ecosystem. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, which increased SHIB's popularity. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's use of Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a platform for trading, and plans for NFTs and community governance. SHIB's connection to Ethereum gives it more possibilities. It aims to be more than just a meme coin. In today's market, SHIB shows potential because of its ongoing development and strong community. While the crypto world can be unpredictable, SHIB's steps into decentralized finance and increased usefulness might make it appealing to some. Compared to other similar coins, SHIB offers more features, which could help it last as the market moves toward practical uses of blockchain technology. BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Energizing the Solana Community BONK is a new memecoin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a playful Shiba Inu mascot. It's not just another token; BONK aims to shake up the crypto scene by redistributing power from big venture capital firms to everyday users. After its recent listing on Coinbase, BONK's value shot up by over 100%. Half of its total supply was airdropped to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects, showing its commitment to building a strong community. The coin faces challenges like a large total supply and the wild swings common in memecoin prices. However, BONK is carving out a space in the growing ecosystem of decentralized apps on Solana. The launch of BonkSwap, its own decentralized exchange, adds to its utility. In a market where community-driven projects are gaining attention, BONK stands out. While it shares the spotlight with other memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, BONK's deep integration with Solana's technology gives it unique potential. Keeping an eye on market trends and developments around BONK could be worthwhile for those interested in the evolving crypto landscape. PEPE: The Frog Memecoin Shaking Up the Crypto Scene PEPE is a deflationary cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Embracing the playful spirit of internet culture, PEPE aims to join the ranks of popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets PEPE apart is its no-tax policy and its honest approach about having no utility—it's all about fun and simplicity in the world of memes. In April and May 2023, PEPE's market cap soared to an astonishing $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires and gathering a vibrant community of enthusiasts. This explosive growth ignited what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with new meme coins experiencing dramatic rises and falls. Looking ahead, PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a bold plan for a ""meme takeover."" With the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many eyes are on PEPE. Compared to other coins, PEPE captures the whimsical side of crypto, standing out in the current market trends. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, BONK, and PEPE have made strides, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth and uniting sports fans worldwide.

This ethos is intended to captivate not only crypto enthusiasts but also a broader audience that appreciates the underdog spirit in competitive arenas like sports. Building a Robust Community The creators of XYZVerse have dedicated 10% of the total token supply for community rewards, fostering a sense of ownership and involvement among its members. This strategy enhances its foundation, aiming to cultivate a loyal and engaged base. Join the XYZVerse Community for Exclusive Airdrops and Rewards Case Studies: The Rise of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin's journey from a quirky memecoin to a staple in top crypto rankings has paved the way for tokens like XYZVerse. With a large supply and strong community engagement, Dogecoin showed that beyond the memes, substantial market value can be created. Similarly, Shiba Inu leverages its Ethereum-based architecture to expand beyond meme status, integrating real-world applications and community governance. Emerging Contenders: BONK and PEPE While BONK invigorates the Solana ecosystem with its unique community-focused distribution strategy, PEPE remains steadfast in its no-tax, fun-centric philosophy amidst the crypto volatility, underpinning the diverse strategies within the memecoin sphere. Conclusion: Anticipating the Future of XYZVerse As XYZVerse prepares for its upcoming exchange listings, comparisons to early days of DOGE and SHIB are inevitable. Whether it will mimic their success remains to be seen, but the combination of strong community backing and strategic market entries might just position XYZVerse as a formidable player in the crypto arena.

Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Bitcoin: The Digital Currency Changing Money Forever Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, reshaping how we think about money. Created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it's a form of electronic cash that allows people to send payments directly to each other. There's no need for banks or governments to get involved. Bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain, which is like a public ledger shared across many computers. This system ensures that transactions are secure and transparent. Miners around the world verify these transactions by solving complex puzzles. They are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. This process keeps the network running smoothly and safely. Right now, Bitcoin's future looks promising. Every four years, an event called a ""halving"" cuts the rewards miners receive by half. With only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, this makes each one more valuable over time. In the current market, Bitcoin stands strong among other digital currencies. Its limited supply and growing acceptance make it an attractive option for investors. As the world moves towards digital solutions, Bitcoin could play a big role in the future of finance. Keeping an eye on market trends might help you decide if now is the right time to get involved. Solana's SOL: Speeding Ahead in the Blockchain Race Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena with its emphasis on scalability and speed. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a solid foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). What makes Solana stand out is its unique architecture aimed at faster transactions and its flexibility in supporting multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana's high-capacity network that avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. This design attracts developers and investors seeking a platform capable of handling high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, where efficiency and speed are increasingly valued, SOL presents itself as an attractive option. Its technological advancements position it well against other coins, making it a significant player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion While BTC and SOL are strong, XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, unites global sports fans and aims for 20,000% growth, positioning itself as a cultural icon.

Concurrently, the XYZVerse presale has surpassed the $14 million milestone, reflecting significant investor enthusiasm. These developments may be early indicators of a broader surge in alternative cryptocurrencies. The market is abuzz, and the coming days could reveal impactful shifts. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin: The Digital Currency Changing Money Forever Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, reshaping how we think about money. Created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it's a form of electronic cash that allows people to send payments directly to each other. There's no need for banks or governments to get involved. Bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain, which is like a public ledger shared across many computers. This system ensures that transactions are secure and transparent. Miners around the world verify these transactions by solving complex puzzles. They are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. This process keeps the network running smoothly and safely. Right now, Bitcoin's future looks promising. Every four years, an event called a ""halving"" cuts the rewards miners receive by half. With only 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, this makes each one more valuable over time. In the current market, Bitcoin stands strong among other digital currencies. Its limited supply and growing acceptance make it an attractive option for investors. As the world moves towards digital solutions, Bitcoin could play a big role in the future of finance. Keeping an eye on market trends might help you decide if now is the right time to get involved. Solana's SOL: Speeding Ahead in the Blockchain Race Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena with its emphasis on scalability and speed. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a solid foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). What makes Solana stand out is its unique architecture aimed at faster transactions and its flexibility in supporting multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana's high-capacity network that avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. This design attracts developers and investors seeking a platform capable of handling high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, where efficiency and speed are increasingly valued, SOL presents itself as an attractive option. Its technological advancements position it well against other coins, making it a significant player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion While Bitcoin and Solana thrive in the 2025 bull run, XYZVerse's unique sports memecoin positions it for remarkable growth in the surging altcoin market.

This astonishing rise is stirring up excitement in the crypto community. The comeback of memecoins seems to be fueling this intense demand. What's behind this explosive growth, and what could it signal for XYZVerse's future? The captivating developments are drawing attention from investors everywhere. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity From Meme to Market Star: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. It was created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They chose a popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which is rare, Dogecoin is plentiful. There is no limit to how many can be made. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined. At first, people saw it as a ""memecoin."" But in 2021, its value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Its total value went over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and support from Elon Musk. It showed how online communities can impact markets. Dogecoin's technology is simple and easy to use. Transactions are fast and cheap. Its abundant supply makes it accessible. With growing acceptance, some think it has potential. However, its value is heavily influenced by trends and social media. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features. In the current market, it's important to be cautious. The crypto market is unpredictable. While Dogecoin has a strong community, its future depends on continued interest. For those looking for a fun and community-driven coin, Dogecoin remains an option. But as with any investment, it's wise to do your research. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender Shiba Inu, or SHIB, started as a meme-inspired cryptocurrency but has grown into much more. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work smoothly within the larger Ethereum ecosystem. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, which increased SHIB's popularity. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's use of Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a platform for trading, and plans for NFTs and community governance. SHIB's connection to Ethereum gives it more possibilities. It aims to be more than just a meme coin. In today's market, SHIB shows potential because of its ongoing development and strong community. While the crypto world can be unpredictable, SHIB's steps into decentralized finance and increased usefulness might make it appealing to some. Compared to other similar coins, SHIB offers more features, which could help it last as the market moves toward practical uses of blockchain technology. BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin Energizing the Solana Community BONK is a new memecoin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a playful Shiba Inu mascot. It's not just another token; BONK aims to shake up the crypto scene by redistributing power from big venture capital firms to everyday users. After its recent listing on Coinbase, BONK's value shot up by over 100%. Half of its total supply was airdropped to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects, showing its commitment to building a strong community. The coin faces challenges like a large total supply and the wild swings common in memecoin prices. However, BONK is carving out a space in the growing ecosystem of decentralized apps on Solana. The launch of BonkSwap, its own decentralized exchange, adds to its utility. In a market where community-driven projects are gaining attention, BONK stands out. While it shares the spotlight with other memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, BONK's deep integration with Solana's technology gives it unique potential. Keeping an eye on market trends and developments around BONK could be worthwhile for those interested in the evolving crypto landscape. PEPE: The Frog Memecoin Shaking Up the Crypto Scene PEPE is a deflationary cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. Embracing the playful spirit of internet culture, PEPE aims to join the ranks of popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets PEPE apart is its no-tax policy and its honest approach about having no utility—it's all about fun and simplicity in the world of memes. In April and May 2023, PEPE's market cap soared to an astonishing $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires and gathering a vibrant community of enthusiasts. This explosive growth ignited what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with new meme coins experiencing dramatic rises and falls. Looking ahead, PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a bold plan for a ""meme takeover."" With the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, many eyes are on PEPE. Compared to other coins, PEPE captures the whimsical side of crypto, standing out in the current market trends. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, BONK, and PEPE thrive, XYZVerse unites sports fans, aiming for 20,000% growth with a community-driven, meme-infused ecosystem set to become the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

Investor anxiety over potential energy supply disruptions and growing regional instability led to persistent pressure on asset prices. Despite this, the DEX to CEX spot trade volume reached a historic peak of 27.9% in June. DEX Fever Hits June Over the past year, DEX trading volumes have more than doubled. This is in contrast with flat volumes on CEX platforms, according to the latest Binance Research report shared with CryptoPotato. In fact, PancakeSwap led DEX market share growth as it climbed from 16% in April to 42% in June, driven by Alpha trading volume growth and the Infinity upgrade that boosted speed, cost, and liquidity efficiency. World Liberty Financial’s increased on-chain activity also boosted liquidity and yield opportunities. Hyperliquid’s spot volume rose from $6 billion in January to nearly $10 billion in June, amidst fierce competition from decentralized perp trading solutions. On Solana, PumpSwap also maintained strong user engagement. The same cannot be said for Raydium, Orca, and Meteora, which struggled to match their January trading peaks, then fueled by meme coin hype. Hybrid CeDeFi Platforms Narrow the Gap A major driver of this growth is that CEXes are increasingly channeling activity toward DEX platforms. Several large exchanges have launched or revealed hybrid models that merge CEX liquidity with on-chain settlement. Binance Research explained that these CeDeFi offerings deliver low-slippage trading, MEV protection, and fast transactions, which allow DEX scalability while bridging the gap between centralized and decentralized crypto markets. It also stated that the flexible regulatory environment for DeFi has allowed DEXes to innovate and expand with new features, which has driven their on-chain volumes. On the other hand, CEX spot volumes remain tied to retail speculation, macro conditions, and volatility, which makes them more vulnerable to external market shifts seen throughout this year.

Many projects are active, but only a few combine strong development with expanding ecosystems. Whether aiming for early access or focusing on existing platforms, these four stand out. This list includes BlockDAG, Cardano, VeChain, and Stellar. From ongoing presales to network upgrades, each offers different paths to long-term potential. Here’s how they are shaping up for the year ahead. 1. BlockDAG: Active Presale and Expanding Ecosystem BlockDAG is gaining traction with its ongoing presale, now in Batch 29. BDAG is priced at $0.0016 and available through the GLOBAL LAUNCH release until August 11. So far, over 23.6 billion BDAG have been sold, and the project has raised about $331 million. The listing price is set at $0.05, which suggests possible returns up to 25x for early participants. The project is already showing user activity. The mobile mining app has 2 million users. Hardware units are also part of the plan, with X30 and X100 rigs shipping July 7, and X10 units going out August 15. Security checks have been completed through Halborn and CertiK. Listings are confirmed for MEXC, LBANK, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. Liquidity plans are in place to manage market entry. With a clear rollout and user base growing, BlockDAG (BDAG) fits well into the best crypto to buy in 2025 category. 2. Cardano: Whale Activity and Governance Steps Forward Cardano is holding firm even as the price moves within a narrow range. ADA is trading near $0.56 after staying between roughly $0.5450 and $0.5939. While some smaller holders have been selling, larger addresses continue to add. Data shows wallets with more than 1 million ADA have added around 490 million ADA recently, bringing their combined holdings to about 23.74 billion ADA. This steady buying from big accounts points to rising confidence at scale. Cardano also makes a case as one of the best crypto to buy in 2025 due to its progress on governance. The Constitutional Committee election closed on July 2, marking a major move toward community-led decisions. This new body will guide network changes under the Cardano Constitution. At the same time, Intersect introduced updates to proposal tools, treasury systems, and GovTool, giving users more control. With consistent buying from large holders and a governance model taking shape, Cardano shows a clear path forward with long-term focus. 3. VeChain: Enterprise Use and Fresh Staking Incentives VeChain continues to focus on real-world supply chain tools. VET is currently near $0.0207. On July 1, the project launched StarGate staking, setting aside $15 million worth of VTHO rewards for early participants over the next six months. This setup encourages users to commit their VET and helps support network strength and decentralization. Joining the program requires holding at least 10,000 VET in wallets like VeWorld. This update is part of VeChain’s larger Renaissance push, which now includes bridging to more than 40 chains like Ethereum and BNB Chain. The network also now supports EVM compatibility and improved development tools. These combined updates are part of what makes VeChain one of the best crypto to buy in 2025. While some projects rely mainly on market interest, VeChain continues to work with firms using blockchain for product tracking, identity checks, and logistics. With utility and income potential, it stands out. 4. Stellar: Focused Growth and Expanding Payment Tools Stellar’s focus on cross-border transactions remains central. XLM is now trading between $0.23 and $0.24 and has kept a steady pace while the market moves sideways. Recently, Stellar completed its Protocol 23 upgrade, which brings smart contract support through Soroban. While no major headlines have surfaced this week, several key partnerships are progressing, including PayPal’s PYUSD and SG-FORGE’s Euro stablecoin, both set to operate on Stellar. These developments help explain why Stellar still belongs among the best crypto to buy in 2025. It continues to build with financial firms and shows strength in handling payment volumes. At the same time, DeFi activity on Stellar is rising, with total value locked now over $97 million. For those focused on networks with long-term use cases and steady growth, Stellar offers a grounded option. It may not post fast gains, but its consistent development and trusted use in financial services are hard to overlook. Summary: What These Four Projects Have in Common For those tracking the best crypto to buy in 2025 , looking beyond short-term price swings is key. BlockDAG is running a large presale, has a live miner app, and continues to build out its tools. Cardano is deepening its governance structure and still offers strong staking systems. VeChain is adding new earning options and expanding its links to other networks. Stellar continues to grow its payment network and is working with major platforms like PayPal and SG-FORGE. Whether your focus is early rollout or proven networks, these four are worth following this year.

After bouncing back from a brief pullback near $105,500 on Wednesday, Bitcoin recently tested $109,000 again in the past 24 hours. A popular crypto analyst has shared a long-term “Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet” that claims that the cryptocurrency has now entered into the final phase that will lead to massive price gains. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Declares Start Of Final Bull Phase In a recent post on X, Merlijn The Trader released what he dubbed the “Bitcoin Bull Run Cheat Sheet.” This cheat sheet is a breakdown of Bitcoin’s past market movements that shows the distinct phases of bear markets, accumulation zones, and subsequent parabolic bull runs. The cheat sheet divides each of Bitcoin’s two previous cycles from 2014 into three colored boxes: red for bear markets, orange for accumulation, and green for bull runs. Merlijn’s chart traces this repeating structure over the past decade, showing how each bull market followed a similar rhythm that began after a lengthy consolidation period and ended with a strong price explosion. The first full cycle began with Bitcoin’s peak around $1,000 in December 2013. Following that top, the price entered a long, painful bear market that spanned into 2015. This red-box phase eventually transitioned into accumulation, where Bitcoin traded sideways between $80 and $500 for a prolonged period. The green bull run box on the chart began around early 2017, and eventually ended with a peak just below $20,000 in late 2017. According to the cheat sheet, this entire cycle from peak to new peak lasted 1500 days. Bitcoin’s second cycle kicked off after its December 2017 top. A long drawdown followed, and the bear market phase dragged Bitcoin down to $3,000 by the end of 2018. The chart marks this point with another red box, followed by the orange accumulation zone that stretched well into 2020. The cheat sheet’s green box reappeared in late 2020 right as Bitcoin broke above its previous highs. The price shot up throughout 2021 and eventually reached a new all-time high around $69,000 in November of that year. This second full cycle was shorter than the first and spanned around 1400 days from the previous top. When Will The Next Bull Run Begin? The current cycle began with Bitcoin’s all-time high in November 2021. Since then, the market has gone through its familiar sequence. A sharp decline into 2022 which bottomed around $15,000 represents the bear market phase. The decline was followed by nearly a year of sideways movement and slow recovery up until early 2025. This is represented as the orange accumulation box on the cheat sheet above. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is now in the next bull phase, and possibly the largest one yet. The chart projects a continuation along the long-term growth curve, possibly toward the $250,000 to $300,000 range over the coming year. Notably, the timeline for the entire cycle this time should take about 1,300 days from late 2021 to complete.

Price scenarios, holder behaviour, and post-breakout plans",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/what-happens-if-fun-hits-010-price-scenarios-holder-behaviour-and-post-breakout-plans,"What if a simple $100 investment today could become $1,000 by Christmas? FUNToken sits at $0.009978 on June 30, 2025, just pennies away from a potential 10x surge that would launch it into crypto's top 100. With 77% of 21.5K community members voting bullish despite recent volatility, the question burning through Web3 gaming circles isn't whether FUNToken will break $0.10. It's what happens next when this deflationary gaming token achieves a milestone that could trigger massive holder redistribution, unlock institutional floodgates, and position early adopters for life-changing wealth. The math is brutal in its simplicity: $0.10 represents a 902% gain from current levels, pushing FUNToken's market cap to $1.08 billion and validating its Web3 gaming leadership thesis. Current holders are already positioning for scenarios most haven't considered. The FUNToken roadmap reveals strategic timing that could make $0.10 inevitable rather than optimistic. Market Reality Check FUNToken's current market position reveals classic pre-breakout dynamics that seasoned analysts recognize immediately. Trading at $0.009978 with a $107.95M market cap, the token shows accumulation patterns despite a 0.26% daily decline and 46.46% volume reduction. These contradictions often signal smart money positioning before explosive moves. The 177.39% yearly gain demonstrates sustained momentum, while the 24.82% volume-to-market cap ratio indicates healthy institutional interest. Most importantly, the fixed 10.81 billion token supply creates mathematical scarcity that compounds with each deflationary burn event. Community sentiment remains remarkably stable with 77% bullish votes from 21.5K participants. This level of confidence through volatility typically precedes major breakouts. Metric Value 24h Change Price $0.009978 Down slightly Market Cap $107.95M -0.26% Volume $26.62M -46.46% Bullish Sentiment 77% Stable The $0.10 Mathematics: Why This Target Makes Sense Breaking $0.10 isn't fantasy; it's mathematical inevitability if current trends continue. This target pushes FUNToken's market cap to $1.08 billion, placing it firmly in the top 100 cryptocurrencies and triggering institutional recognition algorithms. The journey requires conquering resistance at $0.02, $0.05, and $0.075 before the psychological $0.10 barrier falls. Historical Web3 gaming token analysis reveals 10x moves typically unfold over 2-4 months during favorable market conditions. FUNToken's revenue-driven deflationary mechanism creates additional upward pressure by systematically removing tokens from the 10.81 billion supply based on platform performance. Each quarterly burn event makes remaining tokens mathematically scarcer, amplifying price appreciation potential. The timing aligns perfectly with market cycles and FUNToken's strategic roadmap . Q4 2025 gaming platform launches and major partnerships could provide fundamental catalysts for sustained breakout momentum beyond speculative trading. Conservative analysis suggests $0.05 by September creates pathway conditions for full $0.10 achievement by year-end. Aggressive scenarios point to $0.15-$0.20 if institutional adoption accelerates beyond current projections. Holder Behavior Revolution Current FUNToken holders face a psychological transformation most haven't experienced. The 77% bullish majority demonstrates diamond-hand mentality, but $0.10 triggers dramatic behavioral shifts as modest investments become substantial wealth. Analysis reveals three distinct holder categories emerging: conviction holders (40%), strategic profit-takers (35%), and full exiters (25%). Conviction holders understand FUNToken's Web3 gaming positioning offers multi-year value creation beyond short-term gains. These participants will likely hold through $0.10, anticipating further ecosystem expansion and utility growth. Their unwavering confidence often stabilizes prices during volatile breakout phases. Strategic profit-takers represent the most sophisticated group, implementing graduated selling strategies that capture gains while maintaining core positions. These holders typically sell 25-50% at major milestones, using profits to diversify while keeping skin in the game for continued upside. The most dramatic transformation affects small retail holders who accumulated below $0.01. A $0.10 breakout converts $500 positions into $5,000+ wealth, creating unexpected financial freedom for ordinary investors. This psychological impact generates viral social media attention that extends rallies beyond fundamental justification. Projected Holder Behavior at $0.10 Strategy Percentage Action Plan Hold Strong 40% Target $0.20+ Take Profits 35% Sell 25-50% Full Exit 25% Complete sale Roadmap Convergence: Strategic Timing for Breakout FUNToken's 2025-2026 roadmap creates perfect fundamental alignment for $0.10 achievement by year-end. The Q4 2025 gaming platform launch coincides with major partnership announcements that drive organic demand beyond speculative interest. Each completed milestone adds credibility to higher valuation targets. Deflationary tokenomics accelerate value appreciation as ecosystem usage expands. Gaming platform transaction fees trigger automatic Buy-and-Burn events, permanently reducing supply while demand increases. This mathematical relationship suggests $0.10 represents fair value rather than speculative overvaluation. These burn events have already started with the June burn of 25 million tokens taken out of circulation. Strategic positioning shows FUNToken benefiting from broader Web3 gaming adoption projected for late 2025. Industry analysis indicates gaming tokens with working products achieve 10-20x valuations during sector rotations. FUNToken's execution record positions it perfectly for this institutional recognition phase. Critical 2025 Milestones Timeline Catalyst Expected Impact Q3 2025 Gaming partnerships Utility expansion Q4 2025 Platform launch Revenue generation Q4 2025 Enhanced burns Supply reduction Community Momentum FUNToken's community expansion provides essential social infrastructure for sustained price appreciation. The FUNToken Telegram community shows consistent growth while social engagement increases across platforms. This organic building creates viral potential during major price movements. Plus, the AI-power Telegram bot will have gamified features like quizzes to ensure the community remains engaged and build a stronger community. Institutional awareness grows alongside retail enthusiasm. Professional traders increasingly discuss FUNToken's undervaluation relative to competitors with similar utility but higher market caps. This recognition often precedes capital inflows that drive 10x movements. The 77% bullish sentiment from 21.5K votes demonstrates remarkable confidence through volatility. Tokens maintaining 70%+ bullish sentiment during accumulation phases typically experience explosive breakouts within 3-6 months. Beyond $0.10: The Ecosystem Expansion Strategy Achieving $0.10 represents the beginning of FUNToken's value creation journey rather than its conclusion. Post-breakout strategy focuses on ecosystem expansion and utility diversification that sustains momentum toward $0.20-$0.50 longer-term targets. The Web3 gaming sector's trillion-dollar potential provides unlimited growth runway. Breaking $0.10 validates FUNToken's Web3 gaming thesis and unlocks institutional investment previously constrained by market cap requirements. The resulting visibility creates network effects that compound growth exponentially. Smart money recognizes this inflection point as a generational wealth creation opportunity. The $0.10 breakout isn't just a price target; it's a gateway to Web3 gaming dominance.

As institutional adoption accelerates, this projection appears increasingly plausible, prompting discussions about the potential effects on other major cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. Growing Momentum Behind a $1 Million Bitcoin The current market landscape reflects growing optimism about Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory. After surpassing the $100,000 milestone, the asset has seen a surge in institutional involvement. Numerous corporations, inspired by Strategy, have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury holdings. Reports suggest that more than 200 companies now include BTC in their balance sheets. Additionally, the U.S. government is said to be exploring the possibility of creating a national Bitcoin reserve of up to one million BTC. This shift in sentiment has led several public figures to support the $1 million projection, including Michael Saylor, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, Jack Dorsey , Samson Mow, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, and Eric Trump. Estimating XRP’s Price in a $1 Million Bitcoin Scenario To estimate XRP’s potential value in a market where Bitcoin reaches $1 million, it is necessary to consider current market share distributions. At the moment, Bitcoin accounts for approximately 65.7% of the global cryptocurrency market, which currently has a total capitalization of about $3.28 trillion. In comparison, XRP holds a market share of approximately 3.9%. If Bitcoin reaches the $1 million mark while maintaining its market dominance, the total market capitalization of the crypto sector would likely expand to roughly $30.3 trillion. Should XRP maintain its existing market share in this scenario, it would have a market capitalization of around $1.19 trillion. Based on its circulating supply, this would result in a per-token valuation of approximately $20.15, a significant increase from its current price of $2.21, representing a growth of around 830%.

While the above projection assumes XRP maintains its current market share, several analysts argue that XRP could appreciate further even before Bitcoin achieves the $1 million target. For instance, Davinci Jeremie, a long-standing Bitcoin supporter, recently predicted that XRP could reach $24 by the end of 2025. Other projections, such as those from Telegaon , foresee XRP reaching $87 by 2035. In the same forecast, Telegaon also anticipates Bitcoin reaching $1.2 million by that year. These forecasts suggest that XRP’s market share could increase over time, especially if investor interest broadens beyond Bitcoin. Historical data supports this possibility. Over the past year, XRP has recorded a price increase of approximately 350%, compared to Bitcoin’s 75% rise. This suggests a higher growth rate for XRP, which could significantly alter its valuation trajectory. If Bitcoin reaches the projected $1 million price point and XRP retains its current market share, a valuation near $20 for XRP appears feasible. However, this outcome depends on multiple variables, including market sentiment, institutional support, and regulatory developments. With some analysts expecting XRP to gain market share even before Bitcoin reaches this milestone, the actual price of XRP in a future crypto market could exceed these early estimates.

According to a new report by a local news outlet, federal prosecutors say that Denice James, a teller at First Federal Savings of Lorain, allegedly stole approximately $75,000 from eight different victims by faking documents and embezzled $1,000 from the bank itself. The report says that James stole the money between July 25, 2023, and November 2, 2023, by forging customers’ names on bank slips and submitting them right before the bank closed, as no customers were inside. She would then process the withdrawals and take the cash for herself. She has been charged with eight counts of bank fraud, eight counts of aggravated identity theft, and one count of embezzlement, to which she has pleaded not guilty. This incident is the latest in a string of fraud schemes involving bank tellers. In May, a bank teller in Maryland pleaded guilty to stealing $255,000 from his employer’s elderly clients by having conspirators impersonate victims to make fraudulent bank withdrawals. In March, a bank teller from New York, whose job it was to tally up money at the end of the day, was accused of stealing $1,000,000 in cash from his bank’s vault by forging signatures.

Here’s The Math",https://timestabloid.com/1000-xrp-could-be-worth-3-38-million-heres-the-math/,"An XRP community analyst has released a detailed projection estimating that a relatively modest investment in XRP could yield millions in the future, provided the asset reaches its full transactional potential. Currently trading near the $2.22 range , XRP continues to be viewed by many analysts as undervalued. This perspective stems from the belief that XRP’s real-world applications, particularly in the global payment ecosystem, are not yet fully reflected in its market valuation. In response to this perceived undervaluation, some analysts have modeled potential future price scenarios based on XRP’s utility. One such projection was recently shared by a community figure known as The5Blairs. Estimating XRP’s Future Market Performance According to The5Blairs, XRP’s current supply of 60 billion tokens and market activity levels suggest that the network could handle approximately $1.3 trillion in annual on-chain transactions. This estimate assumes a velocity of 10, meaning each token is transacted about 10 times per year. At its current price of $2.20, 60 Billion in Circulating Supply, and an annual velocity of 10, $XRP can handle about $1.3 Trillion in annual flow on chain today. You're not ready for the rest of this post…Lock in… 1700 NDAs, at least 14% of Swift, Derivatives, FX Market,… — Future XRP (@the5blairs) June 28, 2025 Using this baseline, the analyst assessed how increased adoption could significantly alter XRP’s price. The projection incorporates both current activity and potential future integration with institutional financial systems. Ripple’s Institutional Ties and Market Opportunities A central element in this analysis is Ripple’s extensive engagement with major financial and tech institutions. During legal proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple disclosed that it had signed over 1,700 non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with various banks and payment firms, many of which are exploring or testing XRP-related solutions. Additionally, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently predicted that XRP could eventually process up to 14% of SWIFT’s transaction volume. SWIFT facilitates approximately $150 trillion in global transfers annually. If XRP captures even 15% of this market, it could be responsible for over $22 trillion in transaction volume per year. Another area of potential lies in the massive derivatives market, which exceeds $1 quadrillion in size. Ripple has expressed interest in tapping into this market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent patent filings by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a major clearinghouse handling over $2 quadrillion in transactions yearly, included references to Ripple and XRP in the context of cross-chain settlements. While speculative, some believe this could hint at possible future adoption. Price Implications: From $2.20 to $3,380 Per XRP Based on these projections, The5Blairs concluded that XRP could eventually facilitate between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion in annual flow. If this materializes and XRP maintains the same token supply and transaction velocity, the price would need to increase by a factor of 1,538 to support the volume. This would place XRP’s value at approximately $3,380 per token. For individual investors, the implications are significant. A holding of 1,000 XRP, worth around $2,200 today, would rise to $3.38 million at this projected valuation. Similarly, a 5,000 XRP position would reach $16.9 million, and 10,000 XRP could be valued at $33.8 million. A wallet holding 50,000 XRP could theoretically exceed $169 million in value. While these forecasts remain speculative and depend on a variety of future developments, they underscore the optimism within the community regarding the asset’s long-term prospects. If XRP reaches the scale of adoption envisioned in these models, the impact on its market price and its early adopters could be substantial.

Coinbase Exec Explains Why The Mysterious $8 Billion BTC Transfer Was Possibly A Hack,https://zycrypto.com/largest-heist-ever-coinbase-exec-explains-why-the-mysterious-8-billion-btc-transfer-was-possibly-a-hack/,"On Thursday, a single entity transferred $8.6 billion worth of Satoshi-era Bitcoin from eight addresses that had held on to the BTC fortune for over 14 years. Conor Grogan, the director of America’s biggest crypto exchange, Coinbase , suggested there is a chance the $8.6 billion BTC movement was caused by a hack that might set a new heist record. Suspicious BCH Transaction Raises Alarm “There is a small possibility that the $8B in BTC that recently woke up were hacked or compromised private keys,” Grogan observed, pointing out a suspicious Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transaction of over 10,000 tokens (valued at roughly $5 million at current prices) made before the main transfers involving 80,000 Bitcoin began. The move raised the likelihood of someone accessing legacy private keys and quietly testing them before commencing the massive BTC movements. “There is a possibility that the owner was testing the private key in a way that wouldn’t get noticed,” Grogan said in a post on Twitter (aka X). “BCH isn’t monitored heavily by whale-watching services.” The pundit stressed that he saw the behavior as unusual: “What makes me say this is that the other BCH wallets have not been touched at all; why wouldn’t they also sweep these? It implies the actor may not have full access.” Incoming Selling Pressure? According to onchain sleuths, all of the Bitcoin was moved into the original wallets on April 2 or May 4, 2011, and had remained untouched for over 14 years after initially receiving the coins in what is now colloquially known as the network’s “Satoshi era,” when its pseudonymous creator was still active online. No individual or company has, so far, publicly claimed ownership of these wallets, but the timing and scope of the transfers left onlookers befuddled. This is particularly because enormous fund movements by OG wallets often hint at incoming selling pressure. But in this case, the Bitcoin is still sitting in the eight new wallets and hasn’t been deposited into exchange addresses. Bitcoin was recently trading hands at $108,029 per coin, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko, after barely changing over a 24-hour timeframe despite the uncertainty. The leading cryptocurrency is about 3.4% down from the lifetime high of $111,814 it registered in May.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Coinbase,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BCH|SPONSORED|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-06 00:03:46

What begins as a casual online chat can end in financial devastation . In one case, a victim was lured by a friendly stranger and guided to a legitimate cryptocurrency investment platform with charts, a sleek interface, and responsive customer support. Initial deposits showed modest gains. Encouraged, the victim sent more money, even borrowing to keep up. Then, the platform went dark, and the account balance vanished. “That’s how they do it,” said Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the US Secret Service, speaking last month to law enforcement officials in Bermuda. “They’ll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it’s probably some old guy in Russia.” The case was just one of many dissected during a week-long workshop led by the Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) — a little-known unit specializing in tracing digital financial crimes across borders. Using open-source tools, GIOC investigators traced the scam back to a domain, a crypto wallet, and, thanks to a brief VPN glitch, an exposed IP address. The GIOC has quietly become one of the most powerful players in crypto enforcement. Over the past decade, the team has seized nearly $400 million in digital assets, according to people familiar with internal agency briefings. Much of it is held in a cold-storage wallet, ranking among the largest known government-controlled digital asset holdings. Kali Smith leads global push to expose crypto crime and train nations on digital threats Kali Smith, the Secret Service’s head of cryptocurrency strategy, is central to this effort. Under her leadership, the agency has trained law enforcement and prosecutors in over 60 countries, targeting jurisdictions vulnerable to exploitation through weak regulation or residency-for-sale schemes. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn’t even realize that this is occurring in our country,’” Smith said during the Bermuda training session. Bermuda, known for its advanced crypto regulations, hosted the recent workshop amid growing concern that its digital asset-friendly policies could also attract bad actors. Bermuda Governor Andrew Murdoch told reporters that technologies and financial services are fantastic for economic growth but can also be exploited. He notes that, alongside the benefits, you need strong investigative powers to deal with abuse under the law. In a session overlooking Hamilton Harbor, Smith warned that scam victims often falsely assume Bitcoin guarantees safety. “They think they can use Bitcoin and be safe. But that isn’t the case,” she said. One real-life case involved an Idaho teenager who was extorted into paying hundreds of dollars after sending an intimate photo online. The investigation revealed a network of transactions funneled through another American teen, ultimately leading to a crypto wallet that had processed nearly $4.1 million through 6,000 transactions. The wallet was linked to a Nigerian passport, and the suspect was arrested in England, awaiting extradition. Crypto scams drive record losses as fraud turns violent and global manhunts intensify Digital asset fraud is now the top cause of cybercrime losses in the US. Americans lost $9.3 billion to scam schemes related to crypto in 2024. Heists and fraud losses — more than half the FBI’s $16.6 billion total for the year. The elderly victims were hit the hardest, with losses approaching $2.8 billion, much of that to fraudulent investment sites. In more extreme cases, digital theft has escalated to real-world violence. In New York, two men were charged with kidnapping and torturing a longtime friend to access his crypto wallet. In Connecticut, six individuals were accused of abducting and beating the parents of a teenage hacker who had stolen $245 million in Bitcoin in a failed ransom attempt. The Secret Service often works with large cryptocurrency firms to track stolen money. Companies such as Coinbase and Tether have been invaluable in investigating by conducting wallet analysis and freezing accounts suspected of fraudulent activity. One of the largest hauls was $225 million USDT, linked to a sweeping romance-investment scam. The agency’s focus on tracking dirty money is part of a broader, decades-old mission that has now been extended to the digital world, and in which the New York field office, which also covers Bermuda, has taken on a leading role in global cryptocurrency enforcement and training efforts.

The decision came just one day after President Donald Trump signed a tax-and-spend bill into law. That decision reignited tensions between the two. Elon, who backed Trump with hundreds of millions and even served under his administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and close confidant, had warned about the bill repeatedly. But Trump signed it anyway. The president also has plans to yank all federal subsidies going to Elon’s businesses, a number that runs into the tens of billions. Elon’s answer was simple: launch a party, cut ties, and go to war. Elon says he’ll fund takedowns of lawmakers Elon had said that he would spend his own money to oust lawmakers who voted for the bill. Now, he’s doing it under a new party banner. Elon wants full control. And that’s already freaking out the GOP. Republicans are worried that the public feud between him and Trump could wreck their chances of holding onto congressional seats in the 2026 midterms. Elon posted on X that: “Increasing the deficit from an already insane $2T under Biden to $2.5T. This will bankrupt the country.” CBS News asked Brett Kappel, an election attorney with decades of experience, what it takes to actually build a party like this. “Only the richest person in the world could make a serious effort at creating a new American political party,” he said . Elon’s wealth makes it possible, but that doesn’t make it easy. Every state has its own ballot access rules, and most of them are built to block third parties. Kappel said political parties are “creatures of the states,” which means Elon has to navigate 50 separate systems. In places like California, it’s brutal. To even be recognized as a party there, you either register 0.33% of all voters, or collect 1.1 million signatures. After that, you’ve got to keep up those numbers or win 2% of the statewide vote just to stay qualified. Filing across states demands time and money And it’s not just California. Every other state has its own rules and thresholds. Elon will need to get each version of the America Party approved individually, then request an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission to be taken seriously at the national level. None of this happens quickly. Legal teams will be all over it. Democrats and Republicans can, and definitely will, fight every signature. The lawsuits alone will cost a fortune. The current legal system favors the two-party system and works to block third-party entries. Even for someone like Elon, getting recognized in all 50 states before 2026 is unlikely. “It might be doable for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states,” attorney Kappel said, but building a full national party “would take years.” Still, Elon thinks he doesn’t need 50 states. He said on X that a party could “laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts.” That’s enough, he believes, to control the vote on major legislation. And he may be right. If the America Party candidates hold the deciding votes, Elon wins by default. He doesn’t have to take over. He just has to disrupt. But also, this isn’t the first time someone’s tried to build a third party, but the track record is ugly. The Green Party and the Libertarian Party have been around for decades. They still fight for ballot access, still push state-by-state, and still struggle to reach even single-digit national support.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs are nearing $50 billion in cumulative net inflows , underscoring Wall Street’s mounting demand for the cryptocurrency. BTC’s “at-the-market” implied volatility—a metric tracking expected price swings over timeframes from seven days to six months—has dipped to its lowest level since October 2023, when BTC was trading at about a third of its current price. Meanwhile, monthly transactions on the Bitcoin network fell by 15% in June compared to May, reaching their lowest point since October 2023. The slowdown has become so pronounced that miners have been forced to dig deep into the mempool to include abnormally low-fee transactions in blocks. Institutional demand surges as ETFs break records and public firms accumulate Bitcoin Despite this muted on-chain activity, US spot Bitcoin ETFs are hitting new records. The funds drew over $1 billion in net inflows across just two days last week, pushing the cumulative total near the $50 billion mark. In total, these ETFs now hold approximately $137.6 billion worth of BTC—a record high—according to SoSoValue. Publicly traded companies also ramped up their BTC purchases in June, adding around 65,000 BTC, valued at roughly $7 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Though on-chain metrics remain subdued, a Glassnode analysis suggests a shift in network dominance toward institutional investors and whales as high-value transactions become more common. Adding to signs of a summer slowdown, Bitcoin futures volume has declined. Still, the broader trend indicates that institutional demand may be decoupling from retail activity on-chain. Robert Kiyosaki fires back at Bitcoin crash predictions amid $109K resistance struggle Amid this backdrop of waning retail activity and growing institutional presence, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has pushed back against rising bearish sentiment. With BTC struggling to break through the $109,500 resistance level, some traders are bracing for a correction down to $90,000. But Kiyosaki remains unfazed. According to a message on the X platform, Robert Kiyosaki fired back at Bitcoin skeptics while dismissing crash warnings as fear tactics aimed at shaking out weak hands. His comments come as the crypto market faces strong selling pressure, with BTC failing to surpass the $109,500 resistance. In his message on the X, Kiyosaki wrote : “CLICK BAIT Losers keeps warning of a Bitcoin crash. They want to frighten off the speculators. I hope Bitcoin crashes. I will only buy more. Take care”. Reaffirming his long-term bullish stance, Robert Kiyosaki said any sharp correction in BTC should be seen as a fresh buying opportunity. Kiyosaki, a steadfast BTC supporter, maintains his bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. His latest remarks come amid heightened market volatility and growing uncertainty over Bitcoin’s short-term direction. However, Kiyosaki is placing his bets on silver in the near term. Among all asset classes, he’s bullish on silver for July, forecasting a potential 3x surge to $105 by year-end. He continued to say that any Bitcoin dip could be an opportunity to buy for the long term. Currently, BTC price faces rejection at $109,500 while macro factors like the falling US Dollar Index support the upside.

While top cryptocurrencies like ETH dominate headlines, smart money is quietly rotating into high-upside altcoins with real utility and strong fundamentals. Enter Mutuum Finance, a low-price, undervalued DeFi crypto project that’s catching the attention of seasoned analysts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi crypto is quietly gaining momentum. The project has sold more than 60% of presale stage 5 at $0.03. MUTM has mobilized in excess of $11.7 million and has attracted over 12,700 investors. Mutuum Finance could be the next crypto to explode while Ethereum consolidates. Ethereum Shows Signs of Weakness as Market Eyes $2,000 Support Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,452, but is showing signs of fading momentum as broader market uncertainty weighs on top assets. Despite recent bullish developments like spot ETF inflows and ongoing ecosystem upgrades, ETH hasn’t been able to maintain a strong uptrend. Analysts are warning of a potential retest of the $2,000 level if bearish pressure continues and buying volume stays low. While ETH remains a long-term cornerstone of the crypto market, in the short term, traders are increasingly cautious, rotating into smaller, undervalued tokens with higher growth potential. One such project gaining attention during this lull is Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 5 Presale Sees Growing Traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it soars in Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,700 early adopters and well over $11.7 million in funds raised, the project is taking giant strides as a major player in the DeFi. USD Stablecoin Launch & $50K Security Bounty Mutuum Finance, in its plans to build more on its DeFi, is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to highly risk-exposed algorithmic stablecoins, this token has been designed in such a manner that it will guarantee its value even during market volatility. The project itself is about integrity and security. Mutuum Finance platform is already audited by CertiK as well, which once again shows team dedication to transparency, reliability, and sustainability. Mutuum Finance also introduced Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, where a reward of 50,000 USDT is offered. The bounty comes in four categories, namely the critical, major, minor, and low. This will level out all the tiers of vulnerability and reward it alike. Investor Incentives In appreciation of the presale mania and as a token of appreciation to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will distribute a $100,000 giveaway . Ten such winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for being part of the early backers of the project. With the community growing exponentially, the early backers are being rewarded, not only with possible future gain, but with real, present-time rewards. As Ethereum (ETH) flirts with a potential drop toward $2,000, savvy investors are already pivoting toward high-upside opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $11.7 million raised, more than 12,700 investors onboard, and over 60% of Stage 5 already sold out at just $0.03, Mutuum Finance is proving to be more than hype, it’s becoming a movement. Backed by a CertiK audit, a $50K bug bounty, and a forthcoming USD-backed stablecoin, the project combines utility, transparency, and momentum. Now’s the time to act, secure your MUTM tokens today and join the next potential DeFi breakout before prices rise again.

Tron’s steady rise in USDT activity and SUI’s reactions following a significant token unlock reflect how fast market dynamics can shift, highlighting the importance of choosing well-positioned projects. While Tron and SUI maintain strong relevance, BlockDAG is attracting serious interest with its presale numbers and upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release. After raising more than $331.5 million and selling over 23.6 billion coins, BlockDAG has entered batch 29 at $0.0276. However, it now offers a limited-time buying opportunity at just $0.0016 until August 11. Backed by two major security audits and a fast-growing mining base, BlockDAG is making a compelling case as one of the best crypto coins for 2025. Tron’s Rising USDT Usage Strengthens Market Outlook Tron’s roots in decentralized content delivery and its strategic alliances continue to offer stability despite broader market changes. Its recent rise in USDT activity contrasts with the wider market pullback, indicating strong usage across the network. The Tron (TRX) market outlook remains optimistic as developers and users benefit from fast and low-cost transactions. Tron’s well-established ecosystem facilitates stablecoin transfers and DeFi applications, proving its real-world utility. Still, questions about decentralization and regulation remain. Some critics argue that central control and potential scalability bottlenecks could challenge future growth. Nonetheless, Tron’s consistent performance and ecosystem strength keep it positioned for further gains. SUI Reacts to Token Unlock But Maintains Developer Interest SUI gained early support for its high-performance Layer 1 setup, offering speed and cost efficiency. A recent $164 million token unlock, however, sparked a short-term dip, putting pressure on SUI price movement. Despite this, SUI’s design still appeals to developers seeking secure, flexible infrastructure. The platform supports smart contracts and digital assets directly on-chain, which could boost adoption over time. That said, SUI faces strong competition and ongoing market volatility. Its path forward will depend on how well it manages token supply, builds community trust, and delivers consistent development progress. BlockDAG’s $0.0016 Offer, Strong Audits, & GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Draw Attention BlockDAG’s upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release is helping it stand out from other rising crypto projects. Early buyers are now being offered one of the most attractive entry points since the project’s inception. With over $331.5 million already raised during its presale, more than 23.6 billion coins sold, and the current batch 29 priced at $0.0276, BlockDAG is now giving users a rare opportunity to buy in at just $0.0016 until August 11, matching one of the lowest prices available since batch 1. This limited-time phase aims to broaden access and reward early adopters before the full launch begins. Alongside its pricing advantage, BlockDAG has earned added trust through completed audits by Halborn and CertiK, confirming that its foundation is built for long-term, secure expansion. These validations reinforce the team’s dedication to delivering not just short-term hype, but a reliable and scalable ecosystem. BlockDAG’s competitive pricing, paired with these trust signals and a growing adoption base, highlight its momentum. With more than 18,300 miners sold and increasing participation through the X1 Mining App, BlockDAG is proving its utility through live tools already in users’ hands. For those following Tron or observing recent SUI price movement, BlockDAG’s blend of strong security, record-breaking presale milestones, and the forthcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release positions it as one of the best crypto coins for 2025 and a clear project to watch. Summing Up The Tron (TRX) market outlook remains steady thanks to increased USDT usage, though questions about its governance model persist. Meanwhile, SUI price movement shows how token unlocks can affect short-term performance, even as its developer base continues to support the project. BlockDAG, however, is turning momentum into results. Its upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release opens a $0.0016 entry point until August 11, an attractive deal compared to its current $0.0276 batch price. With over $331.5 million raised, audits from Halborn and CertiK, and thousands of miners already active, BlockDAG is showing strength across key areas. In a market full of bold claims, BlockDAG is backing its vision with action. For those looking at the best crypto coins for 2025 , BlockDAG offers one of the most complete and compelling opportunities available today.

Yet, by rejecting calls for a pause and a phased process, the EU may be sabotaging its own ambitions and handing the future of artificial intelligence to the US and China . The European Commission formally rejected industry requests to delay the implementation of the AI Act, choosing instead to stick to a rigid legal timeline. This means general-purpose AI (GPAI) models must comply by August 2025, while high-risk system rules take effect in 2026. There’s no grace period, no transition window, and no exceptions. This is despite loud protests from both American tech giants and European innovators. From Alphabet and Meta to ASML and Mistral, companies around the world have cautioned that an “over-hasty” introduction of the AI Act risked dampening innovation, adding compliance burdens, and potentially becoming a less appealing place to develop AI products in Europe. At a press conference, Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier acknowledged the barrage of feedback — letters, articles, and media criticism — but remained unmoved. “ Let me be as clear as possible, there is no stop the clock ,” he said. That phrase might sound principled, but it could also spell strategic defeat in today’s breakneck tech environment. Rushed rules leave EU businesses in the dark The intention behind the AI Act is commendable. Europe is right to want a robust legal framework for AI, especially as generative models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini are increasingly entwined in business, education, media, and daily life. However, the method and pace of implementation matter just as much as the message. A recent Amazon Web Services (AWS) survey found that more than two-thirds of European companies are still unsure about their compliance obligations under the AI Act. If even large enterprises are in the dark, what does that mean for startups and small firms lacking the legal and technical resources to decode such a complex law? The answer is simple: they either pause development, scale down their AI ambitions, or relocate to more flexible jurisdictions. As the US innovates and China accelerates, Europe risks falling behind Unlike the bloc’s sweeping rulebook, the United States has adopted a voluntary compliance model focused on sectoral risk assessments and industry-led best practices. While not perfect, it has allowed American firms to innovate without the same immediate regulatory chokehold. Conversely, China has taken a different route — integrating AI into its state control mechanisms and social stability frameworks. While critics argue this limits free expression, it also shows China is committed to dominating the AI race on its terms. Europe, meanwhile, sits at a crossroads. It wants to be the ethical leader in AI, where technology is built responsibly. But if it becomes the hardest place to innovate, that leadership will be symbolic at best. European leaders call for a smarter rollout before innovation suffers Even some of Europe’s leaders are voicing concern. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson recently called the rules “confusing” and urged the bloc to postpone implementation. The tech industry lobby group CCIA Europe — representing Apple, Meta, and Amazon — said the AI Act’s rollout risks becoming a barrier to innovation. These aren’t fringe complaints. They are early warning signs that the region’s dream of technological sovereignty could collapse under the weight of its own regulatory ambition. What Europe needs now is not deregulation but calibration. A phased rollout, a temporary grace period, or, at the very least, clearer guidance for smaller businesses would make a difference. It would allow firms to innovate confidently while still preparing for compliance. The Commission has committed to delivering measures to simplify digital regulation, including easier reporting for SMEs. That’s a start. However, the AI Act requires a more direct and focused response. But we can’t let our sense of right and wrong stand in the way of progress, not when the world is only getting more competitive. If Europe really wants to be a leader in responsible AI, it needs to strike the right balance between principle and pragmatism. Otherwise, AI in the future will be scripted and run from elsewhere.",OP-ED,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-06 02:15:27

At first glance, it might seem bold, even forward-thinking, for the United States to invest heavily in Bitcoin. But if we really care about long-term financial leadership, Americans should look beyond just buying digital assets. The smarter strategy lies in creating a national platform that integrates blockchain technology into our financial system. The U.S. holds a privileged place in the world economy. As the issuer of the global reserve currency, the U.S. dollar, we benefit from widespread trust in our economy, our government, and our ability to maintain financial stability. That trust gives us enormous influence around the world. But maintaining that position requires forward-thinking action, not just investing in trendy assets. The Flaws in Relying on Bitcoin Reserves Many argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and resistance to manipulation make it a perfect candidate for national reserves. Since it is not controlled by any government, Bitcoin is often compared to digital gold, a supposedly safe and neutral asset in times of global uncertainty. But while that may sound good in theory, it doesn’t serve the practical needs of a national reserve. Strategic reserves are designed for emergencies, to settle international debts, support the economy in times of disruption, and ensure financial continuity. Bitcoin’s price volatility and limited real-world usage make it a poor fit for such purposes today. Worse yet, if the U.S. were to begin hoarding Bitcoin, the move might be interpreted as a lack of confidence in our own currency. That could undermine global trust in the dollar and open the door for geopolitical rivals, such as China or Russia, to challenge America’s financial credibility. Simply put, trying to “future-proof” the economy by holding Bitcoin could actually weaken our position in the short term. While it’s true that Bitcoin could evolve into a global settlement tool, that evolution is still underway. What’s needed now is not stockpiling crypto, but building the rails that allow digital assets, including Bitcoin, to become functional parts of the financial system. Why Building a Platform Is a Better Strategy To really lead in the digital finance age, the U.S. must do more than own assets, we need to build the infrastructure others rely on. Think back to the early days of the internet. The winners weren’t those who simply bought up websites; it was the companies that built powerful platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, that shaped the digital economy. The same principle applies today. America should invest in becoming the premier hub for digital assets by creating trustworthy exchanges, safe custodial services, and streamlined on- and off-ramps for crypto. In doing so, we export American values like the rule of law, financial transparency, and technological innovation into the growing digital economy. Bitcoin might be the starting point, but it won’t be the end. As decentralized finance (DeFi) matures, the U.S. has the opportunity to lead in developing not just the tools, but the rules that define how digital assets operate globally. Real-World Applications Already Taking Root You don’t have to be an economist to see how digital finance is changing daily life. Currently, millions of Americans are utilizing cryptocurrency for more than just trading; they’re applying it to entertainment, investing, and even gaming. For example, the rise of online casinos in the U.S. highlights how fast digital transactions are being adopted. Many platforms now accept cryptocurrencies, allowing players to deposit and withdraw instantly with lower fees and more privacy. Still, while regulations vary by state, the demand for digital-first entertainment shows just how far the financial landscape has shifted. This isn’t a far-off future, it’s already happening, and it’s one more reason we need to lead with infrastructure, not speculation. The Power of Stablecoins Backed by the Dollar One of the biggest opportunities for strengthening America’s global financial role lies in the expansion of dollar-based stablecoins. These are digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar, offering the stability of our national currency with the speed and accessibility of blockchain technology. Used wisely, stablecoins can facilitate faster, cheaper, and more inclusive cross-border payments. They can provide people around the world with access to digital dollars without requiring a U.S. bank account. If properly regulated and with clear rules around reserves, consumer protection, and transparency, stablecoins could extend the reach of the dollar more effectively than traditional banks or foreign policy ever could. Of course, not all countries welcome dollarization, and in regions where local currencies are weak or politically sensitive, dollar-pegged stablecoins may face resistance. That’s where Bitcoin and other decentralized assets can act as neutral alternatives, bridging systems without being tied to any one nation. Sparking American Innovation Through Smart Policy The U.S. didn’t build the internet by micromanaging innovation. Instead, we laid the legal and technical groundwork for entrepreneurs to experiment and scale. That’s how Silicon Valley became the envy of the world. We can take a similar approach now by giving U.S. companies the space to build on top of open financial networks whether that’s blockchain, stablecoins, or other emerging tech. A balance between regulation and freedom is critical. With too much red tape, we risk losing talent and capital to friendlier markets. With too little oversight, we undermine trust. If we get the balance right, we can lead again, offering an open alternative to closed, authoritarian systems like central bank digital currencies being developed in places like China.

As 2025 progresses, some projects are getting attention for their strong purpose, structured plans, and active communities. This article highlights four networks with different focuses, like mining systems, wallet utilities, Solana trading tools, and Bitcoin-based rewards. While each one has its unique approach, all share good upside potential during their current presale phases. Here are the top crypto presale projects in 2025 you should know about today, starting with BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release. BlockDAG: GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Brings Special Pricing Currently in Batch 29, BlockDAG’s presale price is fixed at $0.0016 until August 11th. It has sold over 23.5 billion coins and raised $331.5 million so far. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. The listing price is set at $0.05, opening the chance for over 3,000% returns when listed. There will be 45 batches or until it hits its $600 million funding target. This method builds strong infrastructure and market readiness before launch. BlockDAG uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work and DAG setup that supports fast processing with better energy efficiency. Its X1 Miner App now has more than 2 million active users. Hardware miners X30 and X100 will ship on July 7, and X10 on August 15. Security checks by CertiK and Halborn add to its credibility. BlockDAG (BDAG) is growing with real DeFi uses, an active system, and a six-week global plan, making it one of the top crypto presale projects in 2025 with strong basics and early access advantages. BEST Wallet: A Multi-Use Wallet with Built-In Utility BEST Wallet offers a non-custodial wallet that works as a launchpad and staking platform. Its $BEST coin presale has raised over $13.5 million at a current price of $0.0252. From its 10 billion total coins, only 4.5% are in presale, spread across 100 small pricing stages. It offers swaps, bridges, staking, NFTs, and governance straight from its interface. Owning $BEST offers fee discounts, exclusive staking APYs above 105%, and access to future presales via the app. Security is boosted with Fireblocks MPC. Soon, NFT support and derivatives will launch. BEST Wallet is becoming a place for DeFi and presale activity, placing it among the top crypto presale projects in 2025 for those seeking wallet benefits and passive income options. Snorter: Telegram-Based Solana Trading Bot Snorter is built for Solana and gives fast, low-cost Telegram trading features. It combines sniping, MEV protection, honeypot checks, and copy-trading in one platform. Its standout feature is that it works directly within Telegram, letting users place trades quickly using simple chat commands. The presale is live, and pricing changes with demand via its portal. More than a bot, Snorter is building an entire system for the new Telegram trading era. As Solana bots grow, Snorter gives a timing and safety advantage. MEV protection and honeypot scanning help reduce risks often linked with fast sniping. This makes Snorter one of the top crypto presale projects in 2025 for users aiming to automate and improve their Solana trading strategies. BTC Bull: Coin Rewards Linked to Bitcoin Growth BTC Bull is a rewards coin that tracks Bitcoin’s market rise without needing to hold BTC itself. It uses custom smart contracts and DeFi staking layers to let users earn from BTC movements. The presale starts at around $0.001 with a burn system to keep the supply limited. Each presale stage has limited allocations to avoid sudden price drops. BTC Bull stands out for its rewards based on Bitcoin’s price. Users who stake early can earn higher APYs when BTC’s value goes up. Future plans include listings, BTC-pegged liquidity vaults, and rewards tied to Bitcoin dominance. With Bitcoin aiming beyond $60,000, BTC Bull gives a way to gain from this growth trend through structured incentives, making it a strong candidate in the top crypto presale projects in 2025 list. Final Remarks! BlockDAG offers an entry at just $0.0016 with early buyers seeing 2,660% gains so far, BEST Wallet combines wallet services with staking and launchpad utility, Snorter delivers Solana trading tools on Telegram, and BTC Bull lets users benefit from BTC price rises through its reward system. These top crypto presale projects in 2025 each bring their own features, from real usage to smart passive rewards. Picking the right one depends on your goals, but these projects are already building strong trust and practical use cases before their exchange listings.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000708. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000381 and an average trading price of $0.0032 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Floki Inu Token FLOKI Price $0.00007424 Market Capitalization $714.51M Trading Volume $38.9M Circulating Supply 9.62T FLOKI All-time High $0.0003462 (Jun 05, 2024) All-time Low $0.00000002 (Aug 08, 2021) 24-hour High $0.00007618 24-hour Low $0.00007312 Floki Inu price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.81% 50-Day SMA $0.00008529 14-Day RSI 46.65 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 67 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.00009696 Floki Inu price analysis Key Insights: Floki’s price is down 0.36% today. Floki Inu is testing crucial support at $0.00007297. A breakout above $0.00007662 could target $0.00008167. FLOKI on the daily timeframe: Analysis reveals a potential reversal point for Floki Inu The daily chart of Floki Inu on July 6 reveals the current price is testing support at $0.00007297, with a recent low point near $0.00007000. The price action indicates some accumulation around this level, but a clear breakout is yet to be seen. The MACD, with green histograms and a positive crossover, suggests a possibility of a shift in momentum. Although the price has been trading in a tight range, it remains below the previous resistance at $0.00007662, which could act as a major barrier. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView In the event of a push upwards, the price could target $0.00008167, the upper resistance, but this will require a sustained increase in buying pressure. A breach below $0.00007000 would open the door to further downside, potentially testing the $0.00005876 level, which has been a historical support. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe: Market indecision becomes prevalent in the short term The 4-hour chart for Floki Inu reveals a period of consolidation following a series of fluctuations. The Bollinger Bands indicate a tightening range, with the price hovering near the middle band at $0.00007452. The market is currently indecisive as the price is struggling to break out of this zone. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The volume oscillator shows a significant decline of -25.88%, suggesting decreasing market participation, and the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) histogram is revealing diminishing bullish momentum, with the line at -0.35. This implies that unless the price pushes above the middle Bollinger Band at $0.00007605, the trend could remain muted, with further chances of revisiting the lower boundary of $0.00007190.

The coin is facing resistance at $0.00007662 while holding support at $0.00007297. The next move will depend on a breakout above resistance or a breakdown below support, with a shift in volume or momentum likely triggering a decisive move. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $100 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 100x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

This support would be triggered if t he 5 0% tariff on aluminum imports remains in place beyond the mid-term, according to Jean Simard, CEO of the Aluminium Association of Canada ( AAC). In an interview, Simard said early discussions are underway and could help support the industry if Ottawa fails to finalize a trade deal with the US, its largest trading partner, by the July 21 deadline. While Canadian aluminum companies currently have no liquidity issues, Simard warned that a prolonged 50% US tariff could eventually impact Canada’s financial system. Canada seeks to offer support to its giant aluminum firms amid Trump’s tariff policies About 50% of the aluminum used in the US comes from other countries, and most comes from Canada. Last year, Canada exported 3.2 million tons of the metal to America. US President Donald Trump increased steel and aluminum import tariffs to 50% last month. This was to ratchet pressure on global steel producers and escalate his trade war to further his objective of boosting the local production of essential materials for building. Concerning Canada’s big move to offer support to its big aluminum firms, Simard said that this is part of a larger discussion where everything is on the table. He further stated that no decision had been reached. According to Simard, with the 50% tariff in effect since June 4, it is normal that there are discussions, among other things, about the impact on businesses’ liquidity if the situation persists over time. Simard’s remarks come after earlier media reports, which cited Mélanie Joly, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry of Canada, said the government is in talks with Rio Tinto to provide financial assistance in light of Trump’s devastating tariffs policies. According to reports from sources, Joly reportedly raised the discussions in a meeting with business leaders in the Saguenay region of Quebec, a major center of aluminum production, often called Canada’s Aluminum Valley. Rio Tinto declined a request for comment. On the other hand, a Joly office spokesperson stated that Ottawa is currently having “active conversations” about the best ways to support Canada’s aluminum industry, given an environment of unjustified US tariffs, to support greater investment in the sector. Trump’s tariff policies on steel and aluminum cause undesirable outcomes Trump plans to back and promote investment in steel and aluminum production within the country. These two are key products in the construction sector. Apart from this, aluminum has an additional benefit. It is widely employed in the transport sector and the packaging industry. Still, aluminum end-users in the physical market have confronted certain problems in America. For instance, they should expect to pay at the London Metal Exchange when purchasing the raw material. Also, there is another cost for the spot market price. This is inclusive of shipping and duties. US manufacturing sector sales have dropped since they depend on raw-material imports. May data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) indicated the sector contracted for the third month, recording a six-month low. This decrease led to the sustained loss of jobs throughout the industry. It has also been hurt by increasing energy prices. It is worth pointing out that apart from exporting aluminum to the US, Canada also imports steel. A quarter of US steel comes from imports, mostly from Mexico and Canada.

Altcoins with real use, strong presales, and serious community momentum are taking center stage. Smart buyers are no longer chasing hype alone, they’re tracking utility, infrastructure rollouts, and early access. Some names are already breaking out in chat groups and newsletters. These aren’t coins just surviving the market, they’re setting up for serious runs before the next bull wave hits. Here’s a closer look at four of the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025. Whether you want to catch a 25x presale rocket or ride the wave of AI and Layer-1 growth, these are the tokens with serious upside. Get in before everyone else does. 1. BlockDAG: 25x Presale Rocket With Real Utility Behind It BlockDAG is grabbing headlines, and wallets, fast. It’s still deep in presale, but it already feels like a breakout is near. Batch 29 is live, offering BDAG at just $0.0016 until August 11 through a limited Global Launch promo. With over 23.5 billion coins sold and $331.5 million raised so far, this isn’t just hype, it’s a presale with muscle. When it hits the $0.05 listing mark, early buyers could be sitting on a 25x return. And BlockDAG isn’t just promises. Its X1 mobile mining app has already pulled in more than 2 million users. Hardware rigs? On the way. The X30 and X100 ship out July 7, with the X10 following on August 15. Add in successful audits from Halborn and CertiK, plus confirmed listings on MEXC, BitMart, CoinStore, and XT.com, and you’ve got a launchpad in motion. With liquidity support and a goal to crack the CoinMarketCap Top 30, BlockDAG could easily be one of the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025, and time is ticking. 2. Render (RNDR): The AI-Powered GPU Engine of Crypto Render is riding the AI explosion and doing it with power to spare. RNDR offers decentralized GPU rendering for creators, game studios, and AI developers, linking idle GPU power to people who actually need it. It’s cheaper, faster, and smarter. And now, it’s not just tied to animation and VFX, it’s supporting AI training and machine learning on a global scale. Trading around $7.80, RNDR is surging thanks to big exchange listings and constant tech upgrades. Its model is simple: give developers a better way to compute, and let the RNDR token power the engine. With AI adoption soaring, RNDR is right in the sweet spot. If your portfolio is missing a high-tech edge, RNDR could be one of the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025 that delivers massive growth tied to a real-world need. 3. NEAR Protocol: The Smart Chain Built for Builders NEAR Protocol is making major moves, and devs love it. This chain isn’t just fast and cheap, it’s made to be used. With Nightshade sharding, NEAR brings powerful scalability without the usual coding headaches. That’s why more builders are migrating here and launching apps with real use. As of early July, NEAR trades around $5.30, bouncing strong from 2023 lows. With cross-chain tools, AI integration, and major backing, it’s poised for a breakout. Add its growing DeFi ecosystem and smooth onboarding tools, and it’s clear why NEAR belongs on any serious watchlist. If you want a project with tech that actually works and dev teams ready to scale, NEAR is one of the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025 that could surprise everyone. 4. Cardano (ADA): The Long-Term Player Starting to Shine Cardano has taken its time, but that’s the point. Built on deep research and peer-reviewed protocols, ADA’s approach is slow and steady. But now in 2025, all that patience is starting to pay off. Its ecosystem is expanding with more DeFi apps, dApps, and partnerships, especially across Africa and Latin America. Sitting near $0.38, ADA might not double overnight, but it’s one of the most trusted names out there. Recent updates like Hydra and Mithril boost its performance and efficiency, keeping the chain future-ready. For those looking to anchor their portfolio with a project that plays the long game, Cardano remains one of the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025 that blends trust, leadership, and a clear path forward. 4 Coins, Real Tools, Big Potential If you’re aiming for serious gains this year, these four coins check the right boxes. BlockDAG is a rare find, live tech, hardware shipping soon, audits completed, and a presale price of just $0.0016 before it hits $0.05. That’s the kind of low-entry, high-reward setup that doesn’t come often. NEAR is making dev tools easier, RNDR is connecting crypto with the AI revolution, and ADA is showing why steady wins the race. The real winners in 2025 won’t just be hype coins, they’ll be projects that are building fast, shipping real features, and getting ahead of the next wave. Each of these belongs in the conversation about the highest-ROI cryptos for 2025 . Now’s the time to act while the window’s still open.

Despite the hesitation, bulls have held critical support, and the coming days are shaping up to be a defining moment for Ethereum and the broader altcoin space. Momentum is slowly shifting as investors look for confirmation that ETH will lead the next wave of upside action. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Top analyst Ted Pillows has shared a bullish technical outlook, suggesting that a Wyckoff accumulation pattern is currently unfolding. According to Pillows, this structure resembles the early stages of major breakouts seen in past cycles and signals strong smart money positioning. He argues that Ethereum already played a key role in Bitcoin’s latest rally to new all-time highs, and now it’s Ethereum’s turn to shine. A sustained breakout above the $2,600–$2,700 range could trigger the next phase of the cycle, with $3,000 in sight as the initial target. With market sentiment recovering and BTC consolidating near highs, traders and investors are closely watching Ethereum’s next move to gauge whether an altseason is around the corner. The setup is in place — but ETH must deliver. Ethereum Builds Strength Ethereum is up 82% from its April lows, demonstrating strong bullish control as the price holds firmly above key demand zones. Despite recent volatility, ETH continues to trade within a well-defined range between $2,400 and $2,700, a structure that has persisted since early May. This tight consolidation suggests the market is preparing for a decisive breakout, one that could define Ethereum’s trajectory for the remainder of the year. Ted Pillows reveals that Ethereum is now undergoing a classic Wyckoff accumulation pattern. According to his analysis, this phase marks the transfer of ETH from weak hands to strong hands, and it mirrors past cycle setups that led to explosive rallies. Pillows argues that Ethereum helped push Bitcoin to new all-time highs, and now it’s Ethereum’s turn to take the spotlight. If this pattern plays out, Pillows sees a clear path: first a breakout to $3,000, followed by a healthy correction, and then a push to $4,000 sometime in Q3. Beyond that, the real parabolic move may begin, driven by renewed confidence, broader altcoin participation, and sustained demand for ETH as a core asset in the crypto ecosystem. Related Reading: Solana Tests Rising Channel Support – Breakdown Could Send Price To $128.50 Level ETH Holds Above Key Support Amid Tight Range Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,520, maintaining its position above critical support levels despite recent volatility. As shown in the 12-hour chart, ETH has acknowledged the $2,480–$2,500 zone multiple times since late May, signaling strong buyer interest at these levels. The price remains trapped within a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, with no clear breakout yet in either direction. ETH is currently trading near its 50- and 100-period SMAs, which are converging around the current price, indicating equilibrium and a potential inflection point. The 200-period SMA sits below $2,200 and continues to trend upward, supporting the longer-term bullish structure. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range Volume has remained relatively stable, with no spike suggesting institutional accumulation or mass distribution. For bulls to regain full momentum, ETH must reclaim the $2,600–$2,700 resistance and flip it into support. On the downside, a clean break below $2,480 could expose the $2,300 zone once again.

Bitrue, a well-known crypto exchange and vocal supporter of XRP , posed an important question to the community: “What price will XRP reclaim next?” The community shared varying targets, ranging from modest gains to highly optimistic forecasts, showing confidence in the asset’s future. What price will #XRP reclaim next? — Bitrue (@BitrueOfficial) July 4, 2025 Wide Range of Expectations Some community members expect a moderate rise, pointing to prices between $2 and $3. Specific projections such as $2.26, $2.28, $2.3, and more were repeated by several participants, indicating a belief that XRP will at least return to its 2021 range. The asset is currently trading at $2.2. Analysts recently highlighted $2.25 as a crucial resistance level to watch. If XRP breaches this resistance, a short-term bull run could start. Others forecast more aggressive price moves. One user suggested a return to $3 in the short term, $5 by November, and $10 by the end of the year . Another commenter pointed to $15.89 as the next target, and increasing institutional and retail demand could contribute to lofty targets like this. Calls for New Highs and Discovery Beyond specific figures, several replies conveyed a broader belief in XRP’s long-term potential. Multiple users declared that the next target should be the all-time high, with some expecting XRP to surpass it and enter a new phase of price discovery. A few replies offered more strategic takes, with one user stating he plans to offload 25% of his XRP holdings at the $10 mark, suggesting that profit-taking expectations are already set around that level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skepticism Still Present in the Community Not every response was optimistic. Some users placed targets below $1 or around current trading ranges. One reply suggested $0.8 as a near-term cap, while another pegged $1 as the most likely outcome in the short term, dismissing more aggressive targets. These replies serve as a reminder that, despite the bullish tone among much of the community, a subset of XRP holders remains either waiting for more concrete market signals or skeptical of quick rallies. XRP Community’s Confidence Remains High While opinions vary, the overarching tone of the conversation remains positive. Many participants view XRP’s future through a long-term lens, with the belief that external factors such as regulatory clarity or broader market sentiment will eventually fuel sustained upward momentum. One user summarized this mindset by stating that price is secondary to the broader movement XRP represents, tying value to utility and vision rather than daily fluctuations.

Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas shared the latest outlook, placing XRP among the top contenders for approval alongside Litecoin and Solana. Several firms including Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, 21Shares, WisdomTree, CoinShares, and Franklin have submitted applications for a Spot XRP ETF. The first official filing was made on January 30, 2025, and the SEC acknowledged it shortly after. The final decision from the SEC is expected by October 17, 2025. However, despite this positive regulatory momentum, XRP’s price remains stuck in a tight range. The token is trading between $2.19 and $2.35, repeatedly testing both resistance and support zones. Unless the price breaks above $2.35 or falls below $2.19, XRP is likely to continue moving sideways in the coming days or even weeks. A move below $2.19 could see the price retesting the $2.05 to $2.10 region, while a clean breakout above $2.35 might spark a short-term rally. XRP Price Prediction According to CoinCodex, XRP is expected to see steady growth in the second half of 2025. In July, the price could range between $2.16 and $2.47, offering a possible 11.14% return for buyers at current levels. In August, prices might rise slightly to a range of $2.18 to $2.50. By September, XRP could climb to around $2.47, with a trading range of $2.29 to $2.60. October is expected to stay positive, with prices between $2.32 and $2.56, although the average might dip a little. . The year might end strong in December, with prices forecasted to move between $2.28 and $3.20, which could mean a 44.10% return if prices reach the higher end.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-06 05:52:43

A prominent member of this group is EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), who has posted a detailed chart analysis focusing on XRP’s large-scale formation, one he believes has recently confirmed a significant breakout. XRP Key Targets EGRAG CRYPTO’s chart depicts a completed symmetrical triangle pattern on XRP’s monthly chart. This structure, spanning from 2017 to 2025, now appears to have resolved with a clear breakout to the upside. The symmetrical triangle is a classic consolidation setup, typically signaling a continuation of the prior trend once price breaches its bounds. In this case, the previous trend was bullish, and the breakout continues in that direction. The analyst included a simplified diagram of symmetrical triangles to clarify the implications of both upward and downward breakouts. He labels the pattern as a macro formation, highlighting the multi-year timespan involved. According to the post, this breakout suggests a large upside move is in play. However, he cautions that a potential macro retest is still on the table. #XRP – DO YOU COMPREHEND? The MACRO formation has broken out, and a potential MACRO retest is still on the table. The measured target is Bellissimo! Bellissimo in Italian means: ""Very Beautiful"" or ""Gorgeous."" pic.twitter.com/u22UFYPkcq — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 4, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The key figure from his chart is the measured move target, an extrapolated price based on the height of the triangle’s formation. That target points toward a projected price of approximately $120, reinforcing recent triple-digit targets and representing an increase of over 9,000% from the breakout point. The chart further outlines Fibonacci extension levels, including 1.272 ($9.13), 1.414 ($15.05), and 1.618 ($30.71), indicating staged potential resistance or consolidation points along the way. The earlier move from XRP’s 2017 low to its 2018 high is used as the basis for the projected breakout move. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the target is “Bellissimo,” a term he defines as “very beautiful,” suggesting optimism about what could come next. Retest and Present Price Action The chart shows that the breakout occurred with a strong upward move, followed by a pullback toward the triangle’s upper trendline, aligning with the textbook retest phase . If this retest confirms support, it could act as a launchpad for the next leg higher. XRP traded around $2.23 at the time of his analysis, putting it just above the triangle’s upper boundary and the $2.2 support level the analyst recently highlighted. The price has yet to make a decisive second move upward, but the technical structure remains intact, and the rally could begin at any time.

Currently, the price is consolidating just under a major resistance trendline on the daily chart. This level has held firm for several days, creating tension in the market as traders await the next decisive move. Interestingly, analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that back in 2020, a huge government spending bill helped send Bitcoin to record highs. Now in 2025, another spending bill is on the way, and this one is even bigger, hoping that history might repeat itself. In a recent interview, CryptoQuant’s Head of Research, Julio Moreno, shared his outlook for Bitcoin’s price over the next two to three months. According to Moreno, Bitcoin is likely to trade between $87,000 and $99,000 in the short term if current market conditions continue. Moreno explained that this range is based on on-chain data showing the average price at which traders brought their Bitcoin, known as the realized price. In bull markets, prices often correct toward this level before moving higher again. The upper resistance band, which would act as a potential top for now, sits at $138,000. Right now, demand for Bitcoin appears to be weakening slightly. Unless buying activity picks up in the coming weeks, Moreno said there’s a stronger chance of seeing a dip toward $99,000 before any major rally. He said that in order to see Bitcoin climb to $138,000, demand would need to strengthen. Moreno further explained that Bitcoin’s market cycle top could still reach around $190,000 later on, though he expects the current cycle to stretch into 2026. Historically, Bitcoin performs well in the final quarter of the year during bull cycles, so a strong finish to 2025 isn’t off the table.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-06 06:18:41

Similar to the crypto market leader (Bitcoin), the prominent altcoin and memecoin has registered significant market corrections since attaining a local peak of $0.249 on May 22. However, recent revelations by top analyst Ali Martinez has shown a bullish market condition that supports a price rebound for the DOGE market. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins DOGE Bulls Eye Return To $0.22 In an X post on July 5, Martinez provides some technical insights into the DOGE market highlighting an important requisite for the altcoin to rediscover its bullish form. Using the daily trading DOGEUSDT chart, the renowned analyst identifies an ascending trendline that stretches to 2023. At multiple instances of a retest, this trendline has acted as an efficient support consistently rejecting a further price decline. According to Martinez’s analysis, Dogecoin is trading around this trendline which presently runs through the $0.150 price level. The analyst explains market bulls must defend this price zone which not only fuels the chances of a price rebound, but essentially prevents a breakdown and complete transition to a bearish market. Interestingly, all retest of the highlighted trendline has always produced a price bounce resulting in a parabolic rally. This event is seen in price surges of $0.059 to $0.210 (≈255% gain) between 2023-2024, and $0.095 to $0.470 (≈395%) in 2024. However, Ali Martinez presents a conservative price target, stating a defence of $0.15 support level supports a quick bullish return to at least $0.220. Nevertheless, in the presence of a strong bullish pressure as seen in previous rallies, DOGE investors may expect a further rise to around $0.24 with a potential to return to the local market peak of $0.47. Related Reading: Litecoin Fate Tied To Bitcoin – Will $96 Resistance Crack? DOGE Price Overview At the time of writing, DOGE trades at $0.164 reflecting a modest price gain of 0.91% and 0.56% on the daily chart and weekly chart, respectively. Meanwhile, the memecoin has recorded a 56.81% crash in its daily trading volume indicating a significant fall in market interest. According to data from price prediction site Coincodex, general sentiment in the DOGE market is bearish. However, investors retain an healthy market demand as evidenced by a Fear & Greed Index of 67 i.e. significant amount of greed. For the short-term, Coincodex analysts expects DOGE to still maintain a price around $0.160 in the next five days while projecting a price gain to $0.193 in a month. Meanwhile, their long-term forecasts show little expected price growth in the far future as indicated by price targets of $0.197 in three months, and $0.169 in six months.

According to Buterin, the fact that Ethereum has not experienced a single second of downtime in its ten-year history is a great source of confidence for institutional investors. In his opening speech at the EthCC event in Paris, Buterin discussed the future development direction of the Ethereum network and the “test of value” encountered during this period of accelerating institutional adoption. Noting that institutions are focusing on issues such as “privacy” in particular for the future, Buterin stated that these issues are much more important than the technical infrastructure of the system. Related News: The US Government's Chief Advisor on Cryptocurrencies, Bo Hines, Reveals His Big Prediction About Cryptocurrencies The new co-executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, Tomasz Stańczak, also supported this view, saying that these core values are why institutions choose ETH: “Ethereum has not suffered a single second of downtime over the last decade. Along with constant upgrades, it has always remained true to security and censorship resistance.” Stańczak also noted that when institutions send orders to the market, they expect their transactions to be executed without discrimination, fairly, on time and without errors. With stablecoins and tokenized assets becoming increasingly mainstream, the importance of such deterministic assurances is also increasing. *This is not investment advice.

Yet beneath the surface, not all voices share the optimism. Over 10,000 BTC, worth more than $1 billion, was recently moved from a wallet that had been inactive since 2011 . Following that, multiple similar wallets were activated, and a total of 80,009 BTC, worth almost $9 billion, was moved to unknown wallets. The transfers prompted speculation among many crypto holders, but Bitcoin advocates largely dismissed the event as routine. However, XRP proponent Edoardo Farina views it as a sign of deeper instability. Farina’s Warning to Bitcoin Holders In a recent post , Farina stated that the Bitcoin community is “completely ignoring the red flags staring them in the face,” asserting that they are “blinded by arrogance” and unable to see the broader implications. For Farina, the timing and nature of these moves suggest something more than mere internal transfers. Though none of the funds appear to have entered centralized exchanges, the scale of the movement has unsettled some market watchers, and some anticipate an upcoming sell-off. Farina argues this is precisely the kind of event the Bitcoin community refuses to analyze critically. The BTC community is completely ignoring the red flags staring them in the face. Saylor is a government contractor paid to deceive the masses. Blinded by arrogance, they unable to spot the RED flags. But in time, their fall will be the lesson. We tried to warn them. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 4, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He went further in questioning the motivations of Bitcoin figureheads, alleging that Michael Saylor, who has been called Bitcoin’s Warren Buffett , is part of a coordinated effort to mislead. “Saylor is a government contractor paid to deceive the masses,” Farina wrote, reinforcing a narrative he has promoted in previous critiques of institutional involvement in Bitcoin. Possibility of Future Sell-Offs The suggestion that these dormant wallets could eventually be used to liquidate large holdings is not unprecedented. Historically, early miner wallets have rarely moved funds unless some form of realization, profit-taking, transfer of custody, or structural risk management was involved. A similar event occurred in March 2024 after a wallet that had stayed dormant for 14 years sold its BTC at an all-time high. The 2025 wallet reactivations mirror those concerns. If such holders begin to exit positions during heightened optimism, Bitcoin could be exposed to swift downward pressure. Is Bitcoin’s Downfall Coming? Critics of Farina often dismiss his perspective as tribalism. However, the scale and timing of the recent wallet moves lend some weight to his concerns. Farina has always believed that Bitcoin maximalists are not ready to admit XRP’s superiority , and their blindness in this case reinforces his point. For him, the issue is the Bitcoin community’s refusal to confront the possibility of an unfavorable outcome. “Their fall will be the lesson,” he warned. “We tried to warn them.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Recently, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, joined the conversation, revealing how early he invested in XRP. In a reply to a community post asking users to share their XRP entry price, Schwartz revealed that he purchased his tokens at “$0.006.” The comment came in response to a tweet by a community member, who had remarked that “Real OGs caught $XRP at $0.50.” $0.006 — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 5, 2025 Schwartz’s response stood out because at $0.006, his disclosed entry point suggests involvement with XRP going back to its earliest phases of availability. XRP has seen significant volatility since its inception, trading at various price points across multiple market cycles. By comparison, many consider $0.50 the benchmark for “early” participation. Schwartz’s entry point of $0.006 sets that bar significantly lower, as the last time XRP traded at such low prices was March 2017. Schwartz’s History With XRP As Ripple’s CTO, Schwartz has been a central figure in the development and technical direction of the company’s products and the XRP Ledger. His deep involvement with the project places him in a unique category, as he is not only a user or investor but also an architect of the technology itself. Given this context, it’s not surprising that his exposure to XRP predates much of the general public’s awareness of the digital asset. However, he didn’t follow the same path as other key figures in XRP’s development. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Instead of taking a substantial XRP stake like Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb, Schwartz decided to take a salary and maintain a 2% equity stake in Ripple. His decision not to accumulate XRP, like others in the company, has consistently sparked discussions within the crypto community. McCaleb has since sold his XRP holdings and has moved on to Stellar. Larsen is still an executive at Ripple, and Schwartz remains one of XRP’s most vocal advocates . While he did not initially accept any tokens, Schwartz previously revealed that his father bought over a million XRP in 2014 at $0.005 , with a lower entry price than Schwartz himself. However, Schwartz did not elaborate on how much XRP he acquired at that rate or whether his holdings have changed over time, and the community will continue to speculate on how much XRP the CTO holds.

In a new episode of the All-In podcast, host Jason Calacanis highlights that the US dollar index (DXY) witnessed its worst first-half performance in over 50 years after losing nearly 11% of its value against other major currencies in the first six months of 2025. While Calacanis describes the slump as “shocking,” Palihapitiya argues that the dollar has been in decline for decades, and it’s not a major concern because the gains from US assets have consistently outweighed the currency’s depreciation. “This has been a one-way trade for a very long time, and it’s probably important to understand why that is. And I think it generally has to do with the fact that the United States finances a lot of growth, and that has been the right decision. Unless you see a complete collapse in the currency, I suspect that this decay continues to happen. So the question is, is it a bad thing? And the answer is it depends. Because if asset prices increase faster than the dollar devalues, you’re still ahead… If you look at asset prices in the United States relative to asset prices any place else in the world, it is the flight to quality, which is to say it is the thing that everybody wants to own. And you see that in the equity markets, you see it in real estate, you see it in hard assets… The reality is that a lot of people still want to own these assets more than they want to own other assets and those assets are dollar-denominated.” Palihipatiya also highlights that there will be a constant demand for dollar-denominated assets as long as “there’s American ingenuity and American supremacy,” which would meaningfully offset the downside of holding USD.

US Stocks Outpaced Ethereum In June For the 30 day window ending Friday, Jun. 27, the S&P 500 Index gained +4.25%. The push overcame serious resistance from the tariff nail biters and took the broad US stock benchmark to a historic record close Friday. But after running from $76,200 on 4/8 to $111,600 on 5/22, a +46% gain in a little over a month, Bitcoin’s price took some time to cool down in June. The cryptocurrency charted minor gains, which could be seen as a positive in the face of massive international turmoils and geopolitical shocks. Meanwhile, Ethereum corrected by 24% before bouncing off the Jun. 22 support to finalize a 2% loss for the 30 days ending Friday, Jun. 30th. So does ETH have a problem that Bitcoin doesn’t? Not really. Ethereum is a smaller currency by market cap, about 14% of Bitcoin’s size. Traders still perceive it as a more speculative bet. So it tends to move in the same direction as BTC — by larger percentages. That means on the way down, losses are frequently greater. But on the way up, gains are often greater too. For example, during the crypto market’s rally from early April through early June, Bitcoin made a +46% gain. But during the same rally, Ethereum gained +100%, rising from the $1,400 handle to the $2,800 level. Bitcoin and Ethereum Rainbow Charts Double rainbow all the way across the sky? Bitcoin is by and large the biggest leading indicator for the rest of the crypto market’s prices, including Ethereum. It appears to have a long ways to go before topping out this year or next. Based on popular and authoritative analysts’ price targets for Bitcoin in 2025, it’s pacing to enter July and Q3 at 50% to 66% of its peak price before this cycle is over. That means it could double or gain by half again its June price levels before the year is over. Standard Chartered, Bernstein, Galaxy Digital, and Peter Brandt all expect $150,000 to $200,000 for BTC sometime in the next six months. Bitcoin’s long-term price trend rainbow chart confirms these projections. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s own long-term trend chart is shaping up to signal a three-peat of a multi-year trend. If it happens the way it did the last two major market cycles, this Ether prices could be primed to rise by more than Bitcoin’s during the next big monthly rally. Source: X If it turns out to be Bitcoin’s final push for its peak on this cycle as market watchers expect, Ethereum’s gains could signal the start of this cycle’s alt season in meme coins and Layer 2 app tokens. In addition to the market technical setup for ETH prices in Q3, here are four further bullish signals supporting the leading smart contract platform’s price gains in July. 1. Who Will Win Ethereum L2 Fee Wars? Ethereum’s price has taken time to absorb the shock of the Dencun upgrade on Mar. 13, 2024. The upgrade lowers rates for Layer 2 apps to lock in tranches of transaction updates with the base layer chain. In the 15 months since, developers have deployed a number of new apps with currencies that offer Ethereum services for lower fees. The base chain’s fee revenue dropped from $30 million annually to $500,000 by Q1 of this year. That saves users money, but a lot of Ethereum stakers who had their money parked in staking contracts to earn that fee revenue felt inclined to move it somewhere that it could still earn returns on their savings. This is a massive factor in Ethereum’s sluggish price growth compared to Bitcoin’s over the past year. But it’s not that the latter is falling behind its competitors like Solana and Ripple. When factoring in the growth of the post-Dencun L2 coins on Ethereum— like Mantle (MNT), POL (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Movement (MOVE), and Starknet (STRK)— the money mostly didn’t leave Ethereum and go to its competitors. It went to another layer, powered by and supporting the base chain. For that reason, Ethereum may be undervalued by a large number of the cryptocurrency market’s headline readers that don’t understand what happened. Ethereum Identity Crisis? Some have referred in the mean time to this awkward stage in Ethereum’s growth as an identity crisis. It’s an open platform and anyone can build on it in any way that the code can handle. The question for Vitalik Buterin and crypto market investors who show up to value early is: Will one of the slew of Ethereum scale and fee apps, some new app we haven’t heard of yet, or an upgrade be what implements the best ultra long term, future proof, platform-wide standardizations that define the network’s global advantages? Find the answer to that question and you’re doing some real work. 2. SharpLink $30M ETH Buy In another positive development, the corporate treasury race that started for Bitcoin supplies continues to rock the Ethereum markets. SharpLink Gaming, bought another $30 million worth of ETH just before the Ether price chart threw a small cup and handle pattern. But why does this matter? Well, let’s see what happened to STrategy. Led by founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, Tyson’s Corner, Virginia-based Strategy Inc. and Bitcoin have both benefited from the company’s pivot in 2020 to simply pile up as much BTC as it can hold on to forever. As a result of the cryptocurrency’s increasing popularity with investors since then, MSTR stock rallied 566% in under 11 months from $63 per share on Jan. 5, 2024 to a price peak of $420 on Nov. 22, 2024. Over that same time, the S&P 500 Index rallied 27% from the 4697 level to 5969. Every $100 spent on Strategy stock on Jan. 5 last year could be sold for $666 dollars on Nov. 22, paying back buyers $566 for saving their $100 with MSTR shares for a term of 11 months. That’s like a downpayment on a new car lease with a high credit score. Meanwhile, $100 spent on an S&P 500 ETF would have returned buyers $27. That’s more like a cheap dinner out for two. All for the same hundred bucks and the same 11 months. That suggests regulated Wall Street investors wanted on to the Bitcoin bandwagon and found a way in Strategy stocks. Seeing the bullishness of corporate finance, Internet crypto markets were now racing Strategy to accumulate a scarce supply of BTC tokens. Now, SharpLink is doing it again with ETH. The company’s stocks spiked over 8 days in late May from $3.76 per share to just under $80 a share as Wall Street rewarded the former gaming company for pivoting to accumulating a regulated corporate Ether treasury. 3. $39M ETH Whale Bite Meanwhile, an Ethereum whale took a $39 million chomp out of the crypto dip on 6/22. Ethereum’s forward outlook was too good for this whale not to bite at that 24% off discount tag. Every token is a vote with a daily trading value that fluctuates on a global open market of crypto exchanges. Participants “vote” by locking, unlocking, moving, and swapping currencies, as often as they like, any time they like. When crypto investors take Ether tokens off a crypto exchange, the remaining supply of ETH tends to attract higher prices at the point of sale. But when they stake ETH for yield, it creates even more support. 4. Bit Digital Drops $34M BTC for ETH Not to be outdone by SharpLink, publicly traded, New York-based blockchain company Bit Digital, announced on 6/25 it is giving up $34 million worth of BTC tokens to move the proceeds into Ether and develop staking strategies. They might profit well from determining in advance of the overall market which of the Ethereum scale and fee coins will deliver the most yield and gains together over timespans relevant to their balance sheet and calendar.

XRP Supporters Have Maintained Consistency Through Challenges Edoardo Farina, the founder of Alpha Lions Academy and Head of Social Adoption at XRPHealthcare, recently stated that XRP proponents have regularly demonstrated insight and resilience, even during periods of skepticism and market underperformance. His remarks follow several key developments that have placed Ripple and XRP back into broader market discussions. Farina pointed to the protracted legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which began in late 2020. Despite the uncertainty and XRP’s extended stagnation around the $0.50 mark during that time, supporters of the token continued to defend its legitimacy and utility. $XRP holders have been proven right time and time again. We had the courage to speak the truth, even when the facts pointed the other way. The SEC lawsuit and XRP stuck at $0.50 felt like an eternity. But we were on the right side of history. We deserve prosperity! — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 2, 2025 Recognition for the Community’s Track Record Farina argued that XRP holders have repeatedly advocated for positions that were initially doubted but ultimately proven valid. He claimed that this consistency, particularly in the face of external criticism, justifies recognition and reward. “We deserve prosperity,” he stated, underscoring his belief that XRP supporters have remained on the right side of industry developments. Among the latest validations for the XRP community was Ripple’s recent confirmation of its pursuit of a U.S. banking license. Additionally, the company, via its subsidiary Standard Custody, has applied for a Federal Reserve master account, which would allow it to hold reserves for its stablecoin, RLUSD. These developments support earlier claims by some XRP commentators that Ripple intended to operate more like a traditional financial institution to challenge the global payments infrastructure. At the time, such views were dismissed by many as speculative. However, Ripple’s current direction aligns with those prior assertions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Legal and Market Milestones Further Strengthen Community Confidence XRP advocates also previously contended that the token should not be classified as a security. This position was upheld in July 2023, when U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in Ripple’s favour regarding the classification of XRP in secondary market sales. That ruling was a major milestone, especially given the initial skepticism surrounding the case’s potential outcome. Furthermore, XRP’s price remained relatively flat between $0.50 and $0.60 for years, even as other digital assets experienced significant growth. Despite this, many within the community remained confident in its long-term potential. Their outlook proved accurate when XRP surpassed $2 in late 2024 after a long-awaited breakout. Future Expectations Remain Bold but Consistent Today, the XRP community continues to project ambitious goals for the token and its underlying technology. These include expectations that XRP will handle a portion of SWIFT’s daily transaction volume and that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) will play a central role in asset tokenization. Some even predict that XRP will eventually reach double-digit valuations. While these forecasts remain highly speculative, they are consistent with the community’s long-standing belief in the token’s transformative potential. If past trends are any indication, XRP holders will likely continue to defend their outlooks until further developments either validate or challenge them.

However, analysts are adamant that the asset can unlock major gains, as long as it reclaims a key resistance level. The key resistance level for $XRP is $2.38. Breaking above it could trigger a major move! pic.twitter.com/mwpqKBxJKV — Ali (@ali_charts) July 4, 2025 Basing his analysis on XRP’s UTXO, Ali Martinez determined that this pivotal level is situated at $2.38, where the fourth-largest cryptocurrency faced several rejections in the past few months. However, a conclusive breakout above it could send the token flying, he added. Shortly after, the analyst with almost 140,000 followers on X indicated that XRP can surge to $2.6 as long as it reclaims $2.33. BitGuru also outlined the significance of the same two major resistance lines, saying the asset was rejected at the lower one after it confirmed an “inverse head and shoulders and triple bottom pattern.” With XRP now testing the $2.23 support, the doors open for a surge back to $2.33 as long as it can remain above it, BitGuru added. Elite Crypto’s analysis is similar to that of Martinez, as they noted that XRP is “showing a strong bullish setup.” They added that “the price is consistently respecting the horizontal support and now approaching the downtrend resistance.” The analyst predicted that a breakout from this obstacle could result in a massive price surge for Ripple’s token, perhaps to and above the $3.4 all-time high. $XRP is showing a strong bullish setup as the price is consistently respecting the horizontal support and now approaching the downtrend resistance. A breakout from this zone could lead to a sharp upward move toward the $3.50 range which has acted as a previous resistance level.… pic.twitter.com/TRXv9tYe3n — Elite Crypto (@TheEliteCrypto) July 5, 2025 The post XRP Price Builds Bullish Momentum: Watch This Resistance Level Closely appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-07-06 07:40:52

But the tide may be turning. Since April, the Total 2 — a metric representing the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin — has climbed 35%, signaling a potential shift in momentum toward altcoins. This recovery marks one of the strongest altcoin performances in recent years and has reignited hopes of a broader market expansion beyond Bitcoin. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook Top analyst Daan has weighed in on this development, highlighting a key technical formation: a higher low on the Total 2 chart during the recent market bounce. This structure is often seen as a bullish signal, suggesting that investors are stepping in to accumulate altcoins at increasingly higher price levels. If confirmed with a higher high in the coming days or weeks, this could mark the start of a sustainable altseason. As macroeconomic conditions stabilize and risk appetite returns, altcoins could see renewed interest from traders and investors. The next key test will be whether bulls can reclaim higher levels and flip the broader altcoin market structure definitively back to bullish. Altcoins Prepare For A Breakout Altcoins remain about 50% below their all-time highs, but bulls are setting the stage for what could be an expansive move in the coming weeks. After months of underperformance, the broader altcoin market is beginning to show early signs of structural recovery. Ethereum — the market’s leader among altcoins — has been consolidating between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May, and many analysts believe that a breakout in ETH could serve as the catalyst for a broader altcoin rally. Daan recently highlighted a key technical development: the Total 2 Altcoin Market Cap has made a higher low during the latest bounce, a structure that often precedes bullish continuation. This higher low suggests growing demand and reduced downside pressure, both of which are critical to establishing a sustainable uptrend. The key area to watch is the 2024 high setback in May. If bulls can push Total 2 above that level, it would confirm a higher high — the final piece needed to flip the high timeframe structure decisively back to bullish. That breakout would likely usher in renewed momentum across mid- and small-cap tokens, fueling what many hope will be the long-awaited altseason. For now, the market remains in a holding pattern, but signs of accumulation are growing stronger. If Ethereum can break out of its multi-month range, the altcoin market could rapidly reprice, erasing months of losses and opening the door to a new wave of capital rotation out of Bitcoin dominance. As long as key levels hold and risk appetite improves, the foundation is in place for altcoins to make a significant move higher. Related Reading: Solana Tests Rising Channel Support – Breakdown Could Send Price To $128.50 Level ETH/BTC Chart Signals Turning Point The ETH/BTC chart reveals a critical moment for the altcoin market. After a prolonged downtrend that began in late 2022, Ethereum has stabilized near the 0.023 BTC level, forming a potential bottom. While the pair remains well below the 50-week, 100-week, and 200-week moving averages—indicating continued bearish pressure—momentum appears to be shifting. Since bottoming out in mid-June, ETH/BTC has held its ground and is attempting to build a base, with early signs of accumulation. However, without a clear breakout above resistance zones, particularly around the 0.025–0.027 BTC range, bulls will struggle to confirm a trend reversal. A decisive move above these levels would be the first major confirmation of strength for Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern – $2,200 Support Back In Focus? This breakout is essential for altseason. Historically, altcoin rallies are triggered when ETH outperforms BTC, drawing capital into mid- and small-cap tokens. Without ETH leading, altcoins tend to lag as Bitcoin dominance remains high.

This forecast comes at a time when Ripple has taken a groundbreaking step toward transforming its role in the U.S. financial sector by applying for an official banking license. In response to a query on XRP’s short-term outlook, ChatGPT stated, “Given the current trajectory of XRP at $2.22 and the added positive sentiment from Ripple’s regulatory advancements, XRP could climb approximately 12.6% to $2.50 by July 31.” The prediction reflects not only the asset’s market performance but also the potential market reaction to Ripple’s new regulatory initiative. Ripple’s Application for a U.S. Banking License Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license marks one of the most consequential developments for the company and XRP in recent years. If approved, Ripple would become a licensed bank in the United States, allowing it to operate directly within the regulated financial system and offer payment and settlement services without relying on third-party intermediaries. This move is widely viewed as a strategic pivot to reinforce Ripple’s legitimacy and expand its services within the traditional banking ecosystem. Regulatory approval would mean Ripple could provide its technology — and XRP itself — as a trusted component in cross-border payments. Ripple’s approach signals confidence in its ability to meet stringent regulatory requirements and demonstrates its intent to work within established frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for XRP’s Use in Cross-Border Payments One of XRP’s primary use cases is facilitating cross-border money transfers by acting as a bridge currency. With a banking license, Ripple would gain the ability to integrate its services, and by extension, XRP, much more deeply into legacy financial systems. According to analyst commentary, this integration could significantly enhance the speed, cost efficiency, and reliability of international transfers. This potential for greater adoption of XRP in mainstream financial services strengthens the fundamental case for the token. Credibility and Regulatory Oversight Strengthen XRP’s Outlook Regulatory clarity and institutional trust are key factors that could bolster investor confidence in XRP. By aligning itself more closely with regulators and becoming subject to U.S. banking oversight, Ripple demonstrates its willingness to operate transparently and within legal boundaries. As ChatGPT highlighted in its forecast, the market often reacts positively to credible institutional moves that reduce risk and enhance the asset’s appeal to conservative investors. “The combination of strong recent performance, Ripple’s institutional strategy, and improved regulatory standing supports a realistic expectation of XRP reaching $2.50 by the end of July,” ChatGPT stated.

33767162,[object Object],1751788838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Outflow Ratio Mirrors 2023 Accumulation – Long-Term Bullish Signal?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-outflow-ratio-mirrors-2023-accumulation-long-term-bullish-signal/,"Bitcoin is currently consolidating just below its $112,000 all-time high, with bulls firmly defending the $108,000 level as short-term support. This narrow range has created a tense but bullish environment as traders and investors await a decisive move that could shape the market’s direction in the months ahead. Top analyst Darkfost highlights a notable trend: outflows continue to dominate, reinforcing long-term investor confidence. This pattern suggests that rather than exiting the market, seasoned holders are moving BTC off exchanges, typically a sign of reduced selling pressure and strong conviction. It’s not difficult to see why confidence is building. Bitcoin adoption is steadily growing among major corporations and government institutions alike. The digital asset is no longer seen purely as a speculative tool but is increasingly being positioned as a long-term store of value. From corporate treasury strategies to nation-state interest, Bitcoin is gradually becoming embedded in broader financial infrastructure. Bitcoin Range-Bound As Long-Term Confidence Builds Bitcoin is currently trading within a tight range between $103,000 and $110,000. This range has persisted for several weeks, creating a buildup in momentum that suggests a breakout is imminent. A decisive move above $110K could push Bitcoin into price discovery, while a breakdown below $103K would likely trigger an accelerated downside. For now, the market remains in wait-and-see mode. Macroeconomic uncertainty is beginning to ease, with more clarity emerging around interest rate policy and global growth expectations. Many analysts believe that a new bullish phase could unfold in the coming months. Still, risks remain. US Treasury yields are climbing once again, and inflation continues to show signs of persistence—two variables that could dampen market sentiment if they worsen. Despite these headwinds, long-term investor confidence appears strong. Darkfost notes that outflows are once again dominating the market. The monthly outflow/inflow ratio has fallen to 0.9, a level not seen since the depths of the 2023 bear market. A ratio below 1 typically signals sustained demand on the spot market, as coins are being withdrawn from exchanges rather than prepared for sale. This behavior reflects growing conviction among long-term holders. Bitcoin is increasingly being embraced by corporations and even governments as a strategic reserve asset. It is gradually evolving into a modern-day store of value, used to bolster treasury allocations and reduce exposure to fiat currency risks. As outflows continue and adoption grows, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain intact. The current range may only be a pause before the next major move—one that could define the trajectory of the market heading into Q3 and beyond. BTC Consolidates Below Resistance The 3-day Bitcoin chart shows continued consolidation just below the $109,300 resistance level, with support holding firm near $103,600. This range has defined recent price action, and the low volatility hints at an impending breakout. Notably, BTC remains well above its key moving averages—the 50 SMA at $95,655, the 100 SMA at $90,529, and the 200 SMA at $73,817—suggesting the bullish trend remains intact on the higher timeframe. Despite repeated tests, buyers have yet to break above $109,300 with conviction. However, the series of higher lows since mid-April indicates consistent bullish pressure building beneath resistance. A breakout above the $112K all-time high would mark a major technical shift and push BTC into price discovery, with upside momentum likely accelerating rapidly. Volume remains relatively low, indicating market participants are waiting for a catalyst to confirm direction. Until then, traders are likely watching for another retest of the lower boundary of the range or a decisive move above resistance. As long as BTC maintains its current structure and key support holds, bulls remain in control. A close above the resistance zone would set the stage for the next leg up in this bullish cycle.

As is known, yesterday a cryptocurrency whale that had been sleeping since 2011 woke up and moved 80,000 BTC worth approximately $8 billion. A crypto whale, likely caught up in the wave of FUD from yesterday’s incident, moved 1,550 BTC, or approximately $167 million worth of assets, to cryptocurrency exchange Binance. However, despite the wave of FUD, Bitcoin price has increased by 0.11% since yesterday and is trading above $108,000 at the time of writing. Related News: The US Government's Chief Advisor on Cryptocurrencies, Bo Hines, Reveals His Big Prediction About Cryptocurrencies There is also speculation about the identity of the big whale, who has not sold yet and has simply moved his assets to another crypto wallet. Some low-level evidence suggests that this whale could be Roger Ver, a former BTC supporter and now the founder of another cryptocurrency called Bitcoin SV. Roger Ver is one of the early supporters of BTC, and it is thought that Ver may be preparing a deal with the IRS, the US tax authority, behind the movement of this amount of BTC. *This is not investment advice.

BofA’s Global Fund Manager Survey, which polled 190 respondents overseeing $523 billion in wealth, finds that 54% of managers believe that international equities will be the best-performing asset class in the next five years, reports Investing.com. Meanwhile, 23% picked US equities, 13% had their eye on gold and 5% chose bonds. Looking closer at the equities market, BofA’s monthly survey shows that fund managers are increasing their allocation in eurozone and emerging market (EM) stocks while trimming positions in US names. Specifically, they are bullish on stocks trading in the energy and banking sectors as they move capital away from staples, utilities and healthcare. As for the US dollar, the fund managers are at their most underweight position in the American currency since 2005, as 35% say they have larger positions in other currencies. BofA chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett says, “[The] biggest summer pain trade is long the buck.” The poll also finds that “long gold” is still the most crowded trade, with 41% bullish on the precious metal. At the same time, optimism for the Magnificent 7 appears to be waning, with just 23% holding long positions. Based on the results of the June survey, BofA says the most contrarian trades include long US dollar, short gold; long US equities, short eurozone stocks and long consumer stocks, short banks.

Holders of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP are expected to pay tax on profits generated from trading the assets, a rule that has been in place for a while. Meanwhile, under the new rules , crypto traders will face fines of up to £300 if they fail to provide their personal details to the cryptocurrency service providers they use to make sure they are paying the right amounts to His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The government expects that the new crypto tax rule, which is known as the Cryptoasset Reporting Framework and would take effect from January, to raise about £315 million by April 2030. Crypto tax evaders to face fines in the United Kingdom According to the new rules, any crypto service providers that also fail to provide accurate details about transaction and tax reference numbers are expected to also face fines. James Murray MP, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, talked about the new rules. “We’re going further and faster to crack down on tax dodgers as we close the tax gap. By ensuring everyone pays their fair share, the new crypto reporting rules will make sure tax dodgers have nowhere to hide, helping raise the revenue needed to fund our nurses, police, and other vital public services,” he said. The new rule comes after Rachel Reeves, Chancellor of the Exchequer, refused to rule out the possibility of tax increases after the United Kingdom government made a U-turn on welfare reforms. The Chancellor, whose tears in the Commons spooked the financial market, said she was not going to apologize for trying to make sure that the numbers add up. “But we do need to make sure that we’re telling a story and a Labour story. We did that well in the Budget and Spending Review, we increased taxes on the wealthiest and businesses,” she said. When asked whether she was prepared to rule out further tax rises, she said it was not going to happen, because it would be “irresponsible for a Chancellor to do that.” Crypto users criticize the new tax rules The new rules, which are expected to take effect in January 2026, will see crypto traders providing certain useful and identifying details to any service provider they use to buy, sell, transfer, or exchange digital assets. The information given to the service provider will ensure each trader’s details will be linked to their tax record, making it easier for the United Kingdom government to find out how much tax they need to pay. Users need to provide information like their full name, date of birth, address, and country where they stay (if they do not live in the United Kingdom). They are also required to present their tax identification number, and in the case of businesses, the legal business name and main business address. Crypto services required to collect this information include crypto exchange applications, online marketplaces where users buy and sell NFTs and services that manage crypto portfolios for users. The new rule has generated quite a buzz among crypto traders in the United Kingdom, with one user noting that it is a win-win for the government. “So you invest what savings you managed to save and buy crypto. If they make a profit, the government tax you but if you make a loss the government aren’t going to be interested, so it’s a win-win for the government,” the user said. Another user argued that they have paid tax on everything they used to set up their small-scale mining hardware, asking the need to pay tax on the profits from her business.

While most larger-cap alts have produced insignificant gains, TON and BONK have emerged as the biggest gainers on a relatively calm Sunday morning. BTC Calm at $108K It has been a quiet period for the primary cryptocurrency. In fact, the latest major price moves came about two weeks ago – on June 23 and 24 – when it dumped to $98,000 before it soared past $105,000 a day later as the Middle East war was going rampantly. Ever since then, though, the asset has been stuck in a tight trading range between $105,000 and $110,000. It tested the lower boundary on Wednesday, where the bulls stepped up and pushed it south toward the upper one. On Thursday, BTC showed signs of a breakout attempt when it spiked to a multi-week peak of $110,500, but the bears stepped up at this point and didn’t allow a surge to a new all-time high. The landscape has been somewhat unchanged since then, as bitcoin quickly returned to $108,000 and has not moved from that level for a few days. Its market capitalization stands strong at $2.150 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at over 63% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView BONK on the Run As the graph below will demonstrate, most larger-cap alts are slightly in the green on a daily scale. Such minor increases are evident from the likes of ETH, BNB, SOL, TRX, DOGE, ADA, BCH, LINK, and XRP. In contrast, HYPE and PI have lost some traction over the past 24 hours. The biggest gainers are TON and BONK. The former has risen by over 9% and sits at $3, while the meme coin has exploded by 20% and now trades at $0.000022.

Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor’s ambitious forecast of Bitcoin reaching $21 million has reignited speculation within the crypto community, including what this could mean for XRP. Saylor’s $21 Million Bitcoin Forecast Speaking at the BTC Prague 2025 conference, Michael Saylor outlined a future scenario where Bitcoin could attain a valuation of $21 million within the next 21 years. His outlook is based on a combination of factors, including evolving global regulatory frameworks and increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Saylor emphasized that these developments could contribute to unprecedented long-term growth in the asset’s price. While his prediction focuses solely on Bitcoin, it naturally invites speculation about potential impacts on other cryptocurrencies, particularly those that tend to follow Bitcoin’s general market direction. XRP, despite operating on a different infrastructure and use case, is often influenced by the broader market trends initiated by Bitcoin. How XRP Reacts to Bitcoin Trends Historically, XRP’s price behaviour has shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s movements . When Bitcoin experiences sustained growth or decline, altcoins like XRP tend to reflect similar patterns, although not always at the same scale. For instance, downturns in Bitcoin typically coincide with broader market corrections, while Bitcoin’s recoveries frequently spark renewed momentum across other assets. Given this correlation, a hypothetical increase in Bitcoin’s price from its current level of approximately $107,000 to $21 million would represent a growth rate of approximately 19,526%. If XRP were to appreciate at the same relative rate, its future value could be projected accordingly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Value in a $21 Million Bitcoin Scenario At the time of writing, XRP is priced at $2.22 . If XRP were to follow Bitcoin’s projected trajectory and experience a similar 19,526% increase, its future price would be approximately $431 per token. This estimate is purely theoretical and assumes a direct proportional relationship between the two assets’ price movements over the coming two decades. To illustrate the potential financial implications, an investment of $10,000 in XRP at its current price would yield approximately 4,545 tokens. If the token value reached $431, this holding would be worth over $1.95 million by 2046. However, this projection is speculative and dependent on numerous variables, including market adoption, regulation, institutional participation, and overall sentiment toward digital assets. Uncertainty in Long-Term Projections While optimistic forecasts like Saylor’s attract attention and can influence investor sentiment, it is important to recognize the uncertainty inherent in such long-term predictions. There is no assurance that Bitcoin will achieve a $21 million valuation or that XRP will appreciate in direct correlation. Market dynamics, competitive technology, legal developments, and macroeconomic factors all play a significant role in shaping outcomes in the cryptocurrency space. While theoretical calculations provide interesting insights into potential returns, they should not be mistaken for guaranteed outcomes.

This move underscores Ethereum’s growing appeal as a balance sheet asset, driven by its 3–5% staking yields and deflationary design. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in the crypto market, with its presale in Phase 5 at $0.03 per token. Having raised $11,700,000 and attracted over 12,700 holders with 580 million tokens sold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling DeFi opportunity.

Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, with the token set to launch at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return on investment.

Moreover, no incidents occurred in the past 90 days. This bolsters investor confidence in the platform’s reliability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also launching a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, offering $50,000 in rewards across four severity tiers. Additionally, its upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, built on Ethereum, promises stability against volatile crypto prices. This fully collateralized asset will streamline lending and staking, reducing depegging risks. Consequently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) strengthens its position as a top crypto in the DeFi market. Engaging community initiatives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is boosting engagement with a $100,000 MUTM giveaway , split among 10 winners, each receiving $10,000. Participants need a $50 presale investment and must submit a valid wallet address while completing all required steps. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s institutional backing, like Bit Digital’s $162.9 million raise, highlights the market’s bullish sentiment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aligns with this momentum, offering a practical DeFi solution. Rallying with Ethereum’s surge As Ethereum gains institutional traction, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a top crypto to buy now. Its presale success, with $11,700,000 raised and a secure, audited platform, positions it for significant growth. The projected $2.50 post-launch price in 2025 signals strong potential for early investors. With innovative lending, a stablecoin in development, and community-driven initiatives, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a unique opportunity in the crypto market.

In a new video update, PlanB tells his 215,000 YouTube subscribers that the crypto king’s rising relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator that measures when an asset is overbought or oversold, suggests that rallies are coming over the next several months. According to the analyst, based on historical precedent, if BTC can hit an RSI of 75 on the monthly chart, a months-long “hot” FOMO bull market will follow. “We had some FOMO and disappointment last year, and that’s why this RSI average shows a little wobble here. Well, I expected [that], and actually, that’s what we’re seeing last month. It picked up the upward slope again. So I expect [BTC] to continue toward [an RSI of] 75, because if you look here in 2019, after the wobble, it returned to the former levels before the wobble. We have seen 75 RSI already three or five times, so I think we’re going to return to that level… That means if that were to happen this month in July, then July would [see BTC] end at $125,000ish… And after that, of course, I expect some really hot FOMO bull months of 80 RSI, 80+ like we’ve seen in all the bull markets. Even the lousy 2021 bull markets had five months above RSI 80. So that’s what I expect.” Source: PlanB/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $107,992 at time of writing.

Firms like Gates Industrial and Generac are already expanding their sale of specialist equipment, offering backup power generators and cooling pumps for tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft. North Carolina’s Honeywell — a well-known manufacturer of aerospace and automotive products, as well as residential, commercial, and industrial control systems — also targets the data center market with its hybrid cooling solutions. During the firm’s last earnings call, the company’s CEO, Vimal Kapur, said that the firm will prioritize data centers, given that the market is growing despite current market conditions. Industrial investments surge as AI boom drives data center infrastructure spending Companies like Caterpillar, Cummis, and Johnson Controls invested in the data center market in the early days of Trump’s tariffs , a time especially filled with uncertainty and market drops. Though the market conditions are uncertain, there are no signs of a material pullback in demand for data center construction. Chris Snyder, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, even acknowledged AI and data center market growth, “We’re seeing supersonic growth on the back of AI, and in general over the past three years, the price that you can get from the data center customer has been stronger than the price elsewhere.” In November 2024, Vertiv Holdings Co., a producer of cooling and power backup equipment for data centers, projected a 14% surge in its annual sales, up from the previous 11% estimate. At the start of the year, tech giant Microsoft pledged $80 billion to increase its data center capacity. According to President Trump, the Damac Group, a Dubai-based real estate developer, will also spend $20 billion to build data centers in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana. According to Gartner, they expect over $400 billion will be spent on data center infrastructure this fiscal year, with hyperscalers like Microsoft driving the majority—over 75%—of the projected spending. Gates and Generac have adjusted their facilities to work on data center products In the last few months, Gates Industrial, a huge player in the automotive industry, expanded into pipe and pump design, typically used in cooling servers in data centers. Mike Haen, the vice president of global product line management at Gates, even noted that they had to customize their equipment slightly to work on the data centre products. Alongside Gates, Generac is betting on the hyperscale market to revive its share price, which has fallen 75% since its 2021 peak. The company has already invested around $130 million this year in facility upgrades to support large-scale generator production aimed at meeting hyperscaler demand. Ricardo Navarro, Generac’s data center chief, seemed optimistic about the company’s pivot to data centers, believing that the hyperscale market is “almost isolated” even during economic turmoil. Earlier, Barclays Plc analyst Julian Mitchell noted that it is difficult to predict whether manufacturers in the data center industry will see a significant rise in valuation. Still, it is equally challenging to foresee a decline, given this year’s elevated spending levels. He added that, with no clear factors likely to disrupt current momentum, it’s hard to anticipate when companies might scale back their investments. So far, the data center–driven upswing in adjacent industrial sectors has fueled robust stock performance and soaring valuations for some companies, including power corporations.

Key Takeaways: Hackers stole nearly $148 million from Brazilian banks by breaching C&M Software’s systems. At least $40 million was laundered into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, according to ZachXBT. Authorities froze $50 million linked to the hack, but much of the stolen crypto remains missing. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged the laundering after tracing large sums moving through Latin American over-the-counter desks and exchanges. The attack stands as one of Brazil’s most significant financial breaches to date. Hackers Target C&M, Key Link to Brazil’s PIX Payment Network The hack targeted C&M, a key intermediary connecting smaller banks and fintechs to the Central Bank’s infrastructure, including PIX, the country’s widely used instant payments system. According to Brazilian authorities, hackers exploited credentials sold by João Nazareno Roque , a 48-year-old IT worker at C&M, who received the equivalent of $2,770 for his corporate login details. Local news outlet g1 Globo reported that Roque didn’t just sell his credentials; he also assisted in building a system to facilitate the theft, netting an additional payment of about $1,800. Using this inside access, hackers orchestrated a coordinated attack early on June 30, siphoning approximately 800 million reais, or nearly $148 million, from reserve accounts of six financial institutions. $140M HACK in Brazil – Insider Sold Access for Just $2.7K?! ZachXBT reports a $140M breach in Brazil, where an insider allegedly sold system access for only $2.7K. Around $30–40M was funneled into crypto via LatAm OTC desks. One of the biggest insider leaks in recent memory?… pic.twitter.com/ehMqjuQGCi — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) July 4, 2025 The fraudulent transfers went undetected for nearly two and a half hours. The breach only came to light when BMP, one of the affected institutions, flagged suspicious transactions. BMP’s CEO, Carlos Benitez, said his bank alone lost roughly $73.8 million but managed to recover about $29.5 million. A Brazilian court has since frozen accounts suspected of receiving stolen funds, recovering approximately $50 million so far. However, the full scope of the laundering operation remains under investigation, with significant sums still unaccounted for. Following the incident, the Central Bank suspended parts of C&M’s access to its systems as authorities worked to contain the damage. Roque was arrested on July 3, two days after the hack, and remains in custody as the investigation continues. Officials said no retail customers suffered direct losses, as the stolen funds were limited to institutional reserve balances held at the Central Bank. Crypto Networks Emerge as Escape Route for Crimes The latest breach underscores growing fears about crypto’s role as a conduit for conventional financial crimes. Digital assets offer liquidity and a level of pseudonymity that traditional cash transactions can’t match, enabling swift movement of illicit funds at scale. Stablecoins, in particular, have drawn the attention of criminal networks. The Financial Action Task Force recently warned that stablecoins pose increasing risks when used by illicit groups, especially in the absence of coordinated global oversight. Brazil’s recent heist mirrors a series of high-profile crypto-related thefts this year, including North Korea’s record $1.46 billion ByBit hack and Chinese authorities dismantling a $136 million laundering ring that used digital currencies for cross-border money flows. Nevertheless, Brazilian officials are now working to trace the stolen funds across various blockchain networks, coordinating with international agencies to freeze assets and identify those responsible for one of the nation’s largest financial cyberattacks.

XRP Price Prediction As Ripple Moves Into Banking with FCC Filing,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/best-crypto-to-buy-now-xrp-price-prediction-as-ripple-moves-into-banking-with-fcc-filing,"All eyes are on XRP right now after the recent filing of Ripple's banking application to the FCC. Considering this has happened just after Ripple's decision to p112ut an end to its standoff with the SEC, hopes have risen that XRP could make a comeback, perhaps even cross its $3 resistance in the coming days. This has given weight to the view that XRP could topple Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. Does it mean XRP is the best crypto to buy now, or does it merely hint at the arrival of investor opportunities with a variety of assets to pick from? Ripple Applying for National Bank Charter from the OCC - Brad Garlinghouse The announcement about Ripple's banking application was made by Brad Garlinghouse, who, on X, posted the news stating that this approach could put more federal oversight on Ripple, which could bolster its trust factor, transforming it into the bridge to connect traditional and decentralized financial institutions. However, that's not all, as the company has also filed for a Fed Master Account via Standard Custody. This could help Ripple to hold $RLUSD (Ripple Stablecoin) directly from the Fed and gain an additional layer of security. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 Just as expected, community reactions to the news have been positive. Some have said this is a materialization of a dream consisting of Ripple becoming a bank, which clears the way for XRP to reach $100. However, others have asked how XRP will fit into the banking license. Impact of the News on the XRP Price While investors were expecting the news to have a major impact on the XRP price, that, unfortunately, wasn't the case. The DeFi token's value is still consolidating around the $2.2 level, and whatever green candles it was able to print were corrected the next day. That said, a macro-analysis of the price chart shows that the XRP price has been following an ascending channel ever since it dropped to the $1.9 level on June 22, and there have been no signs of the price action stopping. Furthermore, since the US government has been very progressive about crypto, chances are high that Ripple's application could be approved. That could help with streamlining crypto into the traditional financial space, giving XRP much-needed long-term upside. It is also possible for the crypto to reach $3 in the coming days. Does it mean XRP is the best crypto to buy now? The answer to this could arguably be yes. However, until the DeFi crypto crosses the $2.6 mark to retest the $3 level, investors should stay cautious, since it will only take one long red candle to change the course of the XRP price action. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Smart Investor Picks During the Current Ecosystem BTC Bull Ripple's growth would consolidate the market's belief that the altcoin season has indeed arrived. However, that does not mean Bitcoin would lose any of its shine, as despite all the news about Ripple's legal qualms, the apex crypto continues to be the major driver of the cryptocurrency market. BTC Bull is a project that taps into that particular market, offering users a standard meme coin experience with a robust touch. While no long-term use cases have been mentioned by the official website, the project has continued to delight customers thanks to its social media posts as well as unique mechanics. The project has tied its token burns and Bitcoin airdrop model with Bitcoin's growth, which is a subtle way to grow alongside the apex crypto. While this move could be seen as a gimmick by many, the fact that the project has managed to raise upwards of $8 million already means there could be more to the project than meets the eye. The token is launching soon, with an application to CoinGecko already filed. Furthermore, there are many analysts already bullish about the launch, stating that BTC Bull could achieve a 1000% growth after going live on the price charts. Snorter Another crypto that could be considered one of the top offerings among crypto pre-sales is Snorter . Snorter is a meme coin powering an automated crypto trading bot that lets investors find and trade top-performing Solana cryptos. What further elevates the appeal of Snorter is the fact that it is accessible via Telegram. Being one of the leading messaging apps for crypto gives it access to a range of unique attributes. Not only is the platform easy to use, but the automated sniping tool is also equipped with all kinds of security features. In addition to the perks that come with the bot, Snorter is also very up to the mark when it comes to highlighting its memes. The main animal chosen to highlight this project, an aardvark, has been used to draw an equivalence between an aardvark's snout that it uses to fetch and Snorter's approach to sniffing the best cryptocurrency investment projects. While Snorter's connection to XRP isn't direct, the fact that XRP has the potential to become the biggest altcoin ultimately means unique projects with niche perks could gain community attention quickly. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a cryptocurrency project whose core idea is to inject utility into the Bitcoin network, and it aims to accomplish this using Bitcoin's first L2 scaling solution. The tech-related documents of the project show that developers are hard at work, trying to make it a reality. Three technologies have been implemented for this purpose: L2 scaling solution, Solana Virtual Machine, and a Canonical Bridge. The L2 scaling solution will reportedly help the Bitcoin network's transaction mechanics through off-chain aid. With the Solana Virtual Machine, developers are hoping for more DeFi applications to be built on the Bitcoin network, and with a Canonical Bridge, communications will be established between Bitcoin Hyper and Bitcoin. It is the project's simple premise that has allowed it to gain so much momentum, and in presale it has raised close to $2 million already. So, for XRP fans looking for an offbeat crypto with a strong focus on utility, Bitcoin Hyper could be a good investment. Conclusion Ripple's entry into the banking sector could lead to a major shift in the world of crypto. It could signal crypto to become more mainstream, leading to increased participation. Tokens that are still available on presale could take advantage of this situation, surging upon launch. Therefore, this ""best crypto to buy now list"" focuses on cryptocurrency ICOs. Each ICO has its own unique attribute, giving traders the opportunity to diversify their investments. And as crypto goes mainstream, these picks could yield massive gains, both in the short and the long term. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Following the recent rejection at the $110,000 price range, the maiden cryptocurrency failed to break out of a descending consolidatory channel; therefore, fears on the current status of the bull market remain intact. Amidst the current mood of uncertainty, prominent market analyst Ali Martinez has identified two important support levels in the advent of a price downturn. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To ‘Very Bullish’ — What This Means On-Chain Data Reveals Strong Bitcoin Support At $106,500 And $98,500 In an X post on July 5, Ali Martinez shares a potentially impactful on-chain insight on the Bitcoin market. Using data from the In/Out Money Around Price (IOMAP) Chart from Sentora, the analyst shares that major support zones have emerged that could play a crucial role in shaping the BTC’s short-term price direction. The IOMAP chart analyzes Bitcoin wallet addresses and the average prices at which they acquired BTC, giving insights into potential zones of buying or selling pressure. Essentially, it shows where holders are currently in profit i.e. in the money” or at a loss i.e. out of the money. From the chart, it is observed that 1.68 million addresses bought 1.28 million BTC between $104,982 and $108,190, with an average acquisition price of $106,738. Historically, such large concentrations of buying activity tend to form strong support zones, as holders may defend their positions from slipping into loss. Therefore, this development makes the $106,700 range a formidable near-term support level. A second significant support level is identified in the $95,247 to $98,566 range, where 1.7 million addresses acquired 1.25 million BTC at an average price of $96,901. Should Bitcoin lose its footing above $106,000, this lower range would act as the next major cushion, potentially absorbing downward momentum. However, a decisive price close below $96,901 would confirm significant bearish intent by the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap On Track To $4.5 Trillion As Q3 Unfolds – Details Bitcoin Market Overview According to data from the IOMAP chart, around 89.36% of all BTC addresses are “in the money,” meaning their holdings were purchased at a lower price than the current market value. This is generally considered a bullish signal, suggesting the majority of market participants are in profit and thus less pressured to sell. Meanwhile, only 10.36% of addresses are “out of the money,” highlighting the relatively low risk of widespread panic selling, unless Bitcoin were to break below these critical levels highlighted above. At press time, the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade at $108,154 reflecting a 0.24% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, it’s daily trading volume is down by 27.09% and valued at $31.04 billion.

As of press time, TON was trading at $3.02, marking an 11% rally over the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization has also jumped from $6.7 billion to $7.43 billion in just one day, an increase of approximately $730 million. TON one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Beyond the fundamental news, Toncoin’s price chart shows possible signs of a breakout. TON has decisively moved above its seven-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $2.83 and its seven-day exponential moving average at $2.81. Meanwhile, its relative strength index ( RSI ), which had dropped to an oversold level of 38.79, is now rebounding, suggesting room for further upside. Catalyst for Toncoin rally The catalyst behind the surge is Toncoin’s announcement of a first-of-its-kind UAE residency scheme built on blockchain technology. Under the program, investors can secure UAE residency by staking $100,000 in TON for three years through a decentralized smart contract in return for a 10-year UAE Golden Visa. The initiative is designed to lock up a significant supply: if 1,000 participants join, around $100 million worth of TON could be removed from circulation. Additionally, the program offers participants an annual yield of 3–4%, encouraging long-term holding. The visa process is fast-tracked, with approvals typically expected within seven weeks. Unlike traditional programs requiring $500,000 in real estate, this initiative offers a lower entry point and extends residency to the applicant’s immediate family. Staked TON remains under user control and is fully withdrawable after three years, with an annual yield of 3–4%, subject to market conditions. Overall, the UAE–TON partnership aims to attract crypto investors and entrepreneurs seeking more accessible residency options. Meanwhile, this is another initiative that will likely help Toncoin gain mainstream attention. For instance, as reported by Finbold, in late May, TON saw increased momentum after xAI announced a partnership to bring its Grok chatbot to Telegram. Under the one-year deal, Telegram will receive $300 million in cash and equity, as well as 50% of all xAI subscription revenue generated on its platform.

Key Takeaways: Drake compares his love life to Bitcoin’s price swings in his new song What Did I Miss?. His lyrics highlight Bitcoin’s growing presence in mainstream pop culture. Global BTC adoption sits at 4% today, far below forecasts of 10% by 2030. “I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I’m up next week,” the Toronto rapper raps . This isn’t Drake’s first dance with Bitcoin. In 2022, he wagered $1 million worth of BTC on the Super Bowl, a move that grabbed headlines and underscored his willingness to engage with crypto beyond casual name-drops. Drake’s Lyrics Show Bitcoin Breaking Into Pop Culture Drake’s latest verse signals how Bitcoin continues to weave itself into mainstream culture, appearing not just in financial headlines but also in music, television, and art. As Bitcoin references pop up more often in pop culture, some see it as a sign that the digital asset is edging closer to widespread recognition. Historical forecasts from Blockware predicted Bitcoin adoption could reach 10% of the global population by 2030, comparing its trajectory to transformative technologies like electricity and the Internet. However, a recent report from River pegged current adoption at just 4%, showing that while crypto has made strides, there’s still a long road ahead. The report highlighted that adoption tends to be stronger in developed economies, where access to financial infrastructure and regulatory clarity is more robust. Meanwhile, institutional interest has continued to rise. Firms like Strategy and Metaplanet have pivoted to holding Bitcoin as a key treasury asset, aiming to guard against inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. Bitcoin ETFs and other investment products have further opened the door to retail and institutional investors, lowering barriers to exposure by removing the need for self-custody or direct onchain transactions. Bitcoin Adoption Gains Ground With Texas State Reserve Last month, Texas became the first U.S. state to establish a publicly funded Bitcoin reserve, marking a significant step toward mainstreaming digital assets at the state level. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law over the weekend, setting up a standalone Bitcoin fund overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar. Unlike previous attempts in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas’s Bitcoin reserve will operate entirely outside the state treasury, providing legal protections against routine fund reallocations. A companion bill, HB 4488, further secures the fund’s status, ensuring it remains intact regardless of future Bitcoin purchases. State Senator Charles Schwertner, the bill’s sponsor, argued that Texas should consider Bitcoin as it does land and gold, highlighting its performance over the past decade. Texas’s move comes as other states pull back from similar plans. In May, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation , joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. Likewise, Arizona’s House Bill 1025, which had advanced further than any other similar bill nationwide, was vetoed on May 3 by Governor Katie Hobbs. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve .

In his assessment on the social media platform X, Krueger argued that Bitcoin will continue to strengthen with the deflationary pressures that artificial intelligence will create in a low interest rate environment. The following statements stood out in Krueger's statement: “Reducing interest rates to 1% would give the fiat money system a 10-year breath. However, at the end of this period, artificial intelligence will come into play and create a strong deflationary effect. Bitcoin could exceed $400,000 or even $1 million much earlier and easily in this time period.” Related News: Is the Whale Behind the Movement of 8 Billion Dollars Worth of Bitcoin Hacked? It Could Be the Largest Cryptocurrency Theft in History - Coinbase Executive Speaks Out Stating that Bitcoin follows a long-term “power law” curve, Krueger argued that companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets (e.g. MicroStrategy, RIOT, MARA) are in a much stronger position than their competitors. He stated that these companies will gain serious advantages in the coming years thanks to their Bitcoin-focused strategies. For these reasons, Krueger stated that he predicts that many more companies will buy Bitcoin in the next 5 years. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. SHIB and DOGE investors go all-in on XYZVerse, eyeing a bold 1000x return and shaking up the crypto community. Influential cryptocurrency investors, previously known for significant holdings in Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, have completely redirected their portfolio into XYZVerse with eyes set on massive returns. This unexpected shift underscores a strong belief in XYZVerse’s potential, aiming for an extraordinary 1000x gain. The move has caught the crypto community’s attention, leaving many curious about what lies ahead. You might also like: Experts favor XYZVerse over HYPE, ONDO for new investors seeking under-$1 crypto XYZVerse eyes 1,000x ROI for early backers XYZVerse (XYZ), a rising entrant in the memecoin ecosystem, is carving out a distinct niche by aligning crypto culture with the high-adrenaline world of sports. Branded as a token for die-hard fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, the project is not merely capitalizing on meme appeal; it’s positioning itself as a movement for those who treat sports not as entertainment, but as identity. With an ambitious “Greatest of All Time” (G.O.A.T.) narrative at its core, XYZVerse is targeting a legacy far beyond short-lived meme frenzies. That strategy appears to be resonating: the project was recently recognized as the “ Best New Meme Project ,” a signal that its blend of sports fandom and Web3 engagement is striking a chord with the market. XYZVerse has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token; it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. Presale gains set stage for potential breakout The numbers suggest strong traction. The presale, which opened with a $0.0001 listing, has already reached $0.003333, with the next pricing tier set at $0.005 and a final presale target of $0.02. According to project estimates, XYZ will debut on centralized and decentralized exchanges with a listing price of $0.10, implying up to a 1,000x return for those who entered early. Capital inflow supports that narrative. More than $14 million has been raised to date, reflecting significant retail appetite and a growing belief in the token’s upside potential. Early investors, already benefitting from steep discounts, are eyeing major upside as the token moves through its final presale phases. While the memecoin sector remains inherently volatile, XYZVerse’s alignment with a global passion point — sports — gives it cultural gravity that few tokens in its class can claim. As the market braces for the next breakout, XYZ is aiming not just for relevance but for dominance. Dogecoin Source: TradingView Dogecoin has experienced a rollercoaster ride lately. In the past week, its price saw a modest increase of about 4%, fluctuating between $0.1552 and $0.1766. However, over the last month, the coin faced a decline of over 12%. Looking at the bigger picture, the past six months have been tough for Dogecoin, with its value dropping nearly 55%. Analyzing the current data, Dogecoin’s future direction seems uncertain. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 55.07, suggesting the coin isn’t overbought or oversold. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) stands at $0.1729, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $0.1649, indicating a potential short-term upward trend. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level of 0.0023 shows only a slight bullish momentum. Key support and resistance levels are in focus. The nearest support level is at $0.1414. If the price falls below this, it could head toward the second support at $0.1200, representing a decrease of around 15%. On the upside, the nearest resistance is at $0.1842. Breaching this could push the price toward the second resistance level of $0.2056, which would be an increase of approximately 17%. Traders are watching these levels to gauge whether Dogecoin will break out or continue its downward trend. Shiba Inu Source: TradingView Over the past week, Shiba Inu’s price showed a modest increase of 1.89%. However, over the last month, it dropped by more than 10%. The six-month view is even more significant, with a decline of over 50%. Currently, SHIB is trading between $0.00001095 and $0.00001236. The coin’s price is near its 10-day simple moving average of $0.00001200 and slightly above the 100-day average of $0.00001153. The Relative Strength Index stands at 50.34, indicating a neutral market sentiment. The MACD level is slightly positive at 0.0000001129, suggesting minimal upward momentum. For SHIB to gain ground, it needs to break past the nearest resistance level at $0.00001287. If successful, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.00001428, which is about a 15% increase from current levels. On the downside, if the price falls below the nearest support at $0.00001005, it may drop to the second support at $0.000008649, representing a decline of around 20%. Based on this data, the coin’s price could move in either direction, so monitoring these key levels is crucial. Conclusion DOGE and SHIB have been impressive, but XYZVerse offers a unique sports memecoin experience, aiming for 1,000x growth in the 2025 bull run.

Despite 90% ETF approval odds and a Wormhole partnership boosting multichain interoperability, weak trading volume and negative funding rates signal bearish pressure. A breakout above $2.22 could drive a 1.3x rally to $2.70, but failure to hold $2.00 risks a drop to $1.90. While XRP (XRP) struggles to hold its ground after slipping 4.12% last week, seasoned investors are already shifting their focus to a token that’s priced far lower but offers significantly higher upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 5 of its presale at just $0.03, is gaining serious traction as capital begins to rotate from top-heavy large caps into low-cap protocols with real-world use and scalable DeFi infrastructure. With $11.7 million raised, 12,700+ holders onboarded, and 60% of this phase’s allocation already sold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is clearly on the radar of smart capital. Borrow, Lend, and Earn—All in One Protocol What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out will be its dual lending model, allowing users to either lend into stable liquidity pools via the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system or create custom loan agreements directly through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) setups. These features will let users access borrowing or lending functionality across a wide spectrum of assets, including meme coins, stablecoins, and major altcoins. A user who lends $15,000 in USDC through the Mutuum protocol will receive mtUSDC at a 1:1 ratio—mtTokens are yield-bearing assets that increase in value as interest accrues. If the average annual yield hits 15%, that same user will earn $2,250 in passive income by year-end. For borrowers, the process is just as efficient. Someone holding $1,000 worth of ETH can use it as collateral and borrow up to 75% of its value—depending on the assigned loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for ETH—without needing to sell the asset. That means they retain full exposure to any ETH price increases while getting the liquidity they need for other opportunities or expenses. In the P2P segment, lenders and borrowers will be able to negotiate interest rates, loan terms, and repayment durations directly, with no intermediaries involved. This setup is ideal for lesser-known or more volatile assets like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Pepe (PEPE), which wouldn’t qualify for pooled liquidity but are still in high demand for lending. The result is a flexible ecosystem that caters to both conservative and risk-tolerant users—without compromising the protocol’s structural safety. Protocol Revenue, Token Burns, and Real Fundamentals Mutuum Finance (MUTM) separates itself from most early-stage altcoins by building its ecosystem around real economic activity. Every time users borrow, repay loans, or interact with lending pools through smart contracts, they generate protocol fees. These fees will be routed for dividend distributions in MUTM for mtToken stakers by strategic token buybacks from the open market. With its $0.06 listing price already locked in, Phase 5 buyers will automatically see a 2x return by launch. But projections don’t stop there. Based on current growth indicators, platform demand, and the rollout of its beta platform and Layer-2 integration, analysts are forecasting MUTM to reach between $0.12 and $0.18 by Q4 of this year. That’s a 4x to 6x return for those entering before the price jumps to $0.035 in Phase 6. The platform’s roadmap shows clearly defined development stages: beta launch at listing, followed by the release of its overcollateralized stablecoin and its Layer-2 scaling infrastructure. These aren’t just ideas—they are functional upgrades that will improve transaction speeds, cut gas fees, and open the door for broader institutional adoption. And while competitors lean heavily on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) backs its ecosystem with investor protections and third-party oversight. A $50,000 bug bounty with CertiK is live, designed to harden the platform ahead of mainnet rollout. With each step, the project continues to align investor interests with long-term protocol health. With less than half of Phase 5 supply remaining and the $100,000 MUTM giveaway drawing more participants every day, entry at the current $0.03 price is rapidly narrowing. For buyers moving out of stagnant large caps like XRP (XRP), this may be the last sub-$0.05 gem that offers real fundamentals, long-term staking rewards, and true scalability inside a DeFi protocol built to last.

The DXY witnessed a 10.8% drop in the first six months of 2025, the worst since its 14.8% decline in the first half of 1973, back when Richard Nixon was the country’s president, reports Bloomberg. The dollar dumping comes as the US money supply has exploded to a new record high. The latest data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) shows that M2, which tracks the total amount of readily available money circulating in the US financial system, stood at $21.942 trillion as of May 2025, shattering its previous peak of $21.749 trillion recorded in April 2022. Source: FRED As the amount of money surges in the country, JPMorgan’s co-head of global FX strategy, Meera Chandan, says that the second half of the year will likely not be better for the American currency. In a new episode of JPMorgan’s Making Sense podcast, Chandan expects the dollar to perform poorly against other major currencies in the coming months amid Europe’s improving fiscal outlook and America’s rising deficits and national debt. “The outlook is still bearish across the board. I think it’s going to be very hard for us to move the needle here to change our view there. I mean to put specific targets, we’ve got the euro/dollar projected to $1.20 to $1.22, dollar/CNY (Chinese yuan) 7.10 CNY, dollar/yen 140 JPY. So as you can tell, it’s still a pretty bearish view and a broad-based one at that, including for cyclical currencies such as the Aussie dollar, we’re looking for a $0.68. And the reason behind it is very much the same reasons why we turned bearish earlier in the year, which is that the US data is going to moderate, catch down to the rest of the world. You have obviously the European fiscal policy, which has turned more growth-supportive, which is helping fiscal policy outside of the US wherever possible, will turn more growth-supportive. And finally you do have the US structural issues that one does have to assign some discount to, but overall, the view is unchanged and still squarely dollar bearish.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Michael Saylor plans to burn all of his Bitcoin ( BTC ), which means he is burning your lifeboat to safety from inflation, and that helps the few, not many. Saylor’s MicroStrategy plans to increase the number of BTC it holds. The accumulation plan again raises questions about Bitcoin’s scarcity, and the questions that arise when few entities acquire such a large percentage of the supply. You might also like: Cryptocurrency’s best ideas will never launch | Opinion Saylor has said himself that he wants to hold one percent of the overall Bitcoin supply. Surely, he is looking to acquire as many BTC as possible for himself. His plan to burn his entire stash should have raised more eyebrows than it has, while also igniting a fervent debate about the implications for Bitcoin’s overall resilience. Not that it’s any of my business, but I have been thinking lately about all the reasons why Michael Saylor, as a prominent Bitcoin advocate and holder through MicroStrategy, should absolutely not, under any circumstances, destroy his Bitcoin via burning. It is like burning the lifeboats on the Titanic as it sinks Burning Bitcoin refers to the process of taking BTC out of circulation forever by sending them to inaccessible addresses that cannot be accessed or used for transactions. Saylor could use his Bitcoin to further his legacy. He could donate the funds to Bitcoin’s developers, build libraries, hospitals, public squares, and more. His name could appear on public spaces the world over. There are many technical reasons, as well, as to why Saylor should not burn his Bitcoin upon his death, but instead use them to bolster his already impressive legacy and even invest directly into Bitcoin’s future. Many BTC have already been lost permanently, as a result of lost private keys, hardware issues, and so on. It is estimated that roughly 17-23% of all BTC have been lost, including wallets thought to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, untouched since 2011. Lost BTC contributes to the asset’s scarcity. Therefore, Bitcoin is even scarcer than the 21 million hardcoded to exist. Bitcoin is a non-reproducible asset, meaning once they are sent to an irretrievable Bitcoin address, there is no getting them back. You can’t mine more Bitcoin. That’s part of the brilliance of Bitcoin, as has been covered ad nauseum heretofore by the wide-ranging voices of the so-called Bitcoin Community. Bitcoin is about resistance to centralized control, a hedge against inflation, as well as state overreach. Bitcoin is financial emancipation. Burning Bitcoin symbolically undermines the rebellion. There would be less Bitcoin to save people from inflationary hegemony. Fewer lifeboats. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is sacrosanct. It mimics gold’s natural scarcity. Saylor destroying his BTC invites speculation about further burns and damages trust in Bitcoin’s predictable issuance, and introduces arbitrariness. If Saylor were to destroy the Bitcoin, the circulating supply of Bitcoin would be reduced. This would create scarcity that could undermine Bitcoin’s monetary function. Arbitrary supply shocks don’t help Bitcoin’s case for transparency. Burning his Bitcoin erodes confidence. Saylor supports Bitcoin’s legitimacy by preserving his holdings and putting them to good use. By not destroying his Bitcoin, Saylor encourages adoption and reinforces its value, because his adoption of Bitcoin signals that the digital asset enjoys historical acceptance. Saylor holding onto his Bitcoin and then putting them to some productive use in his will inspires others to also hold Bitcoin. Saylor should ensure Bitcoin remains part of the economic order for future generations in line with Satoshi’s vision of sound money. If Saylor preserves his Bitcoin by passing it onto heirs or placing them into a trust, Saylor bolsters Bitcoin as a monetary network. Saylor could use his BTC to support its role as a bulwark against statism and an example of sound money. Burning Bitcoin weakens both Saylor’s legacy and Bitcoin at the same time. Saylor might consider letting his Bitcoin remain in the market through inheritance or charitable allocation—or otherwise—to preserve private property and economic productivity. With that said, they are Saylor’s Bitcoin, and he can do whatever he wants with them, including add them to the millions of bitcoins which have already been lost for good in the history of Bitcoin, making the coming supply crunch all the more likely, and bitcoin less likely help the greatest number of people as possible.
