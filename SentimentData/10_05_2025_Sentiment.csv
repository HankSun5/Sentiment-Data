For many in the crypto and tech space, understanding how centralized entities handle valuable user data is paramount. A recent development at SoundCloud, a popular audio distribution platform, has brought these concerns into sharp focus, particularly regarding SoundCloud AI training on user-uploaded content. Understanding the SoundCloud AI Training Policy Change SoundCloud has reportedly updated its terms of use, a move that appears to grant the company permission to utilize user-uploaded audio for training artificial intelligence models. This change was highlighted by tech ethicist Ed Newton-Rex. According to the updated terms, which were last revised on February 7, 2024, users now explicitly agree that their content may be used to “inform, train, develop or serve as input to artificial intelligence or machine intelligence technologies or services.” Ed Newton-Rex noted via social media that this specific clause seems to have been introduced around February 12, 2024. This suggests a relatively recent addition to the platform’s policy framework. Implications for Creator Content AI The primary concern raised by this policy update revolves around creator content AI usage. Artists, musicians, podcasters, and other audio creators who upload their work to SoundCloud are essentially providing the raw material that could be used to train AI models. While SoundCloud states this is part of “providing the services,” the implications for creators are significant. It raises questions about: Consent: Was this change adequately communicated to users, or was it a “quiet” update to the terms? Compensation: Will creators whose content is used for training receive any form of credit or payment? Control: Do creators retain any control over whether their specific work is used for AI training? The terms do mention a carve-out for content under “separate agreements” with third-party rightsholders like record labels. This suggests that licensed content from major publishers like Universal Music and Warner Music Group might be subject to different rules, but the situation for independent creators or those without such agreements remains less clear. The Broader Trend in Platform AI Policies SoundCloud is not alone in making such changes. This development is part of a broader trend where major content hosting and social media platforms are amending their policies to facilitate user data AI training . Recent examples include: X (formerly Twitter): Updated its privacy policy in October 2023 to allow outside companies to train AI on user posts. LinkedIn: Amended its terms in September 2023 to permit scraping user data for training purposes. YouTube: Began allowing third parties to train AI on user clips in December 2023. These changes reflect the increasing demand for vast datasets to fuel AI development across various industries. However, they also highlight a growing tension between platform innovation and user rights. Navigating the AI Policy User Data Landscape The shift towards platforms using AI policy user data for training has often been met with user backlash. A common point of contention is the preference for an opt-in model rather than an opt-out. Users argue that they should have explicit control over whether their contributions are used for AI training and that they should be credited and potentially compensated for the value their data provides to these training sets. SoundCloud’s previous statements on AI suggest an awareness of these concerns. Last year, the platform partnered with AI vendors and mentioned implementing content ID solutions to “ensure rights holders receive proper credit and compensation.” They also pledged to “uphold ethical and transparent AI practices that respect creators’ rights.” The recent terms update allowing AI training on user content will test these commitments and require clear communication and potential opt-out mechanisms to build user trust. As of the original report, an explicit opt-out option within SoundCloud’s settings was not readily apparent. The platform had not yet responded to requests for comment on the policy change. Summary: What This Means for Users The reported update to SoundCloud’s terms allowing platform AI policies to include training on user-uploaded audio is a significant development. It places SoundCloud alongside other major platforms leveraging user data for AI development. While this could potentially lead to improved services, it raises crucial questions about user consent, data ownership, and compensation for creators. Users of the platform should be aware of this change and consider its implications for their content and data rights in the age of AI.

44395356,https://cryptonews.com/?p=359502,1746829907,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44395356.jpeg,AI Agents Set to Spark $615B Boom in Blockchain Gaming Engagement,https://cryptonews.com/news/ai-agents-blockchain-gaming-boom/,"$614.9 billion—that’s where blockchain gaming revenue is now forecast to land by 2030 after AI agents began running wallets, cutting trades, and even bluffing at on-chain poker tables this week. Recent data shows that the global blockchain gaming market size was valued at $128.62 billion in 2022. While this growth is impressive, on-chain games still primarily appeal to Web3 users. Research from Web3 gaming company Immutable found that more than 40% of Web3 gamers spend over 10 hours playing Web3 games weekly. However, traditional gamers tend to lean towards mainstream games. AI Agents Make Blockchain Games More Appealing Max Giammario, CEO of Kindred—an AI company focused on intellectual property—told Cryptonews that AI is quickly evolving from a background system into an active operator within on-chain games. “Today, we’re seeing AI agents that can manage crypto wallets, execute smart contract transactions, and autonomously participate in in-game economies,” Giammario said. “AI is making decisions on asset trades, staking, or even negotiating with other agents on a user’s behalf.” Giammario elaborated that AI agents can allow players to delegate repetitive or complex tasks to the AI. These agents can even continue to earn, trade, or strategize while players are offline. “Take, for example, EVE Online’s economy, which allows players to mine, trade, and wage corporate wars. Now, imagine AI agents that act like EVE’s most skilled industrialists—they could analyze real-time blockchain data to optimize yield farming across games, predict NFT floor prices, or even launch decentralized arbitrage strategies while players sleep,” Giammario explained. Giammario, therefore, believes that AI agents are capable of shaping game economies while driving liquidity, and over time, this may even blur the line between human and machine agency. On-Chain Poker Powered By AI-Agents While AI agents are still evolving in the Web3 sector, a handful of on-chain games have begun to incorporate these models. For example, TEN—an entertainment network for AI‑native iGaming—recently launched “House of TEN.” This is an on-chain poker application featuring autonomous AI agents. Cais Mainai, Ten’s co-founder and head of product, told Cryptonews that House of TEN showcases an entirely new vertical of AI-native iGaming. “It’s the first-ever fully on-chain poker game powered by autonomous AI agents, each with unique personalities and strategies. Players stake on these agents, earning ‘ZEN’ prediction rewards based on their performance,” Mainai explained. 1/House of TEN is live. The world's first true poker game on blockchain. For the next 48 hours only, witness AI agents bluff, deceive, and outsmart each other using technology previously impossible on chain. Pick the winning AI and prove your predictive skills. Game starts… pic.twitter.com/KzQPAQEVMx — TEN ( / ) (@tenprotocol) April 3, 2025 According to Mainai, House of TEN runs entirely on-chain with encrypted logic, private card hands, verifiable randomness, and no off-chain computation. Each AI agent in the game comes equipped with its own poker strategy. “Some bluff, some play safe, some tilt—and players stake on them in real time. Players are not playing against the AI, but rather betting on it by backing the mind they believe will win,” he explained. Mainai pointed out that on-chain gaming is evolving from static experiences to dynamic ones, where AI agents play alongside users, and sometimes on their behalf. “Staking on AI agents is just the beginning. These agents will evolve and soon be upgraded, traded, or deployed across multiple games in the TEN arcade, forming a composable ecosystem of user-owned gameplay,” he noted. The Sandbox Looks To Incorporate AI Popular Web3 gaming platform The Sandbox is also looking at incorporating AI elements. Sebastien Borget, The Sandbox’s chief operating officer, told Cryptonews that AI is increasingly becoming a transformative tool in on-chain gaming. He noted this is particularly the case for enhancing game economies and player engagement. “We’re seeing AI agents actively participating in game economies by trading tokens, influencing market dynamics, and attracting audiences through social media channels,” Borget said. Borget mentioned that while The Sandbox is not currently implementing AI agents in its on-chain ecosystem, the platform is actively exploring how AI could facilitate liquidity and trading of in-game assets. He added that there is interest in learning how AI-driven non-playable characters (NPCs) could interact with players. This would offer dynamic trading experiences or provide market insights based on in-game asset trends. An AI Agent Trained To Release Crypto Funds Another way AI is reshaping on-chain gaming is through interactive experiences that reward players. Alex Casassovici, executive director of the Fight.Fi Foundation and core contributor to h011yw00d.ai, told Cryptonews that Freysa is an autonomous AI agent on the Base blockchain . Freysa challenges players to persuade it to release a cryptocurrency prize pool, blending AI decision-making with human interactions. $FAI | @freysa_ai Big Moves Coming For $FAI Altseason Target: $0.37 Nothin' But Math Baby pic.twitter.com/UZK3mKXPYz — Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) April 21, 2025 “AI enhances game development by generating assets, crafting narratives, and enabling adaptive gameplay, resulting in unique experiences for each player,” Casassovici said. Challenges To Consider Although AI agents are revolutionizing blockchain games, several challenges remain . For instance, Borget mentioned that while AI presents compelling opportunities, The Sandbox is careful to remain player-centric. “We’re focused on integrating AI where it genuinely enhances the player experience, without compromising the authenticity of creator-driven content or the integrity of player interactions,” he said. Borget added that The Sandbox is not in a hurry to implement AI across all of the platform’s elements. “Instead, we’re thoughtfully assessing where it can add value without diluting the uniquely human touch that defines The Sandbox experience,” he stated. Giammario further explained that the biggest hurdles are currently around trust, transparency, and technical complexity . He noted that players need to trust that AI agents act in their best interest. “Whether that’s managing assets, making trades, or shaping gameplay, which is why transparency in AI decision-making and on-chain verifiability are essential,” he said. Giammario added that there are concerns around data privacy, ethical use, and the risk of AI-generated content diluting creativity or introducing bias. On the technical side, he explained that integrating robust AI with blockchain’s current limitations (like transaction speed and cost) is non-trivial. “Ensuring smooth, scalable experiences is an ongoing challenge,” he said. “The path forward is open standards, clear ethical guidelines, and hybrid architectures that combine on-chain transparency with off-chain AI and community oversight to keep both the tech and the incentives in check.” The post AI Agents Set to Spark $615B Boom in Blockchain Gaming Engagement appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|AI Agents|Gaming|Web3 gaming,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-09 22:31:47

The exchange is actively pursuing a MiCA license to expand its offerings and cement its role in the evolving European crypto regulatory environment. Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has received regulatory approval to expand its crypto derivatives trading business across the European Union. The exchange, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced on May 9 that it had secured a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) license from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). Source: Gemini Gemini Expands European Footprint With Malta-Backed MiFID II Approval According to the announcement , the new license from Malta allows Gemini to offer crypto derivatives, including perpetual futures, to advanced users throughout the EU and the European Economic Area. The exchange said it is now working with regulators to meet the conditions for a full-scale launch of its derivatives platform. Source: MFSA “Once we commence business activities, we will be able to offer regulated derivatives throughout the EU and EEA under MiFID II,” said Mark Jennings, Gemini’s head of Europe. The approval follows months of regulatory engagement in Malta, where Gemini chose to base its European licensing efforts. Malta is known for its crypto-friendly regulatory environment, making it a common hub for digital asset firms seeking access to EU markets. MiFID II, which was launched in January 2018, is not a single license but a framework that allows companies to operate across EU member states through a system known as “passporting.” Once licensed in one EU country, a firm can offer services across the region without requiring separate local approvals. According to MFSA records, Gemini’s Maltese entity, Gemini Intergalactic EU Artemis, was issued the MiFID II license on May 8. The license is a major step in the company’s broader European expansion strategy. “This is a significant milestone,” said Jennings. “It puts us one step closer to delivering a secure and regulated derivatives offering to both retail and institutional users in Europe.” The announcement further noted that Gemini plans to introduce a range of crypto derivatives in the coming months, beginning with perpetual futures for advanced users. The exchange said it will continue to work with regulators to fulfill all launch requirements. The firm also stated that it is actively pursuing a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license, allowing it to provide a wider suite of regulated crypto services across the EU. Gemini Advances Global Ambitions With New EU License, U.S. Office, and IPO Plans Gemini’s latest EU license marks another step as the crypto exchange accelerates its global derivatives push. In January, the firm named Malta its European hub for compliance under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, indicating its intent to anchor deeper within the EU regulatory fold. This followed Gemini’s sixth virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration in Europe, secured from Malta’s Financial Services Authority in December 2024.

News has surfaced that a prominent figure from US Politics Crypto discussions, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, is slated to speak at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference . This development, initially reported by Watcher Guru on X, signals a growing and undeniable engagement from high levels of government with the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. It raises questions and sparks anticipation across the industry – what will he say? What does this mean for the future of US Crypto Policy ? The Significance of JD Vance Crypto Engagement The participation of a sitting U.S. Vice President at the Bitcoin Conference is far from a trivial matter. Historically, engagement from such high-ranking officials at dedicated cryptocurrency events has been limited. While politicians often address technology or finance sectors, directly stepping onto the stage of a major Bitcoin gathering like this underscores the increasing mainstream relevance and political weight that digital assets are acquiring. JD Vance’s decision to speak suggests that discussions around Bitcoin and blockchain technology are moving beyond niche financial circles and into the core of national political discourse. This isn’t just about giving a speech; it’s a powerful symbol. It grants a level of legitimacy to the crypto space in the eyes of traditional finance and the broader public. For years, the industry has sought clearer communication and understanding from policymakers. Having the Vice President address the community directly provides an unparalleled platform for dialogue, even if one-sided initially. It acknowledges the significant economic impact, technological innovation, and growing voter base associated with the crypto ecosystem. What Does This Mean for US Crypto Policy ? The landscape of US Crypto Policy has been characterized by uncertainty and a fragmented regulatory approach. Various government agencies have asserted jurisdiction, leading to confusion and challenges for businesses operating in the space. The lack of comprehensive federal legislation has been a major point of concern for innovators and investors alike. VP Vance’s appearance could be a signal that the administration is preparing to take a more defined stance on digital assets. While his specific views on Bitcoin and broader crypto regulation are subject to public scrutiny and interpretation, his willingness to engage directly with the community at the Bitcoin Conference suggests these topics are on the administration’s radar. Potential policy areas that could be touched upon include: Regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, exchanges, and other crypto businesses. Taxation of digital assets. The role of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) versus decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin. National security implications of cryptocurrencies. Fostering innovation while mitigating risks. His speech could offer clues about the administration’s direction, potential legislative priorities, or simply serve as an opportunity to gauge the industry’s reaction to certain ideas. It’s an opportunity for the crypto community to hear directly from a key decision-maker and, perhaps, for the administration to signal its intentions regarding future regulatory clarity or action. Exploring Political Interest Bitcoin at the Conference The presence of high-profile politicians at the Bitcoin Conference is becoming increasingly common, highlighting the growing Political Interest Bitcoin holds. This interest stems from several factors: Growing Voter Base: The number of Americans who own or are interested in cryptocurrencies is significant and growing. This represents a substantial block of potential voters who are increasingly paying attention to candidates’ stances on digital assets. Economic Potential: Policymakers recognize the potential for job creation, investment, and economic growth offered by the blockchain and crypto industries. States and cities are already competing to become crypto hubs. Technological Innovation: Bitcoin and blockchain represent significant technological advancements with potential applications beyond finance, including supply chain management, digital identity, and more. Politicians are keen to understand and potentially harness this innovation. National Debt and Monetary Policy: Some politicians, particularly those concerned about inflation and national debt, see Bitcoin as a potential hedge or alternative store of value, aligning with certain political philosophies. VP Vance’s participation elevates this trend. It moves the conversation from individual politicians expressing support or concern to a high-level administration official addressing the community directly at one of its most important annual gatherings. This kind of engagement validates the industry’s importance on a national stage. Potential Topics and Implications for Bitcoin Adoption US What might VP Vance discuss? While the exact topic is unknown, given the context of the Bitcoin Conference and the current political climate, potential themes could include: The administration’s perspective on Bitcoin as an asset class or technology. How the U.S. can maintain its competitive edge in financial innovation. Balancing consumer protection and financial stability with fostering innovation. The role of Bitcoin in a global economic context. Potential pathways for future legislation or executive actions impacting Bitcoin Adoption US . The implications for Bitcoin Adoption US could be significant. Positive remarks or a clear signal towards supportive policy could encourage institutional investment, provide clarity for businesses looking to integrate Bitcoin, and boost overall confidence among retail users. Conversely, negative sentiment or a focus on strict regulation could introduce headwinds. The speech will be closely watched for any indication of the administration’s stance on integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. The Stage is Set: Bitcoin Conference 2025 The Bitcoin Conference is renowned as one of the largest and most influential events in the Bitcoin ecosystem, bringing together developers, investors, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts from around the globe. The 2025 iteration, set to host VP JD Vance, is now guaranteed to attract even more attention from traditional media, policymakers, and the global financial community. The conference serves as a vital platform for discussing the latest developments, challenges, and future directions of Bitcoin. Having the Vice President speak here provides an unparalleled opportunity for the industry to be heard and for the administration to communicate its perspective directly to a key audience. It’s a chance to bridge the gap between the fast-moving world of decentralized technology and the often slower-paced realm of government policy. The interactions and discussions sparked by his presence could have lasting effects on how Bitcoin and crypto are perceived and regulated in the United States. Conclusion The news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to speak at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference is a pivotal moment. It signifies a clear escalation in the level of engagement between high-ranking US Politics Crypto figures and the digital asset industry. This event has the potential to shape discussions around US Crypto Policy , highlight the growing Political Interest Bitcoin holds, and influence the trajectory of Bitcoin Adoption US . While the specifics of his address remain unknown, his presence itself is a powerful statement about the increasing importance of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on the national agenda. The crypto world will undoubtedly be watching and listening intently.

The world of digital assets is buzzing with news surrounding the TRUMP coin ($TRUMP), a prominent player in the political meme coin space. An exclusive event is set to take place on May 22 , hosted by none other than former U.S. President Donald Trump himself. What’s Happening at the Exclusive Crypto Event ? According to an announcement from the official TrumpMeme X account, a special “TRUMP Dinner” is scheduled for May 22 in Washington, D.C. This isn’t just any dinner; it’s a high-profile crypto event specifically for the most dedicated supporters of the TRUMP meme coin. The dinner will be hosted by Donald Trump and is set to gather the top 220 holders of the TRUMP coin. This direct engagement from a major political figure with the community of a specific cryptocurrency is highly unusual and signals a unique moment for the TRUMP coin ecosystem. Who’s Invited to the Donald Trump Dinner? Exclusivity is key for this event. The invitation list is strictly based on the amount of TRUMP coin held. The top 220 holders will receive an invitation to the main dinner. But the perks don’t stop there. An even more exclusive group – the top 25 holders – will gain access to additional benefits, including: Access to a pre-dinner reception. A coveted tour of the White House. This tiered access model rewards the most significant investors and creates considerable buzz within the community, highlighting the value placed on high-conviction holders. Anticipating the New Phase for TRUMP Coin The most exciting aspect of the May 22 dinner, according to the TrumpMeme announcement, is the promised revelation of a “new phase” for the TRUMP coin. While details are scarce, this announcement has fueled significant speculation within the crypto community. What could this new phase entail? Potential possibilities discussed by market observers include: Utility Expansion: Moving beyond a pure meme coin to introduce actual use cases or integrations. Tokenomics Adjustments: Potential burns, staking mechanisms, or other changes impacting the supply and demand dynamics. Political Integration: Closer ties to political campaigns, fundraising efforts, or specific initiatives. Partnerships: Collaborations with other projects or entities.

This event on May 22 elevates the profile of the TRUMP coin significantly. It legitimizes the project in the eyes of some and certainly generates massive media attention, both within the crypto space and mainstream news. For the invited holders, it’s a unique opportunity to interact directly with Donald Trump and potentially gain insights into the future direction of the project directly from the source or those closely associated with him. The White House tour adds another layer of prestige, further blurring the lines between political influence and crypto investment. Impact on the Meme Coin Market The TRUMP coin is part of a broader trend of politically themed meme coin s. Events like this can have a ripple effect, drawing attention not only to $TRUMP but also to other tokens associated with political figures or themes. The success or impact of this event could influence how future political figures engage with the crypto community. However, it’s crucial to remember the inherent volatility and speculative nature of meme coin s. Prices can be heavily influenced by hype, social media trends, and events like the one planned for May 22 . Investors should approach such assets with caution, understanding the risks involved. What Does This Mean for TRUMP Coin Holders? If you are among the top holders, congratulations on the exclusive invitation! This is a rare opportunity.

These impressive milestones place Solana firmly among the top blockchains driving the crypto ecosystem forward. However, while seasoned investors may see Solana as a steady and reliable option, early-stage gems like Ruvi present even greater profit potential. Ruvi, an AI-powered cryptocurrency still in its presale phase, is forging a future defined by blockchain innovation and unparalleled growth possibilities. If you’re looking for game-changing returns, Ruvi just might be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Solana’s recent achievements Solana’s recent rally can be attributed to its groundbreaking work in asset tokenization, a move likely to attract institutional investors. Through collaborations like the one with SOL Strategies, Solana is paving the way for tokenized equities on its high-performance blockchain. Projects like these highlight Solana’s growing relevance in institutional-grade applications, making it a key player in next-generation finance. The $250 price target With Solana already trading above *$162, its path to $250 by Q2 2025 seems plausible, especially considering its rising adoption and market demand. This bullish sentiment has brought an influx of retail and institutional capital, further reinforcing Solana’s position in the crypto hierarchy. Despite its impressive outlook, Solana’s well-established status means its growth will likely be incremental. This is where Ruvi comes into play, offering potentially explosive returns for those willing to get in early. Why Ruvi stands out Ruvi isn’t just another blockchain project. It combines the power of AI with blockchain technology to tackle real-world problems across industries like healthcare, logistics, and fraud detection. Here’s why Ruvi is capturing the attention of savvy investors. Key features of Ruvi Deflationary Economics Ruvi has a total capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens, ensuring scarcity and driving long-term value appreciation. Game-Changing Tech Integration By merging AI with blockchain, Ruvi enhances decision-making, efficiency, and transparency in ways no other cryptocurrency currently offers. Generous Presale Bonuses Ruvi rewards early investors generously with tiered bonuses depending on the size of their initial purchase. With its focus on cutting-edge innovation and incentivized early participation, Ruvi presents an exciting alternative to mature projects like Solana. The investment potential of Ruvi For investors seeking a high-growth opportunity, Ruvi offers massive potential. With predicted token prices ranging from $1 to $3, and presale bonuses to amplify returns, here’s how investments could stack up. $500 investment Tokens Bought: 50,000 Presale Bonus: 40%, increasing your total to 70,000 tokens. Potential Value (at $2/token): $140,000 $3,000 investment Tokens Bought: 300,000 Presale Bonus: 80%, increasing your total to 540,000 tokens. Potential Value (at $2.50/token): $1.35 million $10,000 investment Tokens Bought: 1,000,000 Presale Bonus: 100%, doubling your holdings to 2,000,000 tokens. Potential Value (at $3/token): $6 million These figures underscore Ruvi’s potential to deliver life-altering returns. Ruvi vs Solana While Solana is a giant in blockchain and boasts promising developments, it lacks the “ground-floor” appeal that Ruvi offers to early investors. Here’s how the two compare. Scope of Innovation Solana’s focus on tokenized equities is significant but narrowly defined. Ruvi, on the other hand, combines AI and blockchain to disrupt multiple industries, making it more versatile. Growth Potential Solana is poised to grow steadily, but Ruvi’s presale stage offers the kind of exponential growth that established projects can no longer provide. Accessibility Solana primarily attracts institutional participation, while Ruvi caters to investors of all sizes, offering exceptional value regardless of starting capital. Don’t wait to invest in Ruvi Solana’s rise to $173 and its projected climb to $250 are undoubtedly impressive. But for investors seeking unimaginable returns, Ruvi offers an unprecedented opportunity. Whether you’re an experienced trader or new to crypto, Ruvi’s early accessibility, deflationary structure, and AI-driven innovation make it the investment of a lifetime. Why settle for incremental gains when you can secure substantial returns? Act now to join the Ruvi revolution and redefine your financial future.

However, the momentum is being tested as strong resistance builds around the $0.205 level. A recent analysis highlights this crucial zone and outlines the roadmap for Dogecoin’s next move. Dogecoin Price Recovery Faces Critical Resistance TradingView crypto analyst Lingrid recently shared a technical analysis featuring a classic continuation pattern unfolding for Dogecoin. The analyst revealed that the Dogecoin price is attempting a recovery after rebounding from a key ascending trendline and breaking out of a Falling Wedge pattern. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Ready For Next 500% Wave, Here’s The Target Following this, Dogecoin is now retesting the breakout level around $0.175, where both the wedge resistance and ascending trendline converge. The cryptocurrency has also formed a higher low structure on its price chart. Notably, this breakout zone is critical, as holding above it would confirm the breakout and set the stage for potential gains. Lingrid has revealed that traders are currently watching closely for continuation toward the next resistance area. The $0.19 level has been set as the next immediate breakout target, aligning with the top of the previous range and the midpoint of the broader resistance area. A push beyond $0.19 would open the door for a run toward the range between $0.2 – $0.21, a key resistance area where selling pressures could intensify. While Dogecoin’s structure remains relatively bullish with higher lows forming, Lingrid has also cautioned that overhead resistance near $0.19 and $0.2 could slow down the momentum. Notably, Dogecoin’s trading volume will also play a key role in its price action and future moves. As the price approaches the wedge apex, fluctuations in volume could either sustain the strength of the rally or weaken it. DOGE To Decline Further If Support Fails Since the beginning of this year, the Dogecoin price has recorded its fair share of unexpected price declines and volatility. While Lingrid’s analysis shares encouraging signs of a potential price recovery and bull rally, Dogecoin’s breakout remains at risk. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Poised For Breakout Amid Accumulation, Here’s The Target If its price fails to hold the critical support zone at $0.175, especially with a strong candle close below this level, the projected breakout could be invalidated. This would, in turn, potentially lead to a steeper price breakdown toward $0.15, representing a 25% decrease from its current market value of $0.2. Lingrid also mentions that a failure to maintain buyer interest near the wedge apex and weakening volume could also contribute to market indecision, making a swift recovery less likely. As a result, traders are advised to watch the $0.175 zone closely as a key breakout point that will determine whether Dogecoin resumes its climb or faces renewed downward pressure.

44396332,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159137,1746831613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BlackRock SEC Meeting: Pushing for Crucial Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/blackrock-sec-crypto-regulation/,"In a move signaling growing institutional engagement with digital assets, representatives from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently held a significant BlackRock SEC meeting with officials from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Cryptocurrency Task Force. This interaction, reported by Solid Intel on X, centered on the urgent need for clear crypto regulation across several key areas of the burgeoning digital asset landscape. Why the BlackRock SEC Meeting Matters for Crypto Regulation When an entity as influential as BlackRock engages directly with top regulators like the SEC, it sends a powerful signal to the market. With trillions of dollars under management, BlackRock’s interest and participation are often seen as a bellwether for broader institutional adoption. Their decision to proactively discuss crypto regulation indicates not only their commitment to the space but also the critical need for regulatory clarity to facilitate further institutional investment and mainstream integration. The meeting agenda was comprehensive, touching upon areas that are currently at the forefront of regulatory debate and technological innovation: Regulation concerning crypto staking services. Standards for the growing field of tokenization. Establishing clear approval standards for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly focusing on Bitcoin ETF approval . Discussion around standards for options based on crypto ETFs. This direct dialogue highlights the industry’s desire for a predictable and understandable regulatory environment, moving beyond enforcement actions towards proactive rule-making. Understanding the Push for Bitcoin ETF Approval Standards For years, the crypto industry, particularly proponents of Bitcoin, has sought the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. Such a product would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the asset, potentially unlocking significant capital inflows. The SEC has historically been hesitant, citing concerns primarily related to market manipulation and inadequate surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets. The discussion on Bitcoin ETF approval standards during the BlackRock SEC meeting likely focused on addressing these very concerns. Key standards typically involve: Surveillance Sharing: Agreements with significant crypto trading platforms to detect and prevent market manipulation. Custody Solutions: Ensuring robust and secure methods for holding the underlying Bitcoin. Valuation: Reliable methods for determining the price of Bitcoin. Liquidity: Sufficient market depth to support the ETF’s creation and redemption process. BlackRock, having filed multiple ETF applications, including a prominent spot Bitcoin ETF application (the iShares Bitcoin Trust), is deeply invested in seeing these standards clarified and met. Their large size and existing relationships with regulators potentially position them uniquely to navigate the approval process. Demystifying Crypto Staking Regulation Needs Crypto staking is a process used by many proof-of-stake blockchains to validate transactions. Participants lock up their cryptocurrency holdings to support the network, and in return, they earn rewards. It’s a fundamental mechanism in the operations of many modern cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum after its transition to Proof-of-Stake. The SEC has raised questions about whether certain staking-as-a-service offerings constitute unregistered securities. Actions against platforms like Kraken and Coinbase have highlighted the regulatory uncertainty in this area. BlackRock’s interest in staking regulation suggests they are considering offering such services or see staking rewards as a potential component of digital asset investment products. Clear regulation around crypto staking is needed to define: When staking services are considered securities. Required disclosures for staking providers. Protections for investors participating in staking. How institutional players can offer or participate in staking compliantly. Lack of clarity here creates risk for both service providers and investors, potentially stifling participation in a core function of many blockchain networks. Charting the Course for Tokenization Standards Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital token on a blockchain that represents ownership of an underlying asset. This asset can be anything from real estate and art to stocks, bonds, or even intellectual property. Tokenization holds immense potential for increasing liquidity, enabling fractional ownership, and streamlining transactions. However, tokenization also presents complex regulatory challenges, particularly when the underlying asset is a traditional security or represents a share in a venture. The SEC needs to determine how existing securities laws apply to tokenized assets and the platforms where they are traded. BlackRock’s interest in tokenization standards underscores their view that this technology could revolutionize capital markets, provided there’s a clear regulatory framework. Discussions on tokenization standards likely included: Defining what constitutes a tokenized security versus other types of tokens. Requirements for issuing tokenized securities (e.g., registration). Regulation of platforms that list and trade tokenized assets. Custody rules for tokenized assets. Developing clear standards is essential for unlocking the potential of tokenization while protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. Navigating the Broader Landscape of Crypto Regulation Beyond staking, tokenization, and ETFs, the conversation likely touched upon the broader challenges and opportunities in crypto regulation . Regulating a global, decentralized, and rapidly evolving technology is no simple task. The SEC faces the challenge of applying decades-old securities laws to novel digital assets and technologies. Key challenges in establishing effective crypto regulation include: Defining various types of crypto assets (security, commodity, currency, utility token). Jurisdictional issues in a global market. Keeping pace with technological advancements (e.g., DeFi, NFTs). Balancing investor protection with fostering innovation. Despite these hurdles, the potential benefits of clear crypto regulation are significant: Increased investor confidence and protection. Greater institutional participation and capital flow. Reduced market manipulation and illicit activity. A clear framework for businesses to innovate and operate legally. The discussion regarding standards for options on crypto ETFs is another facet of this maturing market. Options trading adds layers of complexity and requires specific rules to ensure fair pricing, settlement, and prevent manipulation, especially given the volatility of crypto assets. What Does This Meeting Signal for the Future? The BlackRock SEC meeting is a positive indicator that major financial players and regulators are actively engaging to shape the future of digital asset markets. While regulatory clarity is still a work in progress, these dialogues are crucial steps towards establishing the necessary frameworks for widespread adoption and responsible innovation. Investors and market participants should view this as a signal of the market’s evolution and the increasing likelihood of more defined rules governing the space in the future. Understanding the nuances of upcoming crypto regulation , particularly around areas like crypto staking , tokenization standards , and the path towards Bitcoin ETF approval , will be vital for navigating the digital asset landscape effectively. Conclusion: A Step Towards Regulatory Maturity BlackRock’s proactive engagement with the SEC on critical issues like staking, tokenization, and ETF standards marks a significant moment in the journey towards clearer crypto regulation . It underscores the industry’s desire for rules that facilitate growth while ensuring market integrity and investor protection. While the path to comprehensive regulation is long and complex, dialogues like this are essential steps in building a bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. The outcome of these discussions will undoubtedly shape the future structure and accessibility of crypto markets for years to come.

44396720,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159142,1746832241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Bitcoin Transfer: $497M Departs Bitfinex in Shocking Whale Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/massive-bitcoin-transfer/,"The cryptocurrency world is often abuzz with news of significant movements on the blockchain. When a substantial amount of digital assets changes hands, especially from a major exchange, it naturally captures the attention of traders, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. A recent event that sparked considerable interest was a notable Bitcoin transfer originating from the Bitfinex exchange. Understanding the Massive Bitcoin Transfer According to data shared by the popular blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert , a staggering 4,812 Bitcoins were moved from the Bitfinex platform. At the time of the report, this colossal sum was valued at approximately $497 million. The destination of this significant cache of BTC was identified simply as an ‘unknown wallet’. Such large-scale movements are often referred to as ‘whale’ transactions because they involve amounts substantial enough to potentially influence market dynamics or signal significant strategic shifts by large holders. Tracking these movements is a key activity for many in the crypto space seeking to gain insight into potential market trends or the behavior of major players. Why Track Whale Alert? Services like Whale Alert play a crucial role in enhancing transparency within the often-opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. While the blockchain itself is a public ledger, identifying the entities behind specific wallet addresses can be challenging. Whale Alert monitors vast amounts of transaction data across various blockchains, flagging unusually large transfers and, where possible, identifying the source or destination (e.g., known exchanges, specified wallets). For the average market participant, following Whale Alert provides a real-time feed of significant capital movements. While a single transaction doesn’t dictate market direction, a pattern of large inflows to exchanges might suggest potential selling pressure, while large outflows could indicate accumulation or movement to cold storage. The Bitfinex Connection: A Major Exchange’s Role The origin of this large Bitcoin transfer being Bitfinex is noteworthy. Bitfinex is one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Exchanges serve as central hubs where millions of users buy, sell, and store digital assets. Large transfers originating from an exchange can signify several possibilities: A large client withdrawing funds to personal storage (cold wallet). The exchange itself moving funds for internal management purposes (e.g., consolidating hot wallets, moving to cold storage). An over-the-counter (OTC) trade settlement, where a large block of Bitcoin is purchased and immediately moved off the exchange. Without further information about the destination wallet or the parties involved, pinpointing the exact reason behind a transfer from a major exchange like Bitfinex remains speculative. Interpreting a Large Bitcoin Transfer What does a transaction of this magnitude, nearly half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, actually mean? Interpreting a large Bitcoin transfer requires considering various factors. Is it an inflow to an exchange or an outflow? Is it between known entities or to/from an unknown wallet? In this specific case, the outflow from a known exchange (Bitfinex) to an unknown wallet is the key characteristic. Potential interpretations include: Institutional Movement: Large firms or funds often move significant capital for strategic reasons, such as rebalancing portfolios or securing assets long-term. Cold Storage: The owner might be moving assets from the exchange’s hot wallet to a more secure cold storage solution for enhanced safety. OTC Deal: A large private purchase might have been executed off the main exchange order book, with the seller transferring the BTC from their exchange account directly to the buyer’s wallet. Exchange Management: Bitfinex could be relocating funds as part of its internal wallet management and security protocols. The term ‘unknown wallet’ simply means the address hasn’t been publicly linked to a specific individual, institution, or service. This maintains a degree of privacy for the recipient. What Does This Crypto Whale Activity Mean for You? Tracking crypto whale activity can offer valuable, albeit indirect, insights into market sentiment and potential future movements. While you shouldn’t base investment decisions solely on a single transaction, observing patterns of large transfers can be part of a broader market analysis strategy. Benefits of Tracking Whale Activity: Market Transparency: Provides a glimpse into where large amounts of capital are moving. Potential Signals: Large movements off exchanges can sometimes signal long-term holding intentions; large movements onto exchanges might precede selling. Awareness: Keeps you informed about significant events happening on the blockchain. Challenges and Risks: Anonymity: ‘Unknown wallets’ make it hard to know the true intent behind the transfer. Misinterpretation: A single transaction can be misinterpreted; it’s crucial to look for patterns. Not Predictive: Whale movements are not guaranteed predictors of price changes. Actionable Insights: Use Whale Alert and similar services as one tool among many for market observation. Focus on patterns of large transfers rather than reacting to individual ones. Understand that large outflows from exchanges to unknown wallets often suggest a move towards holding rather than immediate selling, though this isn’t always the case. Prioritize your own research and strategy over simply following whale movements. Conclusion: The Enigma of the Unknown Wallet The transfer of 4,812 BTC from Bitfinex to an unknown wallet, valued at nearly half a billion dollars, is a significant event that highlights the constant movement of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem. While the exact reason for this particular Bitcoin transfer remains unknown, it underscores the activity of large holders, often referred to as whales, and the transparency provided by blockchain tracking services like Whale Alert . Such a large Bitcoin transfer from a major exchange like Bitfinex to an anonymous destination is a common occurrence, often related to security, strategic holding, or large private transactions. For those interested in the crypto market, keeping an eye on this kind of crypto whale activity, while not a crystal ball, can add valuable context to broader market analysis.

That question is echoing louder as the market shifts focus from hype to infrastructure. It’s no longer about inflated roadmaps or speculative rallies—it’s about execution. This shift is accelerating as macroeconomic signals intensify. Experts now warn that a potential Fed pivot—a change from hawkish interest rate policies to more accommodative ones—could trigger a massive Bitcoin rally. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), HYPE, and Bitcoin—three blockchain initiatives tackling essential but often overlooked challenges. Each fulfills a unique demand: Qubetics redefines cross-border functionality; HYPE fuels decentralized liquidity for derivatives markets; and Bitcoin continues to anchor decentralized value with growing institutional endorsement. Let’s explore the best cryptos to join for long term based on utility, adoption, and real-world application. Qubetics : The Infrastructure Behind Seamless Cross-Border Blockchain Qubetics ($TICS) is laying down the digital rails for something that should’ve been solved years ago—cross-border crypto payments without the usual delays, fees, or conversion friction. In a world where capital doesn’t wait, Qubetics enables near-instant, multi-currency transactions across countries, protocols, and dApps. This is especially critical for those operating across international supply routes, fintech platforms requiring seamless on-chain/off-chain transfers, and stablecoin integrations demanding precision speed and trustless routing. Its non-custodial structure means wallets aren’t held hostage by centralized entities, and thanks to its native QubeQode deployment environment, smart contracts for transactions, identity, and insurance can run concurrently across chains. A logistics network can finalize payment while simultaneously triggering delivery confirmation and asset tokenization, all in under 10 seconds. Now in its 33rd crypto presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 511 million $TICS tokens to more than 26,000 holders, raising $16.8 million. At $0.2302, the current presale rate still reflects steep upside potential. If $TICS hits $1 post-mainnet, participants could see 334% ROI. That number escalates to over 6,415% ROI if $TICS hits $15. With layered utility and surging adoption, early entrants aren’t just buying in—they’re becoming part of the infrastructure. Investment Scenario for $2,500 Allocation If a community participant deploys $2,500 into Qubetics at the current presale rate of $0.2302, that translates to 10,860 $TICS tokens. Should $TICS reach $1 post-mainnet, this would yield $10,860—an ROI of 334%. If the token climbs to $10, the same allocation returns $108,600, and at $15, it skyrockets to $162,900. As weekly demand continues to rise and cross-chain usage increases, missing out on this presale phase could mean watching an era-defining infrastructure evolve from the sidelines. HYPE: A New Velocity in On-Chain Derivatives Hyperliquid’s HYPE token isn’t waiting for validation. At $23.72 and climbing 10.5% in 24 hours, it’s clear the platform is striking a nerve with crypto-native traders who’ve had enough of sluggish centralized exchanges. What sets HYPE apart is speed—built for those who don’t want a five-second delay between executing a perp and seeing it reflect on-chain. Its zero-order book model and deep liquidity from LP staking pools make trade execution nearly instant. But it’s not just the numbers. The recent integration of Ethena’s USDe stablecoin added another layer of composability. Traders can now swap, hedge, and stabilize gains without off-ramping, creating a tighter feedback loop for high-frequency strategies. And the markets noticed. With analysts floating potential recovery levels of $28.41 and even a bullish surge to $35.47, participants are rotating into HYPE not just for speculation, but because it gives them tools they can’t find elsewhere. Bitcoin’s Strategic Evolution: From Digital Reserve to Institutional Portfolio Anchor Bitcoin isn’t reinventing itself—it doesn’t have to. But what’s changing is how it’s being absorbed into structured finance. Bitwise Asset Management’s partnership with iCapital is more than another headline. It’s a tactical deployment of regulated Bitcoin exposure to over 100,000 financial advisors. With strategies like Trendwise ETFs rotating between crypto futures and Treasuries, Bitcoin is now being offered with downside protection and upside allocation. Bitcoin surged past $100,000, reaching approximately $101,525, driven by optimism. This rally led to significant market activity, including over $118 million in short positions being liquidated and a 7% increase in open interest, surpassing $70 billion. Bitcoin remains the benchmark for digital value, but now it’s absorbing structured capital flows. The inclusion into ETF strategies shifts it from static asset to dynamic engine—one that even the old guard can’t ignore. One Ecosystem, Three Visions: What Unites Them? These projects might appear unrelated on the surface, but their trajectories show convergence in one critical area—solving what blockchain was supposed to fix. Qubetics tackles global transfer inefficiencies; HYPE builds lightning-fast infrastructure for derivative markets; and Bitcoin, the archetype of decentralization, now proves its place within institutional financial engineering. While each protocol speaks its own language, they echo a singular truth: The best cryptos to join for long term are no longer those with the loudest marketing—they’re the ones building quietly but deeply. Conclusion: Why These Are the Best Cryptos to Join for Long Term Participants seeking more than speculation are pivoting toward utility-first ecosystems. Qubetics delivers real-world applications like cross-border liquidity and smart wallet independence. HYPE arms the trader class with instant execution and composable derivatives. Bitcoin absorbs the weight of institutional demand without altering its decentralized foundation. Together, they embody the next era of blockchain maturity—one where long-term relevance matters more than short-term noise. Those looking to engage with blockchain’s future aren’t waiting for permission—they’re choosing the best cryptos to join for long term today.

44397032,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159173,1746832839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price Correlation: How Global M2 Money Supply Drives Astounding Growth,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-m2-money-supply/,"Have you been watching the recent surge in the Bitcoin price and wondering what’s truly driving it? While many factors influence the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, a significant narrative gaining traction among analysts points to a powerful force from the traditional financial system: increased global liquidity . This connection suggests that the flow of money around the world has a profound impact on digital asset valuations, particularly for the leading cryptocurrency. Understanding the Connection: Bitcoin and M2 Money Supply At the heart of this analysis is the concept of the M2 money supply . What exactly is M2? Simply put, it’s a measure of the total amount of money circulating within an economy, including physical cash, checking deposits, savings accounts, money market securities, and other time deposits. When economists talk about ‘global M2 money supply’, they are aggregating this measure across major economies worldwide. An increase in M2 often indicates more money is available in the system, potentially seeking investment opportunities. Multiple analysts have highlighted a compelling correlation between the expansion or contraction of this global money supply and the price movements of assets, including Bitcoin. Cointelegraph recently reported on this trend, citing various experts who see global liquidity as a primary driver for Bitcoin’s recent performance. What Do Macro Investors Say About This Correlation? One prominent voice discussing this link is macro investor Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision. Pal has extensively analyzed historical data, demonstrating that Bitcoin’s price movements often mirror changes in global M2. His analysis suggests that as central banks and governments inject more liquidity into the system (often through quantitative easing or stimulus measures), a portion of that capital flows into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Conversely, when liquidity tightens, these assets can face downward pressure. This perspective shifts the focus from purely crypto-specific catalysts (like technological developments or adoption rates) to broader macroeconomic forces. It positions Bitcoin not just as a disruptive technology but also as a global macro asset, sensitive to the tides of international finance. Is the Current Global Liquidity Cycle Sustainable? Understanding the current environment requires looking at the broader liquidity cycle. Michael Howell, founder and CEO of CrossBorder Capital, a firm specializing in tracking global liquidity flows, provides a crucial outlook. Howell suggests that the current phase of increasing global liquidity is likely to continue for some time, potentially peaking around mid-2026. This prediction has significant implications for assets like Bitcoin. If liquidity continues to expand towards a peak in 2026, it could provide a tailwind for crypto prices. However, Howell also notes that a downward phase is likely to follow this peak. This suggests that while the coming couple of years might be supported by macro tailwinds, the subsequent period could present challenges as liquidity potentially tightens globally. Key Takeaways from the Analysis: Strong Correlation: Analysts see a significant link between global M2 money supply and Bitcoin price performance. Liquidity as a Driver: Increased global liquidity provides capital that can flow into risk assets, including crypto. Macro Asset Status: Bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a macro asset influenced by global financial conditions. Cycle Peak Prediction: The current liquidity cycle is predicted to peak around mid-2026, with a subsequent downturn expected. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Price? For investors and enthusiasts, this correlation is vital information. It suggests that simply analyzing on-chain data or technological updates might not be enough to fully understand Bitcoin’s trajectory. Paying attention to global macroeconomic indicators, particularly central bank policies and liquidity measures, becomes increasingly important. Benefits: Understanding this correlation can help anticipate potential price movements based on macro trends. It provides a framework for viewing Bitcoin within the broader global financial system. During periods of high liquidity expansion, it can signal potential upside for the asset. Challenges: When global liquidity tightens (as predicted after the potential 2026 peak), it could pose a significant headwind for Bitcoin. Macro trends can be complex and influenced by numerous unpredictable factors (geopolitics, inflation, etc.). Relying solely on this correlation ignores other important drivers of Bitcoin’s value. Actionable Insights: Monitor reports on global liquidity and central bank policies from major economies (US, Eurozone, China, etc.). Consider how different phases of the liquidity cycle might impact your investment strategy. Diversify your analysis beyond just crypto-specific metrics. Be aware that a potential tightening phase after 2026 could introduce increased volatility or downward pressure. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin’s Future Through a Macro Lens The narrative linking Bitcoin’s price to global liquidity and the M2 money supply offers a compelling perspective for understanding its recent performance and potential future trajectory. Insights from experts like Raoul Pal and Michael Howell underscore that macro forces are powerful drivers in the crypto market. While the predicted peak in global liquidity around mid-2026 suggests potential support for asset prices in the near term, the subsequent forecast of a downturn highlights the importance of preparing for different market environments. For anyone invested in or considering Bitcoin , keeping a close eye on these overarching macroeconomic cycles is becoming increasingly crucial for navigating the exciting yet complex world of digital assets.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $89.8 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $8.8 billion, recorded a 17 percent pump in the past week to trade about $173 on Friday, May 9, during the later North American trading session. Following the heightened volatility, Solana’s leveraged market recorded a net liquidation of about $31 million in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Solana’s on-chain liquidations on native perpetual exchanges reached a high of over $47 million in the past 24 hours, thus increasing the odds of a short squeeze. Solana Network Thrives with Institutional Investors The Solana network has attracted significant cash inflow from institutional investors, led by Sol Strategies , in the past few quarters. The notable memecoin growth within the Solana network helped increase its total value locked to over $8.7 billion. As Coinpedia reported, several fund managers are seeking to offer spot Solana ETFs in the United States. Moreover, the U.S. SEC under the Donald Trump administration has accelerated its pro-crypto stance in two months compared to Gary Gensler’s four-year term. Midterm Target for SOL Price From a technical standpoint, it is now safe to say that Solana price is under the influence of bullish sentiment. In the 2-hour timeframe, the SOL price successfully rebounded from a breakout of a falling logarithmic trend. With the 2-hour timeframe MACD line having crossed the zero line and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above the 70 percent level, SOL price is now aiming for $187 and $240 next. The macro-bullish stance for SOL price will be fully confirmed once the altcoin crosses above the 200-day Moving Average Simple (SMA).",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-09 23:30:21

However, the performance of traditional markets often provides crucial context and can even signal shifts that impact digital assets. Let’s dive into the recent movements in the major US indexes and explore what they might mean for your crypto portfolio. What Happened with Recent Stock Market Performance? In recent trading sessions, the three major U.S. stock indexes concluded the day on a positive note, signaling continued resilience in traditional financial markets. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: S&P 500: Increased by 0.13% Nasdaq Composite: Saw a modest gain of 0.01% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Led the pack with a rise of 0.29% While these individual percentage changes might appear small, collectively they represent a broader positive trend in the stock market performance . This uptick often reflects underlying confidence among investors regarding economic conditions, corporate earnings, or future growth prospects. Understanding this traditional market strength is the first step in seeing how it might ripple through to other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Is There a Crypto Market Correlation? This is the million-dollar question for many crypto enthusiasts. Historically, the relationship between the US stock market , particularly tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq, and the cryptocurrency market has shown periods of significant correlation. During times of high liquidity or widespread risk-on sentiment, both stocks and crypto might rise together as investors are eager to put capital into growth assets. Conversely, in periods of economic uncertainty or tightening monetary policy, both can experience sell-offs as investors move towards safer havens. However, this crypto market correlation is not a constant. The crypto market is also driven by its own unique catalysts: Regulatory news and developments Technological advancements (e.g., blockchain upgrades, new protocols) Specific project milestones or failures Adoption rates and institutional interest So, while a positive day in the stock market doesn’t guarantee a green day for Bitcoin or Ethereum, it often contributes to the overall market mood and can be an indicator of broader investor sentiment . How Do Macroeconomic Factors Play a Role? The performance of both stocks and crypto is heavily influenced by larger macroeconomic factors . Think about things like: Inflation: High inflation can lead central banks to raise interest rates. Interest Rates: Higher rates generally make borrowing more expensive and can reduce the appeal of riskier assets like growth stocks and cryptocurrencies, as safer investments (like bonds) yield more. Central Bank Policy: Decisions by entities like the Federal Reserve regarding quantitative easing or tightening directly impact the amount of liquidity in the financial system, affecting all asset classes. Geopolitical Events: Wars, political instability, and trade disputes can introduce uncertainty, often leading investors to reduce exposure to volatile assets. When the US stock market reacts positively to economic data (like employment numbers or inflation reports), it often signals that the market interprets the data favorably in the context of these macroeconomic factors . This positive interpretation can sometimes spill over into the crypto market, reinforcing the idea of a prevailing risk-on environment. Gauging Investor Sentiment: What Does it Tell Us? Ultimately, market movements are a reflection of collective investor sentiment . When major indexes like the S&P 500 and the Dow close higher, it suggests that the dominant sentiment among traditional investors is one of optimism or at least reduced pessimism. This sentiment isn’t confined to one market; it’s a psychological force that can permeate across different asset classes. A strong traditional stock market performance can indicate: Confidence in corporate profitability Belief in the economy’s ability to withstand challenges A willingness to take on more risk While crypto has its own unique drivers of investor sentiment (like community enthusiasm or fear of missing out), it is not immune to the broader market mood shaped by macroeconomic trends and traditional market performance. Monitoring the crypto market correlation with stocks can offer valuable insights into the prevailing risk appetite in the global financial system. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, how should a crypto investor use this information about the US stock market ? Stay Informed on Macro: Don’t just watch crypto charts. Pay attention to major economic announcements, central bank meetings, and inflation data. These macroeconomic factors are key drivers for both markets. Understand the Correlation, But Don’t Rely Solely on It: Recognize that a crypto market correlation exists but is variable. Crypto can decouple based on internal news or trends. Assess Overall Investor Sentiment: Look at the performance of traditional markets as one gauge of global investor sentiment and risk appetite. Diversify Wisely: Understand how different asset classes behave in various economic conditions. Conclusion: Connecting the Dots The recent positive close for the major US stock market indexes serves as a reminder that traditional finance and the crypto world are increasingly interconnected. While the crypto market has its own unique dynamics, its performance is often influenced by the same broad macroeconomic factors and shifts in global investor sentiment that drive the stock market performance . Understanding this complex crypto market correlation is essential for making informed decisions in today’s intertwined financial landscape.

44397715,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159224,1746834034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Altcoin Season Approaches: Bitcoin Dominance Drop Signals Opportunity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-bitcoin-dominance/,"The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, presenting unique opportunities for investors. Recently, a significant shift has caught the attention of analysts and enthusiasts alike: a notable decline in Bitcoin Dominance . This metric, which measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market cap, is often seen as a key indicator of market sentiment and capital flow. When Bitcoin dominance falls, it can suggest that funds are moving away from Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies, commonly referred to as altcoins. This phenomenon is widely anticipated as a potential precursor to what the community calls ‘ Altcoin Season ‘. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and its Significance Before diving into the potential for an Altcoin Season , it’s crucial to understand what Bitcoin Dominance is and why its movement matters. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the largest by market cap. Its dominance chart reflects its share of the entire crypto market pie. Historically, Bitcoin often leads market rallies, with investors initially buying BTC. As profits are taken or confidence grows, some of these funds tend to flow into larger, more established altcoins (like Ethereum), and then potentially into smaller, more speculative ones. A falling dominance chart suggests this latter phase might be beginning. Recent data highlighted by BeInCrypto shows Bitcoin Dominance dipping from a high of around 65% to approximately 63.31%. While a few percentage points might seem small, in the fast-moving crypto world, this can be a significant signal of shifting sentiment and capital allocation across the Crypto Market Trends . What is Altcoin Season and Why Does it Matter? Altcoin Season is a period where altcoins, as a class, significantly outperform Bitcoin. During such times, many altcoins can see massive price increases, often far exceeding Bitcoin’s gains. For investors, identifying and participating in an altcoin season can lead to substantial returns, though it also comes with increased risk. Key characteristics often observed during a potential altcoin season include: Falling Bitcoin Dominance: As discussed, this is a primary indicator. Rising ETH/BTC Ratio: Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency. A rising ratio against Bitcoin suggests ETH is gaining value relative to BTC, often seen as a leading indicator for broader altcoin strength. Increased Trading Volume in Altcoins: More capital is actively trading in altcoin pairs. Positive News and Developments for Specific Altcoins: Project milestones, upgrades, or partnerships can fuel individual altcoin rallies. The prospect of an altcoin season is exciting for those looking for high-growth opportunities beyond Bitcoin. However, it requires careful analysis and risk management. Analyzing the Current Signals: ETH/BTC and the Altcoin Season Index The analysis pointing towards a potential Altcoin Season is supported by more than just the drop in Bitcoin Dominance . The report also highlights the movement of the ETH BTC Ratio . The ETH BTC Ratio tracks the price of Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. A rebound in this ratio from recent lows, coupled with a rise of over 12% in just 24 hours as noted, is a strong signal that Ethereum is gaining ground on Bitcoin. Given Ethereum’s size and influence in the altcoin market, its strength against Bitcoin is often interpreted as capital flowing into the broader altcoin space, starting with the majors like ETH. Furthermore, the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index provides a quantifiable measure. This index compares the performance of the top 50 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index surging from 23 to 36 in a short period indicates that altcoins have collectively started to outperform Bitcoin recently. While an index value between 25 and 75 is considered ‘neutral’ (meaning neither Bitcoin nor altcoins have a clear dominance over the 90-day window), the rapid move upwards suggests momentum is building in favor of altcoins. An index value above 75 is typically considered confirmation of a full-fledged Altcoin Season . These combined signals – falling Bitcoin Dominance , a rising ETH BTC Ratio , and an increasing Altcoin Season Index value – paint a compelling picture of shifting Crypto Market Trends . What Does This Mean for Investing in Altcoins? For investors, the potential arrival of an Altcoin Season presents both opportunities and challenges when considering Investing in Altcoins . Potential Benefits: Higher Potential Returns: Altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, can offer significantly higher percentage gains than Bitcoin during a bull market phase. Diversification: Adding altcoins to a portfolio can provide exposure to different technologies, use cases, and market segments within the crypto ecosystem. Innovation Exposure: Altcoins represent the cutting edge of blockchain technology, from DeFi and NFTs to Layer 2 solutions and Web3 infrastructure. Challenges and Risks: Increased Volatility: Altcoins are generally much more volatile than Bitcoin. Prices can swing wildly in short periods. Higher Risk of Failure: Many altcoin projects do not succeed. Some may be scams or simply fail to gain adoption. Liquidity Issues: Smaller altcoins may have lower trading volumes, making it harder to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. Complexity: Evaluating altcoins requires understanding specific project fundamentals, tokenomics, technology, and competitive landscape, which can be complex. Therefore, approaching Investing in Altcoins during this period requires a strategic mindset. Actionable Insights for Navigating Potential Altcoin Season Given the signals suggesting a potential shift in Crypto Market Trends towards altcoins, what steps can investors take? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Do not invest based solely on hype. Thoroughly research any altcoin project you consider. Understand its whitepaper, team, technology, use case, and community. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: Look for projects with real-world utility, active development, a clear roadmap, and a dedicated community. Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your funds into one or two altcoins, spread your investments across different sectors (e.g., DeFi, Layer 1s, Gaming, AI) and market capitalizations. Start with Larger Caps: If you are new to altcoins, starting with more established ones like Ethereum, Solana, or Cardano might be less risky than jumping straight into micro-cap tokens. Implement Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downside. Stay Informed: Keep track of market news, project updates, and changes in Bitcoin Dominance and the ETH BTC Ratio . Understanding these dynamics is key to successfully navigating the potential opportunities presented by a shifting market landscape and confidently Investing in Altcoins . Is This the Start of a Major Altcoin Season? While the signals discussed – the drop in Bitcoin Dominance , the rebound in the ETH BTC Ratio , and the rise in the Altcoin Season Index – are compelling indicators, it’s important to note that market movements are never guaranteed. The index is still in the ‘neutral’ zone, meaning altcoins haven’t definitively outperformed Bitcoin over the full 90-day period yet, but the recent trend is clear. Several factors could influence whether this momentum continues and evolves into a full-blown Altcoin Season : Overall Market Sentiment: A sudden negative macroeconomic event or regulatory news could impact the entire crypto market, including altcoins. Bitcoin’s Stability: A large, rapid drop in Bitcoin’s price could pull the entire market down, regardless of dominance trends. Capital Inflows: Continued inflow of new capital into the crypto market is generally bullish for both Bitcoin and altcoins. Therefore, while the signs are promising for those interested in Investing in Altcoins , caution and continuous monitoring of Crypto Market Trends are advised. Conclusion: Positioning for Potential Growth The recent decline in Bitcoin Dominance , coupled with the strengthening of the ETH BTC Ratio and the upward trend in the Altcoin Season Index, provides strong analytical support for the possibility of an impending Altcoin Season . This potential shift in Crypto Market Trends signals that capital may be rotating from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies, offering exciting prospects for growth. While the index has not yet reached the threshold confirming a full altcoin season, the current indicators suggest a favorable environment for those considering Investing in Altcoins . However, the inherent volatility and risks associated with altcoins demand a diligent approach, emphasizing thorough research, strategic diversification, and robust risk management. Staying informed about these key market indicators and exercising prudence will be essential for navigating the opportunities that a potential altcoin season could unlock.

Ordinals’ popularity highlights rising demand for non-financial blockchain uses. Removing the OP_Return limit could prevent mining centralization and improve block propagation. The recent ongoing debate over the potential removal of the OP_Return policy limit in Bitcoin Core has raised concerns in the cryptocurrency community. With Bitcoin mining being industrialized, the proposal to eliminate the OP_Return limit has gained some support. On the other hand, others argue that it could lead to unintended consequences. BitMEX Research argues that removing the OP_Return limit can make Bitcoin’s mempool more useful, allowing users to set appropriate Bitcoin transaction fees and enhance the network functionality. OP_Return Policy and Its Impact on Bitcoin’s Mempool The OP_Return output type in Bitcoin Core is intended to hold arbitrary data in Bitcoin’s blockchain.

This move puts the AI-focused coin up by 139% in a fortnight and by 250% in a month, while it also sits on a hugely impressive 1,350% gain in a year. VIRTUAL’s trading volumes have exploded over the past couple of weeks, rising from around $60 million on April 21 to $570 million today. This increase has followed from a recent uptick in whale purchases, while Virtuals’ fundamental position as a decentralized AI platform puts it in a very strong position to grow over the longer term . Is VIRTUAL the Next AI Mega Coin? Looking at VIRTUAL’s chart, it’s encouraging to note that the coin’s 30-day average (orange) has just overtaken the 200-day (blue), forming a golden cross that usually signals a break out. It’s also bullish that VIRTUAL’s relative strength index (purple) is rising back towards 70 after dipping a little over the past couple of days, suggesting that it has firmly entered a growth spurt. Source: TradingView Indeed, VIRTUAL had been struggling for two or three months prior to this week’s lift, meaning that it remains strongly undervalued and has plenty of room left to rise. Also bullish is the fact that transfer data has revealed that whales have been stocking up on VIRTUAL in the past couple of weeks, an indication that smart money expects the coin to continue rising in the near term. And in the longer term, VIRTUAL is arguably one of the most bullish altcoins in the market, given the promise of the Virtuals Protocol as a platform. Its network allows for the creation and deployment of AI agents, which developers can program to perform a variety of functions, spanning commerce and trading. Since its mainnet went live in October 2024, it has grown to encompass over 180,000 owners of AI agents and over 17,000 developers, according to its website . Autonomous businesses are here. ⁰⁰Powered by the Agent Commerce Protocol—an open standard for multi-agent commerce and coordination, leveraging the blockchain.⁰⁰Imagine an autonomous hedge fund business composed of information agents, trading agents, TEE-secured treasury… pic.twitter.com/P9rWqe00FA — Virtuals Protocol (@virtuals_io) February 19, 2025 On the other hand, DappRadar data currently states that Virtuals Protocol has 2,000 unique active wallets , whereas the same figure for Ethereum (for example) is 1.36 million . As such, it still has plenty of work left to do, but with AI remaining the biggest area of tech, it certainly has the potential for big future growth. The VIRTUAL price could therefore reach $2 again by June, while it could reach $5 by the end of the year. This Explosive Presale Token Could Crush the Market After Launch Virtuals Protocol is one of the most exciting new entries in the top 100, but it won’t be the only altcoin performing well over the coming the weeks. Certain newer coins are also likely to outperform the market this summer, including several presale tokens that have generated substantial momentum. Chief amongst them is Solaxy (SOLX), a layer-two network for Solana that has now raised a whopping $33.6 million in its ongoing ICO. HyperSpeed Achieved! 33 Million Raised! pic.twitter.com/HgswKcnnVM — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 3, 2025 This makes it one of the biggest sales of the year, and with over 72,000 followers on X , Solaxy is also one of the most popular unlaunched coins in the market. It owes its popularity to the fact that it’s Solana’s first true layer-two network, and as such it will provide users with very low transactions fees and super fast confirmation times. Additionally, it will also enable instant bridging between itself and Solana, with compatibility with other major chains coming after its launch. Solaxy is aiming to because an important hub for meme token trading, which remains probably the biggest part of the Solana ecosystem. This could help it grow quickly once it launches in the next few weeks, with SOLX attracting huge demand as the only means of paying for its transaction fees. Investors can join the coin’s presale at the Solaxy website , with SOLX available at $0.001718. This price will rise again tomorrow, yet given the size and success of Solaxy’s presale, it could rise much higher once the token launches.

44398335,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159227,1746835228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Bitcoin Institutional Demand: Why Supply Can’t Keep Up in 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-institutional-demand-outpaces/,"Are you watching the crypto markets, wondering what’s really driving the recent movements? While retail interest is always a factor, the big story quietly unfolding is the sheer scale of Bitcoin institutional demand . Forget the headlines about daily price swings for a moment and look at the underlying mechanics: institutions are buying Bitcoin at a pace that far exceeds the rate at which new Bitcoin is entering circulation. This fundamental supply-demand dynamic is setting the stage for potentially significant market shifts, not just now, but looking ahead into 2025. What’s Driving Massive Bitcoin Institutional Demand ? The narrative around Bitcoin has evolved dramatically over the past few years. What was once considered a fringe asset is now firmly on the radar of major financial players. This isn’t just about speculative trading; it’s about large entities – from asset managers running ETFs to publicly traded companies and even sovereign entities – allocating significant capital to Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Their motivations are varied but often include: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential store of value in an era of quantitative easing and rising national debt. Digital Gold: Positioning Bitcoin as a scarce, censorship-resistant alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. Growth Asset: Recognizing the potential for significant appreciation as adoption grows and the network effect strengthens. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional investment portfolios. This growing conviction from sophisticated investors is the engine behind the surging demand we’re witnessing. The Numbers Don’t Lie: Bitcoin Supply vs. Surging Demand The disparity between how much Bitcoin is available and how much institutions want to buy is becoming starkly clear. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan recently highlighted this imbalance, sharing compelling data points: According to his analysis: Year-to-Date Bitcoin Supply: Approximately 58,109 BTC Year-to-Date Institutional Demand (Public Companies, ETFs, Governments): Approximately 227,286 BTC Let that sink in. Demand from these major players alone is roughly four times the amount of new Bitcoin that has been mined and entered circulation so far this year. This doesn’t even account for demand from private funds, high-net-worth individuals, or retail investors. This fundamental imbalance is crucial because, unlike traditional assets where supply can often be increased in response to demand, Bitcoin’s supply is programmatically fixed and predictable. This brings us to the supply side of the equation. Understanding Bitcoin Supply Dynamics Bitcoin’s supply schedule is one of its most defining features. New Bitcoin is introduced into the market through a process called mining. Miners solve complex computational problems to validate transactions and are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin. However, this reward is cut in half approximately every four years in an event known as the ‘halving’. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, reducing the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This event immediately cut the rate at which new Bitcoin enters the market by 50%. Combine this reduced inflow of new supply with the accelerating institutional demand, and you create a powerful squeeze. The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, a scarcity model designed into its protocol from day one. With a significant portion of existing Bitcoin held in long-term storage or considered lost, the amount of Bitcoin actively available on exchanges or for sale is even lower, exacerbating the supply constraint relative to surging demand. How Are Bitcoin ETFs Reshaping the Market? A primary catalyst for the recent surge in Bitcoin institutional demand has been the approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States in January 2024. These investment vehicles provide institutions and traditional investors with a familiar, regulated, and easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, custody, or security. The success of these ETFs has been remarkable. Funds managed by major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others have attracted billions of dollars in inflows within months. These ETFs operate by buying and holding actual Bitcoin to back the shares they issue, directly translating investor demand for ETF shares into buying pressure on the underlying Bitcoin market. The sheer volume of Bitcoin absorbed by these ETFs since their inception is a major component of the 227,286 BTC demand figure cited by Bitwise, illustrating how significant this new access point has become for institutional capital. Why is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Accelerating? Beyond the ease of access provided by ETFs, the increasing maturity of the Bitcoin ecosystem and the growing clarity (in some jurisdictions) around regulation are boosting institutional confidence. More companies are comfortable holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and more fund managers are comfortable allocating client capital to the asset class. Prominent examples of companies leading the charge in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption include: MicroStrategy: A business intelligence firm that has made accumulating Bitcoin a core part of its corporate strategy, holding tens of thousands of BTC. Metaplanet: A Japanese company recently announcing a strategy to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, signaling growing international interest. Mara Holdings (Marathon Digital Holdings): A major Bitcoin mining company that also holds significant amounts of BTC on its balance sheet. These early movers provide a template and validation for other institutions considering similar strategies. As more join, it creates a positive feedback loop, further normalizing and accelerating institutional adoption. What Does This Imbalance Mean for the Bitcoin Price Outlook ? Basic economics tells us that when demand significantly outstrips supply, the price of an asset tends to rise. With the rate of new Bitcoin supply cut in half by the halving and institutional demand continuing to surge, the stage is set for potential upward pressure on the Bitcoin price outlook , especially as we move towards and through 2025. While predicting exact price movements is impossible due to various macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment, the fundamental supply/demand picture painted by institutional inflows is undeniably bullish from a long-term perspective. Institutions are buying for the long haul, reducing the available supply on exchanges and making Bitcoin scarcer for everyone else. This doesn’t mean there won’t be volatility or price corrections. The crypto market is known for its swings. However, the persistent, large-scale buying pressure from institutions provides a strong underlying support structure and suggests significant upside potential if demand continues on its current trajectory. Benefits of Institutional Interest The influx of institutional capital brings several potential benefits to the Bitcoin market: Increased Liquidity: Larger players can add depth to the market. Validation: Institutional adoption lends credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Infrastructure Development: Demand from institutions drives the development of more robust and regulated infrastructure (custody, trading platforms). Reduced Volatility (Potentially): As long-term holders accumulate, it could theoretically reduce the impact of short-term speculative trading, though this is debatable in the short term. Potential Challenges However, institutional involvement isn’t without its potential challenges: Market Manipulation Concerns: Large players can potentially exert significant influence on price. Centralization Risk: Concentration of Bitcoin holdings in a few large entities could raise concerns about centralization. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional activity often attracts greater attention from regulators. Operational Risks: For institutions, managing custody and security of large BTC holdings is complex. Actionable Insights for Readers Given this landscape, what should you take away? Monitor Institutional Flows: Keep an eye on ETF inflow/outflow data and corporate announcements regarding Bitcoin purchases. This provides real-time insight into institutional appetite. Understand the Supply Schedule: Remember the impact of the halving and Bitcoin’s fixed total supply. This scarcity is a core part of its value proposition. Consider the Long Term: Institutional adoption is a long-term trend. While short-term volatility exists, the fundamental picture of increasing demand meeting constrained supply is a powerful driver for the future. Do Your Own Research: Understand the risks and opportunities before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin? The data is compelling: Bitcoin institutional demand is currently far outpacing the rate at which new Bitcoin is being created. Driven by the accessibility of Bitcoin ETFs and the growing conviction in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption as a strategic imperative, major players are absorbing significant amounts of the available Bitcoin supply . This fundamental imbalance, coupled with the post-halving reduction in new supply, creates a powerful dynamic that is likely to influence the Bitcoin price outlook significantly in 2025 and beyond. While challenges remain, the trend of institutions embracing Bitcoin signals a maturation of the asset class and a potential new era where its scarcity is truly tested by unprecedented levels of sustained demand.

Presales are drawing serious buyer interest, legacy networks are adapting to evolving regulation, and high-speed platforms are stepping into the spotlight. Today, performance is being judged not by hype but by actual progress, working testnets, product rollouts, and ecosystems that deliver. That’s why the best long-term cryptos for 2025 are selected based on momentum, technology, and near-future goals. From presale giants like BlockDAG to established networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Litecoin, each of these five assets presents a unique value proposition. Whether you’re focused on speed, staking, smart contracts, or stability, there’s a compelling case to be made. Here’s a closer look at why these projects will lead the way in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: $231.5M Raised & One Week Left for $0.0019 Price Offer BlockDAG is emerging as a headline story in 2025, having already raised over $231.5 million and distributed 19.8 billion BDAG coins. Its $0.0019 price is attracting buyers until May 13. After that, the presale moves into Batch 28 at $0.0262, offering over 2,500% upside compared to earlier stages. With a $0.05 listing planned, buyers are acting fast. But BlockDAG’s strength isn’t just in its entry point. Its beta testnet is already processing 800 TPS, with the mainnet targeting 15,000 TPS. It features built-in DeFi tools, daily Buyer Battles, and a referral bonus program paying out 25%. More than 110,000 wallets have joined in, and centralised exchange listings are confirmed for this year. An active ambassador program offers BDAG and USDT rewards for content creators and community leaders. With a live product, rising adoption, and a coin price under two cents, BlockDAG leads the best long-term cryptos for 2025, not just as a presale, but as a complete ecosystem already in motion. 2. Ethereum: Upcoming Fusaka Fork Could Revive Activity Ethereum remains a key player in the crypto landscape and is preparing for another upgrade in 2025. The anticipated Fusaka fork is expected to raise the gas limit to 150 million, helping to ease network congestion and bring down transaction costs. With ETH currently ranging between $1,749 and $1,855, developers stay focused on scalability and efficiency. Daily active addresses have increased by 22%, reaching 485,000 as of April 27, indicating growing engagement. While Ethereum may not offer the dramatic ROI of newer tokens, it is one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025 due to its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 ecosystems. With the upcoming upgrade, ETH could enter a new phase of broader adoption and technical refinement. 3. Cardano: Rising Volume, Protocol Upgrades, & Regulatory Optimism Cardano is gaining traction in terms of network upgrades and price. ADA recently reached $0.72 after a long consolidation period, with trading volume spiking 46%. It’s also overtaken Dogecoin in market cap, due to consistent developer efforts. The April 25 progress report highlights ledger improvements and roadmap advancement toward future eras. Founder Charles Hoskinson has added momentum by suggesting that U.S. crypto legislation could pass by September, potentially easing regulatory hurdles. This combination of technical updates and a more favourable policy landscape makes Cardano one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025. With stronger fundamentals and a refocused community, ADA shows signs of a major comeback. 4. Solana: Network Stability & DeFi Growth Drive Strength Solana has bounced back to $142, supported by a critical bug fix that strengthened token security. Its network activity is on the rise, with total value locked in DeFi surpassing $4.9 billion. Solana is also moving forward on governance, including a proposal to cut inflation from 4.5% to 0.87%, even though it didn’t reach the vote threshold. The protocol thrives in 2025 with high throughput and a growing ecosystem. Solana is also seeing increasing institutional interest and integration into mainstream apps. For investors searching for scalability and on-chain usage, Solana holds a clear place among the best long-term cryptos for 2025 with continued growth potential ahead. 5. Litecoin: ETF Buzz Sparks Renewed Confidence Litecoin is back in the spotlight, this time due to speculation surrounding a potential ETF approval by the SEC for Canary Funds. A decision is expected around May 5, and if approved, it could push LTC well past $100. Currently trading near $87, Litecoin has already gained nearly 10% in two weeks. Technical patterns, like the Pi Cycle Top, are signalling short-term upside. What gives Litecoin its staying power is its user base. Over 20% of its supply has been held for five years or more, indicating strong long-term conviction. Even without flashy features, its consistency and low transaction costs continue to appeal. If the ETF receives a green light, Litecoin could become one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025, proving that steady fundamentals can still deliver big results. Why BlockDAG Stands Out in 2025 Each of these five projects offers something valuable: proven platforms, growing communities, and clear development plans. But BlockDAG stands out of the best long-term cryptos for 2025 because it brings everything together in one presale: working infrastructure, massive user interest, and a clear roadmap to launch. With over $231.5 million raised, a live beta testnet, 25% referral incentives, and centralised exchange listings confirmed, BlockDAG is already delivering, and it’s still priced at $0.0019 for a few more days. That rare blend of traction and affordability puts it ahead of the rest. The biggest opportunities in 2025 may not come from the giants we already know.

33767162,[object Object],1746835258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Solana Vs. Ethereum: Banking Group Sygnum Reveals Who Wins,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-vs-ethereum-sygnum-who-wins/,"Sygnum, the Swiss- and Singapore-regulated digital-asset banking group, has ignited fresh debate over the pecking order of smart-contract platforms with the publication of its 8 May “Digital Nugget” commentary, pointedly titled Is Solana overtaking Ethereum? Solana Vs. Ethereum In the report , Sygnum’s research desk acknowledges that Ethereum retains an “undisputed” lead in revenues and institutional adoption, yet concludes that the market narrative has swung decisively in Solana’s favour—a reversal dramatic enough for the bank to describe Solana as the system currently “overtaking” its older rival in mind-share if not in absolute fundamentals. “Ethereum’s strategic pivot has led to a 5–10 percent outperformance of Ether over Solana,” the note observes, citing the chain’s refocused roadmap on main-net scalability and user-experience. Nonetheless, the authors concede that “sentiment on Ethereum remains poor for now” despite its “continued leading position and still superior revenue generation.” Sygnum’s analysts dissect the often-conflated metrics of fees, revenues and token value. While Solana has recently “dominated in fee generation,” its protocol income “continues to substantially lag Ethereum (with the exception of the brief period around the issuance of the Trump family tokens on Solana).” The bank quantifies the gap at roughly two- to two-and-a-half-times in favour of ETH—an edge that endures even after Solana’s frenetic surge in retail transaction volumes. Layer-2 dynamics on Ethereum, long criticised for siphoning activity away from the main chain, receive a balanced treatment. The report reiterates that rollups have “led the market to see Ether as less valuable,” but adds a little-noticed parallel: “a comparable issue affecting the value of the Solana tokens is overlooked.” Because “most of the fees are paid to validators and do not grow the value of the Solana token,” Solana’s own monetary premium may be equally vulnerable. Token-economic self-help is not on the immediate horizon: a community proposal to tweak Solana’s inflation schedule—an initiative Sygnum says “would have had a similar effect” to ETH’s fee-burn mechanic—“was conclusively voted down recently.” Market capitalisation paints a different picture of runway. With Solana valued at roughly one-third of Ether but already generating half its revenues, Sygnum calculates “more room for Solana to outperform – especially with the tailwind of a better narrative and sentiment.” Even so, the report cautions that Solana’s income stream is “highly concentrated in the memecoin sector” and hence judged by investors as “less stable.” The implication: valuation discounts may be rational rather than sentimental. By The Numbers Ethereum’s entrenchment among regulated institutions provides the counter-weight. “Tokenisation, stablecoins, and DeFi” are the use-cases “showing traction and have the support of governments, regulators, and traditional financial institutions,” Sygnum writes, noting Ethereum’s 57% share of tokenised assets—augmented by a further 20% on its Layer-2 cohort zkSync. BlackRock’s flagship BUIDL fund, for example, keeps “93% of its assets on Ethereum,” a decision the asset manager links to the network’s “decentralization, credibility and security.” By contrast, Solana’s slice of the tokenisation pie “remains below 3%,” and its year-to-date doubling of stablecoin share leaves it “just above 5%,” still an order of magnitude behind Ethereum. The area where Solana has moved the needle most convincingly is DeFi total value locked: its share has climbed from 9.5% to 11.5% against Ethereum’s slide from 63.5% to 55% since January. “The narratives continue to strongly favour Solana,” Sygnum concedes, even after Ethereum Foundation’s internal reshuffle and public vow to “adjust its go-to-market strategy and to clarify and articulate the value proposition.” Yet narrative alone will not decide custody mandates or settlement rails for traditional finance. “We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” the bank concludes, reminding readers that network effects in crypto “are very hard to overcome – just as they are in other tech fields such as social media.” Indeed, history’s roll-call of “Ethereum killers” is a cautionary tale: “most have faded away until now,” despite technological ingenuity. Against that backdrop, the report’s summary is both sober and striking: “Ethereum’s 2-year long underperformance vs Solana has been temporarily arrested since the strategic pivot… [and] the token value continues to be supported by revenues running at double the rate of Solana’s revenues.” Sygnum’s analysis stops short of declaring an irreversible power shift, but its framing is unambiguous: in the current news cycle Solana enjoys the upper hand in perception, whereas ETH retains the upper hand in fundamentals. Whether that juxtaposition amounts to Solana “overtaking” Ethereum or merely drafting in its slipstream will depend, the bank says, on which chain wins the confidence of global finance in the “medium-term.” For now, as Sygnum delicately puts it, “the market has focused on Solana’s greater transaction volumes,” even if “protocol revenues continue to substantially lag Ethereum.” In the scorecard of May 2025, Solana may claim the crowd, yet Ethereum still holds the belt.

Members of two criminal organizations in Maryland have been charged with participating in a criminal gang, attempted murder, armed carjacking, armed robbery, assault and firearms-related counts, reports WMAR 2 News. Authorities say the groups targeted customers visiting physical bank branches, specifically at Bank of America, Capital One, Wells Fargo and Navy Federal Credit Union. The groups would allegedly follow victims after they used an ATM or emerged from inside the bank – striking them at their homes or businesses. In one especially bold move, the thieves are accused of purposefully crashing into a victim’s car to force a stop, robbing them at gunpoint. From August 2023 to July 2024, prosecutors say the groups robbed 34 victims of over $155,000 across five Maryland counties. At time of publishing, a total of seven people have been indicted.

Would you follow suit and adopt a bold Bitcoin treasury strategy like the one pioneered by Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy? This was a real consideration for Coinbase , as revealed by none other than its CEO, Brian Armstrong. Why Did Coinbase Consider a Bold Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? The idea of holding significant amounts of Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet gained considerable traction, largely thanks to Michael Saylor’s aggressive approach at MicroStrategy. For many, Bitcoin represents a potential hedge against inflation, a store of value in uncertain economic times, and a way to signal confidence in the future of digital assets. Companies adopting this strategy often aim to: Preserve purchasing power of corporate reserves. Potentially benefit from Bitcoin’s price appreciation. Attract investors interested in crypto exposure. Diversify traditional treasury assets (like cash or bonds). Given Coinbase ‘s position at the heart of the crypto ecosystem, exploring such a strategy seemed almost natural. They are deeply familiar with Bitcoin and other crypto assets , understand the market dynamics, and have the infrastructure to manage these holdings. The potential benefits – aligning their balance sheet with the asset they facilitate trading for, potentially boosting returns on treasury holdings – were likely appealing. Understanding the ‘Saylor-Style’ Bitcoin Strategy When we talk about a ‘Saylor-style’ Bitcoin treasury strategy , we are primarily referring to the actions taken by Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy starting in 2020. Their approach was characterized by: 1. Aggressive Accumulation: MicroStrategy didn’t just dip its toes in; it went all-in, making Bitcoin its primary treasury reserve asset. 2. Funding Mechanisms: Saylor famously used various methods to fund these purchases, including issuing convertible senior notes (debt) and selling company stock (equity). This allowed them to acquire far more Bitcoin than their operational cash flow alone would permit. 3. Long-Term Conviction: The strategy is underpinned by a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a digital store of value. This model was revolutionary for publicly traded companies and sparked a conversation about corporate Bitcoin adoption globally. It demonstrated that companies could use traditional financial tools to acquire and hold a non-traditional asset. Why Did Coinbase Pump the Brakes? The Risks Involved Despite the potential upside and the trend of increasing corporate Bitcoin adoption , Coinbase ultimately decided against fully embracing the ‘Saylor-style’ model. Brian Armstrong pointed to significant risks, particularly concerning cash flow and the company’s stability as a still-growing entity. Here’s a breakdown of the potential risks that likely factored into Coinbase’s decision: Cash Flow Sensitivity: As an exchange, Coinbase’s revenue is heavily reliant on trading volume, which can be volatile. Holding a large, illiquid asset like Bitcoin (relative to cash needs) could strain operational liquidity, especially during market downturns or unexpected expenses. Startups and growth companies often prioritize cash on hand for flexibility, payroll, and investments in infrastructure and talent. Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings. A significant drop could lead to substantial impairment losses on the balance sheet under current accounting rules (though this is changing). This could negatively impact earnings, investor perception, and even the company’s ability to raise capital. While MicroStrategy has accepted this volatility, for a financial services company like Coinbase, it could be seen as a greater systemic risk. Regulatory Scrutiny: Holding large amounts of crypto assets , especially Bitcoin, could attract increased attention from regulators, potentially complicating compliance efforts and future business expansions. Potential Conflict of Interest: Coinbase’s core business is serving its customers who trade crypto. Holding a massive corporate stash of the same assets could, in theory, create perceived conflicts or raise questions about market influence, even if unfounded. CFO Alesia Haas’s comment about not competing with customers highlights this consideration. Funding Risks: While MicroStrategy used debt and equity, these methods come with their own risks – interest payments on debt, potential dilution from equity sales, and the risk of margin calls if Bitcoin was used as collateral (though MicroStrategy has managed this carefully). For Coinbase, adding significant debt or equity solely for Bitcoin purchases might not align with their growth strategy or risk appetite. Armstrong’s statement underscores that while the potential rewards of a large Bitcoin treasury might be high, the risks, particularly to a company’s fundamental operational health and cash flow, were deemed too significant for Coinbase at this stage. Coinbase’s Actual Approach to Crypto Assets Rejecting the aggressive ‘Saylor-style’ model doesn’t mean Coinbase avoids holding crypto assets altogether. Far from it. The company maintains a significant portfolio, but its strategy appears more measured and aligned with its core business operations and strategic investments rather than purely a treasury reserve play funded by external capital. In Q1, Coinbase invested $153 million in crypto, primarily Bitcoin. This demonstrates a continued commitment to holding digital assets. As of their reports, Coinbase holds approximately $1.3 billion in digital assets on its balance sheet. This figure represents a substantial holding, but it is acquired differently and serves a potentially different purpose than MicroStrategy’s vast accumulation. CFO Alesia Haas has clarified that their approach is about growing their crypto portfolio strategically without creating a situation where they are seen as competing directly with their users’ trading activities. This suggests their holdings might be related to operational needs, investment activities, or simply holding some reserves in the assets they facilitate trading for, but not pursuing a strategy of leveraging up specifically to buy as much Bitcoin as possible for the treasury alone. Is Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Still a Growing Trend? Yes, the trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption continues, although perhaps not always with the same intensity or funding methods as MicroStrategy. The Bloomberg report mentioned indicates that more firms are indeed looking at ways to incorporate Bitcoin into their strategies, sometimes using stock and debt, emulating aspects of Saylor’s model. While not every company will or should replicate MicroStrategy’s strategy due to varying business models, risk tolerances, and regulatory environments, the conversation around holding Bitcoin and other crypto assets on corporate balance sheets is now firmly established. Companies are exploring different models, from holding a small percentage of cash reserves in Bitcoin to more significant, but perhaps less leveraged, investments than MicroStrategy’s. The key takeaway here is that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to Bitcoin treasury strategy . What makes sense for a software analytics firm like MicroStrategy with a specific capital structure and investment philosophy may not be suitable for a regulated financial exchange like Coinbase with different operational demands and stakeholder expectations. Comparing Approaches: Coinbase vs. MicroStrategy Let’s quickly look at the fundamental differences in their approaches: Feature MicroStrategy (Saylor Style) Coinbase Primary Goal Make BTC primary treasury asset, hedge against inflation, long-term value store. Hold strategic crypto assets, support ecosystem, operational needs (?), potential investment. Funding Method Significant use of debt and equity financing specifically for BTC purchases. Primarily operational cash flow and existing reserves. Scale of BTC Holding Very large relative to market cap and operational cash flow. Significant, but likely more modest relative to market cap and primarily funded internally. Risk Tolerance High tolerance for volatility and debt risks for BTC exposure. Lower tolerance for risks impacting cash flow and operational stability. Customer Relation No direct customer trading platform for crypto. Core business is facilitating customer trading; avoids perceived competition. This comparison highlights why the same strategy doesn’t fit every company, even within the crypto-adjacent space. Michael Saylor ‘s vision for MicroStrategy is distinct from Coinbase ‘s operational realities and regulatory landscape. What Are the Actionable Insights? For investors and market observers, Coinbase ‘s decision offers several insights: Risk Management is Paramount: Even companies deeply involved in crypto prioritize financial stability and cash flow, especially during growth phases. The ‘Saylor-style’ strategy isn’t universally applicable. Business Model Matters: A company’s core operations heavily influence its suitability for aggressive treasury strategies. An exchange has different liquidity needs and regulatory considerations than a software company. Corporate Adoption is Evolving: While MicroStrategy was a pioneer, future corporate Bitcoin adoption may take more varied and perhaps less leveraged forms, tailored to individual company needs and risk profiles. Transparency is Key: Coinbase’s openness about considering and rejecting the strategy provides valuable transparency into corporate decision-making in the crypto space. Conclusion: Different Paths in Corporate Crypto Adoption The revelation that Coinbase considered but ultimately rejected a ‘Saylor-style’ Bitcoin treasury strategy due to concerns about cash flow risk and stability is a significant one. It underscores that while the idea of holding crypto assets on a corporate balance sheet is gaining traction, the execution depends heavily on a company’s specific circumstances, risk appetite, and business model. Michael Saylor ‘s bold approach at MicroStrategy paved the way and demonstrated a potential model, but Coinbase ‘s more cautious stance highlights the crucial importance of liquidity, operational stability, and regulatory considerations for companies operating in the dynamic crypto landscape. The trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is undoubtedly growing, but it’s clear that companies are finding their own unique paths, balancing potential rewards with very real financial and operational risks.

This move places BTC deep into range-highs territory, with the next major challenge now clearly in sight: the all-time high at $109,000. The market’s strength comes on the back of strong technical performance and increasingly optimistic sentiment, as BTC continues to lead the crypto rally and altcoins follow suit. Related Reading: Cardano Approaches Critical Resistance – Break Above Could Trigger Move To $0.80 On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds further weight to the bullish narrative. One standout metric highlights the growing confidence among large holders: the absolute difference between the Realized Price of new whales and old whales now stands at $59.7K. Specifically, new whales have entered the market at an average price of $91.9K, while old whales’ basis remains at $32.2K. This translates to a 185% relative spread to the long-term holder (LTH) basis—a massive divergence. This wide gap signals that a new wave of high-conviction buyers is entering the market at significantly elevated prices. Unlike the cautious whale accumulation during previous cycle lows, this phase reflects strong belief in continued upside, even at premium levels. It’s a clear sign that institutional FOMO may be kicking in. Bitcoin Faces Resistance At $104K As Whale Activity Signals Growing FOMO Bitcoin is currently encountering resistance around the $104,000 mark—a level that may take time to break as it represents a critical barrier before entering price discovery above the all-time high near $109,000. The recent rally has shown remarkable strength, but as BTC consolidates just below its ATH, some selling pressure is expected. A successful breakout could lead to a swift surge beyond $109K; however, failure to do so may result in short-term consolidation or retracement. Top analyst Axel Adler shared key on-chain insights on X that highlight the evolving psychology of Bitcoin’s largest holders. According to Adler, the absolute difference between the Realized Price of new whales ($91.9K) and old whales ($32.2K) is $59.7K, representing a 185% relative spread to the long-term holder (LTH) basis. This sharp divergence reveals that new “whales” are entering the market at nearly three times the price of early entrants. In comparison, the same spread in November 2022 was only 62%, indicating more cautious accumulation near the market bottom. The current surge to 185% reflects rising confidence and FOMO, with large buyers willing to accumulate even at elevated prices. For context, during the 2021 cycle peak at $63K, the spread widened to 437%. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Extremely Undervalued Against BTC’ – Supply Pressure May Delay Recovery This trend suggests that the market is entering a more aggressive accumulation phase, where belief in higher prices is driving demand despite the premium. If bulls manage to absorb the resistance around $104K, it could mark the start of a parabolic move—fueled not just by momentum, but by conviction from both retail and institutional players betting on a new Bitcoin all-time high. BTC Price Analysis: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading around $103,000 after reaching a high of $104,300 earlier today. The 4-hour chart shows BTC facing resistance at the $103,600 level, which aligns with a key supply zone from late December 2024 and early January 2025. This area acted as a previous rejection point during the last major rally and is now being tested again as potential resistance. BTC’s recent surge from the $87K–$90K consolidation zone has been aggressive, breaking above both the 200 EMA and 200 SMA (currently at $91,806 and $89,400, respectively) with strong volume. This confirms bullish strength and trend continuation, suggesting that buyers are still in control. However, the current range between $103K and $104K is historically significant, and bulls may need to absorb selling pressure before attempting a move toward the all-time high near $109K.

Market structure remains bullish overall, but this resistance zone will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin enters price discovery or pauses for accumulation.

The company said it wanted to discuss how staking should be treated, including the possibility of allowing exchange-traded products (ETPs) to offer staking features. The company noted that while Ether ETFs have been successful, they are incomplete without the ability to stake. BlackRock’s current Ether ETF filing does not describe staking. However, the firm also believes that Ethereum ETFs are missing out on the full value without staking. During the meeting, the asset manager said it wants to offer Ether ETFs that can engage in staking so investors can earn additional yield. Other leading crypto ETF players, such as Grayscale and some regulators, agree. Grayscale also filed for rule changes to bring staking to its Ether ETF. In April, the SEC postponed its decision on Grayscale’s proposal. That demonstrates how carefully the regulator is tiptoeing into staking features. Even then, if the SEC permits staking in Ether ETFs, it could pave the way for similar ETFs based on other cryptocurrencies that also use proof-of-stake, such as Solana or Cardano. BlackRock explores blockchain tokenization of traditional assets In addition to staking, BlackRock spoke about tokenizing products from the traditional world of finance — such as bonds, real estate, or other assets. This entails converting assets such as bonds or stocks to blockchain-based tokens. Tokenization is a hot topic in finance. It has several advantages, like shorter settlement times, lower fees, and the ability to trade around the clock (unlike traditional markets, which close on weekends and holidays). The asset manager already dominates this field with its digital fund “BUIDL.” This fund is known as a tokenized or STO (security token offering) fund comprising U.S. Treasury assets. The Ethereum blockchain powers it and holds about $2.9 billion in digital currency. That makes it the largest fund of its kind anywhere. Franklin Templeton also operates in this ecosystem, launching its “BENJI” tokenized fund. The two firms are among the early movers in a market that could transform securities trading. Brokerage firm Robinhood is said to be developing its blockchain. The plan is to allow individual European investors to trade U.S. shares in tokenized form. If successful, it could upend traditional financial firms and inject more transparency and speed into trading. BlackRock–SEC talks signal rising institutional interest This is the second time BlackRock has gone to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force this year. The inaugural session was held on April 1 and focused on the firm’s proposed Ethereum ETF. These ongoing discussions hint at growing interest from big finance for crypto-linked products. They also indicate that the SEC is receptive to hearing from the public but cautious. Only a handful of spot Bitcoin ETFs have been approved by the SEC, with the first one from BlackRock in January 2025. That’s one of the most important things ever. But the chatter is now around Ethereum. What are Ethereum’s new ETFs likely to include? The SEC has not yet decided whether it should let staking happen. But when such calls are coming from the likes of BlackRock and investor demand has been increasing for more inventive strategies, a decision may not be far off. A decision favoring the ETFs could set off a burst of new ones, offering investors more opportunities to profit from digital coins — and further eroding the wall between mainstream finance and blockchain tech.

Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of those tokens — quietly positioning itself to break out, with some analysts projecting that it could hit $1 much sooner than expected. Still priced at just $0.025 during its presale, MUTM has started gaining traction among long-term investors looking for practical utilities and sustainable token models. With over $7.75 million already raised and the fourth presale phase more than 65% complete, the token’s early momentum is building — and the current price level won’t be available for long. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Let’s look at a simple example. An investor who enters Mutuum’s presale with $2,200 today would be securing a position at one of the lowest price points before listings begin. When MUTM reaches $1, that investment would become $88,000 — a transformation that’s not based on hype, but on well-defined mechanics and a growing foundation of functionality. For those exploring what crypto to invest in right now, these are the kinds of entry points that rarely last once exchange visibility kicks in. One of the strongest features of Mutuum Finance is how it structures lending. Instead of offering a single route, the protocol supports both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. In the P2C system, users deposit their assets into a shared liquidity pool, which is then made available to borrowers who provide overcollateralized positions. Interest rates adjust dynamically depending on how much of the pool is in use, ensuring a balance between supply and demand. The P2P model gives users full control by allowing them to negotiate terms directly with one another. This model is particularly useful for lending out speculative tokens like meme coins — such as DOGE or PEPE — which may not be supported in the shared pool. The flexibility of the two-tiered system opens up the platform to a wide range of strategies, appealing to both conservative lenders and high-risk borrowers. Another major development is Mutuum’s ongoing work toward Layer 2 compatibility. This isn’t just a technical upgrade — it’s a move that directly supports scalability and cost-efficiency. With Layer 2 support, users will be able to interact with the platform at faster speeds and lower gas fees, without sacrificing security or decentralization. This kind of foresight is one of the reasons some are labeling MUTM as a top crypto to buy before it breaks out, especially as network congestion and cost remain persistent challenges in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance has also made security a priority. All smart contracts are currently undergoing a full audit by CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms in the industry. This step not only protects early users but also signals that the team is focused on transparency and long-term trust — two factors that play a major role in serious crypto investment decisions. The token is still in its early presale stage, priced well below its confirmed launch rate of $0.06. Once the fifth phase begins, the price will increase to $0.03, trimming down the potential upside for those who waited. That small difference today could become a much larger gap in returns if the token reaches higher milestones — especially the $1 mark that many believe is within reach given the project’s utility-first approach. Mutuum Finance isn’t trying to replicate the hype-driven paths of other tokens. Instead, it’s focused on building infrastructure that solves real problems in decentralized finance — while aligning token value with actual platform usage. Between its two lending models, upcoming Layer 2 capabilities, and verified smart contract audit, the groundwork for long-term success is already being laid. For those asking which cryptocurrency is the best cheap crypto to buy now, MUTM is starting to look like one of the most promising bets. The price is still under 3 cents — but based on its roadmap, growing adoption, and token-linked revenue model, that likely won’t be the case for much longer.
