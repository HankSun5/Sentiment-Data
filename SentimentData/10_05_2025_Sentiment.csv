For many in the crypto and tech space, understanding how centralized entities handle valuable user data is paramount. A recent development at SoundCloud, a popular audio distribution platform, has brought these concerns into sharp focus, particularly regarding SoundCloud AI training on user-uploaded content. Understanding the SoundCloud AI Training Policy Change SoundCloud has reportedly updated its terms of use, a move that appears to grant the company permission to utilize user-uploaded audio for training artificial intelligence models. This change was highlighted by tech ethicist Ed Newton-Rex. According to the updated terms, which were last revised on February 7, 2024, users now explicitly agree that their content may be used to “inform, train, develop or serve as input to artificial intelligence or machine intelligence technologies or services.” Ed Newton-Rex noted via social media that this specific clause seems to have been introduced around February 12, 2024. This suggests a relatively recent addition to the platform’s policy framework. Implications for Creator Content AI The primary concern raised by this policy update revolves around creator content AI usage. Artists, musicians, podcasters, and other audio creators who upload their work to SoundCloud are essentially providing the raw material that could be used to train AI models. While SoundCloud states this is part of “providing the services,” the implications for creators are significant. It raises questions about: Consent: Was this change adequately communicated to users, or was it a “quiet” update to the terms? Compensation: Will creators whose content is used for training receive any form of credit or payment? Control: Do creators retain any control over whether their specific work is used for AI training? The terms do mention a carve-out for content under “separate agreements” with third-party rightsholders like record labels. This suggests that licensed content from major publishers like Universal Music and Warner Music Group might be subject to different rules, but the situation for independent creators or those without such agreements remains less clear. The Broader Trend in Platform AI Policies SoundCloud is not alone in making such changes. This development is part of a broader trend where major content hosting and social media platforms are amending their policies to facilitate user data AI training . Recent examples include: X (formerly Twitter): Updated its privacy policy in October 2023 to allow outside companies to train AI on user posts. LinkedIn: Amended its terms in September 2023 to permit scraping user data for training purposes. YouTube: Began allowing third parties to train AI on user clips in December 2023. These changes reflect the increasing demand for vast datasets to fuel AI development across various industries. However, they also highlight a growing tension between platform innovation and user rights. Navigating the AI Policy User Data Landscape The shift towards platforms using AI policy user data for training has often been met with user backlash. A common point of contention is the preference for an opt-in model rather than an opt-out. Users argue that they should have explicit control over whether their contributions are used for AI training and that they should be credited and potentially compensated for the value their data provides to these training sets. SoundCloud’s previous statements on AI suggest an awareness of these concerns. Last year, the platform partnered with AI vendors and mentioned implementing content ID solutions to “ensure rights holders receive proper credit and compensation.” They also pledged to “uphold ethical and transparent AI practices that respect creators’ rights.” The recent terms update allowing AI training on user content will test these commitments and require clear communication and potential opt-out mechanisms to build user trust. As of the original report, an explicit opt-out option within SoundCloud’s settings was not readily apparent. The platform had not yet responded to requests for comment on the policy change. Summary: What This Means for Users The reported update to SoundCloud’s terms allowing platform AI policies to include training on user-uploaded audio is a significant development. It places SoundCloud alongside other major platforms leveraging user data for AI development. While this could potentially lead to improved services, it raises crucial questions about user consent, data ownership, and compensation for creators. Users of the platform should be aware of this change and consider its implications for their content and data rights in the age of AI.

44395356,https://cryptonews.com/?p=359502,1746829907,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44395356.jpeg,AI Agents Set to Spark $615B Boom in Blockchain Gaming Engagement,https://cryptonews.com/news/ai-agents-blockchain-gaming-boom/,"$614.9 billion—that’s where blockchain gaming revenue is now forecast to land by 2030 after AI agents began running wallets, cutting trades, and even bluffing at on-chain poker tables this week. Recent data shows that the global blockchain gaming market size was valued at $128.62 billion in 2022. While this growth is impressive, on-chain games still primarily appeal to Web3 users. Research from Web3 gaming company Immutable found that more than 40% of Web3 gamers spend over 10 hours playing Web3 games weekly. However, traditional gamers tend to lean towards mainstream games. AI Agents Make Blockchain Games More Appealing Max Giammario, CEO of Kindred—an AI company focused on intellectual property—told Cryptonews that AI is quickly evolving from a background system into an active operator within on-chain games. “Today, we’re seeing AI agents that can manage crypto wallets, execute smart contract transactions, and autonomously participate in in-game economies,” Giammario said. “AI is making decisions on asset trades, staking, or even negotiating with other agents on a user’s behalf.” Giammario elaborated that AI agents can allow players to delegate repetitive or complex tasks to the AI. These agents can even continue to earn, trade, or strategize while players are offline. “Take, for example, EVE Online’s economy, which allows players to mine, trade, and wage corporate wars. Now, imagine AI agents that act like EVE’s most skilled industrialists—they could analyze real-time blockchain data to optimize yield farming across games, predict NFT floor prices, or even launch decentralized arbitrage strategies while players sleep,” Giammario explained. Giammario, therefore, believes that AI agents are capable of shaping game economies while driving liquidity, and over time, this may even blur the line between human and machine agency. On-Chain Poker Powered By AI-Agents While AI agents are still evolving in the Web3 sector, a handful of on-chain games have begun to incorporate these models. For example, TEN—an entertainment network for AI‑native iGaming—recently launched “House of TEN.” This is an on-chain poker application featuring autonomous AI agents. Cais Mainai, Ten’s co-founder and head of product, told Cryptonews that House of TEN showcases an entirely new vertical of AI-native iGaming. “It’s the first-ever fully on-chain poker game powered by autonomous AI agents, each with unique personalities and strategies. Players stake on these agents, earning ‘ZEN’ prediction rewards based on their performance,” Mainai explained. 1/House of TEN is live. The world's first true poker game on blockchain. For the next 48 hours only, witness AI agents bluff, deceive, and outsmart each other using technology previously impossible on chain. Pick the winning AI and prove your predictive skills. Game starts… pic.twitter.com/KzQPAQEVMx — TEN ( / ) (@tenprotocol) April 3, 2025 According to Mainai, House of TEN runs entirely on-chain with encrypted logic, private card hands, verifiable randomness, and no off-chain computation. Each AI agent in the game comes equipped with its own poker strategy. “Some bluff, some play safe, some tilt—and players stake on them in real time. Players are not playing against the AI, but rather betting on it by backing the mind they believe will win,” he explained. Mainai pointed out that on-chain gaming is evolving from static experiences to dynamic ones, where AI agents play alongside users, and sometimes on their behalf. “Staking on AI agents is just the beginning. These agents will evolve and soon be upgraded, traded, or deployed across multiple games in the TEN arcade, forming a composable ecosystem of user-owned gameplay,” he noted. The Sandbox Looks To Incorporate AI Popular Web3 gaming platform The Sandbox is also looking at incorporating AI elements. Sebastien Borget, The Sandbox’s chief operating officer, told Cryptonews that AI is increasingly becoming a transformative tool in on-chain gaming. He noted this is particularly the case for enhancing game economies and player engagement. “We’re seeing AI agents actively participating in game economies by trading tokens, influencing market dynamics, and attracting audiences through social media channels,” Borget said. Borget mentioned that while The Sandbox is not currently implementing AI agents in its on-chain ecosystem, the platform is actively exploring how AI could facilitate liquidity and trading of in-game assets. He added that there is interest in learning how AI-driven non-playable characters (NPCs) could interact with players. This would offer dynamic trading experiences or provide market insights based on in-game asset trends. An AI Agent Trained To Release Crypto Funds Another way AI is reshaping on-chain gaming is through interactive experiences that reward players. Alex Casassovici, executive director of the Fight.Fi Foundation and core contributor to h011yw00d.ai, told Cryptonews that Freysa is an autonomous AI agent on the Base blockchain . Freysa challenges players to persuade it to release a cryptocurrency prize pool, blending AI decision-making with human interactions. $FAI | @freysa_ai Big Moves Coming For $FAI Altseason Target: $0.37 Nothin' But Math Baby pic.twitter.com/UZK3mKXPYz — Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) April 21, 2025 “AI enhances game development by generating assets, crafting narratives, and enabling adaptive gameplay, resulting in unique experiences for each player,” Casassovici said. Challenges To Consider Although AI agents are revolutionizing blockchain games, several challenges remain . For instance, Borget mentioned that while AI presents compelling opportunities, The Sandbox is careful to remain player-centric. “We’re focused on integrating AI where it genuinely enhances the player experience, without compromising the authenticity of creator-driven content or the integrity of player interactions,” he said. Borget added that The Sandbox is not in a hurry to implement AI across all of the platform’s elements. “Instead, we’re thoughtfully assessing where it can add value without diluting the uniquely human touch that defines The Sandbox experience,” he stated. Giammario further explained that the biggest hurdles are currently around trust, transparency, and technical complexity . He noted that players need to trust that AI agents act in their best interest. “Whether that’s managing assets, making trades, or shaping gameplay, which is why transparency in AI decision-making and on-chain verifiability are essential,” he said. Giammario added that there are concerns around data privacy, ethical use, and the risk of AI-generated content diluting creativity or introducing bias. On the technical side, he explained that integrating robust AI with blockchain’s current limitations (like transaction speed and cost) is non-trivial. “Ensuring smooth, scalable experiences is an ongoing challenge,” he said. “The path forward is open standards, clear ethical guidelines, and hybrid architectures that combine on-chain transparency with off-chain AI and community oversight to keep both the tech and the incentives in check.” The post AI Agents Set to Spark $615B Boom in Blockchain Gaming Engagement appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|AI Agents|Gaming|Web3 gaming,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-09 22:31:47

The exchange is actively pursuing a MiCA license to expand its offerings and cement its role in the evolving European crypto regulatory environment. Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has received regulatory approval to expand its crypto derivatives trading business across the European Union. The exchange, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced on May 9 that it had secured a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) license from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). Source: Gemini Gemini Expands European Footprint With Malta-Backed MiFID II Approval According to the announcement , the new license from Malta allows Gemini to offer crypto derivatives, including perpetual futures, to advanced users throughout the EU and the European Economic Area. The exchange said it is now working with regulators to meet the conditions for a full-scale launch of its derivatives platform. Source: MFSA “Once we commence business activities, we will be able to offer regulated derivatives throughout the EU and EEA under MiFID II,” said Mark Jennings, Gemini’s head of Europe. The approval follows months of regulatory engagement in Malta, where Gemini chose to base its European licensing efforts. Malta is known for its crypto-friendly regulatory environment, making it a common hub for digital asset firms seeking access to EU markets. MiFID II, which was launched in January 2018, is not a single license but a framework that allows companies to operate across EU member states through a system known as “passporting.” Once licensed in one EU country, a firm can offer services across the region without requiring separate local approvals. According to MFSA records, Gemini’s Maltese entity, Gemini Intergalactic EU Artemis, was issued the MiFID II license on May 8. The license is a major step in the company’s broader European expansion strategy. “This is a significant milestone,” said Jennings. “It puts us one step closer to delivering a secure and regulated derivatives offering to both retail and institutional users in Europe.” The announcement further noted that Gemini plans to introduce a range of crypto derivatives in the coming months, beginning with perpetual futures for advanced users. The exchange said it will continue to work with regulators to fulfill all launch requirements. The firm also stated that it is actively pursuing a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license, allowing it to provide a wider suite of regulated crypto services across the EU. Gemini Advances Global Ambitions With New EU License, U.S. Office, and IPO Plans Gemini’s latest EU license marks another step as the crypto exchange accelerates its global derivatives push. In January, the firm named Malta its European hub for compliance under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, indicating its intent to anchor deeper within the EU regulatory fold. This followed Gemini’s sixth virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration in Europe, secured from Malta’s Financial Services Authority in December 2024.

News has surfaced that a prominent figure from US Politics Crypto discussions, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, is slated to speak at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference . This development, initially reported by Watcher Guru on X, signals a growing and undeniable engagement from high levels of government with the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. It raises questions and sparks anticipation across the industry – what will he say? What does this mean for the future of US Crypto Policy ? The Significance of JD Vance Crypto Engagement The participation of a sitting U.S. Vice President at the Bitcoin Conference is far from a trivial matter. Historically, engagement from such high-ranking officials at dedicated cryptocurrency events has been limited. While politicians often address technology or finance sectors, directly stepping onto the stage of a major Bitcoin gathering like this underscores the increasing mainstream relevance and political weight that digital assets are acquiring. JD Vance’s decision to speak suggests that discussions around Bitcoin and blockchain technology are moving beyond niche financial circles and into the core of national political discourse. This isn’t just about giving a speech; it’s a powerful symbol. It grants a level of legitimacy to the crypto space in the eyes of traditional finance and the broader public. For years, the industry has sought clearer communication and understanding from policymakers. Having the Vice President address the community directly provides an unparalleled platform for dialogue, even if one-sided initially. It acknowledges the significant economic impact, technological innovation, and growing voter base associated with the crypto ecosystem. What Does This Mean for US Crypto Policy ? The landscape of US Crypto Policy has been characterized by uncertainty and a fragmented regulatory approach. Various government agencies have asserted jurisdiction, leading to confusion and challenges for businesses operating in the space. The lack of comprehensive federal legislation has been a major point of concern for innovators and investors alike. VP Vance’s appearance could be a signal that the administration is preparing to take a more defined stance on digital assets. While his specific views on Bitcoin and broader crypto regulation are subject to public scrutiny and interpretation, his willingness to engage directly with the community at the Bitcoin Conference suggests these topics are on the administration’s radar. Potential policy areas that could be touched upon include: Regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, exchanges, and other crypto businesses. Taxation of digital assets. The role of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) versus decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin. National security implications of cryptocurrencies. Fostering innovation while mitigating risks. His speech could offer clues about the administration’s direction, potential legislative priorities, or simply serve as an opportunity to gauge the industry’s reaction to certain ideas. It’s an opportunity for the crypto community to hear directly from a key decision-maker and, perhaps, for the administration to signal its intentions regarding future regulatory clarity or action. Exploring Political Interest Bitcoin at the Conference The presence of high-profile politicians at the Bitcoin Conference is becoming increasingly common, highlighting the growing Political Interest Bitcoin holds. This interest stems from several factors: Growing Voter Base: The number of Americans who own or are interested in cryptocurrencies is significant and growing. This represents a substantial block of potential voters who are increasingly paying attention to candidates’ stances on digital assets. Economic Potential: Policymakers recognize the potential for job creation, investment, and economic growth offered by the blockchain and crypto industries. States and cities are already competing to become crypto hubs. Technological Innovation: Bitcoin and blockchain represent significant technological advancements with potential applications beyond finance, including supply chain management, digital identity, and more. Politicians are keen to understand and potentially harness this innovation. National Debt and Monetary Policy: Some politicians, particularly those concerned about inflation and national debt, see Bitcoin as a potential hedge or alternative store of value, aligning with certain political philosophies. VP Vance’s participation elevates this trend. It moves the conversation from individual politicians expressing support or concern to a high-level administration official addressing the community directly at one of its most important annual gatherings. This kind of engagement validates the industry’s importance on a national stage. Potential Topics and Implications for Bitcoin Adoption US What might VP Vance discuss? While the exact topic is unknown, given the context of the Bitcoin Conference and the current political climate, potential themes could include: The administration’s perspective on Bitcoin as an asset class or technology. How the U.S. can maintain its competitive edge in financial innovation. Balancing consumer protection and financial stability with fostering innovation. The role of Bitcoin in a global economic context. Potential pathways for future legislation or executive actions impacting Bitcoin Adoption US . The implications for Bitcoin Adoption US could be significant. Positive remarks or a clear signal towards supportive policy could encourage institutional investment, provide clarity for businesses looking to integrate Bitcoin, and boost overall confidence among retail users. Conversely, negative sentiment or a focus on strict regulation could introduce headwinds. The speech will be closely watched for any indication of the administration’s stance on integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. The Stage is Set: Bitcoin Conference 2025 The Bitcoin Conference is renowned as one of the largest and most influential events in the Bitcoin ecosystem, bringing together developers, investors, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts from around the globe. The 2025 iteration, set to host VP JD Vance, is now guaranteed to attract even more attention from traditional media, policymakers, and the global financial community. The conference serves as a vital platform for discussing the latest developments, challenges, and future directions of Bitcoin. Having the Vice President speak here provides an unparalleled opportunity for the industry to be heard and for the administration to communicate its perspective directly to a key audience. It’s a chance to bridge the gap between the fast-moving world of decentralized technology and the often slower-paced realm of government policy. The interactions and discussions sparked by his presence could have lasting effects on how Bitcoin and crypto are perceived and regulated in the United States. Conclusion The news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to speak at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference is a pivotal moment. It signifies a clear escalation in the level of engagement between high-ranking US Politics Crypto figures and the digital asset industry. This event has the potential to shape discussions around US Crypto Policy , highlight the growing Political Interest Bitcoin holds, and influence the trajectory of Bitcoin Adoption US . While the specifics of his address remain unknown, his presence itself is a powerful statement about the increasing importance of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on the national agenda. The crypto world will undoubtedly be watching and listening intently.

The world of digital assets is buzzing with news surrounding the TRUMP coin ($TRUMP), a prominent player in the political meme coin space. An exclusive event is set to take place on May 22 , hosted by none other than former U.S. President Donald Trump himself. What’s Happening at the Exclusive Crypto Event ? According to an announcement from the official TrumpMeme X account, a special “TRUMP Dinner” is scheduled for May 22 in Washington, D.C. This isn’t just any dinner; it’s a high-profile crypto event specifically for the most dedicated supporters of the TRUMP meme coin. The dinner will be hosted by Donald Trump and is set to gather the top 220 holders of the TRUMP coin. This direct engagement from a major political figure with the community of a specific cryptocurrency is highly unusual and signals a unique moment for the TRUMP coin ecosystem. Who’s Invited to the Donald Trump Dinner? Exclusivity is key for this event. The invitation list is strictly based on the amount of TRUMP coin held. The top 220 holders will receive an invitation to the main dinner. But the perks don’t stop there. An even more exclusive group – the top 25 holders – will gain access to additional benefits, including: Access to a pre-dinner reception. A coveted tour of the White House. This tiered access model rewards the most significant investors and creates considerable buzz within the community, highlighting the value placed on high-conviction holders. Anticipating the New Phase for TRUMP Coin The most exciting aspect of the May 22 dinner, according to the TrumpMeme announcement, is the promised revelation of a “new phase” for the TRUMP coin. While details are scarce, this announcement has fueled significant speculation within the crypto community. What could this new phase entail? Potential possibilities discussed by market observers include: Utility Expansion: Moving beyond a pure meme coin to introduce actual use cases or integrations. Tokenomics Adjustments: Potential burns, staking mechanisms, or other changes impacting the supply and demand dynamics. Political Integration: Closer ties to political campaigns, fundraising efforts, or specific initiatives. Partnerships: Collaborations with other projects or entities.

This event on May 22 elevates the profile of the TRUMP coin significantly. It legitimizes the project in the eyes of some and certainly generates massive media attention, both within the crypto space and mainstream news. For the invited holders, it’s a unique opportunity to interact directly with Donald Trump and potentially gain insights into the future direction of the project directly from the source or those closely associated with him. The White House tour adds another layer of prestige, further blurring the lines between political influence and crypto investment. Impact on the Meme Coin Market The TRUMP coin is part of a broader trend of politically themed meme coin s. Events like this can have a ripple effect, drawing attention not only to $TRUMP but also to other tokens associated with political figures or themes. The success or impact of this event could influence how future political figures engage with the crypto community. However, it’s crucial to remember the inherent volatility and speculative nature of meme coin s. Prices can be heavily influenced by hype, social media trends, and events like the one planned for May 22 . Investors should approach such assets with caution, understanding the risks involved. What Does This Mean for TRUMP Coin Holders? If you are among the top holders, congratulations on the exclusive invitation! This is a rare opportunity.

These impressive milestones place Solana firmly among the top blockchains driving the crypto ecosystem forward. However, while seasoned investors may see Solana as a steady and reliable option, early-stage gems like Ruvi present even greater profit potential. Ruvi, an AI-powered cryptocurrency still in its presale phase, is forging a future defined by blockchain innovation and unparalleled growth possibilities. If you’re looking for game-changing returns, Ruvi just might be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Solana’s recent achievements Solana’s recent rally can be attributed to its groundbreaking work in asset tokenization, a move likely to attract institutional investors. Through collaborations like the one with SOL Strategies, Solana is paving the way for tokenized equities on its high-performance blockchain. Projects like these highlight Solana’s growing relevance in institutional-grade applications, making it a key player in next-generation finance. The $250 price target With Solana already trading above *$162, its path to $250 by Q2 2025 seems plausible, especially considering its rising adoption and market demand. This bullish sentiment has brought an influx of retail and institutional capital, further reinforcing Solana’s position in the crypto hierarchy. Despite its impressive outlook, Solana’s well-established status means its growth will likely be incremental. This is where Ruvi comes into play, offering potentially explosive returns for those willing to get in early. Why Ruvi stands out Ruvi isn’t just another blockchain project. It combines the power of AI with blockchain technology to tackle real-world problems across industries like healthcare, logistics, and fraud detection. Here’s why Ruvi is capturing the attention of savvy investors. Key features of Ruvi Deflationary Economics Ruvi has a total capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens, ensuring scarcity and driving long-term value appreciation. Game-Changing Tech Integration By merging AI with blockchain, Ruvi enhances decision-making, efficiency, and transparency in ways no other cryptocurrency currently offers. Generous Presale Bonuses Ruvi rewards early investors generously with tiered bonuses depending on the size of their initial purchase. With its focus on cutting-edge innovation and incentivized early participation, Ruvi presents an exciting alternative to mature projects like Solana. The investment potential of Ruvi For investors seeking a high-growth opportunity, Ruvi offers massive potential. With predicted token prices ranging from $1 to $3, and presale bonuses to amplify returns, here’s how investments could stack up. $500 investment Tokens Bought: 50,000 Presale Bonus: 40%, increasing your total to 70,000 tokens. Potential Value (at $2/token): $140,000 $3,000 investment Tokens Bought: 300,000 Presale Bonus: 80%, increasing your total to 540,000 tokens. Potential Value (at $2.50/token): $1.35 million $10,000 investment Tokens Bought: 1,000,000 Presale Bonus: 100%, doubling your holdings to 2,000,000 tokens. Potential Value (at $3/token): $6 million These figures underscore Ruvi’s potential to deliver life-altering returns. Ruvi vs Solana While Solana is a giant in blockchain and boasts promising developments, it lacks the “ground-floor” appeal that Ruvi offers to early investors. Here’s how the two compare. Scope of Innovation Solana’s focus on tokenized equities is significant but narrowly defined. Ruvi, on the other hand, combines AI and blockchain to disrupt multiple industries, making it more versatile. Growth Potential Solana is poised to grow steadily, but Ruvi’s presale stage offers the kind of exponential growth that established projects can no longer provide. Accessibility Solana primarily attracts institutional participation, while Ruvi caters to investors of all sizes, offering exceptional value regardless of starting capital. Don’t wait to invest in Ruvi Solana’s rise to $173 and its projected climb to $250 are undoubtedly impressive. But for investors seeking unimaginable returns, Ruvi offers an unprecedented opportunity. Whether you’re an experienced trader or new to crypto, Ruvi’s early accessibility, deflationary structure, and AI-driven innovation make it the investment of a lifetime. Why settle for incremental gains when you can secure substantial returns? Act now to join the Ruvi revolution and redefine your financial future.

However, the momentum is being tested as strong resistance builds around the $0.205 level. A recent analysis highlights this crucial zone and outlines the roadmap for Dogecoin’s next move. Dogecoin Price Recovery Faces Critical Resistance TradingView crypto analyst Lingrid recently shared a technical analysis featuring a classic continuation pattern unfolding for Dogecoin. The analyst revealed that the Dogecoin price is attempting a recovery after rebounding from a key ascending trendline and breaking out of a Falling Wedge pattern. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Ready For Next 500% Wave, Here’s The Target Following this, Dogecoin is now retesting the breakout level around $0.175, where both the wedge resistance and ascending trendline converge. The cryptocurrency has also formed a higher low structure on its price chart. Notably, this breakout zone is critical, as holding above it would confirm the breakout and set the stage for potential gains. Lingrid has revealed that traders are currently watching closely for continuation toward the next resistance area. The $0.19 level has been set as the next immediate breakout target, aligning with the top of the previous range and the midpoint of the broader resistance area. A push beyond $0.19 would open the door for a run toward the range between $0.2 – $0.21, a key resistance area where selling pressures could intensify. While Dogecoin’s structure remains relatively bullish with higher lows forming, Lingrid has also cautioned that overhead resistance near $0.19 and $0.2 could slow down the momentum. Notably, Dogecoin’s trading volume will also play a key role in its price action and future moves. As the price approaches the wedge apex, fluctuations in volume could either sustain the strength of the rally or weaken it. DOGE To Decline Further If Support Fails Since the beginning of this year, the Dogecoin price has recorded its fair share of unexpected price declines and volatility. While Lingrid’s analysis shares encouraging signs of a potential price recovery and bull rally, Dogecoin’s breakout remains at risk. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Poised For Breakout Amid Accumulation, Here’s The Target If its price fails to hold the critical support zone at $0.175, especially with a strong candle close below this level, the projected breakout could be invalidated. This would, in turn, potentially lead to a steeper price breakdown toward $0.15, representing a 25% decrease from its current market value of $0.2. Lingrid also mentions that a failure to maintain buyer interest near the wedge apex and weakening volume could also contribute to market indecision, making a swift recovery less likely. As a result, traders are advised to watch the $0.175 zone closely as a key breakout point that will determine whether Dogecoin resumes its climb or faces renewed downward pressure.

44396332,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159137,1746831613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BlackRock SEC Meeting: Pushing for Crucial Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/blackrock-sec-crypto-regulation/,"In a move signaling growing institutional engagement with digital assets, representatives from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently held a significant BlackRock SEC meeting with officials from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Cryptocurrency Task Force. This interaction, reported by Solid Intel on X, centered on the urgent need for clear crypto regulation across several key areas of the burgeoning digital asset landscape. Why the BlackRock SEC Meeting Matters for Crypto Regulation When an entity as influential as BlackRock engages directly with top regulators like the SEC, it sends a powerful signal to the market. With trillions of dollars under management, BlackRock’s interest and participation are often seen as a bellwether for broader institutional adoption. Their decision to proactively discuss crypto regulation indicates not only their commitment to the space but also the critical need for regulatory clarity to facilitate further institutional investment and mainstream integration. The meeting agenda was comprehensive, touching upon areas that are currently at the forefront of regulatory debate and technological innovation: Regulation concerning crypto staking services. Standards for the growing field of tokenization. Establishing clear approval standards for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly focusing on Bitcoin ETF approval . Discussion around standards for options based on crypto ETFs. This direct dialogue highlights the industry’s desire for a predictable and understandable regulatory environment, moving beyond enforcement actions towards proactive rule-making. Understanding the Push for Bitcoin ETF Approval Standards For years, the crypto industry, particularly proponents of Bitcoin, has sought the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. Such a product would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the asset, potentially unlocking significant capital inflows. The SEC has historically been hesitant, citing concerns primarily related to market manipulation and inadequate surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets. The discussion on Bitcoin ETF approval standards during the BlackRock SEC meeting likely focused on addressing these very concerns. Key standards typically involve: Surveillance Sharing: Agreements with significant crypto trading platforms to detect and prevent market manipulation. Custody Solutions: Ensuring robust and secure methods for holding the underlying Bitcoin. Valuation: Reliable methods for determining the price of Bitcoin. Liquidity: Sufficient market depth to support the ETF’s creation and redemption process. BlackRock, having filed multiple ETF applications, including a prominent spot Bitcoin ETF application (the iShares Bitcoin Trust), is deeply invested in seeing these standards clarified and met. Their large size and existing relationships with regulators potentially position them uniquely to navigate the approval process. Demystifying Crypto Staking Regulation Needs Crypto staking is a process used by many proof-of-stake blockchains to validate transactions. Participants lock up their cryptocurrency holdings to support the network, and in return, they earn rewards. It’s a fundamental mechanism in the operations of many modern cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum after its transition to Proof-of-Stake. The SEC has raised questions about whether certain staking-as-a-service offerings constitute unregistered securities. Actions against platforms like Kraken and Coinbase have highlighted the regulatory uncertainty in this area. BlackRock’s interest in staking regulation suggests they are considering offering such services or see staking rewards as a potential component of digital asset investment products. Clear regulation around crypto staking is needed to define: When staking services are considered securities. Required disclosures for staking providers. Protections for investors participating in staking. How institutional players can offer or participate in staking compliantly. Lack of clarity here creates risk for both service providers and investors, potentially stifling participation in a core function of many blockchain networks. Charting the Course for Tokenization Standards Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital token on a blockchain that represents ownership of an underlying asset. This asset can be anything from real estate and art to stocks, bonds, or even intellectual property. Tokenization holds immense potential for increasing liquidity, enabling fractional ownership, and streamlining transactions. However, tokenization also presents complex regulatory challenges, particularly when the underlying asset is a traditional security or represents a share in a venture. The SEC needs to determine how existing securities laws apply to tokenized assets and the platforms where they are traded. BlackRock’s interest in tokenization standards underscores their view that this technology could revolutionize capital markets, provided there’s a clear regulatory framework. Discussions on tokenization standards likely included: Defining what constitutes a tokenized security versus other types of tokens. Requirements for issuing tokenized securities (e.g., registration). Regulation of platforms that list and trade tokenized assets. Custody rules for tokenized assets. Developing clear standards is essential for unlocking the potential of tokenization while protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. Navigating the Broader Landscape of Crypto Regulation Beyond staking, tokenization, and ETFs, the conversation likely touched upon the broader challenges and opportunities in crypto regulation . Regulating a global, decentralized, and rapidly evolving technology is no simple task. The SEC faces the challenge of applying decades-old securities laws to novel digital assets and technologies. Key challenges in establishing effective crypto regulation include: Defining various types of crypto assets (security, commodity, currency, utility token). Jurisdictional issues in a global market. Keeping pace with technological advancements (e.g., DeFi, NFTs). Balancing investor protection with fostering innovation. Despite these hurdles, the potential benefits of clear crypto regulation are significant: Increased investor confidence and protection. Greater institutional participation and capital flow. Reduced market manipulation and illicit activity. A clear framework for businesses to innovate and operate legally. The discussion regarding standards for options on crypto ETFs is another facet of this maturing market. Options trading adds layers of complexity and requires specific rules to ensure fair pricing, settlement, and prevent manipulation, especially given the volatility of crypto assets. What Does This Meeting Signal for the Future? The BlackRock SEC meeting is a positive indicator that major financial players and regulators are actively engaging to shape the future of digital asset markets. While regulatory clarity is still a work in progress, these dialogues are crucial steps towards establishing the necessary frameworks for widespread adoption and responsible innovation. Investors and market participants should view this as a signal of the market’s evolution and the increasing likelihood of more defined rules governing the space in the future. Understanding the nuances of upcoming crypto regulation , particularly around areas like crypto staking , tokenization standards , and the path towards Bitcoin ETF approval , will be vital for navigating the digital asset landscape effectively. Conclusion: A Step Towards Regulatory Maturity BlackRock’s proactive engagement with the SEC on critical issues like staking, tokenization, and ETF standards marks a significant moment in the journey towards clearer crypto regulation . It underscores the industry’s desire for rules that facilitate growth while ensuring market integrity and investor protection. While the path to comprehensive regulation is long and complex, dialogues like this are essential steps in building a bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. The outcome of these discussions will undoubtedly shape the future structure and accessibility of crypto markets for years to come.

44396720,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159142,1746832241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Bitcoin Transfer: $497M Departs Bitfinex in Shocking Whale Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/massive-bitcoin-transfer/,"The cryptocurrency world is often abuzz with news of significant movements on the blockchain. When a substantial amount of digital assets changes hands, especially from a major exchange, it naturally captures the attention of traders, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. A recent event that sparked considerable interest was a notable Bitcoin transfer originating from the Bitfinex exchange. Understanding the Massive Bitcoin Transfer According to data shared by the popular blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert , a staggering 4,812 Bitcoins were moved from the Bitfinex platform. At the time of the report, this colossal sum was valued at approximately $497 million. The destination of this significant cache of BTC was identified simply as an ‘unknown wallet’. Such large-scale movements are often referred to as ‘whale’ transactions because they involve amounts substantial enough to potentially influence market dynamics or signal significant strategic shifts by large holders. Tracking these movements is a key activity for many in the crypto space seeking to gain insight into potential market trends or the behavior of major players. Why Track Whale Alert? Services like Whale Alert play a crucial role in enhancing transparency within the often-opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. While the blockchain itself is a public ledger, identifying the entities behind specific wallet addresses can be challenging. Whale Alert monitors vast amounts of transaction data across various blockchains, flagging unusually large transfers and, where possible, identifying the source or destination (e.g., known exchanges, specified wallets). For the average market participant, following Whale Alert provides a real-time feed of significant capital movements. While a single transaction doesn’t dictate market direction, a pattern of large inflows to exchanges might suggest potential selling pressure, while large outflows could indicate accumulation or movement to cold storage. The Bitfinex Connection: A Major Exchange’s Role The origin of this large Bitcoin transfer being Bitfinex is noteworthy. Bitfinex is one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Exchanges serve as central hubs where millions of users buy, sell, and store digital assets. Large transfers originating from an exchange can signify several possibilities: A large client withdrawing funds to personal storage (cold wallet). The exchange itself moving funds for internal management purposes (e.g., consolidating hot wallets, moving to cold storage). An over-the-counter (OTC) trade settlement, where a large block of Bitcoin is purchased and immediately moved off the exchange. Without further information about the destination wallet or the parties involved, pinpointing the exact reason behind a transfer from a major exchange like Bitfinex remains speculative. Interpreting a Large Bitcoin Transfer What does a transaction of this magnitude, nearly half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, actually mean? Interpreting a large Bitcoin transfer requires considering various factors. Is it an inflow to an exchange or an outflow? Is it between known entities or to/from an unknown wallet? In this specific case, the outflow from a known exchange (Bitfinex) to an unknown wallet is the key characteristic. Potential interpretations include: Institutional Movement: Large firms or funds often move significant capital for strategic reasons, such as rebalancing portfolios or securing assets long-term. Cold Storage: The owner might be moving assets from the exchange’s hot wallet to a more secure cold storage solution for enhanced safety. OTC Deal: A large private purchase might have been executed off the main exchange order book, with the seller transferring the BTC from their exchange account directly to the buyer’s wallet. Exchange Management: Bitfinex could be relocating funds as part of its internal wallet management and security protocols. The term ‘unknown wallet’ simply means the address hasn’t been publicly linked to a specific individual, institution, or service. This maintains a degree of privacy for the recipient. What Does This Crypto Whale Activity Mean for You? Tracking crypto whale activity can offer valuable, albeit indirect, insights into market sentiment and potential future movements. While you shouldn’t base investment decisions solely on a single transaction, observing patterns of large transfers can be part of a broader market analysis strategy. Benefits of Tracking Whale Activity: Market Transparency: Provides a glimpse into where large amounts of capital are moving. Potential Signals: Large movements off exchanges can sometimes signal long-term holding intentions; large movements onto exchanges might precede selling. Awareness: Keeps you informed about significant events happening on the blockchain. Challenges and Risks: Anonymity: ‘Unknown wallets’ make it hard to know the true intent behind the transfer. Misinterpretation: A single transaction can be misinterpreted; it’s crucial to look for patterns. Not Predictive: Whale movements are not guaranteed predictors of price changes. Actionable Insights: Use Whale Alert and similar services as one tool among many for market observation. Focus on patterns of large transfers rather than reacting to individual ones. Understand that large outflows from exchanges to unknown wallets often suggest a move towards holding rather than immediate selling, though this isn’t always the case. Prioritize your own research and strategy over simply following whale movements. Conclusion: The Enigma of the Unknown Wallet The transfer of 4,812 BTC from Bitfinex to an unknown wallet, valued at nearly half a billion dollars, is a significant event that highlights the constant movement of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem. While the exact reason for this particular Bitcoin transfer remains unknown, it underscores the activity of large holders, often referred to as whales, and the transparency provided by blockchain tracking services like Whale Alert . Such a large Bitcoin transfer from a major exchange like Bitfinex to an anonymous destination is a common occurrence, often related to security, strategic holding, or large private transactions. For those interested in the crypto market, keeping an eye on this kind of crypto whale activity, while not a crystal ball, can add valuable context to broader market analysis.

That question is echoing louder as the market shifts focus from hype to infrastructure. It’s no longer about inflated roadmaps or speculative rallies—it’s about execution. This shift is accelerating as macroeconomic signals intensify. Experts now warn that a potential Fed pivot—a change from hawkish interest rate policies to more accommodative ones—could trigger a massive Bitcoin rally. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), HYPE, and Bitcoin—three blockchain initiatives tackling essential but often overlooked challenges. Each fulfills a unique demand: Qubetics redefines cross-border functionality; HYPE fuels decentralized liquidity for derivatives markets; and Bitcoin continues to anchor decentralized value with growing institutional endorsement. Let’s explore the best cryptos to join for long term based on utility, adoption, and real-world application. Qubetics : The Infrastructure Behind Seamless Cross-Border Blockchain Qubetics ($TICS) is laying down the digital rails for something that should’ve been solved years ago—cross-border crypto payments without the usual delays, fees, or conversion friction. In a world where capital doesn’t wait, Qubetics enables near-instant, multi-currency transactions across countries, protocols, and dApps. This is especially critical for those operating across international supply routes, fintech platforms requiring seamless on-chain/off-chain transfers, and stablecoin integrations demanding precision speed and trustless routing. Its non-custodial structure means wallets aren’t held hostage by centralized entities, and thanks to its native QubeQode deployment environment, smart contracts for transactions, identity, and insurance can run concurrently across chains. A logistics network can finalize payment while simultaneously triggering delivery confirmation and asset tokenization, all in under 10 seconds. Now in its 33rd crypto presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 511 million $TICS tokens to more than 26,000 holders, raising $16.8 million. At $0.2302, the current presale rate still reflects steep upside potential. If $TICS hits $1 post-mainnet, participants could see 334% ROI. That number escalates to over 6,415% ROI if $TICS hits $15. With layered utility and surging adoption, early entrants aren’t just buying in—they’re becoming part of the infrastructure. Investment Scenario for $2,500 Allocation If a community participant deploys $2,500 into Qubetics at the current presale rate of $0.2302, that translates to 10,860 $TICS tokens. Should $TICS reach $1 post-mainnet, this would yield $10,860—an ROI of 334%. If the token climbs to $10, the same allocation returns $108,600, and at $15, it skyrockets to $162,900. As weekly demand continues to rise and cross-chain usage increases, missing out on this presale phase could mean watching an era-defining infrastructure evolve from the sidelines. HYPE: A New Velocity in On-Chain Derivatives Hyperliquid’s HYPE token isn’t waiting for validation. At $23.72 and climbing 10.5% in 24 hours, it’s clear the platform is striking a nerve with crypto-native traders who’ve had enough of sluggish centralized exchanges. What sets HYPE apart is speed—built for those who don’t want a five-second delay between executing a perp and seeing it reflect on-chain. Its zero-order book model and deep liquidity from LP staking pools make trade execution nearly instant. But it’s not just the numbers. The recent integration of Ethena’s USDe stablecoin added another layer of composability. Traders can now swap, hedge, and stabilize gains without off-ramping, creating a tighter feedback loop for high-frequency strategies. And the markets noticed. With analysts floating potential recovery levels of $28.41 and even a bullish surge to $35.47, participants are rotating into HYPE not just for speculation, but because it gives them tools they can’t find elsewhere. Bitcoin’s Strategic Evolution: From Digital Reserve to Institutional Portfolio Anchor Bitcoin isn’t reinventing itself—it doesn’t have to. But what’s changing is how it’s being absorbed into structured finance. Bitwise Asset Management’s partnership with iCapital is more than another headline. It’s a tactical deployment of regulated Bitcoin exposure to over 100,000 financial advisors. With strategies like Trendwise ETFs rotating between crypto futures and Treasuries, Bitcoin is now being offered with downside protection and upside allocation. Bitcoin surged past $100,000, reaching approximately $101,525, driven by optimism. This rally led to significant market activity, including over $118 million in short positions being liquidated and a 7% increase in open interest, surpassing $70 billion. Bitcoin remains the benchmark for digital value, but now it’s absorbing structured capital flows. The inclusion into ETF strategies shifts it from static asset to dynamic engine—one that even the old guard can’t ignore. One Ecosystem, Three Visions: What Unites Them? These projects might appear unrelated on the surface, but their trajectories show convergence in one critical area—solving what blockchain was supposed to fix. Qubetics tackles global transfer inefficiencies; HYPE builds lightning-fast infrastructure for derivative markets; and Bitcoin, the archetype of decentralization, now proves its place within institutional financial engineering. While each protocol speaks its own language, they echo a singular truth: The best cryptos to join for long term are no longer those with the loudest marketing—they’re the ones building quietly but deeply. Conclusion: Why These Are the Best Cryptos to Join for Long Term Participants seeking more than speculation are pivoting toward utility-first ecosystems. Qubetics delivers real-world applications like cross-border liquidity and smart wallet independence. HYPE arms the trader class with instant execution and composable derivatives. Bitcoin absorbs the weight of institutional demand without altering its decentralized foundation. Together, they embody the next era of blockchain maturity—one where long-term relevance matters more than short-term noise. Those looking to engage with blockchain’s future aren’t waiting for permission—they’re choosing the best cryptos to join for long term today.

44397032,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159173,1746832839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price Correlation: How Global M2 Money Supply Drives Astounding Growth,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-m2-money-supply/,"Have you been watching the recent surge in the Bitcoin price and wondering what’s truly driving it? While many factors influence the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, a significant narrative gaining traction among analysts points to a powerful force from the traditional financial system: increased global liquidity . This connection suggests that the flow of money around the world has a profound impact on digital asset valuations, particularly for the leading cryptocurrency. Understanding the Connection: Bitcoin and M2 Money Supply At the heart of this analysis is the concept of the M2 money supply . What exactly is M2? Simply put, it’s a measure of the total amount of money circulating within an economy, including physical cash, checking deposits, savings accounts, money market securities, and other time deposits. When economists talk about ‘global M2 money supply’, they are aggregating this measure across major economies worldwide. An increase in M2 often indicates more money is available in the system, potentially seeking investment opportunities. Multiple analysts have highlighted a compelling correlation between the expansion or contraction of this global money supply and the price movements of assets, including Bitcoin. Cointelegraph recently reported on this trend, citing various experts who see global liquidity as a primary driver for Bitcoin’s recent performance. What Do Macro Investors Say About This Correlation? One prominent voice discussing this link is macro investor Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision. Pal has extensively analyzed historical data, demonstrating that Bitcoin’s price movements often mirror changes in global M2. His analysis suggests that as central banks and governments inject more liquidity into the system (often through quantitative easing or stimulus measures), a portion of that capital flows into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Conversely, when liquidity tightens, these assets can face downward pressure. This perspective shifts the focus from purely crypto-specific catalysts (like technological developments or adoption rates) to broader macroeconomic forces. It positions Bitcoin not just as a disruptive technology but also as a global macro asset, sensitive to the tides of international finance. Is the Current Global Liquidity Cycle Sustainable? Understanding the current environment requires looking at the broader liquidity cycle. Michael Howell, founder and CEO of CrossBorder Capital, a firm specializing in tracking global liquidity flows, provides a crucial outlook. Howell suggests that the current phase of increasing global liquidity is likely to continue for some time, potentially peaking around mid-2026. This prediction has significant implications for assets like Bitcoin. If liquidity continues to expand towards a peak in 2026, it could provide a tailwind for crypto prices. However, Howell also notes that a downward phase is likely to follow this peak. This suggests that while the coming couple of years might be supported by macro tailwinds, the subsequent period could present challenges as liquidity potentially tightens globally. Key Takeaways from the Analysis: Strong Correlation: Analysts see a significant link between global M2 money supply and Bitcoin price performance. Liquidity as a Driver: Increased global liquidity provides capital that can flow into risk assets, including crypto. Macro Asset Status: Bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a macro asset influenced by global financial conditions. Cycle Peak Prediction: The current liquidity cycle is predicted to peak around mid-2026, with a subsequent downturn expected. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Price? For investors and enthusiasts, this correlation is vital information. It suggests that simply analyzing on-chain data or technological updates might not be enough to fully understand Bitcoin’s trajectory. Paying attention to global macroeconomic indicators, particularly central bank policies and liquidity measures, becomes increasingly important. Benefits: Understanding this correlation can help anticipate potential price movements based on macro trends. It provides a framework for viewing Bitcoin within the broader global financial system. During periods of high liquidity expansion, it can signal potential upside for the asset. Challenges: When global liquidity tightens (as predicted after the potential 2026 peak), it could pose a significant headwind for Bitcoin. Macro trends can be complex and influenced by numerous unpredictable factors (geopolitics, inflation, etc.). Relying solely on this correlation ignores other important drivers of Bitcoin’s value. Actionable Insights: Monitor reports on global liquidity and central bank policies from major economies (US, Eurozone, China, etc.). Consider how different phases of the liquidity cycle might impact your investment strategy. Diversify your analysis beyond just crypto-specific metrics. Be aware that a potential tightening phase after 2026 could introduce increased volatility or downward pressure. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin’s Future Through a Macro Lens The narrative linking Bitcoin’s price to global liquidity and the M2 money supply offers a compelling perspective for understanding its recent performance and potential future trajectory. Insights from experts like Raoul Pal and Michael Howell underscore that macro forces are powerful drivers in the crypto market. While the predicted peak in global liquidity around mid-2026 suggests potential support for asset prices in the near term, the subsequent forecast of a downturn highlights the importance of preparing for different market environments. For anyone invested in or considering Bitcoin , keeping a close eye on these overarching macroeconomic cycles is becoming increasingly crucial for navigating the exciting yet complex world of digital assets.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $89.8 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $8.8 billion, recorded a 17 percent pump in the past week to trade about $173 on Friday, May 9, during the later North American trading session. Following the heightened volatility, Solana’s leveraged market recorded a net liquidation of about $31 million in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Solana’s on-chain liquidations on native perpetual exchanges reached a high of over $47 million in the past 24 hours, thus increasing the odds of a short squeeze. Solana Network Thrives with Institutional Investors The Solana network has attracted significant cash inflow from institutional investors, led by Sol Strategies , in the past few quarters. The notable memecoin growth within the Solana network helped increase its total value locked to over $8.7 billion. As Coinpedia reported, several fund managers are seeking to offer spot Solana ETFs in the United States. Moreover, the U.S. SEC under the Donald Trump administration has accelerated its pro-crypto stance in two months compared to Gary Gensler’s four-year term. Midterm Target for SOL Price From a technical standpoint, it is now safe to say that Solana price is under the influence of bullish sentiment. In the 2-hour timeframe, the SOL price successfully rebounded from a breakout of a falling logarithmic trend. With the 2-hour timeframe MACD line having crossed the zero line and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above the 70 percent level, SOL price is now aiming for $187 and $240 next. The macro-bullish stance for SOL price will be fully confirmed once the altcoin crosses above the 200-day Moving Average Simple (SMA).",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-09 23:30:21

However, the performance of traditional markets often provides crucial context and can even signal shifts that impact digital assets. Let’s dive into the recent movements in the major US indexes and explore what they might mean for your crypto portfolio. What Happened with Recent Stock Market Performance? In recent trading sessions, the three major U.S. stock indexes concluded the day on a positive note, signaling continued resilience in traditional financial markets. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: S&P 500: Increased by 0.13% Nasdaq Composite: Saw a modest gain of 0.01% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Led the pack with a rise of 0.29% While these individual percentage changes might appear small, collectively they represent a broader positive trend in the stock market performance . This uptick often reflects underlying confidence among investors regarding economic conditions, corporate earnings, or future growth prospects. Understanding this traditional market strength is the first step in seeing how it might ripple through to other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Is There a Crypto Market Correlation? This is the million-dollar question for many crypto enthusiasts. Historically, the relationship between the US stock market , particularly tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq, and the cryptocurrency market has shown periods of significant correlation. During times of high liquidity or widespread risk-on sentiment, both stocks and crypto might rise together as investors are eager to put capital into growth assets. Conversely, in periods of economic uncertainty or tightening monetary policy, both can experience sell-offs as investors move towards safer havens. However, this crypto market correlation is not a constant. The crypto market is also driven by its own unique catalysts: Regulatory news and developments Technological advancements (e.g., blockchain upgrades, new protocols) Specific project milestones or failures Adoption rates and institutional interest So, while a positive day in the stock market doesn’t guarantee a green day for Bitcoin or Ethereum, it often contributes to the overall market mood and can be an indicator of broader investor sentiment . How Do Macroeconomic Factors Play a Role? The performance of both stocks and crypto is heavily influenced by larger macroeconomic factors . Think about things like: Inflation: High inflation can lead central banks to raise interest rates. Interest Rates: Higher rates generally make borrowing more expensive and can reduce the appeal of riskier assets like growth stocks and cryptocurrencies, as safer investments (like bonds) yield more. Central Bank Policy: Decisions by entities like the Federal Reserve regarding quantitative easing or tightening directly impact the amount of liquidity in the financial system, affecting all asset classes. Geopolitical Events: Wars, political instability, and trade disputes can introduce uncertainty, often leading investors to reduce exposure to volatile assets. When the US stock market reacts positively to economic data (like employment numbers or inflation reports), it often signals that the market interprets the data favorably in the context of these macroeconomic factors . This positive interpretation can sometimes spill over into the crypto market, reinforcing the idea of a prevailing risk-on environment. Gauging Investor Sentiment: What Does it Tell Us? Ultimately, market movements are a reflection of collective investor sentiment . When major indexes like the S&P 500 and the Dow close higher, it suggests that the dominant sentiment among traditional investors is one of optimism or at least reduced pessimism. This sentiment isn’t confined to one market; it’s a psychological force that can permeate across different asset classes. A strong traditional stock market performance can indicate: Confidence in corporate profitability Belief in the economy’s ability to withstand challenges A willingness to take on more risk While crypto has its own unique drivers of investor sentiment (like community enthusiasm or fear of missing out), it is not immune to the broader market mood shaped by macroeconomic trends and traditional market performance. Monitoring the crypto market correlation with stocks can offer valuable insights into the prevailing risk appetite in the global financial system. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, how should a crypto investor use this information about the US stock market ? Stay Informed on Macro: Don’t just watch crypto charts. Pay attention to major economic announcements, central bank meetings, and inflation data. These macroeconomic factors are key drivers for both markets. Understand the Correlation, But Don’t Rely Solely on It: Recognize that a crypto market correlation exists but is variable. Crypto can decouple based on internal news or trends. Assess Overall Investor Sentiment: Look at the performance of traditional markets as one gauge of global investor sentiment and risk appetite. Diversify Wisely: Understand how different asset classes behave in various economic conditions. Conclusion: Connecting the Dots The recent positive close for the major US stock market indexes serves as a reminder that traditional finance and the crypto world are increasingly interconnected. While the crypto market has its own unique dynamics, its performance is often influenced by the same broad macroeconomic factors and shifts in global investor sentiment that drive the stock market performance . Understanding this complex crypto market correlation is essential for making informed decisions in today’s intertwined financial landscape.

44397715,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159224,1746834034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Altcoin Season Approaches: Bitcoin Dominance Drop Signals Opportunity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-bitcoin-dominance/,"The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, presenting unique opportunities for investors. Recently, a significant shift has caught the attention of analysts and enthusiasts alike: a notable decline in Bitcoin Dominance . This metric, which measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market cap, is often seen as a key indicator of market sentiment and capital flow. When Bitcoin dominance falls, it can suggest that funds are moving away from Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies, commonly referred to as altcoins. This phenomenon is widely anticipated as a potential precursor to what the community calls ‘ Altcoin Season ‘. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and its Significance Before diving into the potential for an Altcoin Season , it’s crucial to understand what Bitcoin Dominance is and why its movement matters. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the largest by market cap. Its dominance chart reflects its share of the entire crypto market pie. Historically, Bitcoin often leads market rallies, with investors initially buying BTC. As profits are taken or confidence grows, some of these funds tend to flow into larger, more established altcoins (like Ethereum), and then potentially into smaller, more speculative ones. A falling dominance chart suggests this latter phase might be beginning. Recent data highlighted by BeInCrypto shows Bitcoin Dominance dipping from a high of around 65% to approximately 63.31%. While a few percentage points might seem small, in the fast-moving crypto world, this can be a significant signal of shifting sentiment and capital allocation across the Crypto Market Trends . What is Altcoin Season and Why Does it Matter? Altcoin Season is a period where altcoins, as a class, significantly outperform Bitcoin. During such times, many altcoins can see massive price increases, often far exceeding Bitcoin’s gains. For investors, identifying and participating in an altcoin season can lead to substantial returns, though it also comes with increased risk. Key characteristics often observed during a potential altcoin season include: Falling Bitcoin Dominance: As discussed, this is a primary indicator. Rising ETH/BTC Ratio: Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency. A rising ratio against Bitcoin suggests ETH is gaining value relative to BTC, often seen as a leading indicator for broader altcoin strength. Increased Trading Volume in Altcoins: More capital is actively trading in altcoin pairs. Positive News and Developments for Specific Altcoins: Project milestones, upgrades, or partnerships can fuel individual altcoin rallies. The prospect of an altcoin season is exciting for those looking for high-growth opportunities beyond Bitcoin. However, it requires careful analysis and risk management. Analyzing the Current Signals: ETH/BTC and the Altcoin Season Index The analysis pointing towards a potential Altcoin Season is supported by more than just the drop in Bitcoin Dominance . The report also highlights the movement of the ETH BTC Ratio . The ETH BTC Ratio tracks the price of Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. A rebound in this ratio from recent lows, coupled with a rise of over 12% in just 24 hours as noted, is a strong signal that Ethereum is gaining ground on Bitcoin. Given Ethereum’s size and influence in the altcoin market, its strength against Bitcoin is often interpreted as capital flowing into the broader altcoin space, starting with the majors like ETH. Furthermore, the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index provides a quantifiable measure. This index compares the performance of the top 50 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index surging from 23 to 36 in a short period indicates that altcoins have collectively started to outperform Bitcoin recently. While an index value between 25 and 75 is considered ‘neutral’ (meaning neither Bitcoin nor altcoins have a clear dominance over the 90-day window), the rapid move upwards suggests momentum is building in favor of altcoins. An index value above 75 is typically considered confirmation of a full-fledged Altcoin Season . These combined signals – falling Bitcoin Dominance , a rising ETH BTC Ratio , and an increasing Altcoin Season Index value – paint a compelling picture of shifting Crypto Market Trends . What Does This Mean for Investing in Altcoins? For investors, the potential arrival of an Altcoin Season presents both opportunities and challenges when considering Investing in Altcoins . Potential Benefits: Higher Potential Returns: Altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, can offer significantly higher percentage gains than Bitcoin during a bull market phase. Diversification: Adding altcoins to a portfolio can provide exposure to different technologies, use cases, and market segments within the crypto ecosystem. Innovation Exposure: Altcoins represent the cutting edge of blockchain technology, from DeFi and NFTs to Layer 2 solutions and Web3 infrastructure. Challenges and Risks: Increased Volatility: Altcoins are generally much more volatile than Bitcoin. Prices can swing wildly in short periods. Higher Risk of Failure: Many altcoin projects do not succeed. Some may be scams or simply fail to gain adoption. Liquidity Issues: Smaller altcoins may have lower trading volumes, making it harder to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. Complexity: Evaluating altcoins requires understanding specific project fundamentals, tokenomics, technology, and competitive landscape, which can be complex. Therefore, approaching Investing in Altcoins during this period requires a strategic mindset. Actionable Insights for Navigating Potential Altcoin Season Given the signals suggesting a potential shift in Crypto Market Trends towards altcoins, what steps can investors take? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Do not invest based solely on hype. Thoroughly research any altcoin project you consider. Understand its whitepaper, team, technology, use case, and community. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: Look for projects with real-world utility, active development, a clear roadmap, and a dedicated community. Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your funds into one or two altcoins, spread your investments across different sectors (e.g., DeFi, Layer 1s, Gaming, AI) and market capitalizations. Start with Larger Caps: If you are new to altcoins, starting with more established ones like Ethereum, Solana, or Cardano might be less risky than jumping straight into micro-cap tokens. Implement Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downside. Stay Informed: Keep track of market news, project updates, and changes in Bitcoin Dominance and the ETH BTC Ratio . Understanding these dynamics is key to successfully navigating the potential opportunities presented by a shifting market landscape and confidently Investing in Altcoins . Is This the Start of a Major Altcoin Season? While the signals discussed – the drop in Bitcoin Dominance , the rebound in the ETH BTC Ratio , and the rise in the Altcoin Season Index – are compelling indicators, it’s important to note that market movements are never guaranteed. The index is still in the ‘neutral’ zone, meaning altcoins haven’t definitively outperformed Bitcoin over the full 90-day period yet, but the recent trend is clear. Several factors could influence whether this momentum continues and evolves into a full-blown Altcoin Season : Overall Market Sentiment: A sudden negative macroeconomic event or regulatory news could impact the entire crypto market, including altcoins. Bitcoin’s Stability: A large, rapid drop in Bitcoin’s price could pull the entire market down, regardless of dominance trends. Capital Inflows: Continued inflow of new capital into the crypto market is generally bullish for both Bitcoin and altcoins. Therefore, while the signs are promising for those interested in Investing in Altcoins , caution and continuous monitoring of Crypto Market Trends are advised. Conclusion: Positioning for Potential Growth The recent decline in Bitcoin Dominance , coupled with the strengthening of the ETH BTC Ratio and the upward trend in the Altcoin Season Index, provides strong analytical support for the possibility of an impending Altcoin Season . This potential shift in Crypto Market Trends signals that capital may be rotating from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies, offering exciting prospects for growth. While the index has not yet reached the threshold confirming a full altcoin season, the current indicators suggest a favorable environment for those considering Investing in Altcoins . However, the inherent volatility and risks associated with altcoins demand a diligent approach, emphasizing thorough research, strategic diversification, and robust risk management. Staying informed about these key market indicators and exercising prudence will be essential for navigating the opportunities that a potential altcoin season could unlock.

Ordinals’ popularity highlights rising demand for non-financial blockchain uses. Removing the OP_Return limit could prevent mining centralization and improve block propagation. The recent ongoing debate over the potential removal of the OP_Return policy limit in Bitcoin Core has raised concerns in the cryptocurrency community. With Bitcoin mining being industrialized, the proposal to eliminate the OP_Return limit has gained some support. On the other hand, others argue that it could lead to unintended consequences. BitMEX Research argues that removing the OP_Return limit can make Bitcoin’s mempool more useful, allowing users to set appropriate Bitcoin transaction fees and enhance the network functionality. OP_Return Policy and Its Impact on Bitcoin’s Mempool The OP_Return output type in Bitcoin Core is intended to hold arbitrary data in Bitcoin’s blockchain.

This move puts the AI-focused coin up by 139% in a fortnight and by 250% in a month, while it also sits on a hugely impressive 1,350% gain in a year. VIRTUAL’s trading volumes have exploded over the past couple of weeks, rising from around $60 million on April 21 to $570 million today. This increase has followed from a recent uptick in whale purchases, while Virtuals’ fundamental position as a decentralized AI platform puts it in a very strong position to grow over the longer term . Is VIRTUAL the Next AI Mega Coin? Looking at VIRTUAL’s chart, it’s encouraging to note that the coin’s 30-day average (orange) has just overtaken the 200-day (blue), forming a golden cross that usually signals a break out. It’s also bullish that VIRTUAL’s relative strength index (purple) is rising back towards 70 after dipping a little over the past couple of days, suggesting that it has firmly entered a growth spurt. Source: TradingView Indeed, VIRTUAL had been struggling for two or three months prior to this week’s lift, meaning that it remains strongly undervalued and has plenty of room left to rise. Also bullish is the fact that transfer data has revealed that whales have been stocking up on VIRTUAL in the past couple of weeks, an indication that smart money expects the coin to continue rising in the near term. And in the longer term, VIRTUAL is arguably one of the most bullish altcoins in the market, given the promise of the Virtuals Protocol as a platform. Its network allows for the creation and deployment of AI agents, which developers can program to perform a variety of functions, spanning commerce and trading. Since its mainnet went live in October 2024, it has grown to encompass over 180,000 owners of AI agents and over 17,000 developers, according to its website . Autonomous businesses are here. ⁰⁰Powered by the Agent Commerce Protocol—an open standard for multi-agent commerce and coordination, leveraging the blockchain.⁰⁰Imagine an autonomous hedge fund business composed of information agents, trading agents, TEE-secured treasury… pic.twitter.com/P9rWqe00FA — Virtuals Protocol (@virtuals_io) February 19, 2025 On the other hand, DappRadar data currently states that Virtuals Protocol has 2,000 unique active wallets , whereas the same figure for Ethereum (for example) is 1.36 million . As such, it still has plenty of work left to do, but with AI remaining the biggest area of tech, it certainly has the potential for big future growth. The VIRTUAL price could therefore reach $2 again by June, while it could reach $5 by the end of the year. This Explosive Presale Token Could Crush the Market After Launch Virtuals Protocol is one of the most exciting new entries in the top 100, but it won’t be the only altcoin performing well over the coming the weeks. Certain newer coins are also likely to outperform the market this summer, including several presale tokens that have generated substantial momentum. Chief amongst them is Solaxy (SOLX), a layer-two network for Solana that has now raised a whopping $33.6 million in its ongoing ICO. HyperSpeed Achieved! 33 Million Raised! pic.twitter.com/HgswKcnnVM — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 3, 2025 This makes it one of the biggest sales of the year, and with over 72,000 followers on X , Solaxy is also one of the most popular unlaunched coins in the market. It owes its popularity to the fact that it’s Solana’s first true layer-two network, and as such it will provide users with very low transactions fees and super fast confirmation times. Additionally, it will also enable instant bridging between itself and Solana, with compatibility with other major chains coming after its launch. Solaxy is aiming to because an important hub for meme token trading, which remains probably the biggest part of the Solana ecosystem. This could help it grow quickly once it launches in the next few weeks, with SOLX attracting huge demand as the only means of paying for its transaction fees. Investors can join the coin’s presale at the Solaxy website , with SOLX available at $0.001718. This price will rise again tomorrow, yet given the size and success of Solaxy’s presale, it could rise much higher once the token launches.

44398335,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159227,1746835228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Bitcoin Institutional Demand: Why Supply Can’t Keep Up in 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-institutional-demand-outpaces/,"Are you watching the crypto markets, wondering what’s really driving the recent movements? While retail interest is always a factor, the big story quietly unfolding is the sheer scale of Bitcoin institutional demand . Forget the headlines about daily price swings for a moment and look at the underlying mechanics: institutions are buying Bitcoin at a pace that far exceeds the rate at which new Bitcoin is entering circulation. This fundamental supply-demand dynamic is setting the stage for potentially significant market shifts, not just now, but looking ahead into 2025. What’s Driving Massive Bitcoin Institutional Demand ? The narrative around Bitcoin has evolved dramatically over the past few years. What was once considered a fringe asset is now firmly on the radar of major financial players. This isn’t just about speculative trading; it’s about large entities – from asset managers running ETFs to publicly traded companies and even sovereign entities – allocating significant capital to Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Their motivations are varied but often include: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential store of value in an era of quantitative easing and rising national debt. Digital Gold: Positioning Bitcoin as a scarce, censorship-resistant alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. Growth Asset: Recognizing the potential for significant appreciation as adoption grows and the network effect strengthens. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional investment portfolios. This growing conviction from sophisticated investors is the engine behind the surging demand we’re witnessing. The Numbers Don’t Lie: Bitcoin Supply vs. Surging Demand The disparity between how much Bitcoin is available and how much institutions want to buy is becoming starkly clear. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan recently highlighted this imbalance, sharing compelling data points: According to his analysis: Year-to-Date Bitcoin Supply: Approximately 58,109 BTC Year-to-Date Institutional Demand (Public Companies, ETFs, Governments): Approximately 227,286 BTC Let that sink in. Demand from these major players alone is roughly four times the amount of new Bitcoin that has been mined and entered circulation so far this year. This doesn’t even account for demand from private funds, high-net-worth individuals, or retail investors. This fundamental imbalance is crucial because, unlike traditional assets where supply can often be increased in response to demand, Bitcoin’s supply is programmatically fixed and predictable. This brings us to the supply side of the equation. Understanding Bitcoin Supply Dynamics Bitcoin’s supply schedule is one of its most defining features. New Bitcoin is introduced into the market through a process called mining. Miners solve complex computational problems to validate transactions and are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin. However, this reward is cut in half approximately every four years in an event known as the ‘halving’. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, reducing the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This event immediately cut the rate at which new Bitcoin enters the market by 50%. Combine this reduced inflow of new supply with the accelerating institutional demand, and you create a powerful squeeze. The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, a scarcity model designed into its protocol from day one. With a significant portion of existing Bitcoin held in long-term storage or considered lost, the amount of Bitcoin actively available on exchanges or for sale is even lower, exacerbating the supply constraint relative to surging demand. How Are Bitcoin ETFs Reshaping the Market? A primary catalyst for the recent surge in Bitcoin institutional demand has been the approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States in January 2024. These investment vehicles provide institutions and traditional investors with a familiar, regulated, and easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, custody, or security. The success of these ETFs has been remarkable. Funds managed by major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others have attracted billions of dollars in inflows within months. These ETFs operate by buying and holding actual Bitcoin to back the shares they issue, directly translating investor demand for ETF shares into buying pressure on the underlying Bitcoin market. The sheer volume of Bitcoin absorbed by these ETFs since their inception is a major component of the 227,286 BTC demand figure cited by Bitwise, illustrating how significant this new access point has become for institutional capital. Why is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Accelerating? Beyond the ease of access provided by ETFs, the increasing maturity of the Bitcoin ecosystem and the growing clarity (in some jurisdictions) around regulation are boosting institutional confidence. More companies are comfortable holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and more fund managers are comfortable allocating client capital to the asset class. Prominent examples of companies leading the charge in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption include: MicroStrategy: A business intelligence firm that has made accumulating Bitcoin a core part of its corporate strategy, holding tens of thousands of BTC. Metaplanet: A Japanese company recently announcing a strategy to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, signaling growing international interest. Mara Holdings (Marathon Digital Holdings): A major Bitcoin mining company that also holds significant amounts of BTC on its balance sheet. These early movers provide a template and validation for other institutions considering similar strategies. As more join, it creates a positive feedback loop, further normalizing and accelerating institutional adoption. What Does This Imbalance Mean for the Bitcoin Price Outlook ? Basic economics tells us that when demand significantly outstrips supply, the price of an asset tends to rise. With the rate of new Bitcoin supply cut in half by the halving and institutional demand continuing to surge, the stage is set for potential upward pressure on the Bitcoin price outlook , especially as we move towards and through 2025. While predicting exact price movements is impossible due to various macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment, the fundamental supply/demand picture painted by institutional inflows is undeniably bullish from a long-term perspective. Institutions are buying for the long haul, reducing the available supply on exchanges and making Bitcoin scarcer for everyone else. This doesn’t mean there won’t be volatility or price corrections. The crypto market is known for its swings. However, the persistent, large-scale buying pressure from institutions provides a strong underlying support structure and suggests significant upside potential if demand continues on its current trajectory. Benefits of Institutional Interest The influx of institutional capital brings several potential benefits to the Bitcoin market: Increased Liquidity: Larger players can add depth to the market. Validation: Institutional adoption lends credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Infrastructure Development: Demand from institutions drives the development of more robust and regulated infrastructure (custody, trading platforms). Reduced Volatility (Potentially): As long-term holders accumulate, it could theoretically reduce the impact of short-term speculative trading, though this is debatable in the short term. Potential Challenges However, institutional involvement isn’t without its potential challenges: Market Manipulation Concerns: Large players can potentially exert significant influence on price. Centralization Risk: Concentration of Bitcoin holdings in a few large entities could raise concerns about centralization. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional activity often attracts greater attention from regulators. Operational Risks: For institutions, managing custody and security of large BTC holdings is complex. Actionable Insights for Readers Given this landscape, what should you take away? Monitor Institutional Flows: Keep an eye on ETF inflow/outflow data and corporate announcements regarding Bitcoin purchases. This provides real-time insight into institutional appetite. Understand the Supply Schedule: Remember the impact of the halving and Bitcoin’s fixed total supply. This scarcity is a core part of its value proposition. Consider the Long Term: Institutional adoption is a long-term trend. While short-term volatility exists, the fundamental picture of increasing demand meeting constrained supply is a powerful driver for the future. Do Your Own Research: Understand the risks and opportunities before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin? The data is compelling: Bitcoin institutional demand is currently far outpacing the rate at which new Bitcoin is being created. Driven by the accessibility of Bitcoin ETFs and the growing conviction in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption as a strategic imperative, major players are absorbing significant amounts of the available Bitcoin supply . This fundamental imbalance, coupled with the post-halving reduction in new supply, creates a powerful dynamic that is likely to influence the Bitcoin price outlook significantly in 2025 and beyond. While challenges remain, the trend of institutions embracing Bitcoin signals a maturation of the asset class and a potential new era where its scarcity is truly tested by unprecedented levels of sustained demand.

Presales are drawing serious buyer interest, legacy networks are adapting to evolving regulation, and high-speed platforms are stepping into the spotlight. Today, performance is being judged not by hype but by actual progress, working testnets, product rollouts, and ecosystems that deliver. That’s why the best long-term cryptos for 2025 are selected based on momentum, technology, and near-future goals. From presale giants like BlockDAG to established networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Litecoin, each of these five assets presents a unique value proposition. Whether you’re focused on speed, staking, smart contracts, or stability, there’s a compelling case to be made. Here’s a closer look at why these projects will lead the way in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: $231.5M Raised & One Week Left for $0.0019 Price Offer BlockDAG is emerging as a headline story in 2025, having already raised over $231.5 million and distributed 19.8 billion BDAG coins. Its $0.0019 price is attracting buyers until May 13. After that, the presale moves into Batch 28 at $0.0262, offering over 2,500% upside compared to earlier stages. With a $0.05 listing planned, buyers are acting fast. But BlockDAG’s strength isn’t just in its entry point. Its beta testnet is already processing 800 TPS, with the mainnet targeting 15,000 TPS. It features built-in DeFi tools, daily Buyer Battles, and a referral bonus program paying out 25%. More than 110,000 wallets have joined in, and centralised exchange listings are confirmed for this year. An active ambassador program offers BDAG and USDT rewards for content creators and community leaders. With a live product, rising adoption, and a coin price under two cents, BlockDAG leads the best long-term cryptos for 2025, not just as a presale, but as a complete ecosystem already in motion. 2. Ethereum: Upcoming Fusaka Fork Could Revive Activity Ethereum remains a key player in the crypto landscape and is preparing for another upgrade in 2025. The anticipated Fusaka fork is expected to raise the gas limit to 150 million, helping to ease network congestion and bring down transaction costs. With ETH currently ranging between $1,749 and $1,855, developers stay focused on scalability and efficiency. Daily active addresses have increased by 22%, reaching 485,000 as of April 27, indicating growing engagement. While Ethereum may not offer the dramatic ROI of newer tokens, it is one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025 due to its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 ecosystems. With the upcoming upgrade, ETH could enter a new phase of broader adoption and technical refinement. 3. Cardano: Rising Volume, Protocol Upgrades, & Regulatory Optimism Cardano is gaining traction in terms of network upgrades and price. ADA recently reached $0.72 after a long consolidation period, with trading volume spiking 46%. It’s also overtaken Dogecoin in market cap, due to consistent developer efforts. The April 25 progress report highlights ledger improvements and roadmap advancement toward future eras. Founder Charles Hoskinson has added momentum by suggesting that U.S. crypto legislation could pass by September, potentially easing regulatory hurdles. This combination of technical updates and a more favourable policy landscape makes Cardano one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025. With stronger fundamentals and a refocused community, ADA shows signs of a major comeback. 4. Solana: Network Stability & DeFi Growth Drive Strength Solana has bounced back to $142, supported by a critical bug fix that strengthened token security. Its network activity is on the rise, with total value locked in DeFi surpassing $4.9 billion. Solana is also moving forward on governance, including a proposal to cut inflation from 4.5% to 0.87%, even though it didn’t reach the vote threshold. The protocol thrives in 2025 with high throughput and a growing ecosystem. Solana is also seeing increasing institutional interest and integration into mainstream apps. For investors searching for scalability and on-chain usage, Solana holds a clear place among the best long-term cryptos for 2025 with continued growth potential ahead. 5. Litecoin: ETF Buzz Sparks Renewed Confidence Litecoin is back in the spotlight, this time due to speculation surrounding a potential ETF approval by the SEC for Canary Funds. A decision is expected around May 5, and if approved, it could push LTC well past $100. Currently trading near $87, Litecoin has already gained nearly 10% in two weeks. Technical patterns, like the Pi Cycle Top, are signalling short-term upside. What gives Litecoin its staying power is its user base. Over 20% of its supply has been held for five years or more, indicating strong long-term conviction. Even without flashy features, its consistency and low transaction costs continue to appeal. If the ETF receives a green light, Litecoin could become one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025, proving that steady fundamentals can still deliver big results. Why BlockDAG Stands Out in 2025 Each of these five projects offers something valuable: proven platforms, growing communities, and clear development plans. But BlockDAG stands out of the best long-term cryptos for 2025 because it brings everything together in one presale: working infrastructure, massive user interest, and a clear roadmap to launch. With over $231.5 million raised, a live beta testnet, 25% referral incentives, and centralised exchange listings confirmed, BlockDAG is already delivering, and it’s still priced at $0.0019 for a few more days. That rare blend of traction and affordability puts it ahead of the rest. The biggest opportunities in 2025 may not come from the giants we already know.

Members of two criminal organizations in Maryland have been charged with participating in a criminal gang, attempted murder, armed carjacking, armed robbery, assault and firearms-related counts, reports WMAR 2 News. Authorities say the groups targeted customers visiting physical bank branches, specifically at Bank of America, Capital One, Wells Fargo and Navy Federal Credit Union. The groups would allegedly follow victims after they used an ATM or emerged from inside the bank – striking them at their homes or businesses. In one especially bold move, the thieves are accused of purposefully crashing into a victim’s car to force a stop, robbing them at gunpoint. From August 2023 to July 2024, prosecutors say the groups robbed 34 victims of over $155,000 across five Maryland counties. At time of publishing, a total of seven people have been indicted.

Would you follow suit and adopt a bold Bitcoin treasury strategy like the one pioneered by Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy? This was a real consideration for Coinbase , as revealed by none other than its CEO, Brian Armstrong. Why Did Coinbase Consider a Bold Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? The idea of holding significant amounts of Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet gained considerable traction, largely thanks to Michael Saylor’s aggressive approach at MicroStrategy. For many, Bitcoin represents a potential hedge against inflation, a store of value in uncertain economic times, and a way to signal confidence in the future of digital assets. Companies adopting this strategy often aim to: Preserve purchasing power of corporate reserves. Potentially benefit from Bitcoin’s price appreciation. Attract investors interested in crypto exposure. Diversify traditional treasury assets (like cash or bonds). Given Coinbase ‘s position at the heart of the crypto ecosystem, exploring such a strategy seemed almost natural. They are deeply familiar with Bitcoin and other crypto assets , understand the market dynamics, and have the infrastructure to manage these holdings. The potential benefits – aligning their balance sheet with the asset they facilitate trading for, potentially boosting returns on treasury holdings – were likely appealing. Understanding the ‘Saylor-Style’ Bitcoin Strategy When we talk about a ‘Saylor-style’ Bitcoin treasury strategy , we are primarily referring to the actions taken by Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy starting in 2020. Their approach was characterized by: 1. Aggressive Accumulation: MicroStrategy didn’t just dip its toes in; it went all-in, making Bitcoin its primary treasury reserve asset. 2. Funding Mechanisms: Saylor famously used various methods to fund these purchases, including issuing convertible senior notes (debt) and selling company stock (equity). This allowed them to acquire far more Bitcoin than their operational cash flow alone would permit. 3. Long-Term Conviction: The strategy is underpinned by a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a digital store of value. This model was revolutionary for publicly traded companies and sparked a conversation about corporate Bitcoin adoption globally. It demonstrated that companies could use traditional financial tools to acquire and hold a non-traditional asset. Why Did Coinbase Pump the Brakes? The Risks Involved Despite the potential upside and the trend of increasing corporate Bitcoin adoption , Coinbase ultimately decided against fully embracing the ‘Saylor-style’ model. Brian Armstrong pointed to significant risks, particularly concerning cash flow and the company’s stability as a still-growing entity. Here’s a breakdown of the potential risks that likely factored into Coinbase’s decision: Cash Flow Sensitivity: As an exchange, Coinbase’s revenue is heavily reliant on trading volume, which can be volatile. Holding a large, illiquid asset like Bitcoin (relative to cash needs) could strain operational liquidity, especially during market downturns or unexpected expenses. Startups and growth companies often prioritize cash on hand for flexibility, payroll, and investments in infrastructure and talent. Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings. A significant drop could lead to substantial impairment losses on the balance sheet under current accounting rules (though this is changing). This could negatively impact earnings, investor perception, and even the company’s ability to raise capital. While MicroStrategy has accepted this volatility, for a financial services company like Coinbase, it could be seen as a greater systemic risk. Regulatory Scrutiny: Holding large amounts of crypto assets , especially Bitcoin, could attract increased attention from regulators, potentially complicating compliance efforts and future business expansions. Potential Conflict of Interest: Coinbase’s core business is serving its customers who trade crypto. Holding a massive corporate stash of the same assets could, in theory, create perceived conflicts or raise questions about market influence, even if unfounded. CFO Alesia Haas’s comment about not competing with customers highlights this consideration. Funding Risks: While MicroStrategy used debt and equity, these methods come with their own risks – interest payments on debt, potential dilution from equity sales, and the risk of margin calls if Bitcoin was used as collateral (though MicroStrategy has managed this carefully). For Coinbase, adding significant debt or equity solely for Bitcoin purchases might not align with their growth strategy or risk appetite. Armstrong’s statement underscores that while the potential rewards of a large Bitcoin treasury might be high, the risks, particularly to a company’s fundamental operational health and cash flow, were deemed too significant for Coinbase at this stage. Coinbase’s Actual Approach to Crypto Assets Rejecting the aggressive ‘Saylor-style’ model doesn’t mean Coinbase avoids holding crypto assets altogether. Far from it. The company maintains a significant portfolio, but its strategy appears more measured and aligned with its core business operations and strategic investments rather than purely a treasury reserve play funded by external capital. In Q1, Coinbase invested $153 million in crypto, primarily Bitcoin. This demonstrates a continued commitment to holding digital assets. As of their reports, Coinbase holds approximately $1.3 billion in digital assets on its balance sheet. This figure represents a substantial holding, but it is acquired differently and serves a potentially different purpose than MicroStrategy’s vast accumulation. CFO Alesia Haas has clarified that their approach is about growing their crypto portfolio strategically without creating a situation where they are seen as competing directly with their users’ trading activities. This suggests their holdings might be related to operational needs, investment activities, or simply holding some reserves in the assets they facilitate trading for, but not pursuing a strategy of leveraging up specifically to buy as much Bitcoin as possible for the treasury alone. Is Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Still a Growing Trend? Yes, the trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption continues, although perhaps not always with the same intensity or funding methods as MicroStrategy. The Bloomberg report mentioned indicates that more firms are indeed looking at ways to incorporate Bitcoin into their strategies, sometimes using stock and debt, emulating aspects of Saylor’s model. While not every company will or should replicate MicroStrategy’s strategy due to varying business models, risk tolerances, and regulatory environments, the conversation around holding Bitcoin and other crypto assets on corporate balance sheets is now firmly established. Companies are exploring different models, from holding a small percentage of cash reserves in Bitcoin to more significant, but perhaps less leveraged, investments than MicroStrategy’s. The key takeaway here is that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to Bitcoin treasury strategy . What makes sense for a software analytics firm like MicroStrategy with a specific capital structure and investment philosophy may not be suitable for a regulated financial exchange like Coinbase with different operational demands and stakeholder expectations. Comparing Approaches: Coinbase vs. MicroStrategy Let’s quickly look at the fundamental differences in their approaches: Feature MicroStrategy (Saylor Style) Coinbase Primary Goal Make BTC primary treasury asset, hedge against inflation, long-term value store. Hold strategic crypto assets, support ecosystem, operational needs (?), potential investment. Funding Method Significant use of debt and equity financing specifically for BTC purchases. Primarily operational cash flow and existing reserves. Scale of BTC Holding Very large relative to market cap and operational cash flow. Significant, but likely more modest relative to market cap and primarily funded internally. Risk Tolerance High tolerance for volatility and debt risks for BTC exposure. Lower tolerance for risks impacting cash flow and operational stability. Customer Relation No direct customer trading platform for crypto. Core business is facilitating customer trading; avoids perceived competition. This comparison highlights why the same strategy doesn’t fit every company, even within the crypto-adjacent space. Michael Saylor ‘s vision for MicroStrategy is distinct from Coinbase ‘s operational realities and regulatory landscape. What Are the Actionable Insights? For investors and market observers, Coinbase ‘s decision offers several insights: Risk Management is Paramount: Even companies deeply involved in crypto prioritize financial stability and cash flow, especially during growth phases. The ‘Saylor-style’ strategy isn’t universally applicable. Business Model Matters: A company’s core operations heavily influence its suitability for aggressive treasury strategies. An exchange has different liquidity needs and regulatory considerations than a software company. Corporate Adoption is Evolving: While MicroStrategy was a pioneer, future corporate Bitcoin adoption may take more varied and perhaps less leveraged forms, tailored to individual company needs and risk profiles. Transparency is Key: Coinbase’s openness about considering and rejecting the strategy provides valuable transparency into corporate decision-making in the crypto space. Conclusion: Different Paths in Corporate Crypto Adoption The revelation that Coinbase considered but ultimately rejected a ‘Saylor-style’ Bitcoin treasury strategy due to concerns about cash flow risk and stability is a significant one. It underscores that while the idea of holding crypto assets on a corporate balance sheet is gaining traction, the execution depends heavily on a company’s specific circumstances, risk appetite, and business model. Michael Saylor ‘s bold approach at MicroStrategy paved the way and demonstrated a potential model, but Coinbase ‘s more cautious stance highlights the crucial importance of liquidity, operational stability, and regulatory considerations for companies operating in the dynamic crypto landscape. The trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is undoubtedly growing, but it’s clear that companies are finding their own unique paths, balancing potential rewards with very real financial and operational risks.

This move places BTC deep into range-highs territory, with the next major challenge now clearly in sight: the all-time high at $109,000. The market’s strength comes on the back of strong technical performance and increasingly optimistic sentiment, as BTC continues to lead the crypto rally and altcoins follow suit. Related Reading: Cardano Approaches Critical Resistance – Break Above Could Trigger Move To $0.80 On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds further weight to the bullish narrative. One standout metric highlights the growing confidence among large holders: the absolute difference between the Realized Price of new whales and old whales now stands at $59.7K. Specifically, new whales have entered the market at an average price of $91.9K, while old whales’ basis remains at $32.2K. This translates to a 185% relative spread to the long-term holder (LTH) basis—a massive divergence. This wide gap signals that a new wave of high-conviction buyers is entering the market at significantly elevated prices. Unlike the cautious whale accumulation during previous cycle lows, this phase reflects strong belief in continued upside, even at premium levels. It’s a clear sign that institutional FOMO may be kicking in. Bitcoin Faces Resistance At $104K As Whale Activity Signals Growing FOMO Bitcoin is currently encountering resistance around the $104,000 mark—a level that may take time to break as it represents a critical barrier before entering price discovery above the all-time high near $109,000. The recent rally has shown remarkable strength, but as BTC consolidates just below its ATH, some selling pressure is expected. A successful breakout could lead to a swift surge beyond $109K; however, failure to do so may result in short-term consolidation or retracement. Top analyst Axel Adler shared key on-chain insights on X that highlight the evolving psychology of Bitcoin’s largest holders. According to Adler, the absolute difference between the Realized Price of new whales ($91.9K) and old whales ($32.2K) is $59.7K, representing a 185% relative spread to the long-term holder (LTH) basis. This sharp divergence reveals that new “whales” are entering the market at nearly three times the price of early entrants. In comparison, the same spread in November 2022 was only 62%, indicating more cautious accumulation near the market bottom. The current surge to 185% reflects rising confidence and FOMO, with large buyers willing to accumulate even at elevated prices. For context, during the 2021 cycle peak at $63K, the spread widened to 437%. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Extremely Undervalued Against BTC’ – Supply Pressure May Delay Recovery This trend suggests that the market is entering a more aggressive accumulation phase, where belief in higher prices is driving demand despite the premium. If bulls manage to absorb the resistance around $104K, it could mark the start of a parabolic move—fueled not just by momentum, but by conviction from both retail and institutional players betting on a new Bitcoin all-time high. BTC Price Analysis: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading around $103,000 after reaching a high of $104,300 earlier today. The 4-hour chart shows BTC facing resistance at the $103,600 level, which aligns with a key supply zone from late December 2024 and early January 2025. This area acted as a previous rejection point during the last major rally and is now being tested again as potential resistance. BTC’s recent surge from the $87K–$90K consolidation zone has been aggressive, breaking above both the 200 EMA and 200 SMA (currently at $91,806 and $89,400, respectively) with strong volume. This confirms bullish strength and trend continuation, suggesting that buyers are still in control. However, the current range between $103K and $104K is historically significant, and bulls may need to absorb selling pressure before attempting a move toward the all-time high near $109K.

Market structure remains bullish overall, but this resistance zone will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin enters price discovery or pauses for accumulation.

The company said it wanted to discuss how staking should be treated, including the possibility of allowing exchange-traded products (ETPs) to offer staking features. The company noted that while Ether ETFs have been successful, they are incomplete without the ability to stake. BlackRock’s current Ether ETF filing does not describe staking. However, the firm also believes that Ethereum ETFs are missing out on the full value without staking. During the meeting, the asset manager said it wants to offer Ether ETFs that can engage in staking so investors can earn additional yield. Other leading crypto ETF players, such as Grayscale and some regulators, agree. Grayscale also filed for rule changes to bring staking to its Ether ETF. In April, the SEC postponed its decision on Grayscale’s proposal. That demonstrates how carefully the regulator is tiptoeing into staking features. Even then, if the SEC permits staking in Ether ETFs, it could pave the way for similar ETFs based on other cryptocurrencies that also use proof-of-stake, such as Solana or Cardano. BlackRock explores blockchain tokenization of traditional assets In addition to staking, BlackRock spoke about tokenizing products from the traditional world of finance — such as bonds, real estate, or other assets. This entails converting assets such as bonds or stocks to blockchain-based tokens. Tokenization is a hot topic in finance. It has several advantages, like shorter settlement times, lower fees, and the ability to trade around the clock (unlike traditional markets, which close on weekends and holidays). The asset manager already dominates this field with its digital fund “BUIDL.” This fund is known as a tokenized or STO (security token offering) fund comprising U.S. Treasury assets. The Ethereum blockchain powers it and holds about $2.9 billion in digital currency. That makes it the largest fund of its kind anywhere. Franklin Templeton also operates in this ecosystem, launching its “BENJI” tokenized fund. The two firms are among the early movers in a market that could transform securities trading. Brokerage firm Robinhood is said to be developing its blockchain. The plan is to allow individual European investors to trade U.S. shares in tokenized form. If successful, it could upend traditional financial firms and inject more transparency and speed into trading. BlackRock–SEC talks signal rising institutional interest This is the second time BlackRock has gone to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force this year. The inaugural session was held on April 1 and focused on the firm’s proposed Ethereum ETF. These ongoing discussions hint at growing interest from big finance for crypto-linked products. They also indicate that the SEC is receptive to hearing from the public but cautious. Only a handful of spot Bitcoin ETFs have been approved by the SEC, with the first one from BlackRock in January 2025. That’s one of the most important things ever. But the chatter is now around Ethereum. What are Ethereum’s new ETFs likely to include? The SEC has not yet decided whether it should let staking happen. But when such calls are coming from the likes of BlackRock and investor demand has been increasing for more inventive strategies, a decision may not be far off. A decision favoring the ETFs could set off a burst of new ones, offering investors more opportunities to profit from digital coins — and further eroding the wall between mainstream finance and blockchain tech.

Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of those tokens — quietly positioning itself to break out, with some analysts projecting that it could hit $1 much sooner than expected. Still priced at just $0.025 during its presale, MUTM has started gaining traction among long-term investors looking for practical utilities and sustainable token models. With over $7.75 million already raised and the fourth presale phase more than 65% complete, the token’s early momentum is building — and the current price level won’t be available for long. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Let’s look at a simple example. An investor who enters Mutuum’s presale with $2,200 today would be securing a position at one of the lowest price points before listings begin. When MUTM reaches $1, that investment would become $88,000 — a transformation that’s not based on hype, but on well-defined mechanics and a growing foundation of functionality. For those exploring what crypto to invest in right now, these are the kinds of entry points that rarely last once exchange visibility kicks in. One of the strongest features of Mutuum Finance is how it structures lending. Instead of offering a single route, the protocol supports both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. In the P2C system, users deposit their assets into a shared liquidity pool, which is then made available to borrowers who provide overcollateralized positions. Interest rates adjust dynamically depending on how much of the pool is in use, ensuring a balance between supply and demand. The P2P model gives users full control by allowing them to negotiate terms directly with one another. This model is particularly useful for lending out speculative tokens like meme coins — such as DOGE or PEPE — which may not be supported in the shared pool. The flexibility of the two-tiered system opens up the platform to a wide range of strategies, appealing to both conservative lenders and high-risk borrowers. Another major development is Mutuum’s ongoing work toward Layer 2 compatibility. This isn’t just a technical upgrade — it’s a move that directly supports scalability and cost-efficiency. With Layer 2 support, users will be able to interact with the platform at faster speeds and lower gas fees, without sacrificing security or decentralization. This kind of foresight is one of the reasons some are labeling MUTM as a top crypto to buy before it breaks out, especially as network congestion and cost remain persistent challenges in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance has also made security a priority. All smart contracts are currently undergoing a full audit by CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms in the industry. This step not only protects early users but also signals that the team is focused on transparency and long-term trust — two factors that play a major role in serious crypto investment decisions. The token is still in its early presale stage, priced well below its confirmed launch rate of $0.06. Once the fifth phase begins, the price will increase to $0.03, trimming down the potential upside for those who waited. That small difference today could become a much larger gap in returns if the token reaches higher milestones — especially the $1 mark that many believe is within reach given the project’s utility-first approach. Mutuum Finance isn’t trying to replicate the hype-driven paths of other tokens. Instead, it’s focused on building infrastructure that solves real problems in decentralized finance — while aligning token value with actual platform usage. Between its two lending models, upcoming Layer 2 capabilities, and verified smart contract audit, the groundwork for long-term success is already being laid. For those asking which cryptocurrency is the best cheap crypto to buy now, MUTM is starting to look like one of the most promising bets. The price is still under 3 cents — but based on its roadmap, growing adoption, and token-linked revenue model, that likely won’t be the case for much longer.

Arbitrum’s focus on Layer-2 rollups and reward programs helped it move near $1.10 during Q1 2025. At the same time, Stacks gained from Bitcoin’s strong showing, rising from $0.69 to $1.12 by adding smart contract features to BTC’s base. While both projects highlight solid development, Web3Bay is gaining interest for a different reason. Its low entry point and multi-stage presale are showing how timing can lead to stronger gains. Now in Stage 5, the project’s structured rollout is rewarding those who act early. Why Web3Bay’s Early-Stage Entry Could Make a Big Difference Web3Bay’s crypto presale is now in Stage 5 of 28, with more than 420 million tokens sold and nearly $2 million raised. The current price is $0.00524, but each new stage brings a higher price. That means early buyers are securing more tokens for less before the next increase. This kind of pricing model supports those who think ahead. It gives a clear benefit to early buyers, helping them build larger holdings while keeping costs low. It’s not about chasing the market, it’s about acting before the shift. The 3BAY token isn’t just built for price growth. It supports a decentralized e-commerce platform, giving holders access to payment perks, staking rewards, and voting power. These real uses support token demand over time. With early-stage pricing still open and clear value built into the project, Web3Bay is gaining attention from people looking for working ideas in crypto. Acting in Stage 5 could be the last low-cost chance before the price begins to climb faster. Arbitrum Shows Steady Growth as Ethereum’s Key Layer-2 Partner Arbitrum has slowly but firmly built its name as a major Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, improving speed and lowering costs through its optimistic rollup system. Since launch, the project has focused on growing its ecosystem, bringing in developers and users through strong performance and early rewards. A big part of this growth came from major airdrop events and incentive campaigns that helped boost user activity and strengthen the network’s community. In Q1 2025, ARB saw stronger price movement, trading between $1.05 and $1.10 by late April, as confidence rose from both everyday users and larger investors. The network has also built deeper ties with leading dApps and DeFi projects, which has helped it remain relevant in the expanding Ethereum space. As a result, with more transactions and active developers, Arbitrum continues to grow as part of Ethereum’s scaling effort. Its system of rewards and tools is showing it can support lasting growth and loyalty in the long run. Stacks Builds on Bitcoin’s Strength in Early 2025 At the same time, Stacks has developed a strong position by bringing smart contracts and apps to Bitcoin in a way that keeps its original design untouched. Its goal of adding new features while using Bitcoin’s security has drawn developers looking for both trust and flexibility. Stacks has moved forward with steady upgrades, focusing more on long-term progress than short-term buzz. Early investors saw real results as STX kept building, helped by the launch of Clarity contracts and the arrival of stacking rewards. In Q1 2025, STX traded between $0.69 and $1.12, lifted by more usage in Bitcoin-based apps and rising interest in projects connected to Bitcoin. As Bitcoin regained attention, Stacks gained as well from interest in making BTC more usable. The continued growth of developer support and grant programs has helped its wider network expand. As more users explore DeFi tools built on Bitcoin, Stacks could become one of the most practical platforms for turning Bitcoin into more than just a store of value. Web3Bay Offers a Clear Path for Early Participation While Arbitrum and Stacks show how long-term progress in infrastructure can grow slowly over time, Web3Bay presents a simpler route for those looking to join early. Its tiered pricing setup supports those who take action before rising interest leads to higher entry costs. With almost $2 million raised and more than 420 million tokens sold, the Stage 5 price is set at $0.00524, creating a clear benefit for early backers. Unlike other projects still building their full use case, Web3Bay already gives buyers a working idea and a chance to shape its future. For investors who want to join before wider attention arrives, Web3Bay offers that opening right now.

While the Hedera (HBAR) price hangs near a critical $0.15 level and Tron (TRX) activity shows signs of cooling despite heavy USDT flow, BlockDAG (BDAG) is heading in a different direction. Instead of waiting for momentum, it just passed a major milestone, a full CertiK audit, and that could make all the difference in 2025. Now that its smart contracts and protocol have been officially verified, BlockDAG is showing it’s built for security and scale. Its $0.0019 presale price, which ends May 13, is still available, giving new buyers a chance to enter early. For anyone looking at which crypto will explode this year, BlockDAG’s progress is worth noting. BlockDAG Gets Certified for Security: Door Still Open For Buyers1 BlockDAG just earned a major credibility boost after completing a full audit by CertiK, putting it among the few projects with verified security before launch. CertiK reviewed the project’s main smart contracts and signed off after passing all tests. The team didn’t stop there, they added a 2-of-3 multisig wallet and a 24-hour timelock to add more protection. While many projects fix bugs after launch, BlockDAG is doing things differently by locking in security from the beginning. But it’s not only about safety. BlockDAG runs on a hybrid Proof-of-Work and DAG system, which offers both energy efficiency and speed. The beta testnet already clocks over 800 TPS and allows for parallel block confirmations. That makes it scalable too. More than 1 million users are already mining with the X1 app, signaling growing interest and network use. The crypto presale is still live, with BDAG priced at $0.0019 until May 13. It’s currently in Batch 28. So far, over $231.5 million has been raised, and more than 19.8 billion BDAGs have been sold. The launch price is set at $0.05, offering early buyers a potential 2,531% return. You can buy BDAG using ETH, BTC, USDT, BNB, SHIB, DOGE, XRP, ADA, and several other popular cryptos. If you’re asking which crypto will explode, BlockDAG checks every box: strong tech, growing adoption, verified security, and serious upside. With CertiK’s stamp of approval, it just became an even stronger contender. This could be the right moment to take a closer look before exchanges get involved. Can Hedera (HBAR) Price Hold the $0.15 Line? The Hedera (HBAR) price is hovering near $0.1503 after sliding down from $0.19. Sellers have had the upper hand lately, with a pattern of lower highs and lower lows forming a bearish trend. HBAR attempted to bounce from $0.175 but couldn’t push past the $0.185 resistance. If the current level breaks, the next major support is around $0.1276. Trading volume has remained low, which only adds to the downward pressure. On the 4-hour chart, a bearish flag breakdown suggests more downside could be ahead. Earlier this year, HBAR touched $0.40, but the rally didn’t last. If bulls can’t move it back above $0.2007, it may continue to struggle. Without a pickup in buying volume, traders could start focusing on other assets that show better recovery signals. Is Tron (TRX) Activity Slowing or Building for a Breakout? Tron (TRX) activity has cooled a bit on-chain, yet the price has held up well. TRX is trading near $0.2495, with a 2.6% gain over the last two weeks, even as overall market momentum dips. On-chain data shows fewer new wallet addresses and a drop in gas use, usually signs of declining user activity. But analysts think this might be a classic buildup phase rather than weakness. Historically, slow periods like this have often preceded sharp price moves. There’s one bright spot, USDT supply on Tron just hit a record high of over $71 billion, second only to Ethereum. This shows that Tron (TRX) activity remains strong when it comes to stablecoin transfers, even if other metrics are soft. Tron’s low fees and high liquidity continue to attract DeFi users. If this pattern holds, TRX might be gathering strength under the radar and setting up for its next price surge. What to Watch Next? Tron (TRX) activity is down in some areas, but USDT usage suggests hidden strength. At the same time, the Hedera (HBAR) price is struggling to hold key support at $0.1503 and could dip lower without stronger buyer action. Both are at make-or-break moments. TRX might be preparing for a breakout, while HBAR could slip further if support fails. But if you’re wondering which crypto will explode , BlockDAG is making a clear case. It just passed CertiK’s full audit, confirming its smart contracts and protocol are built right. Its hybrid model, no-code tools, and focus on privacy are all points in its favor. With a presale price of $0.0019 available until May 13 and $231.5 million already raised, the numbers speak for themselves. The listing price is locked in at $0.05, meaning serious upside potential.

XRP gained over 8% even after news of a serious JavaScript library flaw. At the same time, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) surged 32% before hitting strong resistance. While traders analyze the future paths of these assets, a new name is quietly gaining momentum: Dragoin. Currently priced at $0.0000386, Dragoin ($DDGN) isn’t relying on hype. It offers a live beta game, contract audits, and a design prioritizes privacy. While many projects are still promising future products, Dragoin is delivering now. With its functional game and built-in user protections, it’s becoming one of the top crypto coins, drawing real attention. XRP Holds Up Despite XRPL Code Breach XRP rose 8.14% over the past day and 9.66% this week, trading near $2.27, even after a serious flaw surfaced in one of its main developer tools. A backdoor in the XRPL JavaScript library, found on NPM, exposed users to wallet key theft. This did not affect XRP’s core protocol but raised concerns across developer communities. Despite this, XRP’s price pushed past its usual $2.00–$2.14 range, lifted by Bitcoin’s broader market rally. Analysts say strong overall demand helped soften the impact of the news. Even so, security experts are urging developers to check their tools to prevent supply chain risks manually. XRP’s strength shows trust remains for now, but platform teams must improve transparency and safety to keep that confidence going forward. PENGU Hits Resistance After Sharp 32% Climb Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) jumped 32% in just one day, breaking out of a long-term triangle and hitting $0.0068, its best price since March. A bullish daily candle helped confirm the move, but the rally slowed at $0.0070, a level it had reversed before. Market tools like Weighted Sentiment jumped to 1.05, hinting at overheated vibes. RSI touched 65.39, signaling that buying pressure is building but not yet overextended. Chart watchers now see $0.0070 as a key level. If it breaks with substantial volume, another leg higher could follow. But if it fails, the price could return to $0.0060 or even $0.0054. PENGU remains volatile, but its fast rise has put it under the spotlight as one of this week’s top crypto coins. Dragoin: Real Product, Audited Contracts, and 6,700% ROI Potential Dragoin is stepping up with fundamental tools and a working product, something rare for presale projects. At just $0.0000386, it’s attracting early traction, thanks to a Telegram-based Tap-to-Earn game that’s already live and being used. Unlike many presales relying on roadmaps and future hopes, Dragoin is fully functional. Its strong user base is no accident. The design focuses on user privacy from the start. There is no IP logging, third-party scripts, or behavior tracking, just a clean, secure experience. For a crypto platform, this stands out. Dragoin’s structure favors user control and safety. Back-end security is also solid. Smart contracts have already passed audits, providing transparency on how the system works, which helps remove uncertainty for users. The presale entry of $0.0000386 comes with a planned launch price of $0.002, which opens a path to a potential 6,700% ROI. Dragoin isn’t just about future vision; it’s about the value users can unlock today. With privacy-focused tech, working gameplay, and a strong foundation, Dragoin is quickly being seen as one of the top crypto coins to watch. At a time when many projects overpromise, Dragoin is showing results. That’s what makes it different and why it’s gaining momentum now. Final Overview XRP’s ability to grow despite a major code flaw shows how demand can often outweigh concerns, at least in the short term. Long-term strength will still depend on improved system checks and open communication. PENGU’s breakout confirms meme coin energy remains strong, but its next move depends on whether it clears $0.0070 with power. In contrast, Dragoin offers clarity. With a price of $0.0000386, a real game already live, and security measures built in, it’s delivering what others delay. For those exploring top crypto coins with real functionality, Dragoin offers a working platform, not just hype.

However, the company ultimately decided against going all-in on Bitcoin, citing concerns over the risks to its startup status and financial stability . Coinbase chose risk management over Saylor-style Bitcoin gamble On a Friday video discussion on the X social network, Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase , looked back at his company’s decision-making. He admitted that at various times over the last 12 years, the thought of putting 80% of their balance sheet into crypto — especially Bitcoin — was interesting. But as tempting as it was to get in on the action, Coinbase didn’t want to take such a danger-fraught route. Armstrong said the move was calculated by assessing risks. He noted that going all in on Bitcoin would have risked the financial solvency of a startup and possibly “killed” the company. It was a reasoned decision arising from how to manage risk well. While Coinbase declined to take the Bitcoin bet Saylor’s company made, it still sits on a sizable crypto portfolio. However, according to its latest shareholder letter, the company purchased $153 million in cryptocurrency, mostly Bitcoin, in the first quarter of 2025. Its investment portfolio is now worth $1.3 billion in crypto assets. Alesia Haas, Coinbase’s chief financial officer, who also appeared at the X discussion, emphasized the company’s conservative stance. She said the company did not want to be seen as in competition with its crypto investor customers. Haas also said the firm will grow its crypto holdings. Companies follow Saylor’s lead, emulating his Bitcoin strategy Meanwhile, other companies have tried replicating Saylor’s model of funding Bitcoin purchases by issuing stock and debt. Since Strategy’s Bitcoin buying spree began in 2020, its shares have surged more than 3,000%, bolstered by the rising value of the cryptocurrency. Strategy currently holds approximately $54 billion in Bitcoin. Several other companies and new entities are now following Saylor’s approach to give investors different ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Among them are firms such as Twenty-One Capital Inc., which Cantor Fitzgerald LP, Tether Holdings SA, and SoftBank Group back. Meanwhile, a subsidiary of Strive Enterprises, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, is merging with Asset Entities Inc. to form a Bitcoin treasury company. In other news, Next Technology Holding Inc. shares soared more than 600% on Friday after the Beijing-based software company announced that it had substantially upped its Bitcoin holdings from 833 BTC to 5,833 BTC, causing volatility halts in the stock. Coinbase launches 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum futures trading for US Investors On Friday, Coinbase Derivatives officially activated 24/7 trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, becoming the first CFTC-regulated derivatives exchange to offer around-the-clock access to crypto futures contracts in the US. Coinbase first revealed the initiative in March, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional US trading hours and the global crypto market, which makes up over 75% of worldwide trading volume. The exchange will provide both nano and large-sized contracts. Coinbase’s latest offering lets U.S. investors trade, hedge, and manage exposure around the clock, matching the nonstop nature of crypto markets. The exchange has built its infrastructure to support this new setup, with all trades cleared through Nodal Clear, a CFTC-regulated clearinghouse that operates 24/7. Major firms like Virtu Financial help provide liquidity. While Coinbase has remained cautious about fully adopting a Bitcoin-centric strategy, the surging interest in crypto-based corporate treasuries underscores the growing allure of Bitcoin as a store of value in the corporate world.

Hyperliquid began its life as a focused, app-specific chain but has gradually transformed into something much more complex and interesting—a dynamic ecosystem that now attracts large crypto investors (or “whales”), active traders, and growing interest from institutional players. Hyperliquid Surpasses $1 Billion in TVL @HyperliquidX continues to strengthen its presence in the crypto market, recently surpassing the significant milestone of $1 billion in Total Value Locked. What began as an app-specific chain is now steadily evolving into a more robust and… pic.twitter.com/xw3h4FHGZ8 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 8, 2025 This accomplishment signifies a key turning point for Hyperliquid as it establishes itself as a high-performance decentralized exchange meant especially for trading perpetual futures. The $1 billion TVL threshold not only reflects user confidence in Hyperliquid but also highlights its emergence as a serious player in the Layer 2 and DeFi derivatives spaces. High Stakes: Whale Doubles Down on HYPE Short Position Amid Mounting Losses While celebrating Hyperliquid’s swift expansion, a high-stakes drama unfolds on the platform’s trading floors. A leading whale trader has positioned a colossal leveraged short against HYPE—Hyperliquid’s native ecosystem token—even as the market has shifted against him. A whale just deposited another $1.8M $USDC into #Hyperliquid , doubling down on a losing $HYPE short. In the past week, this whale has funneled $10.36M into a 5x leveraged position—now worth $29.1M—with a $1.24M unrealized loss and liquidation looming at $25.01. Will the whale… pic.twitter.com/MmLxDvCqGw — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) May 7, 2025 As per on-chain information, this whale has put in another $1.8 million of USDC into Hyperliquid in the last 24 hours, intensifying what looks like a seriously bearish stance on HYPE. This new capital is being used to bolster a very significant short position that is currently being opened with 5x leverage. Overall, the trader has now channeled $10.36 million into this one position over the last week. That leveraged bet has since swelled to $29.1 million, even as the trade heads into the red. At present, the whale is looking at an unrealized loss of approximately $1.24 million and a liquidation price that is gushing blood at $25.01. This action has attracted much focus from the Hyperliquid community and wider crypto trading spheres. Although high-leverage positions are standard fare in the perpetual futures market, the scale and timing of this specific trade—executed at a time when the platform was enjoying growth and positive momentum—has prompted a number of onlookers to scrutinize what the whale is really up to. Should the price of HYPE keep climbing and get close to the liquidation limit, it might set off a chain reaction of liquidations, and we’re not just saying that because it sounds good. We mean it. Why? Because it’s a huge position we’re talking about. Conversely, if sentiment shifts and the token’s price falls, the whale stands to make a ridiculous amount of money. If that happens, it could turn out that this THAAD (that’s right, we said it) in HYPE is a contrarian profit play. Hyperliquid’s Growing Role in the DeFi Landscape The drama’s broader backdrop is Hyperliquid’s rapid ascension in the DeFi rankings. It has managed to build a nimble and efficient on-chain environment for advanced derivatives traders. Very few newer trading platforms can make this claim. In fact, most seem to trip into the same pitfalls of user bottlenecks, unstable UX, and liquidity fragmentation that have victimized DeFi trading platform projects since mid-2020. Achieving $1 billion in TVL does not happen by accident. It requires a reliable platform that users can trust, and that is exactly what Hyperliquid has become. The platform is now attracting very sophisticated users, like hedge funds, who appreciate its speed, interface, and other configurable features. To hedge fund types, $1 billion matters because it signifies a whole lot more than just another round number in the DeFi space. Hyperliquid’s application-specific chain allows Hyperliquid to optimize for performance in ways that general-purpose blockchains just can’t. We started out with a pretty narrow focus on perpetual futures, and while we still do that—and do it really well—we’ve begun to expand into an ecosystem that is integrating stablecoin liquidity, yield-bearing instruments, and all the tokenized incentives you could want for both traders and liquidity providers. Hyperliquid is quickly becoming one of the most observed platforms in DeFi, with a rising total value locked, increasing daily trading volumes, and intensifying interest from both analysts and deep-pocketed investors. The platform’s next growth phase is upon it, and its bold whale trade is the current focus of attention. Is this oh-so-grainy picture of the CEX taking shape under platform-wide bull conditions—wherein we’re on the cusp of a brave new world for digital trading—actually a grainy picture of an expensive prescient move in a whale world for a CEX under platform-wide bullish conditions? One thing is for sure—Hyperliquid’s story is no longer just about protocol growth. It’s now about the high-risk, high-reward ecosystem it’s enabling in real time.

Fentanyl overdoses take the lives of dozens of thousands of people in the U.S. and Canada annually. China is a key player in the North American fentanyl market. According to unnamed sources cited by The Wall Street Journal, China may propose cooperation on the fentanyl crisis as an “off-ramp from hostilities” to foster dialogue with the Trum administration. Potentially, China has a resource to tackle the North American fentanyl problem as its role in this crisis and market is essential. Reportedly, Chinese chemical companies export fentanyl precursors and provide consultations to Americans wishing to synthesize the drug on online forums. China may hope for dialogue as the role of fentanyl was explicitly cited by Donald Trump when he motivated imposing the harshest tariffs on China, the only country not granted a 90-day tariff pause. The dialogue between China and the U.S. is not impossible, as recently Trump himself said, “it’s a natural thing to ask,” referring to asking China to assist in solving the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. REPORTER: Will you be asking China to help you close the gap between Ukraine and Russia? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think so. If we can get the fighting stopped that would be a great accomplishment. We're trying very hard and I think we're close. pic.twitter.com/U5G0xwIhHu — Bannon’s WarRoom (@Bannons_WarRoom) May 8, 2025 Fentanyl crisis statistics Terms like “fentanyl crisis” and “fentanyl epidemic” are no exaggeration. The word “tragedy” also fits. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid used medically as an anesthetic but far more potent than heroin or morphine. In the 2010s, recreational use of fentanyl exploded in North America, resulting in hundreds of overdose deaths daily. At the peak in 2022, the fatal overdoses on synthetic opioids (mostly fentanyl) reached nearly 80,000 in the U.S. alone. In Canada, with its 5x lower population, the numbers are not as high as in the U.S. For instance, 2023 was marked with around 6,000 deaths related to fentanyl. However, if we look at the deaths per 100,000 of the population, we’ll see that Canada is close to the U.S. Most of the victims of overdose are men under 45 years old, but the number of elders among fentanyl casualties is on the rise . The crisis affected both men and women of all ages, including preschoolers. These numbers may seem too huge to realize the scale of the tragedy. To get a more vivid and striking idea of this epidemic’s deadliness, we may think that at the peak, it was killing one person per hour in Canada and one person every seven minutes in the U.S. Although after 2022 both the U.S. and Canada saw a drop in fentanyl deadly overdoses, the epidemic scale is still damning. Council on Foreign Relations notes that the 2022 fentanyl death count is 10x bigger than the total casualties of the U.S. army in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. Comparisons to wars don’t look misplaced. The death toll in the fentanyl crisis is in line with the number of deaths in the most dismaying military conflicts of the 2020s: in Sudan , Gaza, Yemen, and Ukraine. Somehow, North America reached the point at which it has war-scale casualties, while it doesn’t participate in a war. Except for the U.S. trade war. Two countries subjected to the harshest tariffs are the key players in the fentanyl trade in America: China and Mexico. Another country that faced high tariffs is Canada. Fentanyl from Canadian Valerian Labs was a part of the problem too. Read more: U.S. DOJ indicts eight Chinese firms for using crypto in fentanyl trade Fentanyl trade: China, Mexico, and cryptocurrency In 2022, the Drug Enforcement Agency called China the prime source of fentanyl killing Americans. The drug is sent to North America from China by mail or through Mexico. Two years later, a Congressional committee claimed that China is subsidizing the production of fentanyl precursors that then turn into illicit drugs in North America. The report reads: “The PRC (People’s Republic of China) scheduled all fentanyl analogues as controlled substances in 2019, meaning that it currently subsidizes the export of drugs that are illegal under both U.S. and PRC law. [Some of the substances] have no known legal use worldwide.” Chinese authorities deny responsibility for the crisis and claim to have cooperated with U.S. enforcement efforts to suppress trafficking. AG Pam Bondi sounds the alarm: “People in China don't get addicted to fentanyl because they're shipping it to our country to kill 18-34-year-olds… It is a weapon of mass destruction in my opinion… They're killing our kids and it's got to stop.” pic.twitter.com/ehrO54syDN — Proud Elephant 🇺🇸🦅 (@ProudElephantUS) May 5, 2025 Meanwhile, cryptocurrency is playing a dual role. A February 2025 Chainalysis report highlighted how digital assets both facilitate and expose the fentanyl trade. On darknet markets, fentanyl and its precursors are often sold for Bitcoin or Monero. Chainalysis noted that some buyers and sellers don’t anonymize their activity, allowing analysts to map out trafficking networks. Cryptocurrency enables remote drug purchases and money laundering but also provides transparency that cash doesn’t. “While the cartel may have benefitted from speed, low transaction fees, and cross-border efficiency, their reliance on the blockchain has allowed investigators to trace these transactions more easily than would have been possible with traditional cash-based money laundering. Furthermore, it allows even greater disruptive potential, because issuers and centralized services typically have the ability to freeze assets when necessary.” That’s an unobvious way in which crypto facilitates drug trafficking and helps to disrupt the illicit substance markets at the same time. Conclusion Whether China is truly willing or able to dismantle its transcontinental fentanyl supply chain remains unclear. Still, it’s a powerful bargaining chip as trade talks with the Trump administration loom. In 2019, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matt Cronin put it bluntly: “It is a fact that if the People’s Republic of China wanted to shut down the synthetic opioid industry, they could do so in a day.” You might also like: Fentanyl ‘precursors’ made $32m in crypto last year, report says",Feature|Canada|China|Crime|Donald Trump|tariffs|trade war,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|ZRX,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-05-10 01:38:00

Defined by speed, ferocious competition, and furious innovation, the chain has in the past 24 hours alone turned up some explosive engagement by users and other activity that’s key for a serving of serious Layer-1 momentum. An ecosystem promising high throughput and innovative tokenomics is taking concrete shape. Core contributors like Sonic Labs and initiatives like Shadow on Sonic are pushing the project toward a vision of it becoming a high-performance, community-driven chain with long-term potential. Here’s more about the ambitious project in a nutshell. Daily Activity Soars as Ecosystem Grows The latest information from Sonic depicts a chain that is growing very quickly. Almost in a single day, Sonic was able to secure 122,700 active users — a 29% increase — that makes it sound like Sonic is kind of really heating up, promising to bring in a lot more user interest and sustained usage. May 6 alone saw 100,000 unique addresses sending out transactions, resulting in a total of 839,000 transactions in a 24-hour time span. These figures aren’t simply numeral values—merely a collection of adding and subtracting—that exist in and of themselves. They’re far more significant to an ecosystem that, in a landscape where Layer-1 not just networks but all kinds of platforms are vying for attention and throughput, seems to be gaining traction on both the developer and user sides. So what gives? Sonic is picking up serious momentum. In the past day: – 122.7K active addresses (+29%) – 839K transactions – Nearly 100K senders on May 6 alone With @ShadowOnSonic and @SonicLabs leading the charge, the chain’s ecosystem is clearly heating up. pic.twitter.com/6HIC3iTB8U — Nansen (@nansen_ai) May 8, 2025 A sizable chunk of this growth can be pinned down to the continual expansion of Sonic’s ecosystem. Two substantial factors in this ecosystem growth are Sonic Labs and the Shadow on Sonic project. Sonic Labs is building infrastructure and tooling that increase usability and utility for developers working with Sonic. Shadow on Sonic is doing the same for users of Sonic. Altogether, these projects are making Sonic the kind of network you can use right now. Sonic Construction’s competitive advantage is its ability to deliver what many Layer 1 blockchains have struggled to do consistently: perform at scale. Their current offering achieves a phenomenal 400,000 transactions per second (TPS), with the potential to do much more. This is moon math, in part because we don’t know how many TPS a Layer 1 must deliver to be useful. For now, we can only gauge Sonic’s performance in terms of the handful of TPS that leading Layer 1s purport to deliver. @SonicLabs is emerging as a new force in the Layer-1 race. With performance reaching 400,000 TPS, a deflationary tokenomics model, and a strategic dual airdrop system, $S is not just making noise — it’s laying the foundation for long-term, sustainable growth. A real… pic.twitter.com/Ou7FQxOn2o — Sonic Insider (@insider_sonic) May 7, 2025 Tokenomics and Airdrops: Building a Sustainable Growth Model Sonic isn’t just fast and active; it’s also constructing a carefully devised economic model for long-term success. This model is underpinned by a token called $S, which is a deflationary asset, designed to reward both long-term holders and active participants of the Sonic ecosystem, while also maintaining a healthy token supply over time. Sonic is attracting new participants and boosting user engagement with its innovative dual airdrop system. What makes this so engaging is that it ensures that token distribution stimulates a more active ecosystem rather than just makes token holders wait to sell their tokens for a profit in the future. Sonic rewards both kinds of people who interact with its system—not just those who participate in the system day to day but also those who potentially might be in the future. $S’s utility and deflationary design make it a sustainable token — quite unusual among the many inflationary tokens. Even so, it’s important to recognize that building a sustainable token economy fully within the Sonic ecosystem would not be possible without strong application growth and a fast-growing partner network, since the Sonic experience is a key context for users to hold and use $S. Sonic Labs has also played a crucial role in directing this model and supporting the broader ecosystem with tools, funding, and developer incentives. They furnish structure and vision, and act as a stabilizing force as the ecosystem grows. Sonic in recent weeks has shown that it is no longer just another Layer-1 hopeful but a serious contender operating in a crowded market. Seen now is an immediate next phase for Sonic, where it shifts from not just community momentum but real tokenomics momentum with an approach that allows for sustainable and scalable growth in its community. With daily activity that is absolutely sky-high and new all-time highs in daily number of transactions. Seen now is a next phase for Sonic, which aspires to achieve a more decentralized structure. In 2025, as the Layer-1 race intensifies, Sonic is more than just a pace setter — it is establishing the tone for the next generation of blockchains.

In the past day, Virtuals has delivered breathtaking price performance and continued its march toward expansion, a development that has played a significant role in pumping the otherwise lackluster total AI-agent sector valuation up to $9.28 billion. With an investor interest that is now shifting toward smaller, high-potential projects, Virtuals has been quietly going about its business of establishing itself as an AI-agent core pillar — not just because of its market cap, but also owing to its apparent technological leadership and community traction. Virtuals Sees 15% Daily Price Surge Amid Sector-Wide Gains On the day, the real showstopper was $VIRTUAL, the very native token of the Virtuals ecosystem, which saw a price increase almost in the realm of a bull rider’s reward: a 15% surge just in the last 24 hours. That brings us to the present moment, where $VIRTUAL is priced at $1.6357, and where the Virtuals ecosystem’s overall market cap is now at $1.96 billion, which is just about 17% more than what it was before today. This sharp movement upward was part of a sectoral rebound in the AI-agent group, which grew by 7.34% to hit $9.28 billion. The performance indicates reenergized interest in intelligent crypto agents, an emerging vertical that sits at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Virtuals now commands 26.45% of total mindshare in the AI-agent sector, which is up a slight 0.45%. This figure reflects both brand recognition and network effect — indicators that users and investors alike are consolidating around the Virtuals brand as the sector’s flagship platform. As the market sentiment brightens and capital rotates with gusto back into cutting-edge, AI-driven enterprises, Virtuals is cashing in on what looks more and more like a precocious bet on the future of the metaverse. The company has invested its own money (and raised some from eager investors) to build metaverse infrastructure, to put it in simple terms—right now, it has a pretty good stake in what could easily become a cornerstone of tomorrow’s internet. With the investment in place, it has a very active community both in and around its virtual spaces to serve, and it’s engaged in a constant process of iteration and improvement, which is what virtually every successful tech company does. Top Gainers: Smaller Agents Spark New Wave of Momentum While $VIRTUAL remains the cornerstone of the ecosystem, smaller cap agents within the VIRTUAL network are also seeing tremendous growth. This suggests a good distribution of capital within the ecosystem, along with a rising investor appetite for differentiated agent technologies. The list below names some smaller cap agents within the VIRTUAL network that are experiencing rapid growth. Heading the gains over the past 24 hours was GEKKO (@Gekko_Agent), which shot up by 51.2%. GEKKO’s individual trading logic and the way it’s coupled with real-time sentiment analysis tools have made it a darling of the sorts of users who favor high-frequency, data-driven decision-making. Close behind is MUSIC (@MusicByVirtuals), which gained 43.48%. This audio-focused AI agent has a strong following and a clearer path to monetization than its sibling. Personalization is at the foreground of MUSIC’s experience. Users interact with the product while it learns. And it produces something special: generative music. POLY (@polytraderAI) continued to build on its momentum as a versatile trading assistant, rising 41.6%. Its modular design allows users to program multi-asset strategies, making it appealing to DeFi traders navigating multiple ecosystems.

While SANTA is positioning itself as a gamified gift-giving and engagement engine, MISATO focuses on cross-platform identity and reputation scores — both reflecting the increasing diversity of agent use cases being explored within Virtuals. The pronounced advances of lower-cap assets mark a turn in the investor landscape. It’s one thing to buy a large, well-known token with some hope of utility. It’s another to plow money into niche, specialized AI assets that are used for specific purposes and, in many cases, are much smaller and less profitable than the top tokens. Like many AI projects, Virtuals has moved from proof of concept to real utility, but it’s not there yet. It has received sustained capital, but quite a bit of the narrative seems to be ecosystem innovation and increasing mindshare. Overall, the next stage of the Virtuals narrative seems… unclear. The recent rally isn’t only a flash in the pan—it’s an indication that the AI-agent sector is solidifying its presence in the wider Web3 economy. Virtual’s leadership in this space, alongside a thriving community of agents and developers, positions it nicely for further expansion in 2025 and well beyond.

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. Ether ( ETH ) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard. Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives . Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen. Ether 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.ch The ETH futures premium has yet to exceed the 5% threshold typically associated with a neutral market, indicating that demand for leveraged bullish positions remains notably limited. ETH's continued underperformance—trailing the altcoin market capitalization by 17% in 2025—helps explain the prevailing lack of investor confidence. Some analysts interpret this as an opening for further short covering, while others contend that Ethereum's core fundamentals have yet to improve meaningfully. Ethereum maintains leadership in decentralization and TVL Irrespective of Ether’s price action, recent network upgrades have notably enhanced layer-2 scalability . More importantly, they have helped solidify Ethereum’s position as the leading platform in terms of decentralization and security. This is reflected in Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL), which stands at $64 billion. For comparison, the three largest direct competitors—Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron—collectively hold a total value locked (TVL) of $22.3 billion. The limited demand for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has emerged as a key warning sign. Even Ether’s strongest single-day price performance in four years failed to prevent a third consecutive day of net outflows, according to data from Farside Investors. On May 8 alone, US-listed Ether spot ETFs experienced net outflows totaling $16 million. Ether US-listed spot ETFs' daily net flows, USD million. Source: Farside Investors The muted enthusiasm following Ether’s recent bullish momentum can be partly attributed to the sharp 85% drop in Ethereum network fees from January to April. Reduced network activity lowers overall demand for ETH and negatively affects net staking yields, as the protocol’s burn mechanism relies on competition for data processing. ETH options markets also offer insight into whether whales and market makers anticipate further downside risks. Deribit 30-day ETH options delta skew (put-call). Source: Laevitas.ch Currently, put (sell) options are trading at similar levels to equivalent call (buy) options, indicating a neutral sentiment. This outcome is somewhat discouraging for Ether bulls. Nevertheless, Ether could regain market attention after US President Donald Trump reversed his position following earlier public endorsements of competing altcoins. Related: Ether clocks ‘insane’ 20% candle post Pectra — A turning point? According to a Politico report published on May 8, President Trump felt he had been “used” and had severed ties with the lobbyist who reportedly proposed the idea of a strategic crypto reserve. While Trump’s social media post on March 2 specifically mentioned Solana ( SOL ), Cardano ( ADA ), and XRP, the subsequent March 6 “Digital Asset Stockpile” Executive Order struck a much more reserved tone. Despite the evident apathy in both the Ether derivatives market and spot ETF flows, a rally toward the $2,700 level remains plausible—especially if investor sentiment shifts in response to the failed lobbying efforts undertaken by some of Ethereum’s competitors.

After a sustained spell of not-so-exciting price changes, Ethereum has lately had all the excitement it can handle, capped by another nearly 10% price pop in just the last few hours. Ethereum Breaks $2,000 As the crypto market turns bullish once again, $ETH is showing strong price momentum following the recent Pectra upgrade rising 9.33% in the past 24 hours. Could this mark the beginning of @ethereum comeback? https://t.co/XMztWV1XuS pic.twitter.com/1Q2kz4WdtJ — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 8, 2025 This price action—actually upward instead of downward for a change—has a lot of traders and investors in the Ethereum ecosystem pretty pumped. And now, right on the heels of the latest price run, everyone is trying to figure out what these developments could mean for the future of ETH. Ethereum’s price surge is after a phase of fluctuating market conditions and stiff competition from other blockchain networks. But the renewed optimism around Ethereum isn’t just about the price. It’s also about what’s happening on the network. And what’s happening on the network is that it’s showing real signs of life, not just in the price, but in what people are doing with the network—its developers, for one, are super active; and two, they’re building things—activity reminiscent of crypto’s halcyon days in 2018. If the next chapter for Ethereum is an exciting one, that’s definitely a good sign for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Developer Activity and Ethereum’s Long-Term Potential One major indicator of the health of any blockchain network is developer activity, and for Ethereum, this has seen a truly remarkable resurgence. The figures show that the number of commits tagged to Ethereum open-source repositories has returned to levels seen back in 2018. More impressively, this was after Ethereum had peaked at an all-time high of 176,000 weekly commits in August 2023. Even now, Ethereum accounts for a substantially impressive 44% of all the commits being made in the weekly crypto ecosystem. Developer activity returns to 2018 levels The number of commits tagged to open-source repositories has now returned to 2018 levels after peaking at 176K weekly commits in August 2023. @ethereum ecosystem accounts for 44% of the total weekly commits, with a current figure of… pic.twitter.com/llL6UEsEaM — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 7, 2025 The increase in developer activity indicates a sharpened focus on constructing and refining the Ethereum network, particularly post-big upgrades such as the Pectra upgrade. The affair and vigor exhibited by developers signify a renewed long-term commitment to Ethereum’s steady evolution, and in the developers’ words, to “future-proofing” the network for what kind of potential growth could come its way. Notably, Ethereum’s network upgrades—especially the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and the shift to proof-of-stake—have set the stage for far greater scalability, much lower energy consumption, and overall improved network efficiency. These developments, along with a dedicated base of developers and contributors, give the Ethereum ecosystem a definite aura of vitality and innovation. Ethereum ETFs and Institutional Interest Although the price of Ethereum and the level of development activity seem to be on the upswing, the appearance of the institutional side of things is one of caution. As of May 7, Ethereum spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $21.77 million, which was really just an unfortunate reflection of the investor sentiment toward the asset. To make matters worse, none of the nine Ethereum-focused ETFs could muster up even a single dollar of net inflow during that period. So, what could this be telling us? On May 7, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $142 million, with none of the twelve ETFs recording net outflows. In contrast, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $21.77 million, with none of the nine ETFs registering net inflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 8, 2025 Even with this short dip, Ethereum continues to hold strong as a long-term viable network. Why? Because it keeps its developer activity at high and growing levels, and because it keeps up with successful upgrades. Its most recent upgrade, the Pectra implementation, has gone off without a hitch as far as I know (that is, as far as any major problems that could indicate some kind of upgrade calamity). Now, I know this is a lot of good news for Ethereum to bathe in, and trust me, I’m aware of the negative price action for the long-suffering Ether. A decline week in and week out is never a pleasant sight. But the sea of red that has become part of Ether’s price history seems to lie in direct contrast to the reality of Ethereum the network. The Road Ahead: Ethereum’s Bullish Momentum Could Signal New Heights Ethereum’s latest performance is seeing a lot of promise attached to it, as traders look to see if it can finally break through the important $2,000 mark. For many in the market, this was a key psychological barrier to get through for Ethereum and represented a serious test of its resilience. If it can maintain its upward momentum and overcome any potential resistance, there’s a possibility it could rise a lot more and potentially set new all-time highs in the months ahead. To keep the bullish movement alive, Ethereum must keep the developers interested, accomplish promised updates to its network, and furnish powerful use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other areas. Yes, the recent outflow from Ethereum spot ETFs might raise eyebrows and elicit some hand-wringing, given how much is also riding on the appearance of demand for Ethereum these days. But the ETF concern is a half-building block of a bearish narrative. The other half, which also happens to be on much more solid ground, is that Ethereum is a pretty good hedge to have in a DeFi-based portfolio over the longer term. From this point on, Ethereum’s ability to retain its crown as the preeminent smart contract platform in the crypto world will most likely determine its continued thriving in the crypto space. Backed by a fervently devoted developer community and a robustly interested cryptocurrency market, Ethereum keeps moving forward with its ongoing evolution. If nothing else, the latest price surge clearly states that the asset is not in a death spiral. Even as the crypto market moves in other directions, Ethereum remains resilient and a source of technical promise. This outlook may provide some optimism for any price pullbacks that might occur in early 2022. If Ethereum’s price continues to rise in 2022, it may do so on the back of both the momentum that the crypto market currently has and the potential future technical developments of the network.

Even with the price surge, the overall resistance levels for Bitcoin might not be as tough to topple as some experts had expected, meaning the cryptocurrency could clear these hurdles in the near future with the same ease as it did its last few rising price points. The price of Bitcoin is around $94,719, a strong support level where a substantial amount of $BTC has been accumulated. This floor seems to be solid, a sort of base the price can bounce off of as it heads toward the $100K level. However, there are obstacles to overcome on the way up, with resistance levels lying between here and the next major milestone price point at around $101,673, where once again a significant amount of Bitcoin has been amassed. Sell-Side Pressure and Resistance: On-Chain Indicators Show Limited Downside Risk One of the most critical insights that on-chain data provides is understanding the selling pressure and potential resistance in the market. When Bitcoin gets close to crucial price points, the sell-side activity tends to ramp up, often coming from holders with underperforming assets. On-chain analytics from places like Santiment reveal there’s still some serious sell-side pressure judging by the red bubbles they see on the charts. These bubbles represent volume coming from what we would call “distressed” holders. To be more precise, these sellers aren’t really distressed; they are far better positioned than they were a year ago. Bitcoin is once again approaching the $100K threshold, and on-chain data suggests potential resistance may be limited. The red bubbles highlight volume that's still in an unrealized loss; cohorts more likely to sell to break even or minimize further downside. This group… pic.twitter.com/yAhdHXp6IR — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 8, 2025 This group of likely sellers is very limited in size compared to the total available supply of Bitcoin. That essentially means that the sell-side pressure is more contained than in previous episodes where a larger number of holders were underwater. If we take together the profit-taking rendering the price action of Bitcoin for the past few weeks and the fact that profit-taking usually happens when a dire resistance level is being approached, it seems like sellers might still be at a very strategic advantage. Again, this isn’t exactly a positive delisting catalyst, but it is some indication that, regardless of the price action in the short term, buyers on the Bitcoin network are better off for now. Conversely, the levels where accumulation has occurred are apparent in the @#@substantial accumulation zones. Bitcoin is mirroring key support at $94,719, where 195,000 BTC were amassed over a short period of time. It is likely that these holders, who we term ‘believers,’ have strong incentives to defend this level. As a result, this zone becomes a good candidate to consider absence of any formation that signals a breakdown into lower levels. The path to $100,000 and up is not clear of roadblocks. A key obstacle lies just in front of us, at $101,673, where 81,910 BTC have been gathered. This is a much more prominent and wider resistance level than even the next one, at $111,732, which has also accumulated significant buying interest. #Bitcoin has established a strong support floor at $94,719, where 195,320 $BTC were accumulated. On the upside, a key resistance wall stands at $101,673, with 81,910 #BTC accumulated at that level. pic.twitter.com/PRFCKAeDFY — Ali (@ali_charts) May 8, 2025 Needless to say, if Bitcoin does head toward $100,000, much less if it surpasses that, it will have to deal with these two obvious pockets of profit-taking for traders who have been long Bitcoin. Surely, such trading dynamics could induce a consolidation at best and a retracement at worst. Whale Activity and Spot ETF Inflows Indicate Confidence in Bitcoin’s Price Surge As Bitcoin’s price keeps climbing, there has been considerable movement from Bitcoin’s big holders. On-chain data shows that these big players have been taking the opportunity to cash out a fair amount of their holdings. Santiment’s data this week highlighted that these large Bitcoin holders (i.e., the whales) sold over 60,000 BTC in recent days. This, according to Santiment, is further evidence that these big investors are taking advantage of the rising price to lock in some of their profits. Whales capitalized on the recent price surge, booking profits by selling over 60,000 #Bitcoin $BTC , shows on-chain data from @santimentfeed ! pic.twitter.com/Ilmw0zXQHx — Ali (@ali_charts) May 7, 2025 Even so, the total trend is still very much in the bullish camp, with growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as an asset; this confidence seems to be underpinning the inflow of capital into Bitcoin-focused spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On May 7, the Bitcoin ETF had a net inflow of $142 million—there were no outflows from any of the 12 ETFs that track Bitcoin. My take is that this signals a pretty robust institutional demand for Bitcoin and further reinforces the optimism under which its price might be moving. On May 7, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $142 million, with none of the twelve ETFs recording net outflows. In contrast, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $21.77 million, with none of the nine ETFs registering net inflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 8, 2025 The Road Ahead: Potential for Further Growth and Continued Volatility The current price action of Bitcoin shows that interest in the cryptocurrency market is once again escalating, with not only institutional players maintaining their interest but also long-term holders remaining true to their positions. The next few weeks could see Bitcoin testing some key price points, with a solid support level at $94,719 and resistance looming at $101,673. Volatility is a constant in the world of cryptocurrency, and investors need to stay alert to the possibility of not just rapid price increases but also swift pullbacks. That said, relatively low sell-side pressure and strong accumulation might just mean that Bitcoin is ready to break through its resistance levels and establish a new record high. Of course, there are a lot of different ways to play this scenario. Spot ETFs have been receiving decent inflows, and whales are certainly still playing a large role in price action. Those are two pretty important aspects for a healthy Bitcoin market. But, as usual, it’s mainly a question of the price itself resolving at critical levels across time frames.

For most of the year, memecoins and speculative assets have been the darlings of the headlines. Now, utility-driven tokens are stepping into the spotlight—especially those tokens that exist at the intersection of AI and decentralized infrastructure. A few tokens are emerging that seem to be winning, with $VVV, $LAYER, and $HOOK capturing most of the investor attention. That said, $TANK and $CYBER also have momentum building behind them, and if they keep moving in the direction of upward price action, they could be next in line to garner the serious interest of investors. This shift is occurring for reasons that are very much tied to artificial intelligence and infrastructure. Venice Protocol ($VVV) Dominates the AI Infrastructure Narrative At the forefront is $VVV, the native token of the Venice Protocol—also known by its handle @AskVenice. This decentralized generative AI platform empowers a multitude of possibilities, spanning text conversations, image and code generation, and more. In contrast to AI services of the traditional Web2 era, Venice resides in a computational layer that is decentralized, censorship resistant, and redefining the contours of value capture in AI infrastructure. What’s been dominating mindshare? Over the past month, there’s been a noticeable rotation into $VVV , $LAYER , and even $HOOK . $TANK and $CYBER climbed the ranks toward early May. pic.twitter.com/EBKtqb3bD4 — Nansen (@nansen_ai) May 9, 2025 In the course of just a week, $VVV has rocketed upward by more than 80%, and now has a market cap of $135 million. Its growth isn’t just hype; it’s being driven by some impressive numbers. Venice now has over 50,000 daily active users (DAUs), strong evidence that its adoption is being driven by real utility and not just a bunch of speculators. What differentiates Venice is its unique model of ‘stake-for-access.’ Users don’t pay a subscription fee or burn tokens to use the generative AI capabilities of the platform. Instead, they stake $VVV to access them. This is a clear value proposition to stakers, and it creates an interesting value loop. The more people using the tokenized service, the more demand there is for the token, which is designed to strengthen the network. If this model works, it might give AI and tokenomics something to talk about. A Broader Rotation into AI and Infra-Focused Tokens $VVV may be at the head of the pack, but it hardly runs alone. Tokens like $LAYER and $HOOK have seen mounting interest and an inflow of capital, too. Both are linked to infrastructure layers that, in the case of both tokens, aim to serve the next generation of decentralized applications, especially those driven by AI. $LAYER is all about a modular, scalable, global compute layer. It’s letting developers build highly customized, high-performance environments. And at the same time, it lets those developers rely on standard primitives, or building blocks, for the kinds of applications they’re creating. These assets reflect a more extensive market understanding: as AI becomes further incorporated into our digital existences, the infrastructure undergirding it has to be decentralized, resilient, and open. The platforms that furnish this backbone seem most primed to gain, both in user numbers and in goodwill from investors. From Speculation to Substance: Real Utility Becomes the Key Driver Right now, more than just another hype cycle is happening. With the platforms like Venice rising and the tokens that power them, the crypto market is showing signs of maturing. The way things are playing out, the story is shifting from a purely speculative rotation into something that’s more about real, long-term sustained use cases. Platforms providing decentralized AI that can’t be censored, are accessible to everyone, and are able to capture their economic value on-chain, are something I’m increasingly seeing as a very important component of the modern digital world. In that context, we’re looking at tokens like $VVV not as ephemeral, here-today-and-gone tokens, but as basic building blocks of an economic layer for decentralized AI. If the current momentum continues, expect further inflows into tokens that are based around AI and those that are in the infrastructure layer. These tokens have not only good fundamentals, but they also have the kinds of good fundamentals that are leading to them having a user base that is growing quickly. So these tokens, in particular, are not just winning “mindshare”; they are well on their way to winning “market share” as well. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In the last 24 hours, the total market cap for AI agents has soared by 17.12%, climbing to a record-smashing $10.89 billion. At the heart of this exploding rally is the AI project Virtuals, whose token $VIRTUAL has not just reclaimed, but soared past the $2.00 price point, closing today at $2.04—a 24.64% one-day gain. The total investor confidence wave that the broader Virtuals ecosystem experienced carried it to a total market cap of $2.39 billion, which is a 27.13% increase. Virtuals has 27.13% mindshare, which means it is leading the rapidly expanding AI agent market. $VIRTUAL Reclaims Momentum, Driving Ecosystem Growth Today’s performance of the virtuals was nothing short of commanding. After a brief consolidation period earlier in the week, the token staged a sharp breakout of sorts, crossed the $2.00 threshold, and peaked at $2.04 by the daily close. The 24.64% surge in price (wasn’t just a technical move—it was) driven by (heightened trading volume, renewed community attention, and a) sharp uptick in developer activity across the platform. Virtuals keeps on carving a unique space in the AI agent market by offering modular, programmable agents that can interact across decentralized applications. These agents perform tasks like automating smart contracts, managing on-chain communities, and integrating AI into DeFi protocols. The demand for these capabilities seems to be increasing and this has driven not only token demand but also ecosystem growth. At a present market cap of $1.33 billion, $VIRTUAL now constitutes over 12% of the whole AI agent field as a sector. Some analysts are closely watching this breakout to see if it can sustain itself, particularly as the usage metrics and developer traction keep climbing. Top Performers: Small Caps Stage Major Breakout Despite the attention drawn by the Virtuals, numerous smaller projects also enjoyed impressive increases over the last 24 hours.

For instance, HOLLY and VADER have both become widely used and are talked about because they offer entertainment-focused AI agents. Meanwhile, GUAN is growing and growing as an AI company because its research assistants, who are powered by AI, are helping users across the globe to conduct research. LUNA, a constituent of the Virtuals ecosystem, had a particularly strong day, rallying nearly 35% alongside the breakout of $VIRTUAL. Performance like this suggests that secondary ecosystem tokens might represent an opportunity to gain leveraged exposure during broader market moves. What’s Next? Momentum Faces a Key Test The AI agent market has surged past $10.89 billion, and $VIRTUAL has broken new ground. The momentum is undeniable. But what we should really be asking is: can this rally be sustained? A number of things will be, and rightly should be, taken into account. First, an adoption of these by users in the real world may well serve to validate the valuations in question. That takes us to the second factor: broader market conditions, especially in the crypto world, could well impact either direct or indirect sentiment toward these assets in the short term. Lastly, traditional venture capital works in cycles. The Virtuals will have to keep the spark of imagination going pretty well non-stop if it is to retain its top-of-mind status. Nevertheless, one clear thing has emerged from their output in recent weeks: the AI agent market is heating up fast, and Virtuals is placed right in the thick of it. With a relatively young but rapidly growing ecosystem, strong community support, and what Utz envisions as a clear product-market fit, the project appears well positioned to lead the next wave of decentralized AI growth.

44401868,https://nulltx.com/?p=149367,1746841707,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethereum Defies Retail Sentiment, Surges Past $2,075 Post-Pectra Dip",https://nulltx.com/ethereum-defies-retail-sentiment-surges-past-2075-post-pectra-dip/,"In the extremely volatile realm of cryptocurrency, Ethereum has once more given investors a timely reminder of a golden rule: The market frequently moves in the opposite direction of expectations held by retail investors. Just one day after the Pectra upgrade—an event long anticipated by many—failed to produce the immediate price rally that so many had hoped for and instead sent a wave of disappointment and a flurry of sell-offs in Ethereum’s direction, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has sharply reversed course. Today, Ethereum burst beyond the $2,075 level, making its peak price in over six weeks and leaving behind many who’d staked a bet on its not-so-distant future. The surge smacks of what seasoned traders might call “contrarian value”—the principle that doing what most people are not doing can lead to outsized gains. Retail Capitulation, Meme Coin Hype, and the Unexpected Rebound Yesterday’s Pectra upgrade had a quick and, for many, disheartening reaction. The immediate price action was underwhelming for the many in the upgrade camp who were just hoping for a move to all-time highs in ETH. If we are being real, though, it was mostly a narrative surrounding the upgrade that had people excited, not the math behind the upgrade itself. The narrative was mostly a way to say that we have been in a bear market for a long time, and what a bull signal this upgrade was. Retail traders who had been long on this narrative sold into weakness and, in a fit of frustration, told others to buy meme coins instead. The sentiment on social media took a distinctly negative turn as ETH’s price fell and attention turned to more exciting, unstable assets that promise quick returns. But the people who held their ground and remained calm for just a bit longer than most were rewarded at the end of that same day with an unexpectedly large uptick in Ethereum’s price. The event served to reinforce yet again the idea that having a strong, long-term belief in an investment pays off much more handsomely than giving in to the short-term buzz. The rally that brought Ethereum (ETH) up to the $2,075 mark today wasn’t just a nice number to see—it was an important sign to see. For over a month, month-and-a-half, ETH has had a hard time making any kind of headway in an upward direction. If anything, it had been mostly taking backward steps. Almost the only time in that period when ETH appeared to make even a modest gain was when it was momentarily lifting back up through the $1,750 mark. Ethereum has provided a textbook example on how it pays to be a contrarian against the retail crowd. Following disappointing price performances following the Pectra upgrade yesterday, many traders sold off their ETH bags and instructed others to do the same in favor of various… pic.twitter.com/ABIqtfnpKw — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 8, 2025 One analyst said that retail investors continue to underestimate Ethereum. ‘Every time sentiment shifts to a bearish position based on a single event, we tend to see the asset respond with strength not long after. It’s almost a case study of how markets punish emotional trading and reward strategic patience.’ The Crowd is Often Wrong—And Ethereum Proved It Again One of the clearest messages from Ethereum’s post-Pectra price action is that the market has a repeated tendency to move against retail investors. When price extremes happen—be they euphoric tops or panic-driven bottoms—they tend to occur at the very moments when the crowd is most confidently wrong in its direction. Ethereum’s recent surge fits this pattern perfectly. Traders keeping an eye on sentiment metrics, and especially those focused on social engagement and predictions of an imminent ETH price collapse, may have been alerted to the possibility of a reversal. The charting of retail sentiment extremes has become an unexpectedly valuable guide. It highlights how FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt)—which is plentiful around Ethereum these days—often sets the stage for a contrarian bounce. To recover so quickly—and decisively—suggests that what lies underneath, in the fundamentals of Ethereum, is quite strong. The network, as it stands, is aiming for the kind of scalability that will one day allow it to support something more than just a few hundred dapps and smart contracts—if not millions of them. Ethereum might be getting there, folks, and it might not be unwise to consider what this means for ether (ETH) as an investable asset. This episode serves as a lesson not just in trading Ethereum, but in the behavior of markets more generally. When fear is at its loudest, and when exits are most crowded, opportunity often lies just beneath the surface. Once more, Ethereum has reminded the crypto world that patience and fundamentals can still outperform hype and herd behavior. Ethereum continues to be near short-term highs, and because of this, all eyes can now turn to whether or not this momentum can be translated into a sustained rally. But what happens next might be a less important story than the one that’s already been told: Following the crowd in crypto is a peculiarly dangerous pastime, and Ethereum just made that point impossible to ignore.

Pi coin is holding near $0.60 after sliding sharply from its highs. XRP, on the other hand, is showing positive signs with some predicting a move beyond $5 as major support builds behind it. While these coins dominate headlines, Web3 ai is quietly gaining attention, and it might not stay quiet for long. Web3 ai is not just joining the AI crypto trend, it’s creating something practical. The platform’s dashboard brings together tools for price forecasting, yield farming, and live trading bots across Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain. Unlike many projects, $WAI is more than a symbol, it gives access to actual tools already in development. Those who missed early growth from TAO or ChainGPT may want to pay attention. As top-rated crypto options are compared, from Pi coin’s movement to the latest XRP price prediction, $WAI is shaping up to be a contender that can’t be ignored. Web3 ai: Could This Be the Top Missed 100x of 2025? Web3 ai is being developed as one of the most complete AI-driven platforms in crypto for 2025. Made for traders who prefer a unified system, it brings together DeFi features, automated portfolio tracking, real-time insights, and multi-chain access in a single layout. With 12 built-in AI modules, the platform features a deep learning price prediction tool (LSTM), automated bot trading, a scam alert system, arbitrage insights, and DeFi farming support. These tools are powered by active blockchain and exchange data, supporting Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain from the first day. $WAI also enables full access to the dashboard’s tools and gives holders a voice in future governance. What gives Web3 ai its edge is its readiness; it’s not a distant idea but a functioning product. Once $WAI is listed, the full tool suite becomes available. Currently in stage 3, $WAI stands at $0.000331. The presale has 50 stages, starting from $0.0003 and ending at $0.003267, with an official exchange price of $0.005242. This means an expected ROI of 1747% before it even goes live. With AI and crypto gaining traction together, Web3 ai is fast becoming one of the top-rated cryptocurrencies for 2025. It isn’t just creating excitement, it’s offering real services. If TAO or ChainGPT passed you by, this could be a second chance. For those exploring early-stage coins with genuine use, Web3 ai could be the one that ends up being 2025’s most talked-about miss. Pi Coin Price Slides but May Still Hold Promise Pi coin has dropped to roughly $0.60 after falling from nearly $3 earlier this year. The launch of its open mainnet brought real user interaction, including P2P payments and verified apps. However, limited exchange support and slow retail use have held its price back. Even so, momentum may return. The MACD indicator has flipped to the bullish side, and RSI data suggests a potential move toward the $0.73–$0.76 range. The project’s founder is also set to speak at Consensus 2025, which might add fresh energy if new platform updates are shared. Though still early-stage, Pi’s progress and community presence keep it on the radar for small-cap traders. XRP Price Prediction Points Toward $5 Target XRP is regaining attention, now priced near $2.23 after gaining 5% in April and reversing a long pattern of losses during the same month. Some predictions suggest a fallback toward $1.55, but others believe it could reach $5 by May based on current technical trends and increased buying activity. From a broader view, XRP has cleared regulatory hurdles, ending its legal battle with the SEC. Ripple has rolled out new futures on the CME, acquired a brokerage firm, and introduced RLUSD, a new stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar. XRP’s inclusion in a U.S. crypto reserve plan further improves its position with major institutions. These steps suggest XRP’s momentum could continue and is backed by real-world upgrades. Summing Up! Pi coin may be down from its peak, but its team is pushing adoption through real use and upcoming updates. XRP price prediction remains strong as legal clarity and major partnerships push it forward. Both show upside, but have already seen movement. Web3 ai brings something different. With a 12-tool AI platform, live market features, and a structured presale offering 1747% ROI, it’s still early in the game. Built for users who want a ready-to-go dashboard with everything from auto trading to price forecasts, Web3 ai is focused on real use, not speculation. If you’re watching the top-rated crypto and still undecided, now might be the time to take a closer look. Web3 ai could be remembered as the one that most people noticed, too late.

While some coins are still dealing with price swings, others are showing steady growth and signs of real progress. The top trending crypto projects today aren’t just riding waves; they’re backed by adoption, real-world use, and long-term goals. This article looks at four cryptos making big moves this year. Cardano is gaining momentum with large holders accumulating and a possible breakout ahead. XRP is in the spotlight with ETF speculation and futures listings coming soon. Solana is approaching a major resistance level with strong upside potential. And BlockDAG is quietly rising as a powerful crypto presale project with strong fundamentals and major growth potential. If you’re building a future-focused portfolio, these top trending crypto picks are worth watching closely. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): A Rising Star with $231.5M Raised BlockDA (BDAG) is capturing serious attention in 2025 as one of the top trending crypto projects. With over $231.5 million raised and more than 19.9 billion coins sold, it’s clear the project is drawing strong early support. What’s pushing the urgency even further is the limited-time entry price of $0.0019, available only until May 13. With a public launch set at $0.05, early backers are staring at an expected 2,531% return. BDAG isn’t just gaining traction because of numbers. It’s built as a fully EVM-compatible Layer 1 network focused on scalable, fast, and low-cost smart contract deployment. The project also emphasizes developer usability and has support from respected tech collaborators like HackerEarth and SpaceDev. The ecosystem is expanding quickly. The X1 Miner app has now passed 1 million downloads, creating a large pre-listing user base. Additionally, BlockDAG’s mining hardware has brought in over $7 million in revenue, with 17,376 miners sold so far, demonstrating real market demand. Analysts are already discussing BDAG’s potential to reach $1, and with exchange listings expected soon, the timing couldn’t be more crucial. If you’re looking for a top trending crypto that blends tech, community, and early-stage potential, BlockDAG deserves your full attention before the price window closes. 2. Cardano (ADA): Building Momentum with Whale Accumulation Cardano is steadily regaining strength. Trading around $0.72, ADA has shown resilience by rebounding from April lows and maintaining key support levels. Technical analyses suggest a potential breakout if it surpasses the $0.74 resistance mark. Notably, large holders accumulated over 420 million ADA in April alone, signaling growing confidence in Cardano’s long-term prospects. Analysts anticipate a price movement toward $1.30 if bullish momentum continues. Cardano’s ongoing development and expanding ecosystem keep it at the forefront of smart contract platforms. With a dedicated community and increasing institutional interest, ADA remains a top trending crypto for those seeking consistent growth. 3. Ripple (XRP): Anticipating ETF Approvals and Futures Listings Ripple XRP is back in the spotlight. Currently trading around $2.21, it has experienced a 7% uptick in recent weeks amid growing anticipation of a potential spot ETF approval. Additionally, XRP futures are expected to launch on the CME this May, potentially increasing trading volume and price discovery. Analysts predict XRP could reach $3.40 by mid-2025, with some forecasts suggesting a rise to $5 if ETF approval is secured. Conversely, a rejection might see prices dip toward $1.61. Nonetheless, XRP’s role in global payments and cross-border transactions ensures its continued relevance. For those monitoring top trending crypto assets with real-world applications and regulatory developments, XRP remains a key contender. 4. Solana (SOL): Approaching Critical Resistance Levels Solana has regained attention, trading around $154.65 after rebounding from April’s dip to $115. It is nearing a significant resistance zone between $153 and $155, marking a pivotal point for potential price movements. A breakout beyond this range could lead to further gains, with long-term projections aiming for $191.85 or higher by 2030. Solana’s high-speed network, active developer community, and low transaction fees continue to attract users and builders. With technical indicators aligning with growing market support, Solana offers a blend of performance and scalability. Its momentum and ecosystem strength solidify its position as a top trending crypto, especially for those interested in innovation-driven growth. Final Thoughts As seen above, these top trending crypto projects are standing out in 2025 by proving their value through utility, strong performance, and market readiness. Cardano shows solid technical patterns. XRP is gaining momentum with institutional interest. Solana brings speed and scale that continue to attract attention. But BlockDAG is rising fast. With a limited-time price of $0.0019 until May 13, over $231.5 million raised, and major partnerships secured, it’s building real traction. Strong tech and community support make it a standout. For those tracking future leaders, these four rank among the top trending crypto projects worth following this year.

After cycles filled with meme coins, flashy Layer 1s, and speculative NFTs, the focus in 2025 is clearly moving toward tokens that offer actual use. These are the ones powering real features inside crypto apps and tools. With users now more focused on function and reliability, utility tokens are quietly becoming the top performers. Unstaked (UNSD) , Ripple (XRP), and Chainlink (LINK) are three projects showing what real utility can look like. Each one tackles a unique issue using active systems and tested methods. However, they stand apart in their goals, reach, and speed of progress. Ripple (XRP): Known for Fast Global Transfers Ripple is often considered the most grounded crypto project with real-world use. Its token, XRP, helps banks and financial services move money across borders cheaply and quickly. This use case has wide demand, and RippleNet’s reach keeps growing in places like Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. This year, Ripple picked up pace thanks to clearer rules in the U.S. and new licenses abroad. On-chain activity jumped, and XRP pushed past $2.30. Analysts suggest a path to $5.00 if more big players keep using it. But XRP still faces issues around adoption. Its benefits mostly serve business users, not individuals, and it depends on big banks and legal clarity to stay useful. So while it has strong utility, it’s not widely used by everyday people. Chainlink (LINK): The Engine Behind DeFi Data Chainlink plays a key role in making smart contracts useful. It brings off-chain data like asset prices and weather updates into on-chain apps, enabling DeFi, insurance, and more. LINK tokens help pay node operators who verify and send this data. By 2025, Chainlink’s CCIP feature is seeing more use among blockchains, and partnerships with DeFi names like Aave and Synthetix have cemented its place as key infrastructure. While Ripple focuses on finance, Chainlink is embedded in developer tools. It supports back-end systems instead of user-facing apps. Its value grows with DeFi’s expansion, and it’s become a core part of how Web3 services function. Unstaked (UNSD): Powering AI Tools in Web3 Communities Unstaked shows a new kind of usefulness, AI that works for Web3 users directly. It will allow users to activate AI agents to manage and grow Web3 spaces on Telegram and X. These agents will operate without user input and only get rewarded in UNSD if they perform well. What sets Unstaked apart is its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) system. This setup tracks each task an agent completes and distributes rewards based on measurable outcomes. Web3 groups, DAOs, and NFT projects can rely on it for hands-free, AI-led activity that doesn’t require any centralized control. Currently in Stage 7 of its crypto presale , Unstaked is priced at $$0.00776 and has already brought in close to $3 million. With $20 million in launch liquidity planned for Q3 2025 and no VC or private allocations, the project gives access to the public fairly. While the AI agents are not live yet, they will go live once the presale ends and the launch begins. Compared to Ripple and Chainlink, Unstaked stands out by serving users directly. It supports content creators, project managers, and developers who need AI assistance but don’t want to depend on closed platforms. Final Thoughts! Ripple opened the door by showing how crypto can work in banking. Chainlink proved that hidden systems also carry big value. Now Unstaked brings that concept into Web3 communities by creating AI tools that work for the people, not just institutions or code. What’s becoming clear is that crypto is moving past hype into purpose. And in this space, the ones that provide real services, XRP, LINK, and UNSD, are leading from different directions but with shared importance. As more users demand actual function, tokens with clear roles and working systems will be the ones to stick around.

In his opinion, Bitcoin has already taken three distinct steps in its price trajectory: from $100 to $1,000, then to $10,000, and then to over $100,000. i’ve seen bitcoin go: – from $100 to $1,000. – from $1,000 to $10,000. – from $10,000 to $100,000. one more 10x to $1,000,000 is inevitable. — muneeb.btc (@muneeb) May 8, 2025 Ali pointed out how each move took more time but followed a familiar pattern. In 2013, Bitcoin climbed from $100 to $1,000 in four months. Four years later, in 2017, it reached $10,000. By December 2024, it had crossed the $100,000 mark. Based on that path, Ali said another 10x jump to $1 million isn’t just likely — it’s “inevitable”. However, he didn’t explain what would actually drive that kind of rise. New Projection Sees $116K Next Month The latest Bitcoin price forecast by CoinCodex has the price increasing by 13% and hitting $116,600 on June 8, 2025. Technical analysis indicates a positive trend, with 20 of the past 30 days (67%) closing in the positive. During the same timeframe, Bitcoin recorded 6.50% price volatility. Source: Alternative.me The Fear & Greed Index is currently at 73, which is Greed. Though this prediction is not quite hinting at reaching $1 million yet, it validates the notion that there is still space for Bitcoin to rise in the near future.

A US Government Buy-In Could Speed Things Up Zack Shapiro, a Bitcoin Policy Institute lawyer, also thinks that Bitcoin has a lot of potential — and quick. He studied a bill called the Bitcoin Act, which was reintroduced last March. The bill proposes the US government to purchase 1 million BTC within five years. That represents 5% of the total supply. If passed, the bill would fund the acquisition using profits from gold revaluation. Shapiro indicated that a plan like that would fuel demand so high it drives Bitcoin to $1 million earlier than anticipated. That’s provided that the bill gains momentum and secures the financing it requires.

SEI was one of those early 2024 movers that slipped through the fingers of many, and now the regret is loud. Those who acted fast when it launched turned modest entries into serious returns. But for the rest, it became yet another name on the growing list of missed crypto chances. It’s easy to brush these off—until you see what that early decision could’ve meant for your portfolio. And while SEI’s window may be closed, another door might be wide open—if you’re quick enough to catch it. Enter Qubetics . Qubetics isn’t promising magic—it’s delivering structure, purpose, and real-world integration. Built with a scheduled growth model and weekly stage-based pricing, Qubetics has caught the attention of those tracking the most popular cryptocurrency plays of the year. It’s not fueled by hype cycles—it’s grounded in planned development, including an advanced multi-chain wallet, strong infrastructure, and a presale model that’s moving at a clockwork pace. With each new stage bringing a consistent price increase, those waiting too long may find themselves sidelined once again. This might be the last chance to get in before the breakout happens. Qubetics Might Become the Most Popular Cryptocurrency Before You Realize It Those who got in on the earliest phases of Qubetics secured $TICS at just $0.01 during its initial launch back in September 2024. Since then, multiple presale stages have quietly closed, each with a precise 10% price increase every seven days. At Stage 33, the price has reached $0.2302—and many of the lowest-entry windows are long gone. Still, with only 12.85% of the total supply allocated to early community members, Qubetics remains one of the few large-scale Web3 projects offering a fair and open entry point. This isn’t just another token—it’s a tech-focused project anchored by long-term goals and immediate usability. And with the Qubetics mainnet launch confirmed for Q2 2025, there’s a clear path ahead for those aiming to align with the best crypto presale still within reach. As of now, the Qubetics presale has raised over $16.8 million, with more than 511 million $TICS sold across 26,000 unique holders. The numbers speak volumes, but it’s the ROI potential that truly makes this project stand out among other contenders for the most popular cryptocurrency . A $2,000 investment at today’s price of $0.2302 gives you 8,684 tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, that’s already $8,684, offering an ROI of 334.33%. At a $5 projection, that same amount skyrockets to $43,420. Push it to $10 or $15 after the mainnet, and your original investment could return $86,840 or even $130,260 respectively. These figures aren’t just hopeful—they’re structured outcomes based on Qubetics’ mathematical growth curve. For anyone looking to join this best crypto presale, the path is still clear. Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet is already drawing serious attention for practical reasons. Unlike wallets limited to single ecosystems, Qubetics Wallet supports integration with leading blockchains, debit card networks, and mobile pay systems. Whether you’re a freelancer receiving cross-border payments, a merchant looking for stable crypto-to-fiat conversions, or a traveler needing real-time digital access, this wallet adapts to your life. Virtual cards can be generated instantly, used globally, and canceled remotely—offering unmatched flexibility and security. Business owners can link it to payment processors like Google Pay, while everyday users gain seamless access to digital spending. In short, Qubetics isn’t building features for hype—it’s solving real-world problems. SEI’s Rise Was Loud—But All the Best Phases Are Already Gone SEI Network gained early traction by focusing on optimizing transaction throughput and minimizing latency across decentralized environments. Its early ICO price was a fraction of where it stands today, and those who entered during its genesis phases benefitted massively once the project achieved its first exchange listings and decentralized finance integrations. SEI’s technical edge quickly earned it a solid reputation in high-speed trading, which made it particularly appealing for Layer 1 scaling discussions. Community members who missed Solana’s earliest days flocked to SEI hoping for a repeat scenario—and many got just that. But those opportunities came and went fast. After reaching its all-time high within a few months of public trading, SEI became a textbook case of early participation success. Those who bought in late either settled for marginal gains or watched from the sidelines. Today, SEI remains a strong player in its category, but the overwhelming ROI potential that once surrounded its name has already diluted. That doesn’t mean it lacks relevance—but it does mean that those still searching for exponential upside are likely scanning the horizon for the next breakout. And that’s precisely where Qubetics comes into the picture. Final Call: Don’t Let the Most Popular Cryptocurrency of 2025 Slip Past You Again Opportunities like SEI don’t come around every month—and when they do, only a few get in before the big leap. The most popular cryptocurrency in 2025 might not be the one already making headlines. It might be the one still up for grabs, quietly gaining strength behind the scenes. That’s exactly what Qubetics represents today: a well-structured project, a timed token release, a non-custodial wallet application, and the clearest pricing logic in the current Web3 space. If your goal is to be part of something before the surge—not after—it’s time to act decisively. The Qubetics presale is still open, but not for long. Each stage ticks forward weekly with a built-in 10% price rise. This isn’t just math—it’s a countdown. And with Qubetics’ presale metrics and wallet infrastructure already proving their worth, it’s no surprise many believe it’s gearing up to become the most popular cryptocurrency of the year. If you’ve missed SEI and other past giants, this might be your signal to join this best crypto presale while the numbers are still on your side.

The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off Saylor said “lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” “A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added. Strategy’s Michael Saylor spoke to Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast. Source: Natalie Brunell Saylor said that many of these trustees do not have a “10-year investors mindset,” and as Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price began to rally, they took advantage and “thought this is a good exit point to get liquidity.” “So I think people less committed to the long term have taken the opportunity to exit the market and a whole new class of investors are entering by way of ETFs and by way of Bitcoin treasury companies.” After Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20 just hours before US President Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, it experienced a downtrend, falling as low as $76,273 on April 9, before starting to show signs of recovery. On May 8, Bitcoin reclaimed $100,000 for the first time since Feb. 1 after US President Donald Trump proposed tariffs. The recent price surge has pushed Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to 50.27% above their average Bitcoin purchase price of $68,569. At the time of publication, the firm holds 555,450 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $57.23 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. Saylor is surprised at US government sentiment shift Spot Bitcoin ETFs posted $564.7 in inflows over the past five trading days, according to Farside data. Meanwhile, Saylor said he’s not surprised the US government hasn’t yet bought Bitcoin for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve which Trump signed an executive order for on March 7. The reserve is holding Bitcoin that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. However, Saylor didn’t anticipate their stance to quickly change so positively following Trump’s inauguration.

44403904,https://nulltx.com/?p=149383,1746845517,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Gaming Tokens in Crisis: Millions Raised, Now Worth Pennies",https://nulltx.com/gaming-tokens-in-crisis-millions-raised-now-worth-pennies/,"Once lauded as the future of digital entertainment, Web3 gaming now confronts a stark reality. Despite pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars during the crypto boom, many gaming tokens now trade at market caps far below what those projects initially raised. The discrepancy between the capital raised and current valuations has triggered a sobering reassessment across the GameFi sector. This is no longer a mere bear market decline but a severe market revaluation. Dislocated Valuations Reveal Market Disbelief Let’s look at the figures to see how disconcerting this disconnect has become. Look at how far apart the colors are in these bar graphs. They practically took my breath away during the last meeting when our head of research presented them. Here are some of the token names he used: • LUNA • FTX token • Solana • Internet Computer (ICP) • Toncoin • Filecoin • near (NEAR) • HT • BB • PHT $GUNZ: Collected $82M → Currently assessed at $36.2M $MYTH: Collected $281M → Now under evaluation at $115.3M $SIPHER: Collected $44M → Presently trading at a mere $5.2M $AVG: Collected $27.2M → Currently sitting around $800K $AURY: Collected $108.8M → Down to an evaluation of about $8.4M The numbers are not merely technical corrections—they indicate a failure of confidence. In numerous instances, token market caps have fallen to merely 3–12% of what was initially garnered. This chasm between hope and current appearance signifies more than just subpar token action—it speaks to an increasing doubt about the business models of certain GameFi projects. Although investors once readily supplied funds to any venture that promised gaming integrated with blockchain technology or ecosystems centered around NFTs, today’s market is much more discerning. And increasingly, that discernment is manifesting in the form of disappointing investment returns. Why the Collapse? A Combination of Structural and Market Forces Between 2021 and 2025, Web3 gaming had a seemingly endless string of excitement. VCs invested in Web3 gaming at a breakneck pace, driven by the belief that it would help bring to life visions of the “metaverse”—the virtual environment where most of our future digital lives will take place—and create a new economy that would make some games play-to-earn. Yet, these investments have yet to demonstrate the sort of returns that other, more traditional segments of the gaming industry have secured. Now dragging valuations down are a few core problems: Protracted Development: Creating games of the sort and quality that funders expect takes not just years but many years. Even was launched in December 2022, still struggles to engage its intended gamer demographic. Much of what came after 2021 seems to have lacked in even this basic respect. Holding Invested Users: Of the relatively few users who can bob by in daily active user status, the level of engagement across the portfolio is poor and shallow. Better player engagement is necessary to bring any portfolio game into a sustainably profitable state and/or justify a game’s crypto pay-to-play economics. Token Utility and Demand: A majority of the portfolio projects without a portfolio game have either a token or something like a token. Among these games, and the projects have few ways of either generating or purposing meaningful demand for these tokens. Gaming Tokens: Raised Millions, Now Worth Pennies ? A brutal truth for Web3 gaming market caps are collapsing far below what projects raised. Here's a breakdown pic.twitter.com/0RXf4dE2zC — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) May 9, 2025 The outcome? Efforts that have gathered nine-figure sums now confront the stark reality that tokens lacking product-market fit or genuine community engagement are just too risky to be seen as viable investment opportunities in today’s climate. A Critical Inflection Point for Web3 Gaming Dangerous feedback loops happen when a token’s market cap drops below the amount of total capital it has raised. This is what is happening, for instance, with Axie Infinity (AXS). ‘Liquidity dries up,’ CoinDesk explains in an article. ‘That makes it hard for traders to enter or exit. New investors are understandably wary about putting their money in something the market has already heavily discounted. Most critically, future token emissions—supposed to incentivize players or fuel game economies—become value-destructive when you already have such a market scenario.’ The token is instead an obstacle to growth. This mismatch between the raised capital and market cap reflects a deeper problem. The market loses faith in many Web3 games to convert capital into sustainable ecosystems. Their development seems really hard, and it might not be leading to any sustainable ecosystem the market wants. It raises a deeper question: Are any of these games the ones that will give Web3 its needed capital markets success? For creators, the caution is unmistakable: create captivating gameplay, provide genuine utility, or else run the very real risk of adding your name to a growing list of entities in a sector where expectations are high, but actual performance is low, and where it’s becoming clear that being in the metaverse isn’t enough. As investor forbearance wanes and token unlockings proceed apace, GameFi finds itself at a fork in the road. It can morph into something substantive—or it can serve up a cautionary tale of overcapitalized hype and underdelivering execution. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In only a few weeks, USD1—a stablecoin launched by @worldlibertyfi that is tied to the Trump-branded Liberty Finance movement—has shot up in adoption and market capitalization, becoming one of the most dominant forces on the BNB Chain. Trump-linked stablecoin takes over BNB Chain @worldlibertyfi stablecoin #USD1 has surged from $130M to over $2.12B in market cap since late April. $2.11B worth of #USD1 has been issued on the @BNBCHAIN , pushing the total stablecoin market cap there close to $10B. pic.twitter.com/dtUQmp0hfm — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 9, 2025 Here’s what you need to know about USD1 and its politically charged progenitor. Since late April, USD1’s market capitalization has skyrocketed from just $130 million to an eye-popping $2.12 billion, representing a more than 1,530% increase in less than a month. The authorities in charge of overseeing the growing world of digital assets have largely been caught flat-footed. BNB Chain Booms as USD1 Drives Capital Inflows Most of this action is happening directly on the BNB Chain, Binance’s native blockchain network. Of the $2.12 billion issued in USD stablecoins, a staggering $2.11 billion has been minted on the BNB Chain—funneled directly onto this layer-1 chain in the same way a stablecoin like USDC would work on Ethereum or Avalanche. This stablecoin issuance has pushed the total stablecoin market cap on BNB Chain close to $10 billion, with DAI, USDC, and BUSD serving as the main drivers behind that figure. The rise in stablecoin liquidity is likely to ignite fresh movement in decentralized finance (DeFi) on BNB Chain, pushing it past Ethereum and other Layer 2 platforms. Trader eyes are glued to the signs: DEX volume increases, liquidity pool growth, and on-chain staking activity. Early data suggests that use of USD1 across DeFi protocols is already well underway. How soon until this use becomes commonplace? And what might it mean for the DeFi sector if it does? USD1 is gaining a renewed interest from users who are looking for stable alternatives to the often volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Still, what really sets USD1 apart isn’t the stable value it offers, but rather its direct connection to the Liberty Finance initiative, which is aligned with former President Donald Trump. Trump-Linked Wallet Moves Millions into ETH and BTC A wallet thought to be linked to Liberty Finance has made some interesting purchases over the last 24 hours. It’s been picking up substantial amounts of both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Confirming through blockchain analytics the purchases of the wallet, we see that it obtained 1,587 WETH at an average price of $2,200, which represents approximately $3.49 million in Ether. It also acquired 9.7 WBTC at a price of $103,092, which brings the total to roughly $1 million in wrapped Bitcoin. Altogether, the wallet deployed $4.94 million in capital into these two leading crypto assets. These purchases have prompted questions about Liberty Finance’s operational strategy. Accumulating both WETH and WBTC at this moment in time conveys a message of confidence in the overall market and its long-term trajectory. In fact, their decision may point to Liberty’s ambition to build out a more robust “crypto infrastructure”—beyond the stablecoin realm.

The mix of financial usefulness and ideological appeal could entice a wide array of users. What’s Next for USD1 and Liberty Finance? Now, with USD1 firmly among the top stablecoins on BNB Chain by market capitalization, the important question is whether this momentum can be maintained. The success of a stablecoin depends not just on inflows of capital but also on ongoing adoption and integration, as well as on transparency. Liberty Finance seems to be setting itself up as both a financial and an ideological entity in the Web3 world. It’s not clear yet how this will play out. If the movement takes off, it could encourage the development of more financial products within Web3, making them accessible to a larger audience; but if the movement stalls or attracts a lot of regulatory scrutiny, it could have the opposite effect. USD1 has become a significant new player in the stablecoin sector. Its rapid growth might be the harbinger of a new phase in politically motivated financial infrastructure. As Liberty Finance enlarges its asset base and extends its reach, it can be expected to work in concert with other healthy financial actor—to the tune of billions, presumably—watching all the while for any signs that the federal regulatory apparatus has either blessed or cursed the new outfit.

44404027,https://nulltx.com/?p=149381,1746845721,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Coinbase Misses on Revenue, Beats on Volume as Strategic Bets Begin to Pay Off",https://nulltx.com/coinbase-misses-on-revenue-beats-on-volume-as-strategic-bets-begin-to-pay-off/,"The prominent crypto exchange in the United States, Coinbase , issued its Q1 2025 financial earnings this week. The company delivered a whole assortment of results that underscored its part as a player in a digital asset market that is maturing rapidly. While the company missed total revenue and earnings targets, it unearthed some gems in terms of trading volume increases and an expanding global footprint. For the first quarter of 2025, Coinbase registered total revenue of $2.03 billion, which is below the Street’s consensus of $2.2 billion. Transaction revenue, which is a key metric for the company, came in at $1.26 billion and missed the expectation of $1.33 billion. The good news was that subscription and services revenue has been increasing nicely and was up 37% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter to $698 million, just slightly below the expectation of $702.5 million. EPS adjusted were $0.24, which is a far cry from the target set by analysts of $2.09. The company remains strong, however, with an adjusted EBITDA of $930 million and a net income that certainly made its balance sheet look better at $66 million. Add in an adjusted net income of $527 million, and you clearly see the company standing tall and remaining very profitable despite going through some market dynamics that are swaying it back and forth. Trading Volume Strength and Strategic Growth Shape the Quarter Even though it missed revenue expectations, Coinbase showed impressive trading activity strength. The total trading volume came in at around $393 billion this past quarter—just slightly above what they were projecting ($392.7 billion). A phenomenal metric was the 49% increase in USDC balances in Coinbase products since the end of the previous quarter, now totaling $12.3 billion. This figure reflects a demand from our users for stablecoin-based services and suggests that the platform in general, including our lending business, is seeing more adoption of recently launched products using USDC. The trust from both retail and institutional users is increasing, as evidenced by our custody asset base growing to $212 billion, up $25 billion from last quarter. We are seeing much-improved regulatory clarity combined with a much-expanded set of service offerings. In the future, Coinbase projects subscription and service income to be between $600 million and $680 million for the second quarter of 2025. At the same time, the company expects underlying operating expenses (technology and general administration) to range from $700 million to $750 million. Sales and marketing expenses are projected to come in between $215 million and $315 million, but with the sale of actual transactions already projected to be $240 million for the month of April. $COIN | Coinbase Q1'5 Earnings Highlights Revenue: $2.03B (Est. $2.2B) Adj.

It announced a $2.9 billion acquisition of the crypto options exchange Deribit, structured in both cash and stock. This puts Coinbase in a dominant position in crypto options and futures, broadening its reach into more sophisticated trading products. In their press release, Coinbase emphasized that this acquisition aligns with their mission of “building the most secure and compliant trading venue in the world” and that they are now working on an “orderly integration plan” for Deribit. From a regulatory perspective, the company had a really major legal win when the SEC lawsuit that had been hanging over the company for quite some time was dismissed—”with prejudice,” no less. That was a huge hurdle the company had to face, and now it has investor confidence on board, too. The company registered internationally as well, with both Argentina and India now recognizing it as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP). Regulatory operations across the globe continue to expand. Coinbase’s long-term vision is primarily centered around product development. Initiatives in place, like the Base Layer 2 network—a blockchain scaling initiative—saw $4 billion in stablecoin balances this past quarter. The company also shafted new products into the ecosystem, among them, Flashblocks, a solution that utilizes Ethereum to enable finality of transactions in less than a second. At the same time, Coinbase continued its work scaling its other products, namely, Coinbase One Premium and Verified Pools, for retail and institutional customers, respectively. In addition, there was an external development that fit neatly with Coinbase’s strategy. A U.S. Executive Order was issued that formally established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Although this wasn’t a Direct hit for Coinbase, it was widely interpreted as a sign that the U.S. government was starting to recognize Bitcoin as an asset of sufficient quality that they might hold it in reserve, right alongside gold. Even though the miss on earnings could have some impact on sentiment in the near term, I think this could be an opportunity to accumulate shares in Coinbase. Why? Because I still believe that this company’s strategic long-term initiatives are positioning it much better in the space to lead well into the next era of cryptocurrency adoption.

44404063,https://nulltx.com/?p=149380,1746845812,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Massive Liquidations and Expired Options Shake Crypto Markets,https://nulltx.com/massive-liquidations-and-expired-options-shake-crypto-markets/,"In the last 24 hours, the crypto markets were shaken as a wave of liquidations swept through global exchanges. Nearly $1 billion in positions were wiped out, and digital asset trading was again shown to be highly volatile and risky, especially for those using leverage. According to Coinglass, 200,194 traders were liquidated in this turbulent period, and forced sell-offs across both long and short positions were caused by sharp price movements. According to Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, a total of 200,194 people were liquidated globally, with a total liquidation amount of $972 million. Of this, long positions accounted for $134 million in liquidations, while short positions accounted for $838 million. The largest… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 9, 2025 A truly astonishing total liquidation figure of $972 million. All we can do is watch. What’s particularly notable is the skew in liquidations: while $134 million came from long positions, a dominant $838 million was wiped from shorts. This suggests a strong upward price movement caught bears off guard, leading to a short squeeze that amplified the market’s momentum. The single largest liquidation took place on Binance and involved a position in BTCUSDT that was worth $11.97 million. This liquidation alone illustrates the dangers that traders who use high leverage are exposed to, especially when options are expiring and during surprise shifts in market direction. Options Expiry Adds Fuel to the Fire Liquidations weren’t the only thing causing a stir on Friday. We also had a hefty Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry event to contend with—one with a lot of open interest that was set to unwind and reconstitute the market landscape for June. A total of 26,000 Bitcoin options expired, with a notional value of about $2.67 billion. The Put/Call Ratio at expiration was 1.05. This suggests that at the very least, option holders weren’t terribly imbalanced and were probably OK with the current price level. However, the max pain point was calculated at $94,000, far above current prices. This highlights how option writers were betting on much higher prices, and that any aggressive hedging or attempted short squeezes could be moves to drive prices up toward the levels necessary for options sold to be profitable. Regarding Ethereum, 165,000 ETH options expired with an associated notional value of $360 million. The Put/Call Ratio was more skewed at 1.42, indicating a heavier bearish positioning leading up to the expiry. The max pain was recorded at $1,850, which lines up a bit better with the current price action of ETH. Market analysts note that many of the previously leading bearish positions have now been cleared out. This clearing of negative sentiment could set the stage for a more bullish posture heading into June, especially as data shows a rising percentage of bullish options in the upcoming month’s expiries. Often the expiry clean-up acts as a reset button for the market, recalibrating expectations and removing distortions caused by heavily skewed options positioning. With bearish pressure significantly reduced and many shorts already liquidated, market participants now watch closely for signs of sustainable bullish follow-through. Liquidations and expiries have increasingly become a common sight in the crypto derivatives landscape, where rising institutional participation and complex strategies can create cascading effects in volatile conditions. As more capital flows into perpetual futures, options, and structured products, the market’s sensitivity to these expiration cycles has intensified. 26,000 BTC options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 1.05, a max pain point of $94,000, and a notional value of $2.67 billion; 165,000 ETH options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 1.42, a max pain point of $1,850, and a notional value of $360 million. Previously high bearish… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 9, 2025 This in turn makes the effects of these combination events on the underlying crypto asset prices more pronounced. The takeaway is the same for investors and traders: leverage is a double-edged sword. And what we learned during this episode is that expiring products add another layer of risk to an already risky equation. This isn’t to say that trading with leverage is evil. All of us do it in one form or another, even when we don’t realize it. In the future, watch will be kept on the macroeconomic indicators, regulatory developments, and looming project milestones to ascertain whether this recent rally—ignited by short liquidations and option rollovers—has staying power or if we are looking at another reversal in the not-so-distant future.

44404149,https://nulltx.com/?p=149379,1746845907,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,NEAR Protocol Sees Developer Activity Surge Amid Breakthrough Upgrades,https://nulltx.com/near-protocol-sees-developer-activity-surge-amid-breakthrough-upgrades/,"NEAR Protocol is back in the news, but this time there is no speculation surrounding it. Instead, onlookers can see a definite increase in not just one, but several important indicators of NEAR’s growth. The newest indicator is on-chain developer activity, which comprehensively measures how much attention developers are paying to a given blockchain. After a few months of relatively quiet growth, in April NEAR’s on-chain developer activity experienced a major uptick and is clearly trending upwards. As of April, daily NEAR contract deployments surpassed 280 and were deploying contracts at a pace five times the rate of March’s average daily deployments. Even more remarkable is how this accelerated pace has effectively been locked in as a permanent level of development. NEAR’s developers not only seem to have ramped up the pace of deploying new contracts but also appear to be doing so with a starting point close to March’s levels. This again points to a kind of engagement that may just get deeper as we enter the second quarter. Contract deployments on @NEARProtocol quietly surged in April. After months of low activity, daily deployments spiked over 280 — a 5x jump from the March average. Sustained volume followed throughout the month. Momentum like this usually doesn’t happen by accident. pic.twitter.com/xcaZw1U77c — Nansen (@nansen_ai) May 9, 2025 When it comes to this sort of ongoing effort, there is usually a good reason. And NEAR has had a very good reason for putting its head down and doing the work necessary to quietly roll out some of the most sophisticated architectural upgrades to be found anywhere in the blockchain world—upgrades that are starting to pay the network real dividends in the form of greater developer interest and ecosystem expansion. Nightshade 2.0 and Stateless Validation Set a New Benchmark A recent spike in NEAR’s community growth has emerged, spurred the by the Nightshade 2.0 update. This major improvement to NEAR’s sharding model significantly increased scalability, increasing its transaction throughput by four times while reducing costs for developers. Nightshade 2.0 massively optimized the way shards communicate with each other while executing transactions in parallel and allows for a much faster and more efficient data processing across the whole network. This update seems to have brought NEAR back in the spotlight, attracting community and developer interest. Another critical breakthrough in NEAR’s architecture is called stateless validation. It is a new feature that dramatically lowers the resource requirements for validators, which allows many more people to run validator nodes. Traditionally, validators must store the entire state of the blockchain, an expensive and technically demanding requirement. With NEAR’s approach, validators can now participate in consensus without retaining full network data. These upgrades together signal a substantial advancement in blockchain infrastructure and make NEAR a more tempting and accessible target for developers looking to build high-throughput applications. Improved User Experience Through Ethereum Compatibility and Chain Signatures Although the improvements that NEAR has made to its back end are truly remarkable, the platform has also directed its attention to improving user experience. A comparatively recent change that NEAR has made that dramatically increases that user experience is full compatibility with Ethereum wallets, such as MetaMask. Now, users of Ethereum can move directly into NEAR’s decentralized applications without having to create any new wallet or to figure out NEAR’s user interface. This change seems to be a significant push towards making NEAR more accessible. Complementing this is the enforcement of Chain Signatures, a powerful instrument that streamlines cross-chain account access. By using Chain Signatures, users can better function across multiple blockchain networks with a single account—removing the confusion and inconvenience of getting to your account across different wallets and keys on different chains. This makes cross-chain dApp access much more pleasant for the user; it’s uniformly easier to do so when all that must be navigated are Layer 1 and Layer 2 environments. NEAR Protocol's 2025 Tech Breakthroughs: NEAR Protocol has kicked off 2025 with powerful innovations that push the boundaries of blockchain performance and usability. Stateless Validation & Chain Signatures: NEAR now enables validators to participate without storing the full… pic.twitter.com/dDNB40QT6T — IBRAHIM (@M1sterIbrahim) May 9, 2025 Developer Attention Returns as NEAR Reinforces Its Technical Edge The April contract deployment surge is more than a number. It’s an indicator. It’s developers once again focusing on NEAR, and for good reason. We have tools now that open up accessible scalability and efficiency in contrast to the way decentralized applications used to work. Those tools make us rethink NEAR as a Layer 1 that can not only match Ethereum or Solana in performance but can also actually be used by regular people in a way that seems impossible with other programmable blockchains. Among the places that hype too often overshadows substance, NEAR is emerging as a beacon where deep technical innovation and long-term planning pay off in the delivery of actual results. As 2025 unfolds, the next challenge for NEAR is maintaining this momentum, continuing to attract a devoted allegiance among developers, and building real utility on top of its freshly upgraded infrastructure. If the present trend holds, NEAR might very well be creating the stage for its most impactful year yet. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Ethereum (ETH) is preparing for a major upgrade that could push its price toward $2,104, while Cosmos (ATOM) is aiming for a long-term target of $57. Both projects bring powerful features to the table, yet still face ongoing concerns around scalability, trust, and centralized control. With a focus on real transparency and on-chain accountability, Unstaked ($UNSD) was built to give users full control over their data and activity through a secure, decentralized structure. For those searching for the best crypto for the future, Unstaked’s verifiable, user-first approach sets it apart from hype-driven competitors. Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade Sets $2,104 in Sight Ethereum (ETH) is preparing for its Pectra Upgrade, scheduled for May 7, which introduces critical improvements to its staking model. The highlight is EIP-7251, which raises the validator cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. This change aims to boost validator participation, streamline operations for larger stakeholders, and reinforce the network’s overall security and decentralization. Despite its promise, Ethereum’s upgrade history includes delays and rollout issues. A smooth deployment could push ETH toward the $2,104 mark, but any hiccups may spark short-term volatility. Still, with its broad DApp and DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum remains one of the best crypto projects to watch. Cosmos Eyes Long-Term Growth with $57 Projection Cosmos (ATOM) continues to build its identity as the “Internet of Blockchains,” enabling seamless interoperability between independent networks through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. The Tendermint-powered architecture offers scalability and security for decentralized apps, with analysts forecasting a price surge toward $57 by 2031 as adoption grows. Still, Cosmos must navigate an increasingly competitive market. New blockchains boasting faster speeds and lower fees threaten its edge. Additionally, decentralized governance across multiple chains makes coordination more complex. While the Cosmos (ATOM) outlook remains strong, long-term growth depends on continual upgrades and unified community development. Unstaked Presale Goes Viral – Over $3.1M Raised While Ethereum and Cosmos chase scalability and interoperability, Unstaked is setting a new standard for blockchain security and transparency. At a time when many projects rely on vague promises and centralized controls, Unstaked is delivering a platform where every action is verifiable, recorded, and user-controlled. Priced at just $0.00776 in Stage 7 of its presale, Unstaked has already raised over $3.1 million, with a projected launch price of $0.1819, offering a potential 28x upside. Unstaked’s model centers around blockchain-recorded AI activity. Every task performed by its autonomous agents, on Telegram, X, and soon Discord, is written directly on-chain. From message automation to task execution, the transparency ensures no manipulation, no hidden processes, and full accountability at every level. It’s a security-first structure where function and integrity are permanently aligned. Adding to this is Unstaked’s wallet-first login system. Unlike centralized apps that store sensitive data on external servers, Unstaked users control their access, assets, and identity entirely through their Web3 wallets. This dramatically reduces the risks of breaches or unauthorized data access, making the platform both secure and user-centric. Governance further empowers the community. $UNSD holders shape protocol decisions through proposals and voting. This decentralized model ensures Unstaked evolves through consensus, not central authority, making it one of the best crypto for the future. Key Takeaways Ethereum and Cosmos continue to push forward with ambitious upgrades and long-term price goals, but their reliance on centralized development teams leaves users with limited control over core changes. Unstaked breaks from this model entirely, offering a secure, transparent ecosystem where users manage their assets through a wallet-first login system. But what truly sets Unstaked ($UNSD) apart is its decentralized governance. Token holders shape the platform’s evolution by voting on proposals and decisions. For those seeking the best crypto for the future, Unstaked delivers both control and security in one package.

New Bitcoin Whales Have Cost Basis Around $91,900 In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed how the Realized Price compares between the two major sides of the whale cohort on the Bitcoin network. The “Realized Price” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition level of the average investor in the BTC market. When the value of this metric is above the spot price of the asset, it means the holders as a whole are carrying a net unrealized loss. Similarly, the indicator being under the coin’s value suggests the dominance of profit among the investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver’s Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of the entire sector isn’t of interest, but rather that of two specific investor cohorts: the short-term holder and long-term holder whales. The short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs) make up the two main divisions of the BTC network based on the basis of holding time. All investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days are put into the STHs, while those who surpass this threshold mature into the LTHs. The STHs and LTHs of focus here aren’t just any ordinary investors, but rather the “whales,” entities who are carrying more than 1,000 BTC ($103.3 million) in their balance. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price for the STH and LTH whales over the past few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Price of the whales who got in during the past 155 days stands at $91,900 at the moment. With BTC’s recent recovery rally, the spot price has gained a notable distance above this line, so the cohort should be comfortably in the green now. That said, their situation is nowhere near as good as that of the veteran whales, who have their cost basis at just $32,200. This indicates that there is a spread of a whopping 185% between the bottom line of the two groups. According to the analyst, this indicates a growing confidence and FOMO among the investors, which is driving them to buy at even the recent high prices. This trend is in sharp contrast to the 2022 bear market, where the difference between the cost basis of the two groups fell to just 65%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resistance Limited Beyond $100,000, On-Chain Data Suggests It now remains to be seen whether demand from the new whales will continue to be strong in the near future, potentially driving up the spread between the cohorts further.

One project that has people talking is $BNKR ($BNKR), the token affiliated with the DeFi effort known as BankrBot. $BNKR has enjoyed a growth spurt that is almost beyond belief, adding an astounding 13,000 new holders in just the last week to bring its total holder count to a staggering 89,700. That puts it in a league well above most of the other tokens in the DeFi space, where the average is about 42,500 holders. So, what’s behind all this excitement, and how long might it last? $BNKR is about to flip $CLANKER and it’s super interesting to watch. $CLANKER ($28M mc): multiple team members, listed on Coinbase, nearly $30M sitting idle in the vault. $BNKR ($26.5M mc): came out of $CLANKER, solo dev, gained momentum on X with Grok coins and an actual… — Kien Nguyen (@KienNguyen_NFT) May 9, 2025 The response is based on a number of factors: the debut of the OK Computers NFT, a burgeoning wave of interest surrounding the project, and the pledge of a real working DeFi product. Let’s dissect the ongoings with $BNKR and see why it might soon be neck and neck with $CLANKER ($CLANKER) as the leading edge of conversation in DeFi. The $BNKR Surge: Unprecedented Growth and the Potential for Even More BNKR was most recently at the $BNKR world’s holders surge in holders is something we most deem bullish. With a sub $27 million market cap, I think most people would agree that it seems like we could just be overachieving expectations in this space to now have $BNKR in any near mainstream conversation. Largely, this seems to have come from the most recent NFT drop with the OK Computers; and boy, did that one seemingly drop as well. I would think the lead into that drop, all the engagement and attention from this space should have us set up to keep that vibe going from here. When we examine $BNKR’s growth in comparison to that of its competitor $CLANKER, the contrast is clear. With a market cap of $28 million, $CLANKER has a team that is not only much larger but also far more experienced and better established. $CLANKER is even listed on Coinbase, one of the top exchange platforms. By all typical measures, $CLANKER should be outpacing $BNKR. Still, in something of a curious case, $BNKR has recently been achieving a markedly higher rate of growth than $CLANKER. A notable point here is that $BNKR arose from $CLANKER, and, although it is an indie project rather than a large-team effort, it is building on the growing momentum of its predecessor. The big differentiator is that $BNKR already has an actual working DeFi product in the market—a key element in this industry for long-term success. Countless projects in our space claim to be the next big thing but don’t deliver. $BNKR is committed to proving such a functionality over hype point. In addition, $BNKR has been making gains on X (formerly Twitter) propelled by the launch of Grok Coins, which has generated a lot of buzz in the DeFi community. This is an obvious sign that $BNKR’s ecosystem is not just being noticed but also being actively participated in by users—something that is crucial for the lifeline of any crypto project. Could Coinbase Listing Push $BNKR Into the $100M Market Cap Club? One of the biggest questions surrounding $BNKR is whether it will be able to follow in the footsteps of other DeFi tokens and land a listing on big exchanges like Coinbase. Right now, $BNKR isn’t on Coinbase or any other big exchange, and its growth is all organic, with community-driven development and product deployment. If Coinbase were to list $BNKR, the token could rally like crazy, sending its market cap north of $100 million. It cannot be said strongly enough how important exchange listings are. When a project gets a listing on a major exchange, it often sees its liquidity and visibility boosted significantly. Then that project is even more conveniently positioned as it continues its adoption by retail and institutional investors in the crypto space. Should $BNKR land a listing on the Coinbase exchange, it is likely that the liquidity, visibility, and adoption fountain will be opened widely for it. In addition, because the $BNKR project’s special market position allows it to have an active working product and organic growth, it can leverage this potential listing to go well past the $100 million market cap threshold. Should it do so, $BNKR would surely be one of the most exciting DeFi projects of 2025 and beyond. The Future Looks Bright for $BNKR In summary, $BNKR has managed to build significant momentum. This could change the DeFi landscape. They are not yet in the universe of serious DeFi players, but you have to give them credit for actual achievement and the growth of their community. $BNKR has a working product. Their DeFi product, by the way, is different from those of most other DeFi players we cover. It is not a lending/borrowing platform. It is still unknown whether major exchanges such as Coinbase will list $BNKR. However, the project’s momentum seems almost inevitable, leading us to consider the wider crypto community’s attention as an end that’s already in sight. Investors and DeFi enthusiasts should watch $BNKR closely. We might witness its growth outpacing that of many larger competitors, and even faster than we’re accustomed to seeing for new market entrants. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While top names catch headlines, Web3 ai is steadily preparing for the long run, not just chasing short-term gains. Web3 ai has become a standout choice because it focuses on building useful AI-powered tools that go far beyond temporary trends. Its system serves practical needs, from smart trading alerts and portfolio tools to fraud detection. What’s drawing early interest is its long-term vision: Web3 ai is not just made for 2025; it’s shaped for what’s coming in 2026. A $100 purchase in the first batch could grow to $1847 by the time of listing, even before using any platform tools. Web3 ai Is Engineering the Next Phase of Crypto: Analysts Eye 1747% ROI Instead of aiming for quick gains in this cycle, Web3 ai is laying the foundation for the next one. While many AI coins chase trending headlines, this project is developing an entire stack. It includes trading bots, risk assessors, predictive ROI engines, and on-chain signal trackers. This isn’t just trend-following, it’s a full setup to take control of what’s ahead. That’s why early entries are already taking action. The $WAI coin powers the whole platform, used for insights, voting, and access features. It isn’t made for holding and waiting, but for real usage. As more users come on board, demand grows. Whether you’re a beginner or skilled at trading, the tools work seamlessly across centralized and decentralized exchanges, covering multiple blockchains. The presale is currently in its 3rd stage, priced at $0.000331. Buyers are rushing as the final batch hits $0.003267, with a public launch price of $0.005242. That means if you joined at stage one, you’re looking at a 1747% ROI, without even counting the platform’s future growth. Reflecting market confidence, the presale has raised more than $2 million in record time. For those looking at the top crypto in 2025, skipping early batches might mean missing easy gains. What sets Web3 ai apart is how it’s shifting AI excitement into solid, lasting features. With each presale stage, the price gets higher, and early support means bigger returns. Ethereum (ETH) Upgrade Postponed as Pectra Nears New Ethereum (ETH) updates reveal that the Pectra upgrade, originally expected to include EOF adjustments, will no longer feature them. These changes are now scheduled for the Fusaka release later in the year. This limits major technical shifts in the near term. Pectra will instead offer upgrades like support for USDC gas payments and increased validator slots. The real structural overhaul will arrive with Fusaka, which is set to introduce full EOF and redesign contract execution methods. This is important as Ethereum faces rising performance issues and slowing protocol earnings. Some big players, like Galaxy Digital and Paradigm, have already trimmed their ETH positions. This shows that while ETH remains active, newer projects could gain ground due to this hesitation. XRP Price Climbs on XRPFi and ETF Announcements XRP has surged beyond $2.30, thanks to excitement around the April 29 launch of XRPFi from Flare Networks. This new tool brings staking and DeFi functions to XRP using an FXRP wrapper, adding capabilities that weren’t available through its original system. The network will run on Flare’s oracles, which supply real-time pricing and support for liquid staking. The rise continues with ProShares confirming the release of three XRP futures ETFs, including leveraged and short versions. These updates, paired with the launch of Flare’s system, are giving XRP more function and greater market reach. Traders are monitoring $2.40 and $2.55 as possible limits, while a drop below $2.20 could suggest a move back to $2.00. For now, data hints that buyers are still active. Final Remarks! Ethereum is facing delays, and XRP is getting a lift from new DeFi features. But while these shifts respond to current market pressures, Web3 ai is working beyond those conditions. With smart contract scanners, trading prediction engines, and live market trackers, this platform is set for where crypto is heading next. It’s this approach that makes Web3 ai more than just another AI name in crypto. With 50 presale stages starting from $0.0003 and a launch price of $0.005242, the earliest buyers could see gains of 1747%. That means a $100 buy-in could grow to $1847 at listing, and that doesn’t count future platform development. Anyone watching the top bullish crypto trends for 2025 should consider that skipping Web3 ai might mean leaving serious growth behind.

As the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin has lately experienced a surge of new wallet creations, a renewed uptick in its dominance, and, more generally, an impressive show of renewed investor interest and confidence. All this has led some observers to suggest that, at the moment, a rather pronounced and palpable sentiment shift is taking place. Bitcoin's network saw 344,620 new wallets be created on its network as FOMO poured in. Crypto's top market cap asset has silenced bears, reaching a high of $103.8K for the first time since January. pic.twitter.com/hai245lQJz — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 9, 2025 On May 8, the price of Bitcoin shot up to $103.8K, its highest since January 2025. This sharp price increase was accompanied by an unprecedented wave of excitement that led to the creation of 344,620 new wallets on the Bitcoin network in just a few days. This surge reflects the ever-growing demand for Bitcoin from a diverse group of investors, as the asset continues its robust upward trend. Right now, it’s Bitcoin’s market dominance that investors seem most interested in. At over 60 percent, it’s approaching levels last seen in early 2021. Bitcoin’s Market Dominance Soars as Investor Confidence Builds The current trend in Bitcoin’s price is a mirror of the growing investor faith that is being placed in the cryptocurrency. After spending several months in limbo, Bitcoin has come roaring back as the premier asset for crypto aficionados. Its resurgence to market dominance is the clearest indication of this newfound enthusiasm. The cryptocurrency’s dominance is now sitting above 60%, which is a pretty significant occurrence. Essentially, it means that more and more investors are looking to Bitcoin as the most reliable option in a sea of digital tokens. In contrast, at 2024’s onset, Bitcoin’s dominance wobbled around 40%, which seems almost laughable considering today’s numbers. To see it climb to over 60% is honestly unexpected and almost magical in how it illustrates the shift toward Bitcoin’s appearing to be the standard against which other cryptocurrencies are measured. Altcoins, on the other hand, seem to be showing increased volatility, which is making Bitcoin’s price stability and network activity look reassuring to those worried about the digital gold appearing to be a hedge against such volatility. Bitcoin’s price hike to $103.8K, which is its highest since January, has been credited to much the same kind of institutional interest that has led to price increases in traditional assets. Mini surges have taken place this year during the kinds of special events that intrigue crypto traders. One such occurrence was a “halving” in May, when the reward for mining a new Bitcoin was cut in half. As Bitcoin’s price goes up, it continues to draw more and more attention from both individuals and institutions as a seemingly viable storage method for long-term, value-preserving assets. A Surge in Active Users and Institutional Interest The Bitcoin network is not only witnessing new wallet creations but also experiencing a rise in daily activity. The average number of daily active Bitcoin addresses exceeded 817,000 this week, failing to achieve that level since last December. This apparent uptick in activity signifies that many more individuals are not just holding onto Bitcoin but are also partaking in network transactions. The average number of daily active Bitcoin addresses surpassed 817k this week, the highest level since December of last year pic.twitter.com/npge6cUYlL — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 9, 2025 Also, the cryptocurrency’s much-more-than-before allure to gigantic investors is evident in the stupendous inflow seen in Bitcoin spot ETFs. On the 8th day of May (the year 2023), Bitcoin spot ETFs registered a net inflow of 117 million U.S. dollars, which is a signal that financially traditional institutions and big whale investors are very interested in the prospect of Bitcoin. This obvious growth in participation by such high-profile investors is an indication of something: the long-term prospects of Bitcoin seem to be much better, with more and more big entities backing it. Bitcoin possesses reliable network fundamentals, an established presence among institutional investors, and growing interest among retail investors. These factors combine to enhance its reputation as the leading cryptocurrency. While some observers still regard it as an experimental asset, a growing number of investment professionals, including those working for large pension funds and hedge funds, consider it a “mainstream” alternative to cash. On May 8, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $117 million. Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $16.11 million, marking three consecutive days of net outflows. https://t.co/SF4brkkBta — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 9, 2025 Looking Ahead: Bitcoin’s Long-Term Bullish Outlook Many analysts see Bitcoin as a winner in the long run. They consider its burgeoning network, the rising confidence of all types of investors, and even its recent bump in institutional adoption to be almost crypto-favorable developments. They’ve painted a nice picture of all that combining into something almost ‘sunny’ for Bitcoin: it’s reaching new all-time highs, enjoying its highest level of market dominance (more than 50 percent) since 2021. Even if the wider crypto market is still fluctuating, the very fundamentals of Bitcoin do seem solid. Its network effects are as powerful as ever, the elementary law of supply and demand dictates a price very much above where it currently is, and more and more Bitcoin seems to be finding a home in traditional finance. If anything, the use case for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation seems to be gaining steam. And investor sentiment appears to be carrying it upward. To sum up, not only has Bitcoin’s recent showing managed to hush bearish voices, but it has also demonstrated that this cryptocurrency has resilience and appeal in a rapidly changing market. It is not only surviving but also growing in popularity. Indeed, the near-term future of Bitcoin looks very bright, with sustained growth in wallet creations, daily activity, and inflows from institutions. Investors and enthusiasts are watching closely and with good reason because this cryptocurrency’s potential is far from being fully tapped. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Data from DeFi analytics firm SentoraHQ shows that over the past 24 hours, exchange outflows of Ethereum have reached a staggering $559 million. This increase in outflows fits right in with Ethereum’s price rally that it’s on as we speak, with its price hitting above $2,300 recently—meaning the asset is now up over 20% just from yesterday to today. ETH has surged past $2,300, up more than 20% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Abraxas Capital continues to accumulate, withdrawing 61,401 $ETH ($116.3M) from exchanges over the last 2 days. https://t.co/ObH6pw7cwd pic.twitter.com/cKk7K8ZXe0 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 9, 2025 The recent increase in price and outflows shows that the market is shifting, with investors now casting their votes in favor of Ethereum’s long-term vision. The uptick in ETH’s price has not only gained the attention of everyday investors but has also drawn the eyes of big-name institutions. These organizations are now starting to custody ETH themselves—means to an end that, in Ethereum’s view, further hashes out the network’s future value. Ethereum exchange outflows reach $559M amid price rally Ethereum $ETH has seen accelerating exchange outflows for the third straight week, driven by its ongoing price surge, according to DeFi analytics firm @SentoraHQ on X (formerly IntoTheBlock). About $559 million worth of ETH… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) May 9, 2025 Abraxas Capital Takes a Bold Step, Increasing its Ethereum Holdings A very important event in the Ethereum market has been the accumulation of ETH by institutional investors, especially Abraxas Capital. Just in the last two days, the firm has taken an impressive 138,511 ETH, worth about $297 million, off exchanges. This appears to be a not-so-subtle way of signaling its intent to hold more Ethereum in the sort of context that makes one think it’s just waiting for the price to go up before it’s yet again returning to more modern investment strategies. Massive $ETH accumulation! Abraxas Capital has withdrawn 138,511 $ETH ($297M) from exchanges in the past 2 days. https://t.co/scgYjuISN0 pic.twitter.com/Dvtr1IIubS — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 9, 2025 Large-scale withdrawals from Abraxas are just one obvious reversal of a much-discussed institutional accumulation trend. This accumulation trend has seen a growing number of large entities, especially in the U.S., buying up not only Bitcoin (BTC) but also a quite surprising amount of Ethereum (ETH), all in these past few months. Ethereum ETFs Face Outflows, but Price Rally Continues In spite of the favorable Ethereum price rally, the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have encountered some difficulties. On May 8, Ethereum spot ETFs endured a net outflow totaling $16.11 million, which was the ETFs’ third consecutive day of outflows. Now, those numbers might cause one to raise an eyebrow in concern. A declining asset under management is, after all, a sign of something being undesirable. On May 8, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $117 million. Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $16.11 million, marking three consecutive days of net outflows. https://t.co/SF4brkkBta — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 9, 2025 Indeed, the outflows could be a reflection of changing investor strategies. As Ethereum’s price keeps climbing, it’s likely that a number of investors are moving in the direction of direct holding methods that provide more control and security. This might mean self-custodying or moving Ethereum to a staking arrangement where it’s earning interest-yielding rewards. Notably, this trend matches the broader pattern of Ethereum outflows from exchanges, as holders aim to sidestep any price-dipping disaster that could occur if the Ethereum in question is simply parked on an exchange. Moreover, the price of Ethereum keeps on climbing despite ETF outflows, and this suggests that investor sentiment around Ethereum is still quite solid. Once again, the price has now transcended the $2,300 mark, making this the highest that Ethereum has reached in 2023, and it’s continued to do really well relative to everyone’s expectations. Most of the confidence around Ethereum’s price rally is based on how well the network is expected to perform in the near term, particularly with big events like its full transition to Ethereum 2.0 later this year and with the adoption of its Layer 2 solutions. The Bigger Picture: Ethereum’s Growing Strength Ethereum’s sustained price rally and record exchange outflows show increasing trust in the network’s future. With market dominance right alongside Bitcoin’s, Ethereum is staking out a place as the go-to blockchain for not just decentralized applications but also the sorts of “smart contracts” that, in theory at least, could make things like computerized financial derivatives work. An enormous developer ecosystem makes at least some of us think at least some of the time that there’s something really, really valuable in all this. The Ethereum network has already displayed virtuous technology over the years, and its advancements—like Ethereum 2.0, for instance—along with the increasingly unidirectional adoption of Layer 2 solutions—like, say, Optimism—give further cause for optimism. Investors are betting on these unidirectional long-term improvements, transferring Ether off centralized exchanges—on which it has been exposed to as much as 80% downside risk in the event of a hack or insolvency—and into their unsecured crypto wallets. Ethereum is still building on its successes. Rising prices and accumulation by institutions are taking Ethereum to a significant next level of development. In terms of both technological and market performance, Ethereum is now assured for a promising future. With a combination of price action and accumulation by institutions, Ethereum is now solidifying its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. And it is not going anywhere: unlike the first assembly of Bitcoin forks in 2017, which mostly withered away, Ethereum is a blockchain ecosystem that maintains a strong, secure position. To conclude, the latest spike in exchange outflows—and a recent price rally—gives Ethereum a shiny new outlook. These price moves seem to have been driven mainly by buying from institutions and a heightened level of confidence from retail investors. With these two types of players now being much more involved in the Ethereum space, it seems quite likely that Ethereum will be able to maintain its upwards price trajectory well into the next several months.

Here Are The Best Cryptos To Buy Now Before Altcoin Season,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/has-bitcoin-dominance-topped-here-are-the-best-cryptos-to-buy-now-before-altcoin-season/,"Bitcoin ‘s price is rising again and investors everywhere are wondering: What’s the best altcoin to buy now before the next alt season kicks off? Sure, Bitcoin is still king, but seasoned crypto enthusiasts know the real excitement and often the biggest gains come from spotting promising altcoins early. One name that’s buzzing right now is Remittix (RTX) , a fresh project still in presale that has already raised over $14.8 million and is gearing up for its exchange debut. Alongside established players like Bitcoin , Solana and SUI , Remittix offers a compelling opportunity for investors looking to ride the next crypto wave. Remittix – Is the best looking for the future Remittix (RTX) isn’t just another crypto project, it’s positioning itself at the forefront of the PayFi revolution. What exactly is PayFi, you ask? It’s the intersection of crypto and traditional fiat payment systems and Remittix is bridging that gap beautifully. Imagine sending cross-border payments instantly, cheaply and without hidden fees. That’s the Remittix promise. While Bitcoin is great as digital gold and Solana and SU I are busy building scalable dApp ecosystems, Remittix is laser-focused on the massive $250 trillion cross-border payments market. This clear, practical use case gives Remittix a unique edge and enormous growth potential. What is Remittix and how does it work? At its core, Remittix is an innovative payment network that seamlessly connects crypto to traditional fiat banking systems. Users can instantly convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currency, sending it directly to any global bank account. The recipient doesn’t even need to know crypto was involved, they simply see a regular bank transfer. For businesses, Remittix offers the Remittix Pay API, allowing merchants to accept crypto payments and receive fiat currency straight into their bank accounts. With support for over 30 fiat currencies and 50+ crypto pairs, businesses have complete flexibility and control. And if security is your concern (as it should be!), rest easy: Remittix has passed a thorough SolidProof audit with flying colors. Bitcoin – Setting market trends Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and it often leads market trends. Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency that allows peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. It’s a favorite store of value among investors. Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $108,786 in January and then its price fell to $76,329 in April. It recently jumped to around $103,000, up around 7% in the last 7 days. Bitcoin’ s price movements typically set the tone for the entire crypto market. When Bitcoin consolidates, altcoins often follow suit. Image source: CoinGecko Solana – Known for speed Solana (SOL) is known for fast transactions and minimal fees. It’s a popular choice for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi projects and NFTs. Currently priced around $167, Solana is often considered Ethereum’s biggest rival. Its rapid growth has made it stand out in the altcoin community and investors are watching closely to see if it can sustain its momentum. Image source: CoinGecko SUI – Onboarding users into Web3 SUI is a newer Layer 1 blockchain explicitly designed to onboard the next billion users into Web3. With a focus on high throughput, low latency and a developer-friendly programming model, SUI aims to become a go-to platform for decentralized apps. Currently priced around $4.00, SUI is still in its early days. It has already attracted attention for its ambitious goals and strong backing. Remittix price prediction Remittix (RTX) is still in its presale phase, offering investors an attractive entry price before it hits exchanges. Historically, presales provide the best opportunities for significant returns. Given Remittix’s clear use case in the enormous cross-border payments market, its robust security credentials and practical utility, it has the potential to grow. Unlike more speculative assets, Remittix’s value is tied directly to adoption and real-world usage, potentially making it less volatile than Bitcoin, Solana or SUI in the long run. RTX could see impressive price appreciation once it hits exchanges and starts gaining traction. What are the best altcoins to buy now ? With Bitcoin’ s dominance signaling a maturing crypto market, investors are eagerly hunting for the best altcoins to buy now . While Bitcoin , Solana and SUI each offer unique strengths, Remittix (RTX) stands out with its practical application in the massive global payments industry.

As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $102,922, up 3.5% on the day and just 5.2% shy of its all-time high of $109,000 recorded in January. The latest push above this critical psychological threshold marks a renewed phase of bullish market behavior, following weeks of range-bound trading between $93,000 and $98,000. Related Reading: Massive Buy Pressure Hits Binance as Bitcoin Reclaims $100,000 Short Liquidation Clusters Ignite Rally According to insights shared by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha, the recent rally has been driven in part by a sequence of short liquidation events on Binance. These events not only removed downward pressure from the market but also flipped the derivatives funding market, signaling a possible change in trader sentiment. Taha explained that a large cluster of short positions had accumulated in recent days, creating conditions ripe for a squeeze. Taha noted that the first key liquidation occurred at the $97,000 level, where a large number of short positions were wiped out, totaling approximately $360 million. Traders had positioned themselves for a local top, but instead, BTC broke through this zone, triggering a cascade of short covers and forced liquidations. This resulted in a rapid price acceleration as sellers were pushed to close their positions. Shortly after this surge, the price consolidated below the $101,000 mark, where another dense cluster of short interest had formed. This acted as a magnet for a second liquidation wave. When BTC breached $101,000, nearly $240 million in shorts were liquidated, contributing to a breakout that pushed the price toward $104,000. Data from liquidation heatmaps highlighted both $97,000 and $101,000 as high-liquidity targets, reinforcing the narrative that these were calculated liquidation sweeps. Bitcoin Funding Rate Shift Signals Bullish Sentiment The impact of these events extended beyond spot price movement. Taha pointed to Binance’s funding rate chart, showing that prior to the liquidation events, the funding rate was negative, a reflection of bearish bias among traders who were paying to maintain short positions. Following the twin liquidation waves, the funding rate flipped to +0.01%, a key signal that demand for long exposure was increasing. This transition from negative to positive funding is often interpreted as a shift in market structure, from bear-dominated to bull-dominated sentiment. It suggests that many traders now expect further upside, at least in the near term.

XRP is holding attention for a breakout, and Aave’s new buyback plan has sparked cautious interest, but there’s something else catching attention. Projects offering real usability and tools, like Web3 ai , are changing how people engage with digital assets, offering more than just watching prices go up and down. While many cryptos rely mainly on price movements, Web3 ai offers real-time AI-powered tools, including automated trade support and advanced risk analysis. For anyone checking out the best crypto to invest in now, utility might be the smarter focus than price charts. XRP Forecast: Can Sideways Trading Lead to a Summer Push? With XRP trading close to $2.10 and moving between $2.05 and $2.23, the current pattern shows tight consolidation. Flat MACD indicators and the coin’s position near the 50-period EMA suggest calm trading, a condition that sometimes hints at bigger changes ahead. Forecast opinions remain split. Some analysts see a breakout coming in July, following past seasonal patterns, while others, like Peter Brandt, warn of a possible 50% drop in XRP’s market cap by late 2025 if sellers take control. What happens next largely depends on whether XRP can hold or break key levels. Rising above $2.23 could see targets of $2.35 and $2.48. However, slipping below $2.05 may signal deeper dips toward $1.93 or even $1.84. Aave (AAVE) Update: DAO Backs Major $50M Buyback Aave has made a major move with its $50 million buyback, a step that reflects strong support from its DAO. This strategic effort, widely approved by the community, has stirred renewed interest as more users accumulate AAVE. The buyback signals a push for better liquidity and long-term support for the token’s role within the protocol. On-chain activity also reveals growing wallet usage, rising interest from retail and institutional circles. Planned in phases to reduce market shocks, this buyback is part of a broader plan to keep AAVE stable and sustainable. With treasury management at the core, Aave’s governance is playing a central role in shaping its financial direction.

The latest XRP price forecast reveals a bullish five-wave pattern that could push the token toward $6.30 by year-end. Meanwhile, VanEck’s Binance Coin (BNB) Spot ETF filing is sparking fresh excitement around institutional demand. If it’s approved, BNB could see a surge toward mainstream adoption. But it’s not just XRP and BNB stealing the spotlight; BlockDAG’s (BDAG) Buyer Battles are turning heads too! The daily frenzy to grab leftover coins from a 25 million BDAG pool has created non-stop action, pushing presale totals past $231.5 million. It’s a thrilling time for both retail traders and presale analysts watching this momentum unfold! XRP Eyes $6.30: A Bullish Setup That Could Shape 2025 The latest XRP price forecast from analyst Dark Defender is sparking interest, with a bullish five-wave pattern pointing to a possible $6.30 by the end of 2025. After recently bouncing off the $2.13 support level, XRP could make a short-term push to $2.80, followed by a slight pullback to $2.30. From there, a stronger third wave could drive XRP past the 2017 high of $3.80. The final waves of the cycle are expected to bring it closer to that $6.30 target. Of course, this forecast relies on favorable market conditions, but if support levels hold, there’s real potential for significant upside. It’s a pattern worth keeping an eye on as things unfold. What VanEck’s BNB Spot ETF Filing Means for Its Future Traders are closely watching the recent VanEck filing for a Binance Coin (BNB) Spot ETF in the U.S., coming just days after the company’s CEO met with Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. This move is significant, as VanEck already manages approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. If the BNB Spot ETF gets the green light, it could open the door for institutional investors to access BNB legally, potentially boosting its price. BNB has already bounced back from previous losses, holding steady above $600. Some analysts believe this momentum could push it toward the $1,000 mark. While regulatory challenges remain, the BNB Spot ETF filing is adding serious potential to the coin’s long-term outlook. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles: Why Traders Can’t Look Away! The BlockDAG (BDAG) leaderboard is shaking things up every single day. Here’s how it goes down: 25 million BDAG enters the ring, buyers snatch up their portion, and the biggest participant pockets whatever’s left. This simple formula is turning heads, driving presale totals over $231.5 million, and moving a massive 19.7 billion BDAG coins. The rewards are undeniable, with current holders raking in about 2,520% in gains! The math behind it all is crystal clear. BDAG is still priced at a mere $0.0019 until May 13. That’s a fraction of batch 28’s price of $0.0262 and a long way off from the projected $0.05 launch. Even if only a quarter of the daily pool goes unsold, that’s $163,750 up for grabs; $312,500 once the exchange listings kick in. But here’s the kicker: landing at the top of the leaderboard means turning a regular buy into a six-figure bonus in just one reset. Early buyers are jumping back in, hoping to repeat their big wins before the deal disappears. New participants? They’re eyeing the opportunity to snag 16 times more coins for the same price as today’s batch. It’s a rare chance to get in while the cost is still low, all while chasing the thrill of leaderboard fame. Analysts are buzzing about BlockDAG’s potential to be a major player in the next crypto bull run, especially with its ability to keep liquidity flowing nonstop. The clock is ticking! The next cycle starts at midnight UTC. With fewer resets left before prices climb, wallets are loading fast. Big buys mean big rewards—no staking, no waiting, just bragging rights and a stash of BDAG! Which Is The Top Crypto to Buy Before The Bull Run? Crypto markets are heating up again, with strong technical setups like the XRP price forecast and the growing buzz around the BNB Spot ETF. These moves are getting traders excited about positioning themselves early before the next bull run kicks off. While XRP banks on chart strength and BNB rides the ETF wave, BlockDAG is shaking things up with something completely different: its Buyer Battles. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are more than just a catchy feature; they’re drawing real interest and consistent volume. With the $0.0019 deal expiring on May 13, there’s even more urgency to act before prices rise. But here’s the twist: it’s not just about buying coins. BlockDAG’s loyal community gets daily chances to snag bonus rewards, adding a whole new layer to the excitement. It’s a unique opportunity to join the action and get in on the rewards!

According to a new filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Goldman Sachs has significantly increased its exposure to Bitcoin ETFs. As of March 31, the Wall Street giant holds 30.8 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), valued at over $1.4 billion—up from 24 million shares previously. The updated position, first reported by financial analyst MacroScope, places Goldman Sachs as the largest institutional holder of IBIT, surpassing other major investors like Brevan Howard, which holds over 25 million shares worth nearly $1.4 billion. Source: Fintel Other notable IBIT investors include Jane Street, D.E. Shaw, and Symmetry Investments, reflecting the growing confidence of hedge funds and trading firms in the Bitcoin ETF market. Goldman Sachs sticks with Fidelity’s Bitcoin fund Goldman Sachs has already revealed a big position in a number of the US spot Bitcoin ETFs . In his February filing, he listed over $1.5 billion in several Bitcoin ETF products. That figure included $1.2 billion in IBIT and $288 million in Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin fund (FBTC). Bank of America continues to be fair value. The latest 13F release from Goldman Sachs shows the bank has made no major changes to its portfolio in FBTC. However, the lack of any Bitcoin options contracts is striking. By December 2023, the bank owned more than $157 million in call options and more than $527 million in put options on IBIT, a hedged position that would provide gains from price swings. It also had $84 million in put on FBTC. As market volatility and risk appetite changed, those positions are not listed in the latest report, indicating that Goldman may have eliminated those contracts or let them expire. IBIT continues to dominate ETF market IBIT has quickly become the largest of the spot Bitcoin ETFs for BlackRock. As of May early 2025, it has about $62.8 billion in assets under management, Farside Investors figures show. Since starting the fund, IBIT has taken in over $44 billion in net inflows — a historic clip for any ETF, crypto or not. The fund has $674 million in new inflows so far this week. On Friday, shares of IBIT climbed by $1.04 to close at $58.66. The price jump tracks a higher rebound for Bitcoin over the past month amid a broader stabilization above $60,000. Analysts think that Goldman’s growing exposure suggests increasing institutional confidence in the long-term value of Bitcoin—specifically through regulated vehicles like ETFs. These funds allow regular investors to get in on crypto without dealing with self-custody or unregulated exchanges. Goldman’s expanding presence in the Bitcoin ETF realm is viewed by many as a powerful vote of confidence — not just in Bitcoin but in the development of financial products that facilitate broader access to digital assets. The move also reflects a bigger shift: Wall Street is increasingly weaving digital assets into standard investment portfolios, particularly as several spot Bitcoin ETFs were greenlit by US regulators recently. As institutional inflows are anticipated to increase and regulatory clarity continues to take shape, the Bitcoin ETF landscape may still have room for growth. For the moment, Goldman Sachs is in the lead. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Meanwhile, XRP’s price outlook is turning heads, with Fibonacci-based projections placing it as high as $27 if current patterns hold. But beyond these headline-making tokens, Unstaked (UNSD) is quietly setting a new benchmark for utility in Web3. Its AI agents operate across platforms like Telegram and X, with every action scored and logged on-chain through its Proof of Intelligence system. Currently in stage 7 of its presale and priced at just $0.00776, Unstaked isn’t selling potential, it’s delivering functionality right now. Ethereum Price Action Signals Possible Breakout to $2,000 Ethereum (ETH) has broken past the $1,820 resistance, trading near $1,859.73 and now testing the next key level at $1,850. A confirmed breakout above this mark could set the stage for a continued move toward $1,920 and potentially $2,000. The technical picture is strong, with the MACD entering bullish territory and the RSI holding above 50, signaling sustained buying momentum. Still, downside risks remain. If ETH loses its grip above $1,820, it could revisit support at $1,780 or even $1,750. The next few sessions will be critical in determining whether this move marks the start of a broader rally. XRP Eyes $27 as Technical Structure Tightens Top analyst EGRAG Crypto has laid out a bold projection for XRP, mapping potential targets between $9.50 and $27. The forecast hinges on a symmetrical triangle pattern in the XRP/BTC chart, supported by Fibonacci levels that point to an explosive upside if current conditions hold. Crucially, XRP must stay above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement (0.00001552 BTC) to preserve its bullish structure. A close above the 0.786 level (0.000029 BTC) could trigger the start of a major upward move. According to EGRAG, patience now could lead to one of XRP’s most significant breakouts yet. Unstaked: Trustless AI Built for Web3, Powered by Proof of Intelligence Unstaked is redefining how Web3 evaluates AI, not with marketing buzz, but with real, verifiable results recorded on-chain. At the core of its platform is Proof of Intelligence, a proprietary system that logs and scores every action performed by an AI agent. From moderating chats to generating content and engaging users, every task is tracked transparently, ensuring that only meaningful, high-impact contributions earn rewards. This eliminates human bias and centralized oversight. There’s no off-chain scoring or delayed validation, just an immutable, trustless system where performance speaks for itself. Every AI interaction on platforms like Telegram, X, and soon Discord is logged directly to the blockchain, making it impossible to fake results or manipulate reward systems. Unlike many AI crypto projects still caught up in concept phases or whitepapers, Unstaked has a working infrastructure. Its autonomous agents are already designed to operate across real platforms, with live tracking and output-based incentives baked into the protocol. The system is built to deliver measurable value from day one. Now in stage 7 of its presale, Unstaked is priced at just $0.00776, with a projected launch value of $0.1819. Few tokens offer this level of tech readiness and transparent utility at such an early stage, making Unstaked a standout in AI crypto. Crypto Market Takeaways Ethereum’s rally and XRP’s ambitious $27 target reflect strong technical setups, but both remain tied to market sentiment and speculative momentum. Unstaked, on the other hand, is building traction through real, working AI infrastructure. Its Proof of Intelligence system actively tracks agent performance, like community growth and engagement, and records every outcome directly on-chain for full transparency. Currently in stage 7 of its presale at $0.00776, Unstaked ($UNSD) offers direct access to a live, utility-driven ecosystem. While others project future impact, Unstaked is already delivering measurable results, making it a clear standout in the next phase of Web3 development.

Bitcoin dominance has dropped sharply from over 65% to 63.89%, hinting at a capital rotation into altcoins. Ethereum surged nearly 13%, while major altcoins like SOL, DOGE, and ADA rallied over 6%. Notably, the ETH/BTC ratio rebounded from its lowest level since 2020, signaling a potential structural shift in investor sentiment. With the tide turning, analysts at Altcoin Daily have revealed their top 14 coins they believe are primed to explode in 2025. Top Altcoins to Watch in May Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum leads the charge amid growing institutional interest . Coinbase added 21,000 ETH to its treasury last quarter, now holding over 140,000 ETH. With Layer 2 solutions like Kraken, OKX, and Uniswap scaling the ecosystem, ETH is seen as climbing the store-of-value adoption curve—making it one of the safest and most promising bets. Ondo Finance (ONDO) Backed by BlackRock, ONDO is at the forefront of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) for institutions. With the U.S. pushing tokenization forward, ONDO is well-positioned to benefit from institutional-grade on-chain finance. XRP (XRP) With U.S. regulatory clarity, XRP is being used for enterprise payments. A Florida pharma firm recently adopted XRP for a $50M treasury and vendor payment use case, proving its real-world financial utility. Cardano (ADA) ADA remains efficient and eco-friendly . It’s expanding Bitcoin bridges and supporting World Mobile Token (WMT), making it a strong contender in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. World Mobile Token (WMT) Deeply tied to Cardano, WMT is expanding across Ethereum and Cosmos, aiming to bring decentralized connectivity worldwide and become a major Cardano partner chain. Borg Token (BORG) This exchange token powers the Swissborg ecosystem (CeFi to DeFi). With one-third of its supply staked and recent integration into Hyperliquid, BORG is gaining traction fast. COTI (COTI) Originally Cardano-native, COTI is now an Ethereum L2 focused on compliant privacy and RWAs. It’s powering the digital euro and collaborating across Africa and the Middle East in a $30 trillion market space. Foxy (FOXY) More than a meme coin, FOXY is the mascot of Linea, a rising Ethereum Layer 2 . If Linea continues to grow, FOXY could gain infrastructure-level support rare among meme coins. Solana (SOL) Still central to the L1 narrative, Solana is praised for its speed and scalability. Analysts call it “the next Ethereum” despite past challenges. Sui (SUI) Dubbed “the next Solana,” Sui is gaining attention for its high-performance architecture. Analysts say it’s in a strong race alongside Solana this cycle. Supra (SUPRA) Seen as a “next-gen blockchain,” Supra might be “the next Sui.” It’s a part of the rising L1 narrative, focused on speed and interoperability. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : 97% of Bitcoin Holders in Profit After $100K Surge: Will BTC Price Hold or Face Selling Pressure? , Injective (INJ) Tailored for decentralized finance , Injective enables tokenized stocks and RWAs like MAG7. Analysts say it’s paving the way for a decentralized Wall Street. Paid Network (PAID) An OG crypto project, PAID is building legal and crowdfunding tools for startups. Now in its third cycle, it’s seen as a strong small-cap survivor. ResearchCoin (RSC) Powering the DeSci (Decentralized Science) movement, RSC rewards researchers for publishing open data. It’s poised to become a leading token in decentralized scientific discovery. Final Thoughts As Bitcoin dominance drops and Ethereum gains steam , the spotlight is shifting toward altcoins. With real-world use cases, institutional adoption, and emerging narratives, these 14 tokens could be the breakout stars of the next crypto bull run. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Japanese firm recently launched its U.S.-based arm, Metaplanet Treasury Corp. , dedicated to accumulating Bitcoin. As part of this bold strategy, it’s planning a $250 million bond sale to fund additional BTC purchases—signaling a deep commitment to its Bitcoin-first approach. Adam Back: Metaplanet Outperforms MicroStrategy According to Blockstream CEO Adam Back , Metaplanet is significantly more efficient than MicroStrategy in generating returns from Bitcoin. Using a metric called “months to mNAV cover,” Back said Metaplanet delivers a 2x BTC yield in just 3 months. Currently, Metaplanet’s market Net Asset Value (mNAV) stands at 3.3x , and could hit 8.3x if the current pace continues. This would allow its stock price to jump from ¥533 to ¥1,340 , according to Back. “Metaplanet is growing 3.8 times faster than MicroStrategy in terms of mNAV coverage,” Back wrote on X. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Tops $100K Again! Changpeng “CZ” Zhao Urges Traders to ‘Stay Calm and Hold’ , Metaplanet Stock Is Gaining Momentum As of now, Metaplanet holds over $536 million in Bitcoin , acquired at an average price of $86,672 per coin . In 2025, its BTC yield stands at 136.7% , and the company’s stock has recently surged 11.5% , closing at ¥477 ($3.33) . Risks Still Exist While the performance looks strong, crypto analyst @agentic_t noted that markets are volatile and emphasized that risk-adjusted returns should be considered. “2x yields are great, but not always guaranteed,” he warned.With fast Bitcoin accumulation, a growing presence in U.S. capital markets, and high praise from industry experts like Adam Back , Metaplanet stock could become one of the top BTC plays globally.

The renewed momentum around stablecoins has reignited concerns among U.S. lawmakers, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is pushing to keep Big Tech players like Meta from issuing their own digital currencies. Meta’s communications director, Andy Stone, has publicly denied these claims, stating bluntly, “Diem is dead. There is no Meta stablecoin.” Still, insiders suggest informal discussions are ongoing behind closed doors. Whilst Diem failed in the aftermath of regulatory, legislative, and financial watchdog backlash, Meta seems to quietly find new methods to gain entry to the stablecoin market . There has been no official word of this development. Still, speculation is growing that the company will begin to deploy stablecoins to optimize creator payments and facilitate international transactions. Senator Warren demands tougher GENIUS Act to block Big Tech from controlling stablecoins Senator Elizabeth Warren is sounding the alarm over the GENIUS Act — the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act — demanding crucial changes to prevent Big Tech from entering the stablecoin market. Warren argues that the Senate must strengthen the GENIUS Act and clarify that Big Tech and other large commercial firms should not be allowed to own or control stablecoins . Before the GENIUS bill was defeated, she said, “If we can reach a compromise solution on these issues today, I will vote for the bill. If not, I will be fighting against it.” Her concern is clear: If Big Tech companies have financial control over digital currency systems, they can use it to untangle user transactions, tinker with digital payments, and perhaps stamp out competitors and dissenters. Addressing the involvement of Meta, Warren explicitly questioned Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, asking whether his company plans to quietly bring back what was once its plans to roll out its stablecoin. Warren said that Zuckerberg owes it to Congress to explain whether this is another ploy to indirectly use the American people’s money to support the market. For Warren, the prospect of Meta or any tech company overseeing a digital currency threatens not just the business of finance — but the very idea of democracy. She fears it could put these companies on steroids, with outsize sway over politics, commerce, and civil liberties. Lawmakers block stablecoin legislation as Meta attempts revival On Thursday, Democrats blocked the Senate from considering the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. The bill was voted down 48-49, falling short of the 60 votes required to bring it closer to final passage. The vote was split almost entirely along party lines after bipartisan support for the legislation fell apart last week. Though initially expected to secure prompt approval of another must-do measure, the bill faced opposition from some Democratic senators. They said they still had concerns about provisions on anti-money laundering, national security, and a handful of other issues and could not support the bill’s current version. Warren and her allies argue that the bill could allow corporate interests to control financial transactions without stronger safeguards. The GENIUS Act is getting a hard look or two now, with some calls to fix it. Sen. Ruben Gallego (Ariz.), the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, had initially asked to delay the vote until Monday to give senators more time. However, his request was rejected, and Democrats voted down the bill. At the heart of the debate is whether companies like Meta should be allowed to re-enter the stablecoin space, a prospect that many lawmakers, including Warren, view as a serious risk to financial stability and democratic oversight. The GENIUS Act is now back in negotiations, and some lawmakers remained hopeful it could reappear on the Senate floor as early as next week.

Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying” “I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November . SWFs are government-owned investment funds that manage national savings , often built from surplus revenues like oil profits or trade gains. Norway has the largest SWF in the world, with approximately $1.73 trillion in assets under management, followed by China with $1.33 trillion, according to data from Visual Capitalist. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) market cap is approximately $2.05 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Anthony Scaramucci spoke to Anthony Pompliano on his podcast on May 8. Source: Anthony Pompliano Scaramucci said that if stablecoin regulation is passed, clear guidance is provided for traditional banks to custody of Bitcoin and other digital assets, and there’s progress on tokenizing stocks and bonds, a significant wave of buying from Sovereign Wealth Funds is likely to follow. “Then I will tell you that there will be large blocks of buying, or people worth 10, 20, 30 trillion dollars, buying a half a billion dollars of Bitcoin, buying a billion of Bitcoin,” Scaramucci said. Related: Institutional investors continue to scoop up Bitcoin above $100K “But if you wanna see a million dollar Bitcoin, that’s when someone at a sovereign says ok, this is part of the infrastructure of the world’s financial services architecture,” he added. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently said that the chances of Bitcoin reaching a seven-figure price by 2030 have increased. “We actually think the odds have gone up that our bull case will be the right number because of what is becoming the institutionalization of this new asset class,” Woods said in February.

Ethereum Staking Back in Spotlight During the early July meeting, BlackRock stressed that Ethereum ETFs are “less perfect” without staking, as investors miss out on yield from locked ETH. Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, described staking for spot ETH ETFs as a “step change upward,” though he acknowledged regulatory and operational complexities ahead. Under SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the agency previously blocked staking features in ETH ETFs. But with the potential shift in stance, staking approval could allow ETH ETFs to generate revenue by earning yield. Other firms like Fidelity and Grayscale are also lobbying for staking support. Notably, the NYSE proposed a rule change in February to enable staking in Grayscale’s fund—currently under review. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin With a 35% Breakout; A New ATH at $6000 is Loading! , Tokenization Momentum Builds The meeting also covered BlackRock’s push to tokenize traditional financial assets. The firm highlighted its $2.9 billion BUIDL fund—a tokenized U.S. Treasury product—promoting blockchain -based solutions for bonds and securities with faster settlements, lower fees, and round-the-clock trading. Rival efforts include Franklin Templeton’s BENJI fund and Robinhood’s blockchain project aimed at offering tokenized U.S. stocks to European users. While the SEC has not disclosed the outcome of the meeting, BlackRock’s continued advocacy signals growing momentum in blending crypto innovation with mainstream finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Tim Scott promises “painful repercussions” for Democrats who stalled crypto’s GENIUS Act,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/scott-painful-repercussions-dems-crypto-bill/,"Senator Tim Scott said on Thursday night that Democrats who voted against the GENIUS Act should expect “painful” political consequences. He made the statement after the crypto bill failed in the US Senate, where Democrats blocked it despite months of bipartisan talks. The GENIUS Act, led by Senator Bill Hagerty, would have created the first legal framework for stablecoins in the US But two Democratic co-sponsors flipped their votes, and two Republicans—Josh Hawley and Rand Paul—also voted no. According to Eleanor Terrett, former Fox Business journalist and founder of Crypto in America, Scott told her he hoped the crypto industry’s reaction would push lawmakers to return and pass the bill. Scott, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said his party had made “major concessions” to get the bill across. Those included reducing the time for stablecoin issuers to register in the US, tightening national security rules, and softening anti-money laundering measures. Still, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks—who helped write the bill—turned their backs on it. Scott told Eleanor, “If you can get so much of what you want, and you still can’t say yes, I don’t get it.” He said he hopes both Democrats and the two Republicans who opposed it will come around after realizing how the delay hurts financial inclusion and blocks crypto innovation. Democrats stall bill as Trump’s crypto ties dominate talks The bill failed in a Senate where crypto had, until now, enjoyed its most favorable climate under President Donald Trump’s second term. The setback was the first major blow for the industry in the Trump era. Republican leaders needed Democratic votes to push the bill through, and they didn’t get them. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, had warned his caucus a week before the vote not to commit to supporting the bill. Behind closed doors, he asked them to use their leverage to demand more changes. Lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Chris Murphy raised concerns about passing any crypto legislation while the Trump family remained so deeply involved in the space. Trump’s sons launched a stablecoin venture last year, and Trump himself issued a memecoin just two days before taking office again. Murphy said, “The Trump crypto coin scam is the biggest corruption in the history of the White House.” He and others demanded language in the bill that would bar any president from creating or profiting from crypto. Not everyone agreed. Senator Ruben Gallego, who voted for an earlier version of the bill and led last-minute negotiations, said Trump’s coin had nothing to do with the actual bill. “If we don’t pass any stablecoin legislation, he’s still going to do everything he’s going to do right now. The most important thing we can do is get a strong, strong bill.” After the bill died, Scott stood on the Senate floor and said, “It was a vote to stop President Trump from having a victory in the digital asset space. It was a vote against common sense — that simple.” He accused Democrats of letting “Trump Derangement Syndrome” hijack what could’ve been a win for both parties and the crypto space. Democrats said they needed more time to finalize the deal. Gallego asked to delay the vote on the Senate floor, but Republicans rejected the request. Now, Senate Majority Leader John Thune has filed a motion to reconsider, which could bring the bill back. Senator Warren told reporters, “I always worry about the influence of money in Washington, but the crypto industry seems to think that they have a lot of power right now because of the contributions that they’ve made.” After the vote, Scott’s team made it clear they don’t want crypto donors wasting money on Democrats anymore. Jennifer DeCasper, Scott’s longtime aide and the current Executive Director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said, “Anyone backing Senate Democrats in hopes of crypto progress is ignoring reality.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

On Friday, Senior US District Judge Susan Illston issued a court order that blocks Trump’s executive plan to lay off thousands of federal workers. This came after a February directive from the White House, signed by Trump, called for a massive shake-up of the federal workforce, one that would shut down agencies and force early retirements across multiple departments. The order was about to go live, but the court just hit the brakes—hard. The ruling stalls the administration’s move to fire workers at Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration, State, Treasury, and Transportation, just days before the layoffs were set to begin. Illston said the government can’t skip the legal steps. She made it clear Trump does have the power to restructure agencies, but only by following the rules, and when it involves large cuts, Congress has to be involved. Judge says layoffs can’t start until May 23 According to Politico, Illston froze all new layoff notices and stopped any existing ones from being carried out until May 23. This includes notices by the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management. Some agencies were less than two weeks away from starting the firings. The court order now stops every single one of them—at least temporarily. The court named several departments targeted in Trump’s executive order. That includes Energy, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Interior, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, DOGE , AmeriCorps, the National Labor Relations Board, National Science Foundation, and the Small Business Administration. During the Friday hearing, Illston said the executive order looked like it was written to dodge all the slow parts of the law. She didn’t hold back on why she believed the plan moved the way it did. “I think that is probably why the executive order said what it said, because there is some impatience with how slow that process can be,” she told the courtroom. “But if the statutes provide for the process, then the process needs to be followed.” Illston reminded everyone this isn’t the first time Trump tried something like this. In 2017, he made another effort to overhaul the government, but that time, he asked Congress to pass legislation to support it. In her ruling, she wrote, “Nothing prevents the President from requesting this cooperation — as he did in his prior term of office.” Unions and nonprofits push back against Trump’s plan The court fight started when major federal worker unions and several nonprofits sued the administration over the February order. They said Trump’s plan to shut down offices and fire workers through voluntary retirement and large-scale reductions-in-force broke federal law and violated the Constitution. They argued the White House ignored the requirement to provide 60 days’ notice, assess veteran status, and check if workers could be reassigned instead of fired. Lawyers for Trump claimed the court didn’t have the power to hear the case. They said workers could take their complaints to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the body that handles job disputes in the federal workforce. But that’s where the whole thing fell apart. Illston pointed out that the Merit Systems Protection Board doesn’t have enough people to make decisions. She also said the Trump administration hadn’t told Congress or the unions anything about how the layoffs would be done.

However, the rising RSI suggests the asset may be overbought and vulnerable to a short-term pullback. New Peak on the Way? The price of the leading cryptocurrency has been booming lately, briefly climbing above $104,000 earlier today (May 9). As of this writing, bitcoin (BTC) is worth approximately $103,000, which represents a 33% monthly increase. The asset’s impressive rally sparked huge enthusiasm on crypto X, with multiple users predicting that an upswing toward a new all-time high is just a matter of time. Some important factors support the bullish thesis. An example is BTC’s exchange netflow, which has been predominantly negative on most days in the past week or so. This indicates a shift from centralized trading platforms toward self-custody methods and reduced selling pressure. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant The interest in BTC is also worth mentioning. Over the last few weeks, Google searches with the word ‘bitcoin’ have been on the rise, signaling increased attention from investors, especially retail. BTC searches, Source: Google Trends As CryptoPotato reported earlier today (May 9), Bitcoin’s network saw almost 350,000 newly created wallets in a single day, signaling a FOMO effect. On some occasions in the past, the massive influx of retail investors has been a precursor of cycle tops. Although the current retail numbers are higher now than in the last several weeks, they are still far from what could be described as the bull run top. Last but not least, we will focus on the upcoming meeting between US and Chinese officials scheduled for this weekend. The two sides will supposedly discuss de-escalation of the ongoing trade war. Recently, American President Donald Trump hinted that the tariffs imposed on China might be cut in the near future. Eased tension between the two biggest economies in the world could positively impact the financial and crypto markets since it would reduce uncertainty and might boost investor confidence. Greed Is Here, But Watch Out BTC’s recent bull run seems to have affected investors’ sentiment. Today, the popular Fear & Greed Index surged to “greed” territory of 73, a level last observed in January this year. BTC Fear and Greed Index, Source: alternative.me The metric tracks numerous segments, such as price volatility, social media comments, and surveys, to determine the momentary investor feelings toward BTC. The predominantly bullish sentiment might sound encouraging, but one should keep in mind Warren Buffett’s advice, who once urged people “to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.” The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is another indicator worth monitoring. The momentum oscillator measures the speed and magnitude of the latest price changes and varies from 0 to 100. It helps traders spot potential trend reversals, as readings above 70 typically signal that the asset could be overbought and headed for a pullback. Currently, the ratio stands at almost 75.

Notably, BTC surged past $100,000 yesterday for the first time since February 3. Bitcoin On The Verge Of Trend Reversal? At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $100,000, approximately 5.2% below its all-time high (ATH) of $108,786, set earlier this year on January 20. The leading cryptocurrency has staged an impressive rebound of over 20% from its recent low of $74,508 recorded on April 6. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Apparent Demand’ Makes Sharp Rebound – Will BTC Breakout Soon? In their analysis, crypto analyst burakkemeci referred to the CryptoQuant Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator, saying that it is flashing the early signs of a potential bullish trend reversal. The analyst noted: With Bitcoin surging back above $100K, the indicator has started flashing bullish signals again – for the first time in weeks. Although the signal is still weak (coefficient: 0.029), the mere appearance of a positive shift is encouraging. To explain, the CryptoQuant Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is an on-chain tool that tracks long-term and short-term market sentiment by comparing price momentum and investor behavior trends. It uses two key components – the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MA) – to identify shifts between bull and bear cycles. Importantly, the analyst pointed out that the Bull-Bear 30-day MA has started to turn upward. If this metric crosses above the 365-day MA, historical trends suggest Bitcoin could enter a phase of parabolic price growth. Recent macroeconomic developments may further support the bullish narrative for Bitcoin. Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor, recently highlighted the relationship between the global M2 money supply and the price of BTC. Bittel shared a chart that overlays BTC’s price with the M2 money supply, adjusted with a 12-week lag. The data reveals a steep increase in global liquidity since early 2025, implying that BTC could follow this trend and continue rising in the months ahead. Warning Signs Still Linger For BTC Despite recent strength, not all signals are bullish. Analysts caution that the current rally has been accompanied by aggressive profit-taking, increasing the chances of a local top forming. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still Far From A True Supply Shock, Analyst Explains Further, recent analysis shows that BTC’s Demand Momentum is yet to come out of negative territory. The analyst noted that such market behavior is mostly prevalent during late-cycle distribution phases or macro-level consolidation periods. That said, Bitcoin’s Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) is beginning to reflect renewed bullish momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $103,444, up 4% in the past 24 hours.

However, the assets remain locked within the ecosystem and are inaccessible for transfer or resale. Powered by blockchain technology, Web3 gaming introduces true asset ownership via fungible and non-fungible tokens. Players can sell or trade their in-game items across platforms, building a player-driven economy that mirrors real-world markets. Blockchains introduce transparency and reduce restrictions Blockchains introduce transparency, verifying and reliably storing each in-game transaction, which helps prevent fraud and builds trust between developers and players. Web3 games are hosted on a decentralized node network, making them very hard to hack or shut down. The network also allows users to play Web3 games from anywhere in the world as long as they have an internet connection. Tradition meets modernity in the mobile-friendly Web3 game NFL Rivals, officially licensed by the National Football League and the NFL Players Association. It brings together NFT trading and fantasy football, allowing players to create and manage a virtual team, trade individual game characters as NFTs, compete against other teams, etc. The unique NFTs come with different strengths and rarity levels and can be sold, bought, and traded on Mythical Marketplace, the trading platform of the game’s creator, Mythical Games. More than 150,000 people signed up to play NFL Rivals in its beta phase, and this number increased further after the official launch. The game was downloaded more than five million times in the inaugural season when more than 115 million games were played . NFT trading volume reached $6 million in 2024. In-game NFT trades took just over a month to increase from $4 million to $5 million and 27 days to grow from $5 million to $6 million. The platform will launch FIFA Rivals, targeting soccer fans across the globe, in the summer of 2025. Web2 continues to dominate global gaming While Web3’s rapid progress has been remarkable, Web2 games remain more accessible to a wider audience. In February 2025, Roblox alone reported 85 million daily active users , with its monthly player base including 50% of US children under 16. Other major titles, such as Call of Duty, Minecraft, and Fortnite, each boast tens of millions of active players. In addition, user engagement with Web3 games tends to fluctuate. The industry reached 5.5 million daily active users in November 2024, up 15.7% from October . However, this growth is not consistent across platforms. Hamster Kombat claimed over 300 million users in August and September 2024, but actual engagement was far lower, with 51.9 million monthly active users at the end of October. Web3 gaming may be growing, but it still represents a small fraction of the global gaming market. What’s more, concepts like Web3, NFTs, and blockchain have failed to resonate with many Web2 users. This prompted the developers or publishers of Steam, GTA V, and Minecraft to remove everything related to Web3 from their platforms. Real interest in company growth makes all the difference Web2 platforms sell user data to advertisers to make money, contrasting with the sacrosanctity of personal information in Web3. How do the games make a profit, then? The difference lies in the interest of organizations like the DAO supporting Mythical Games in company development and growth. If the platform grows, the value of the native token (in this case, MYTH) required to participate in the ecosystem increases, and players can sell it. What’s more, MYTH token holders play a crucial role by voting on DAO proposals, taking part in governance decisions, and generally influencing the Mythical ecosystem’s direction. While Web2 players spend money on digital items without external value, Web3 currencies and goods can appreciate over time, giving players a reliable incentive to engage. These processes are palpable in emerging markets, where blockchain-based games can offer a feasible alternative to conventional forms of employment. Players can enjoy the games while capitalizing on project growth. Web3 is still in its infancy, but the lucrative mechanisms underpinning it promise to enhance and sustain players’ motivation to a greater extent than its predecessor.",Information|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-10 05:32:22

The post calls into question the psychological feasibility of such a strategy, arguing that many investors are underestimating the emotional and financial pressures associated with large, sudden gains. DIAMOND HANDS UNTIL $10,000? LET'S GET REAL ABOUT YOUR XRP EXIT STRATEGY.

At… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 7, 2025 The tweet challenges the idea that individuals who hold significant amounts of XRP would remain unaffected by rapidly appreciating value. A scenario is laid out: a holder with 10,000 XRP sees their holdings reach $100 million if the asset hits $10,000 per coin . The commentator asks whether anyone would passively watch their portfolio climb to $50 million and then decide it’s still insufficient. According to the post, the human response to that level of wealth is rarely rooted in restraint, especially when faced with the opportunity to improve one’s quality of life drastically.

When XRP reaches $10, a $10,000 investment becomes $100,000, a point where many think seriously about liquidating. By the time it hits $100, that same investment reaches $1 million, and real-world considerations—such as family responsibilities, debt relief, and career changes — take priority. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At a $1,000 valuation per coin, a $10,000 initial position can reach $10 million, drawing in extended family, unexpected attention, and pressure to address financial needs outside the investor’s immediate goals. The Difference Between Memes and Maturity Rather than relying on slogans or idealistic memes, the tweet emphasizes the need for a more grounded view of wealth accumulation. The commentator dismisses the talk of “diamond hands” versus “paper hands” and instead promotes a third category: realistic, prepared investors who understand that wealth management involves discipline, not denial. According to the tweet, professional investors typically do not wait for a singular “moonshot” moment. Instead, they operate with pre-defined exit strategies, taking profits at logical intervals to reduce exposure and manage risk. The suggestion is not necessarily to abandon the idea of long-term holding , but to be transparent and deliberate about one’s thresholds for profit-taking. Private Exit Strategies Deserve Honest Reflection The commentator concludes by urging followers to confront their actual plans. Many, they argue, privately hold more nuanced exit strategies than they publicly admit. These include partial sell-offs at various price milestones or gradual reduction of holdings as key targets are met. The overall message is that maturity in investing does not come from holding forever, but from being prepared to act responsibly when opportunity arises.

Built on Ethereum and introduced as a playful alternative to Dogecoin, it quickly gained traction through online communities and social momentum. The Shiba Inu dog mascot came to represent the rise of retail investor enthusiasm, attracting a massive wave of participants to the crypto space. Over time, the Shiba Inu ecosystem expanded to include a decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), its own Layer 2 network (Shibarium), and even a foray into metaverse development. Yet, despite these additions, market activity around SHIB has cooled, with much of its early surge driven by sentiment rather than consistent on-chain utility. While the token still holds cultural value and has a loyal base, many long-term investors are now exploring alternatives that prioritize financial functionality over hype. One of those alternatives is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a project that’s gaining momentum not for memes, but for real passive yield and lending infrastructure. With a current price of only $0.025, it’s emerging as one of the top low-cost cryptocurrency options for investors aiming at long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t aiming for virality — it’s focused on solving real problems in DeFi. The protocol offers decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing, where users can supply assets like ETH or BTC and unlock liquidity without needing to sell their core holdings. This structure provides flexibility. Users can borrow stablecoins against collateral and still benefit from future market gains on the assets they’ve deposited. It’s a practical tool, not a speculative bet. That shift in purpose — from meme to mechanism — is what’s attracting a new wave of interest. Adding to this utility is Mutuum’s use of mtTokens. Users who contribute assets to the protocol receive mtTokens in exchange — tokenized assets that reflect their original deposit and steadily accumulate interest over time. These tokens are transferable and compatible across DeFi platforms, making them more than placeholders. They’re functional instruments of value within the ecosystem. Currently in its fourth presale phase, MUTM remains available at $0.025 — a figure that won’t last long. With over $7.75 million raised and the next price tier set at $0.03, interest is rising among early adopters aiming to enter before the price adjusts. The eventual launch is priced at $0.06, but projections for MUTM stretch much further, with long-term forecasts suggesting a potential to reach several dollars per token. For those making calculated crypto investment decisions, this timeline matters. Getting in now, at presale, means doubling returns before the token even lists on major exchanges. And with more than 9,500 holders already on board, it’s clear that demand is growing — but it’s still early. Unlike tokens that depend on external hype cycles, MUTM’s value is directly tied to activity within the protocol. The borrowing activity within the platform generates revenue that is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market, which are then redistributed to contributors, forming a sustainable, yield-driven cycle. This buy-and-distribute mechanism benefits those who hold and participate in the system, rather than relying on short-term speculation. It’s a model that aligns with investor goals in 2025 — passive income, utility, and transparency. With additional features like a protocol-native stablecoin under development and plans to roll out a beta version of the platform at launch, Mutuum isn’t waiting to build utility after the fact. It’s preparing to offer it from day one. SHIB captured attention and created a movement — no one can deny that. However, as the market evolves, attention is turning in a new direction. Utility, sustainability, and reward mechanisms are taking the lead, and that’s where MUTM is gaining ground. While one token built its foundation on hype, the other is building yield-backed infrastructure designed to scale. For those exploring the best cryptocurrency to invest in with future returns in mind, Mutuum Finance may be the better choice — and right now, it’s still trading under three cents.

At the same time, other whales continue to accumulate the asset, perhaps to secure a place in the upcoming dinner with the President. TRUMP Team Sells Again? The controversy around the fourth-largest meme coin continues as the team behind it has made another sizeable transaction into centralized exchanges. In the latest example, a wallet linked to them deposited over $52 million worth of TRUMP into trading platforms, which is typically associated with sales; otherwise, why would they transfer funds to exchanges, as everything on the blockchain is visible and traceable? The wallet linked to the $TRUMP team just deposited 3.5M $TRUMP ($52.66M) into exchanges again. https://t.co/9nc4YjTvxE https://t.co/Y8lStmCWyw pic.twitter.com/alY3TRv1oz — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 10, 2025 This is far from the first similar instance. Recall that in late April, the team transferred a more modest $20 million worth of the meme coin to Binance, OKX, and Bybit. At the time, TRUMP’s price had also risen in value after the announcement of the upcoming dinner with the president at one of his golf establishments in Washington, DC. A recent report by Chainalysis, cited by CNBC, indicated that the TRUMP team has profited somewhere around $320 million from different activities with the token, including fees routed to wallets tied to the creators. At the same time, the US President continues to claim that he has not profited even a cent from the meme coin’s price gains. Whales Keep Buying Following the dinner announcement made last month, which says that the top 220 TRUMP holders will have a chance to attend a special event with the POTUS on May 22, many investors rushed to purchase the profit, some with the obvious intention to attend it, others to profit by speculating. With just a few days left until the holders’ snapshot deadline is over, on-chain data shows that one whale spent 4 million USDC to acquire 276,968 TRUMP tokens at $14.44. As of press time, this secures them a seat at the presidential table. A whale just withdrew 4M $USDC from #Binance to buy 276,968 $TRUMP at $14.44. https://t.co/DG97zijyMu pic.twitter.com/uYCLlSOM72 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 10, 2025 The post Did The TRUMP Token Team Just Sell Another $50 Million as Price Surged? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Official Trump (TRUMP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-10 05:54:21

Wall Street’s wealthiest institutions are cutting down on their dollar holdings and piling into European markets, as new data shows a massive pullback from US equities and bonds. According to the Financial Times, this is not a one-time reaction. It’s a long-term retreat, driven by chaos in Washington, falling confidence in the Federal Reserve, and the latest wave of tariff fights started by President Donald Trump. The White House has been on a warpath against the Fed chair, while the broader policy outlook has turned into a mess. Even though US stock prices bounced after Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, they’re still down this year, and trailing behind global competitors. Meanwhile, the US dollar has lost over 7% since January, and traders are now watching what some are calling early signs of a capital exodus into safer European investments like German bonds. European equities soak up investor money while ETFs bleed Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said the flow is already underway. “It is happening. It will be slow but inevitable,” he said, pointing to low valuations and Germany’s rising defense budget as clear reasons why investors see more value in Europe. The evidence is everywhere. In March, a Bank of America survey showed investors made their biggest cut ever to US stock holdings, and the pivot to Europe was the fastest since 1999. In April, €2.5 billion flowed out of European-domiciled ETFs holding US stocks and bonds—the highest figure since early 2023, based on Morningstar Direct data. The bleeding didn’t stop there. Early May numbers show more outflows from equity ETFs, though fixed-income ones managed to claw back a bit of interest. Spot markets are seeing a steady dump of US dollars in favor of euros, and investment banks say institutional players are doing the bulk of the trading. Pension funds across continents turn their backs on US assets Big retirement funds are now leading the exodus. Laura Wickström, CIO at Finland’s Veritas Pension Insurance Company, said they slashed US stock exposure in the first quarter. She cited overpriced valuations and the confusion caused by tariff decisions. “The uncertainty and the communication around tariffs … the confusion and unpredictability associated with that made us question the idea that you should pay that sort of premium,” said Laura. In Australia, John Pearce, who runs investments at the A$149 billion UniSuper fund, echoed the same doubt. He told the fund’s podcast that his team had “quite a large exposure to US assets” but were now “questioning that commitment.” He added, “Frankly, I think we’ve seen peak investment in US assets.” Danish pension funds joined the trend too. In Q1, they sold US stocks for the first time since 2022 and made their biggest purchase of European-listed shares since 2018. Sam Lynton Brown, head of macro strategy at BNP Paribas, said if European pension funds bring their US exposure back to 2015 levels, that would mean dumping €300 billion in dollar-denominated investments. For years, the US was the top destination for capital, backed by liquidity and strong market returns. But John Butler, a strategist at Wellington Management, said the tide is turning. “If the globalisation of capital goes in reverse, the question becomes how far and fast it does so.” Even in the US, institutions are no longer sure about sticking with the dollar. Scott Chan, CIO at California’s $350 billion State Teachers’ Retirement System, told his board this week that “one of the unintended risks and consequences of opening Pandora’s box on tariffs” could be that America’s top trade partners start selling US assets. “The question for us is do we need greater diversification because we are very focused on US assets,” he said. The dollar plunge has been hurting foreign holders who didn’t hedge their positions. Bank of America estimates that if European investors hedge their currency exposure like they did pre-Covid, that would involve $2.5 trillion in hedging—something that could drag the dollar down even further.

Here’s the Latest Development,https://timestabloid.com/blackrock-xrp-etf-is-coming-heres-the-latest-development/,"In a significant development for the cryptocurrency sector, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has reportedly met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force to discuss standards for approving Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Crypto influencer Amelie shared the news on X, sparking widespread excitement within the XRP community. BREAKING: BLACKROCK MEETS WITH THE SEC CRYPTO TASK FORCE TO DISCUSS ETF APPROVAL STANDARDS! BLACKROCK #XRP ETF IS COMING SOON! pic.twitter.com/fPj2FwG5wU — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 9, 2025 BlackRock’s Strategic Move Towards an XRP ETF The meeting between BlackRock and the SEC’s specialized crypto team signals the asset manager’s growing interest in launching a dedicated XRP ETF. As the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, BlackRock’s proactive engagement with the SEC highlights its commitment to navigating the compliance complexities of introducing a crypto-based financial product. While details of the discussions remain sparse, the meeting’s agenda reportedly focused on establishing standardized criteria for ETF approval. This development follows recent trends in the financial industry, where major asset management firms are increasingly exploring ways to incorporate digital assets into traditional investment portfolios. Why an XRP ETF Matters If approved, BlackRock’s XRP ETF would mark a groundbreaking milestone for Ripple and the broader crypto market. ETFs offer investors a way to gain exposure to assets without directly purchasing them, simplifying investment while potentially boosting liquidity. In the case of XRP, an ETF would provide institutional investors with a regulated and easily accessible avenue to invest, significantly increasing market participation. A potential XRP ETF launch highlights increasing institutional investment in the digital asset, driven partly by recent developments around the Ripple vs SEC saga. With XRP now recognized as a regulated cryptocurrency in the United States, asset managers like BlackRock are seizing the opportunity to capitalize on the renewed market confidence. What an ETF Could Mean for XRP’s Price The prospect of a BlackRock XRP ETF has stirred speculation about how it could influence XRP’s valuation. Past approvals of cryptocurrency ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have typically led to bullish price movements, suggesting a potential trend. Analysts believe XRP ETF could similarly trigger substantial upward momentum, fueled by increased demand from retail and institutional investors. Market experts also point out that BlackRock’s involvement lends significant credibility to XRP’s investment potential. As a financial giant managing trillions in assets, BlackRock’s endorsement of XRP through an ETF would likely attract other major players to consider similar financial products. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory Hurdles and Market Outlook Despite the optimism, securing approval for an XRP ETF is far from guaranteed. The SEC’s cautious stance on crypto ETFs stems from worries about market volatility and protecting investors. However, the meeting signals progress, indicating that BlackRock is actively addressing these regulatory concerns. Some analysts speculate that the recent settlement agreement between Ripple and the SEC could work in BlackRock’s favor. XRP’s clearer regulatory status could pave the way for a more favorable SEC review of the ETF proposal. Industry Reactions and the Road Ahead The potential launch of an XRP ETF has drawn considerable attention from the crypto and financial communities. Supporters argue that such a product could significantly bolster XRP’s mainstream adoption, while skeptics remain cautious, pointing out that regulatory approval is never a given. Amelie’s update has sparked anticipation in the XRP market, generating excitement among investors. The crypto community will wait for further updates, hoping BlackRock’s efforts will lead to a fully approved XRP ETF. Should the SEC ultimately give the green light, it would mark an unprecedented moment in the intersection of traditional finance and the cryptocurrency ecosystem..

XRP Holds at $2 & SUI Boasts 500M Transactions",https://thecoinrise.com/dragoins-6700-roi-and-telegram-game-draw-investors-attention-xrp-holds-at-2-sui-boasts-500m-transactions/,"The altcoin market is showing mixed signals this week. Sui (SUI) has surpassed 500 million transactions in 2025 alone, attracting DeFi activity and strong support from the developer community. XRP, meanwhile, continues to trade above the $2.00 level, though its upward momentum appears limited due to resistance levels capping any major gains. While SUI and XRP face technical resistance, Dragoin ($DDGN) is standing out by showing actual progress. Its Telegram-based game is already active in beta, offering real interaction before the coin even launches. Combined with a clear roadmap and fully audited smart contracts, Dragoin is showing why it’s getting attention at its current price of $0.0000386, heading for a $0.002 listing, a potential ROI of 6,700%. SUI’s Massive On-Chain Growth and $2.17 Resistance Test Sui (SUI) has quickly established itself as a busy Layer 1 chain, processing over 501 million transactions this year, more than Ethereum and Bitcoin combined over the same period. Its smart contract framework and DeFi ecosystem have attracted developers and liquidity, helping to push open interest above $318 million. From a technical view, SUI is hovering just below $2.1707 resistance, and some expect a break toward $2.20. Momentum indicators like the MACD and RSI offer mixed signals, but the overall market structure hints at potential upside. This excitement is tied to real usage. SUI is not driven by empty speculation, it’s being adopted heavily. That kind of steady growth usually leads to stronger price movement if the key level is cleared. XRP Maintains $2 Support But Lacks Upward Drive XRP continues to hold above the $2.00 support, though it’s showing limited signs of breaking higher. On the USDT pair, it remains around the 200-day moving average at $2.00, while facing pressure from the $2.40–$2.60 resistance range. Indicators like RSI stay near the neutral 50 mark, and low trading volumes suggest that traders are waiting for more direction. Against BTC, XRP is still in a declining trend, sitting under 2,800 SAT without signs of recovery. A reversal above that level is needed to open up gains. Although Ripple’s technology remains strong, the current outlook for XRP appears more about maintaining its position than making a move. Without a strong breakout, XRP’s path forward is uncertain. Dragoin: Telegram Game, Audited Tech, and 6,700% ROI Window SUI’s usage growth and XRP’s technical base are notable, but Dragoin is moving faster than both by offering working features right now. Its Telegram beta game is already available, giving users something tangible well before the official token launch. This hands-on feature sets Dragoin apart from other projects still in the concept phase. The roadmap is equally structured and visible. In Q2 2025, the focus is on presale and early user growth. Q3 introduces the MVP rollout, with exchange listings and multichain expansion in Q4. By early 2026, Dragoin aims to release its SDK and launch both mobile and web platforms. Each milestone is public and time-bound, providing accountability that’s rare in this space. Technically, Dragoin’s smart contracts have passed audits, and token allocation details are published. The distribution includes 40% for presale users, 30% to community rewards via DAO, and the rest to development and long-term partners. This gives Dragoin a solid structure for steady development. At its current price of $0.0000386 and a confirmed $0.002 launch price, Dragoin presents a 6,700% ROI opportunity. What separates Dragoin is that it’s not just making promises, it’s already delivering results. Final Say! SUI is gaining usage rapidly, and XRP is holding steady, but Dragoin is actually building. With a live game, transparent roadmap, and audited smart contract system, it offers much more than hope for price increases. It provides a working experience even before its official launch. In today’s crypto space, that action speaks louder than future plans.

NEAR Protocol and Algorand have both advanced in simplifying blockchain use, with NEAR rising to $6.14 earlier in 2025 before sliding, and Algorand peaking at $0.40 in March before easing down to $0.20. Even as these networks keep building and drawing attention from institutions, Web3Bay is taking a broader approach by focusing on usability for everyday users. With $1.9 million raised by Stage 5 and PayPal integration coming, Web3Bay aims to remove crypto-only limits. Its presale format benefits early buyers and invites a wider audience to take part. Web3Bay Builds Access from the Ground Up Web3Bay is changing how people join crypto presales by focusing on ease of access. Most early-stage tokens still require users to own crypto first. Web3Bay takes a different route by planning support for PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay, which opens the door to those new to crypto. This effort to reach more people could help bring a larger audience into blockchain-based commerce. Currently in Stage 5 of its 28-stage rollout, Web3Bay has already sold over 420 million tokens and raised $1.9 million. Each 3BAY token is now priced at $0.00524, offering early buyers lower entry points with more stages to go before the final price. In addition, the 3BAY token is more than just a tradable asset. It will be used for purchases on the upcoming Web3Bay marketplace. Buyers will also get discounts, the ability to vote on platform decisions, and staking features that may offer extra rewards. By adding familiar payment choices and tying token use to real activity, Web3Bay is not just launching another token. It’s offering a new way for people to shop, earn, and decide how the platform grows. For many users, this presale marks the start of a digital economy built to include everyone, not just early adopters. NEAR Sees Early 2025 Spike Before Price Pullback NEAR Protocol has developed into one of the most user-friendly Layer 1 blockchains, aiming to offer a Web2-like experience to help more users and developers get started. Over time, the NEAR team has supported this goal with developer grants, the Aurora integration for Ethereum compatibility, and partnerships across different parts of Web3. These efforts helped boost adoption as 2025 began. In the first quarter, NEAR opened the year strong, briefly reaching a high of $6.14 in early January during a wave of interest in scalable networks. But as the wider market corrected and trading slowed down, the price moved down and reached around $2.30 by early May. Even so, analysts remain hopeful, with some expecting NEAR to climb back toward $5 before the end of the year if ecosystem growth continues. NEAR’s focus on user experience, community involvement, and strong app development keeps it in the spotlight within the competitive smart contract space. Algorand Gains Momentum, Then Slows in Early 2025 Algorand has become known for offering a balance of speed, safety, and ease of use, while also building strong ties with institutions. Since its early days, it has been developed for both public and private use cases, including digital identity, cross-border payments, and asset tokenization. By early 2025, Algorand had built several global partnerships with governments and banks, strengthening its position. In terms of price action, ALGO began the year at around $0.08, climbed to $0.40 by March, then dropped back and settled near $0.20 in early May after a general market pullback. Analysts say ALGO’s future depends on how well it follows its plan to improve its Layer 1 design and increase use among large institutions. With eco-friendly features and a growing DeFi footprint, Algorand continues to be considered by investors looking for blockchain projects with long-term goals. Web3Bay Lowers the Barrier in Crypto Presales While NEAR and Algorand work on developer tools and large-scale partnerships, their price shifts reflect a market still adjusting. Both projects offer solid foundations, but the challenge of making crypto easy for everyone still exists. Web3Bay is tackling this directly by creating a crypto presale that welcomes users without requiring crypto knowledge.

Many altcoins continue to post impressive gains, with ETH standing well above $2,300, while DOGE has soared past $0.21. BTC’s Impressive Week If we roll back the clock to May 6, we will see that BTC’s price was just rejected at $98,000, and the asset had slipped back down to under $94,000. Although this $4,000 price drop might sound painful, a broader look would show that bitcoin has still added roughly $20,000 since the early April lows. Impressive, right? Well, the primary cryptocurrency wasn’t done yet, not by a long shot. It bounced off that support line, and it took about a day to fly past the coveted $100,000 line. As such, BTC stood within a six-digit price territory for the first time in over three months. The gains kept coming on Friday as bitcoin exploded to its highest price level since late January of over $104,000. It met some resistance there and was pushed south by a few grand, but that was short-lived. As of now, BTC stands well above $103,000 – a 7% weekly surge and a 26% monthly pump. Its market capitalization has risen to $2.050 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has taken a hit and is down to 60.5%, as many altcoins have registered mindblowing price increases. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts With Big Gains Many altcoins have doubled down on yesterday’s price increases with massive gains today as well. ETH is among the leaders as another 6% surge has taken it to $2,350 where it faces a crucial resistance. Binance Coin, Solana, Avalanche, and Shiba Inu have marked similar pumps, while DOGE has risen by over 12% and now trades above $0.21. As a whole, the meme coins have posted the biggest gains, with PEPE and FARTCOIN leading the charts with substantial double-digit price increases. The total crypto market cap has surged to $3.4 trillion on CG. This means that the metric has added roughly $400 billion since May 6 . Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Ron Paul’s Warning: Government Spending and Centralized Control In a recent post on X, Ron Paul criticized both political parties for escalating government spending, particularly the approval of a $1 trillion military budget. Paul warned that this growing debt and surveillance measures like REAL ID are pushing the U.S. toward centralized control, which threatens decentralization. He stressed that simply swapping one party for another won’t solve the problem—what’s needed is a complete overhaul of the system. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Too Late to Buy Bitcoin? Samson Mow Issues Bull Run Warning as Price Breaks $103K , Kiyosaki Speaks Out Against ‘Fake Money’ Echoing Paul’s concerns, Robert Kiyosaki condemned the Federal Reserve and central banks for manipulating interest rates, a practice he called “price fixing.” He compared this system to Marxist-style central planning, where false statistics and corrupt leaders erode personal wealth and freedom. Kiyosaki also warned that the manipulation of currency harms the economy and strips away individual autonomy. The Path to Financial Freedom: Decentralization Kiyosaki believes the solution lies in rejecting fiat currency and shifting to decentralized assets such as Bitcoin, gold, and silver. In his view, these tangible assets are the only way to preserve personal freedom and safeguard wealth from government-controlled financial systems. By embracing decentralization, Kiyosaki argues, Americans can break free from what he sees as an impending socialist takeover driven by economic manipulation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

These new assets are showing promise and could offer huge profits soon. This article will examine five rising cryptocurrencies that might outperform the market and deliver gains in the coming quarter. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has stolen headlines with its claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during its presale phase. So far, the token has gone halfway, raising over $13 million, with the price of the $XTZ token standing at $0.003333. At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will rise to $0.005, meaning that investors who participated early in the project could secure massive gains. After the presale, $ XYZ will also be listed on centralized and decentralized exchanges. While the team has yet to disclose the details, they have released a teaser as they prepare for the big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for investors who are looking for big profits–the relentless, the ambitious, and the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin built for the true fighters–a mindset that athletes and sports fans believe in. $XYZ is the token for experienced investors chasing the next big thing in the crypto sector. Central to the XYZVerse story is its prized fighter in the meme coin arena, XYZepe. It has been battling hard to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next SHIB or DOGE? Only time can tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community is in charge of things. Active participants earn rewards for their activities, with the team allocating 10% of the total token supply, which is around 10 billion $XYZ for airdrops, making it one of the biggest in the industry. The project also has good tokenomics, which consists of listings on CEX and DEX, regular token burns, and making $XYZ built for a run at the championship. Every move is designed to help the token, driving its price high with help from its community that knows that it is the start of something good. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI) has experienced notable price movements recently. In the past week, its price jumped by 5.42%, with the token seeing an 83.34% rise in the past month. In the last six months, the token has risen by 61.72%, showing steady growth in the long term. Currently, the token is trading between $2.99 and $3.71 as it continues to move towards its $4.15 resistance level. If the token passes this point, it could witness a 23% increase from its current price. The next resistance is around $4.87, representing a gain of 45%. If the token slides, the nearest support level is around $2.71, a drop of around 19% from its current levels. Another support is at $2, which would be a drop of 40%. Technical analysis shows that there is buying pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 78.57, showing that the asset is overbought. The stochastic oscillator is at 93.74, supporting this view. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $3.57, a little bit above the 100-day SMA of $3.35, showing that the market is bullish. The MACD level is positive at 0.0892, also showing that the token could trade up. Based on this, SUI is expected to continue its move upward, but the overbought readings show that it could witness a correction soon. Sei (SEI) Sei (SEI) is currently trading between $0.19 and $0.22. In the past week, the price dropped about 1.27%. However, its price moves in the past month tell a different story, with the coin rising over 40%. In the past six months, SEI registered a big drop of about 50%, showing that the market is volatile. The coin is also close to its resistance level at $0.24. If it pushes above this level, SEI could be looking at the next one at $0.28, gaining around 27% from its present price levels. If the price drops, the next support level is at $0.18, with a further drop seeing the token test the second support level at $0.14. Technical indicators are not pointing to a particular movement. The 10-day SMA is around $0.21, a little bit above the 100-day SMA of $0.20. The RSI stands at 71.23, showing that SEI is almost at the overbought region. In addition, the Stochastic indicator is at 96.01. These figures show that the token could see a price correction soon, but there is still a high chance of continuing its upward trend. Tron (TRX) Tron (TRX) has grown significantly over the last six months, jumping by 55.74%. In the last month, its price rose by 9.62%, seeing a jump of 1.72% in the past week. Currently, the token is trading around $0.24 and $0.25, maintaining a steady position in the market. Technical support shows that the asset is still growing. The RSI is at 66.57, suggesting it has an opportunity to trade upward before it enters the overbought condition. The MACD level is positive at 0.001136, showing a bullish momentum. Both the 10-day and 100-day MAs are at $0.25, showing that the performance of the asset remains stable. If the token breaks past the resistance at $0.25, TRON could reach the next resistance at $0.26, showing a 4% increase. If the price slides below the support at $0.24, it could fall to $0.23, a drop of 4%. Going by the recent trends, TRON may encounter higher resistance levels, showing that it could trade upwards. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) has shown an impressive price movement lately. In the past week, the price of the token increased by 6.88%. In the past month, it rose by 54.54%, showing that it still has room to move upwards. However, in the last six months, the token has dropped by 14.49%, showing that the market remains volatile in the long term. KAS is currently trading between $0.08 and $0.10. Technical indicators show interesting trends, with the RSI standing at 69.68 and the Stochastic around 86.07, numbers that show the token is close to the overbought region. The 10-day and 100-day MAs are at $0.09, showing that the asset is consistent in long-term and short-term price moves. If the asset continues to move upwards, the token might test the resistance level at $0.11, which is a 105% rise from its current price. If it breaks past that, the next resistance is around $0.13, a jump of about 30%. On the other hand, if it drops, a support is at $0.07, signalling a decrease of about 20%. The next support is around $0.05, representing a drop of 40%. These levels are important as they would help traders watch the price moves of Kaspa for growth or decline. Conclusion While SUI, SEI, TRX, and KAS show promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its mixture of sports and memes and a big prediction of a 20,000% growth.

With the U.S.-China trade discussions reigniting global economic expectations and institutional funds flowing back into the market, digital assets are seeing a sharp resurgence. Bitcoin’s price crossing six figures again has sent ripple effects across the entire sector, shifting attention toward projects showing strong fundamentals and real-world application potential. This renewed momentum isn’t just about the big names—it’s fueling a broader search for the best crypto presale to buy for 2025, as market participants look for scalable, future-ready platforms. While top-layer protocols like Aptos and Stellar are registering increased on-chain activity, Qubetics is steadily gaining traction for introducing a practical Web3 model with real-world usability baked into its framework. Qubetics ($TICS) is solving structural problems that older chains struggled to address, offering modular development through a no-code environment while integrating core blockchain infrastructure into mainstream business operations. This shift is particularly important at a time when Aptos is gaining developer traction through its surge in real-world use cases and Stellar is pushing through a technically bullish phase, despite encountering tough price resistance. All three blockchains are moving in sync with today’s macroeconomic environment—but Qubetics, unlike the rest, is offering early access via an ongoing crypto presale that rewards timely participation and offers price stability through scheduled increases. As momentum builds across the market, this trio is becoming the center of conversation for those looking beyond the surface noise and toward long-term blockchain value. Qubetics Is Making Blockchain Development Practical Again Qubetics is building the tools that bring blockchain development back to ground level—accessible, modular, and adaptable to real-life workflows. Its integrated development suite, QubeQode, is a visual IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that allows users to launch smart contract-based apps without needing a single line of complex code. Small businesses can leverage drag-and-drop components to build secure platforms for things like user logins, token management, and data storage—all without hiring an engineering team. Meanwhile, fintech startups can streamline product deployment by utilizing pre-built code snippets and logic templates that shorten delivery cycles by weeks. With its native form-based configuration, users define smart contract behavior in a simplified UI instead of manual coding, which means legal tech firms, supply chain managers, and even game developers can integrate blockchain logic into their stack, on their terms. This is where Qubetics stands apart from the saturated chain space. Unlike most Layer 1s that expect developers to adopt steep learning curves, Qubetics builds on the idea that accessibility equals adoption. Even large-scale institutions can utilize QubeQode’s interface to scale applications across multiple blockchains via its Web3 aggregator function—enabling seamless interaction across fragmented networks. These capabilities align perfectly with the current demand for blockchain utility and low-friction onboarding, solidifying Qubetics’ position as the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 for those eyeing utility-backed performance rather than marketing buzz. Why Qubetics Presale Structure Makes It the Best Crypto Presale to Buy for 2025 Currently in its 33rd stage, the Qubetics presale is creating buzz for all the right reasons. The token price is set at $0.2302, with over $16.8 million already raised and more than 511 million $TICS tokens sold. The project has also drawn the attention of over 26,000 early adopters, each aligning with a presale model that offers price predictability and growth incentives. The structure is disciplined—every stage lasts seven days and ends at 12 AM every Sunday, followed by a mandatory 10% price increase. This system eliminates guesswork and provides a defined timeline for community members to participate confidently in this crypto presale. For instance, a $2,000 allocation at the current $TICS rate yields 8,684 tokens. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, that investment would grow to $8,684—a return of 334.33%. Should the token touch $5, the ROI would jump to 2,071.63%, equivalent to $43,420. Higher projections reveal even more potential: $6 gives a 2,505.96% ROI, while $10 and $15 generate massive returns of 4,243.26% and 6,414.90%, respectively. With the Qubetics mainnet launching in Q2 2025, these projections are drawing serious attention from community members looking to diversify their portfolios through a structured crypto presale. This explains why many are now calling it not just a strong contender—but the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 . Aptos Sees Spike in Real-World Use Case Development The Aptos network is witnessing a sharp uptick in real-world application development, reflecting the blockchain’s shift beyond speculative use cases. As of May 9, the Aptos token ($APT) jumped 4.7% to $8.92, accompanied by an 18% increase in 24-hour trading volume, now totaling $142 million. This uptick signals a strong shift in developer confidence, especially as more applications integrate into business infrastructures. Aptos’ move toward non-financial utility is driving this surge in activity, which may create a compounding effect as demand for its native token increases. These real-world integrations are not just cosmetic—developers are actively launching viable tools on the Aptos blockchain, pushing the narrative that it’s more than just a next-gen platform. The current momentum is reshaping how Aptos is being positioned in the market. As more tangible use cases go live and network activity climbs, Aptos is solidifying itself as a major Layer 1 option worth tracking during this upward phase in crypto. Stellar Struggles with Resistance Despite Strong Technicals Stellar (XLM) has entered a technically promising zone, posting a 5% price surge within 24 hours. This growth was coupled with a strong uptick in indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which shot up from 31.47 to 62.21 in just two days. Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) moved into positive territory, reflecting growing buyer interest. These signs point toward bullish pressure building up within the network. Despite the technical indicators flashing green, Stellar continues to battle significant resistance near the $0.30 mark, a level it hasn’t crossed since early March. While this cap remains a hurdle, the recent metrics suggest Stellar is poised for another push—especially if broader market conditions continue to favor upward price movement. The coin is now on the radar of many analysts who see the current setup as a possible launchpad, provided it can sustain its current bullish posture. Bitcoin’s $100K Comeback Brings Spotlight to Functional Chains The crypto market is being reshaped by Bitcoin’s powerful return to the $100,000 level. This milestone isn’t just a technical breakout—it’s reshaping perception and causing major capital flows into fundamentally strong projects. Aptos, with its increase in real-world app development, and Stellar, with improving technical setups, are showing signs of responding positively to this climate. The broader macro environment, fueled by U.S.-China trade progress and institutional inflows, is renewing attention on which projects offer practical, stable, and scalable value. This environment plays especially well for Qubetics, which offers a structured presale model that removes volatility and adds strategic clarity. With each price increase set in advance and weekly transitions that push prices higher, the Qubetics presale offers a rare kind of predictability in crypto. As the market grows warmer, projects offering both innovation and structure are expected to outperform—and that’s where Qubetics may gain further traction. Ready for 2025: Which Blockchain Will Outperform? Qubetics, Aptos, and Stellar are each bringing distinct value propositions to the crypto space. Qubetics is taking a practical-first approach to adoption with its no-code IDE and structured presale model, positioning itself as the best crypto presale to buy for 2025. Aptos is demonstrating network maturity through the growth of real-world development initiatives. Stellar, meanwhile, is aligning technically for a breakout, even if resistance still lingers. Together, they represent the kinds of assets gaining relevance as this new bullish wave builds. Those looking to take advantage of this shifting momentum have the chance to participate in a structured crypto presale while the value entry is still accessible. Qubetics’ tokenomics, presale incentives, and long-term roadmap align with market expectations for utility-driven performance. That’s why many have made the call to join this best crypto presale while the upside is still fully in play. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the current stage of the Qubetics presale? Qubetics is in its 33rd stage with $TICS tokens priced at $0.2302. How much can a $2,000 investment return from Qubetics? If $TICS hits $1 post-launch, the ROI would be over 334%, translating to $8,684. Why is Qubetics considered the best crypto presale to buy for 2025? It combines real-world blockchain utility with structured price growth and clear entry points.

In addition to Bitcoin, BlackRock also bought $17.6 million worth of Ethereum. Fidelity also increased its Bitcoin holdings with purchases totaling $125.3 million over recent days. These acquisitions occurred as Bitcoin's price consolidated near $95,000 before breaking above the $100,000 mark, highlighting renewed confidence from major asset managers in the cryptocurrency market.

The company released this information on Thursday in a filing , confirming that it found a “material weakness” in how it handles financial reports. The issue increases the risk that serious mistakes in the company’s numbers might go unnoticed. The company said it failed to set up proper systems to track and report its financial activity. The team also doesn’t have enough qualified staff with real experience in SEC reporting, which the company admitted openly. It said there’s a clear risk of errors that wouldn’t be found on time. The internal review was part of a check on the firm’s reporting process for the first quarter of the year. Trump Media loses $31.7 million, hires new staff to fix issue The company reported a net loss of $31.7 million for the quarter ending March 31. Despite that, it said it closed the quarter with $759 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. The company’s statement said the weak financial controls were mostly caused by missing accounting policies and a lack of staff with the right skills. In the company’s own words: “TMTG’s management determined that the material weakness primarily related to its failure to design and maintain formal accounting policies, processes, and controls to analyze, account for, and properly disclose income recordation as well as a need for additional accounting personnel who have the requisite experience in SEC reporting regulation.” Trump Media claimed it’s already started fixing the problem by bringing in new accountants who understand how to handle reporting rules. It didn’t say how many people were hired or how long the fixes might take. But the company said this was part of a larger effort to fix the internal systems that broke down. Trump Media pushes expansion, signs crypto partnerships During the same quarter, Trump Media said it rolled out a new fintech brand called Truth.Fi and signed a partnership with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to work on new exchange-traded funds and related products. These developments came while the company was still dealing with weak financial controls. The firm said its current cash pile and low spending give it enough room to expand, keep building its platforms, and go after new acquisitions. It also claimed this setup would let it invest in areas like crypto and retail investment tools without running into cash problems. In a letter to shareholders, CEO Devin Nunes said the company is still “hunting for top-quality assets.” Devin said the goal is for Trump Media to become a much larger firm that owns and operates many types of products and services, not just its Truth Social app. In April, the company said it signed a binding agreement to roll out a full set of retail investment products, including crypto. The move attracted pushback from ethics watchdogs, who questioned how the company would manage conflicts of interest between its media platform and its financial ambitions. Despite all this, Trump Media’s stock barely moved after the announcement. The company said its net sales went up a little—rising 6% to $8.2 million. But the $31.7 million in losses still overshadowed that. The company did not say when it expects to return to profit. Trump Media closed its filing by saying the $759 million in liquidity will help fund the company’s next phase, even as it scrambles to fix its accounting. The company made it clear that it still wants to grow—by pushing into crypto, expanding its media footprint, and going after more deals. But for now, its financial controls are still a work in progress.

In a post shared on X, the analyst argues that the true significance of the settlement is not the $50 million penalty imposed on Ripple but the SEC’s formal acknowledgement that it is seeking to reform its regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Quoting directly from the SEC’s official statement, the post draws attention to the Commission’s language that the resolution “rests on its judgment that such resolution will facilitate the Commission’s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry.” According to All Things XRP, this wording is not typical in SEC settlements and marks a meaningful departure from past enforcement narratives. CRUCIAL SEC DETAIL EVERYONE MISSED: The SEC-Ripple settlement isn't just about a $50M penalty — it's about REGULATORY TRANSFORMATION. The SEC explicitly states their decision ""rests on its judgment that such resolution will facilitate the Commission's ongoing efforts to… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 9, 2025 Language Marks Departure from Previous SEC Stance The commentator asserts that the SEC is not framing the settlement as a decisive legal victory. Instead, they interpret the Commission’s language as indicating that it recognizes flaws or limitations in its existing regulatory strategy. This is particularly notable given the SEC’s prior pattern of what industry participants have named “regulation by enforcement,” where legal actions are taken without providing formal rules or guidelines for the sector. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to the post, the emphasis should not be on the monetary penalty paid by Ripple, but rather on what the SEC’s language implies about future oversight. The tweet states that the regulatory body is “signalling a regulatory reset,” adding that this could pave the way for more defined rules, collaborative engagement with crypto firms, and potentially a departure from the combative posture that has been viewed by many as stifling innovation. XRP Positioned Amid Regulatory Evolution All Things XRP also connects these developments to the outlook for XRP itself. The post suggests that this shift in regulatory tone could lead to the clarity that XRP holders and institutional market participants anticipate. The idea is that a more transparent and predictable regulatory environment could encourage broader adoption and usage of digital assets for cross-border transactions, including XRP. The emphasis on regulatory transformation rather than punitive enforcement is interpreted as a potentially advantageous development for digital assets that have long faced uncertainty in the U.S. market. The commentator identifies this moment as a possible turning point for the industry and XRP’s future role. Settlement May Mark Beginning of Structural Change The commentator concludes by asserting that the $50 million financial penalty is ultimately secondary to what they interpret as the SEC’s acknowledgment of the need for institutional change. The post ends with a forward-looking question about how this regulatory reform will shape the future of the crypto sector and whether XRP is now positioned to benefit from a clearer and more supportive framework in the United States.

Meanwhile, well-known crypto analyst Timothy Peterson has an exciting analysis suggesting that Bitcoin will hit a New all-time high soon, citing historical bullish trends. Let’s find out when BTC will hit new ATH & how much it will pump? History Hints: A Breakout Is Near According to Timothy Peterson, this isn’t the first time Bitcoin has been in this position. Since 2015, Bitcoin has found itself in this exact position nearly 300 times. And here’s the exciting part, in 98% of those cases, the price went on to set a brand-new all-time high within the next 50 days . That kind of consistency is hard to ignore. Historically, when this has happened, Bitcoin has recorded some serious gains. The median return was around 17%, while the average gain was a whopping 43%. Even after COVID, during a calmer market phase, the average gain still holds up at a respectable 8%. Bitcoin To Hit $115K to $125K If this trend repeats, Bitcoin could be headed toward a price range of $115,000 to $125,000 over the next two months. That would be a massive step forward from current levels and would make headlines around the world. Peterson’s bitcoin price prediction also aligns with what giant bank Standard Chartered said recently. The bank still believes Bitcoin will hit a new all-time high in Q2, adding that the $120,000 target is looking more realistic than ever. Key Factor Supporting This Bullish Prediction Bitcoin’s recent surge is driven by several powerful factors, fueling its bullish momentum. First, Bitcoin ETF’s consistent inflow has spiked over the past two weeks, pushing the price from $82,000 to $104,000. Additionally, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) continues to build its Bitcoin holdings, now valued at over $57.4 billion . Big players like Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, the Swiss National Bank, and Norway’s Norges Pension Fund are also adding to the momentum, increasing bitcoin’s legitimacy among traditional investors. On top of that, U.S. states like Arizona, Texas, and Oregon are making laws to include Bitcoin in reserves, showing growing support. All of this is pushing Bitcoin’s price higher.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-10 06:47:09

The fund has now extended its inflow streak to 19 consecutive days — its longest run of inflows so far this year. IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin ( BTC ) market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1 . Bitcoin ETFs ticking along as Bitcoin price spikes Over the past trading week alone, IBIT posted $1.03 billion in inflows, according to Farside data. Prior to the current 19-day streak, IBIT’s longest inflow streak in 2025 was a nine-day stretch surrounding US President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, spanning from Jan. 15 to Jan. 28. Approximately $41.13 billion has flown into the spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January 2024. Source: Farside IBIT’s longest inflow streak since the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024 lasted 104 days, stretching from the launch date through April 23, 2024.

Analyst Says Bitcoin Rally Mirrors June 2020 Setup,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bull-market-reignited-analyst-says-bitcoin-rally-mirrors-june-2020-setup/,"Bitcoin’s recent surge has kept its price firmly above the $100,000 price level, reflecting ongoing investor confidence. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $103,527, posting a 4.3% gain in the past 24 hours and climbing 33% over the last month. While still approximately 5% below its all-time high recorded in January, the market has displayed consistent upward momentum, with technical and on-chain signals indicating continued accumulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver’s Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows On-Chain Metrics Reflect Growing Confidence This latest rally comes amid broader economic uncertainty and renewed geopolitical activity. According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, current market patterns mirror a period last seen almost 5 years ago, marked by high volatility and conflicting economic narratives. While central banks such as the Federal Reserve have maintained a cautious stance, investor sentiment appears to be shifting toward risk-on, as headlines around trade agreements and fiscal maneuvering spark a surge in buying interest. Darkfost points to the Bitcoin Growth Rate indicator, which has returned to bullish territory alongside BTC reclaiming the $100,000 level. The analyst notes that current market dynamics resemble the June 2020 cycle, particularly in how external political developments influence asset flows. For example, recent trade talks initiated by the Trump administration and aggressive posturing on global policy are fueling rapid investor reactions across equities and crypto alike. This sentiment-driven environment, according to Darkfost, makes it challenging to rely solely on traditional metrics for forecasting price trends. Complicating the picture is the impact of news-driven narratives. Darkfost wrote: This can notably be explained by all the headline-driven effects, like the one we saw today (“You should buy stocks now”), but also by the fact that Trump is starting to pursue trade deals with various countries, such as the agreements made today with the U.K. These signals may be pushing investors into crypto assets as part of broader diversification strategies. Despite the Federal Reserve’s warning for continued caution, the market seems to be faced with a fear of missing out, creating further upside volatility. Bitcoin Whales Continue to Accumulate as Retail Lags In a related analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst caueconomy revealed that large-scale Bitcoin holders have remained active throughout the recent price recovery. Over the last month, wallets classified as “whales” have added roughly 41,300 BTC to their balances. This steady accumulation, especially from institutional investors and corporations, indicates that strategic positioning continues regardless of mixed macroeconomic signals. According to caueconomy, this accumulation is not being driven by retail speculation but by institutional entities using corporate resources such as retained earnings and debt issuance. This form of capital inflow, often described as “passive” accumulation, can generate sustained demand pressure independent of market cycles. As a result, Bitcoin’s recent gains may be supported by a structurally different class of buyers than in previous bull markets.

The price is stuck within a range, which hints towards the beginning of yet another accumulation phase. However, the question remains whether this phase will ease off soon or prevail for a long time, and if it eases, will the price trigger a breakout or face a rejection? The Bitcoin price is consolidating above $100K, which is flashing a major bullish signal with the expectation of reaching new highs. The token usually consolidates before undergoing a massive bullish action, and hence, the next upswing is expected to mark new highs. Meanwhile, the technicals have reached the levels from which the correction phase began in the previous cycles. Therefore, the BTC price is also feared to face a similar consequence if it bears strike down the levels below the threshold. The BTC price is an inch close to reaching the final threshold before testing the ATH. However, a close look at the technicals suggests a correction phase could soon begin. The weekly RSI has reached the overbought levels for the first time since the November breakout. The levels dropped further and remained stuck within a descending trend to mark the bottoms. This does not mean that the price will face an instant pullback, as it held within the bullish range from December 2024 to February 2025 while the RSI maintained a descending trend. Therefore, a new ATH for the Bitcoin price is imminent, but it may not be higher than $112,000 to $115,000. On the other hand, the OBV is yet again displaying a bearish divergence after hitting the resistance. As it has failed to surpass during the previous couple of events, a bearish validation could hinder the progress of the rally. Therefore, if the OBV strikes above the levels, the BTC price could gain strength; else a horizontal consolidation may prevail for long.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-10 07:01:12

The digital asset, currently trading around $103,800, spiked after Trump’s Truth Social post suggested that a blanket 10% tariff on all imports could be lifted. This news sparked optimism among investors, pushing the Dow up 500 points and lifting the S&P 500 by 1.47%.

U.S. States Embrace Bitcoin Reserves Beyond trade news, Bitcoin’s surge is also being fueled by state-level crypto legislation. On May 8, the Missouri legislature passed Bill 594, eliminating all capital gains taxes on BTC. This follows similar moves by other states, allowing them to establish strategic BTC reserves—an important step toward broader digital asset adoption. Additionally, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) confirmed on May 7 that banks under its jurisdiction can now trade crypto on behalf of clients. This move allows banks to offer custodial services and outsource crypto trading, further integrating BTC into the traditional financial system. Institutional Support Drives Long-Term Demand The institutional landscape for BTC is also evolving rapidly. Inflows to spot BTC ETFs have surged, reflecting growing interest from large-scale investors. Major corporations are increasing their BTC holdings, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. In late March, the FDIC issued guidance allowing banks to hold crypto assets and offer a range of related services to their customers, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as a mainstream financial asset. Bitcoin Eyes $105,300 as Bulls Hold $102,500 Support Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading around $103,375, having broken above the key 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $100,756, signaling strong bullish momentum. The next immediate resistance is the 2.272 Fibonacci level at $103,743, followed by the critical 2.618 extension at $105,325. These levels represent potential upside targets if the bullish momentum continues. However, the current rally has pushed the MACD into overbought territory, suggesting the risk of a short-term pullback. If prices retreat, the immediate support lies at the 2.0 Fibonacci level at $102,501, which aligns closely with the recent breakout zone. A break below this level could expose Bitcoin to a deeper correction, with the next support around $99,824. Trade Setup: Buy Above: $102,500 Take Profit: $105,300 Stop Loss: $100,750 Strategy: Consider buying above $102,500, targeting the 2.618 extension at $105,300, while setting a tight stop below $100,750 to manage downside risk. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.47M as Flexible 78% Staking Yield Draws Investors BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to gain traction, crossing $5.47 million in funds raised as it nears its $6.14 million presale cap. Priced at $0.002495, the token has positioned itself as more than just a meme coin—offering real utility through flexible, high-yield staking. Utility-Driven Tokenomics Fuel Demand Unlike typical meme tokens, BTCBULL blends crypto culture appeal with tangible staking rewards.

In a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, Maryland-based Kelly Benefits says it has discovered a significant cybersecurity incident impacting 413,032 people. The company says an internal investigation revealed that an unknown entity gained unauthorized access to its database and stole sensitive customer information, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, tax ID numbers, medical and health insurance records and financial account datasets. “The investigation determined Kelly Benefits’ environment was subject to unauthorized access between December 12th, 2024 and December 17th, 2024 and certain files were copied and taken. Kelly Benefits then began a time-intensive and detailed review of all files affected by this event to determine what information was present in the impacted files and to whom it related. Once this review was complete, Kelly Benefits reviewed its internal records to match the individual to the appropriate client or carrier. This analysis was completed on March 3rd, 2025.” Kelly Benefits offers a wide array of HR-related services, including benefits administration, payroll solutions, retirement planning, compliance support and consulting services. The firm says it issued letters of notice to affected individuals while offering a 12-month credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. For now, Kelly Benefits says it “has seen no evidence of misuse of any information related to this incident.” The firm says it has reported the data breach to federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies and will continue closely monitoring its security policies, procedures and tools.

According to its Q1 2025 earnings report , Coinbase saw its retail crypto trading volume fall 17% to $78 billion, as Bitcoin dropped 11% over the same period. Total revenue slipped 10% year-over-year to $2 billion, and net income plunged 94% to $66 million. Shares of Coinbase fell 6% following the results amid a broader downturn in tech stocks. XRP Delivers Standout Performance Despite the poor headline numbers, XRP delivered a standout performance. Coinbase earned more transaction revenue from XRP than from Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL), marking a notable shift in trading behavior. XRP accounted for 18% of the company’s consumer trading revenue—surpassing both ETH and SOL combined and trailing only Bitcoin in revenue contribution. Even more striking, Coinbase’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing showed a 458% year-over-year surge in the value of XRP held on the platform. This comes less than a year after the exchange resumed XRP trading following a court ruling in July 2023 that cleared Ripple of securities law violations for exchange-based sales. XRP also led all cryptocurrencies in deposit growth on Coinbase in the last year, signaling renewed retail interest. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain core holdings, with Bitcoin rising 35% in Q1 and Ethereum totaling $250 million in value, XRP’s momentum stands out as a potential catalyst for future growth. XRP trading volume on Coinbase last quarter was higher than pretty much every asset besides BTC and USDT Lesson in there pic.twitter.com/PU5mrWqcMq — Alana Levin (@AlanaDLevin) May 8, 2025 Still, Coinbase’s overall performance was hampered by nearly $600 million in unrealized losses on its crypto holdings. The company’s net income decline reflects broader market pressures, especially following U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff policies, which have contributed to global economic uncertainty. In a strategic move, Coinbase recently agreed to acquire crypto options exchange Deribit for $2.9 billion, signaling a push into derivatives to diversify revenue streams and stabilize earnings in volatile markets. Coinbase’s Q1 performance parallels rival Robinhood’s , which also reported a decline in crypto trading volume, from $71 billion at the end of 2024 to $46 billion last quarter. XRP Attempts Recovery After Sharp Pullback, But Bullish Momentum Faces Resistance XRP is currently trading at $2.36 following a recent bounce, but technical indicators show mixed signals across timeframes. On the 1-minute chart, the RSI has climbed above 63, suggesting short-term bullish momentum. However, price action remains close to the upper Bollinger Band, often a signal for short-term exhaustion. Meanwhile, the MACD is just beginning a modest bullish crossover, indicating that upward momentum is building, albeit cautiously. On the 30-minute timeframe, XRP appears to be stabilizing after a strong rally earlier this week. The RSI is neutral around 52, signaling a potential consolidation phase rather than a strong directional move. The Bollinger Bands are slightly widening, indicating rising volatility, while the price remains above the midline. However, MACD momentum is flattening, hinting that buyers may need more volume to push higher. Overall, XRP’s price recovery shows signs of strength, but momentum remains fragile. If bulls can hold above the $2.35 support level and push through $2.38 resistance, further upside could materialize. Otherwise, failure to sustain buying pressure may lead to another retest of the lower Bollinger Band near $2.33.

Several lesser-known altcoins are on the verge of making significant moves. Enthusiasts are eager to discover which digital currencies will lead the charge in this rapidly growing phase. As the momentum builds, coins like LUNC, XLM, SEI, PI, and HYPE emerge as promising contenders. Amidst these options, Codename:Pepe crypto offers a fresh, humorous approach to maximize gains using genuine AI capabilities. This unique project aims to stand out in the meme coin sector, challenging the norms and enticing investors with potential returns. Codename:Pepe Unleashes True Intelligence for Maximum Profits The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is actually doing something useful: helping you make money in the chaotic meme coin jungle. Codename:Pepe is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: The True Identity of Codename:Pepe Keep this under wraps: Codename:Pepe is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Codename:Pepe Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Codename:Pepe is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Codename:Pepe Mission Explained Codename:Pepe plans to use the power of artificial intelligence to hunt down the juiciest meme coins, predict market trends, and deliver exclusive AI-powered trading signals before the FOMO kicks in. Beyond smart analysis, this genius agent will also trade for you with its fully automated AI-trader, turning those signals into sweet gains. Every great agent needs an elite organization backing them. That’s where $AGNT comes in. Holding $AGNT unlocks membership in a top-secret DAO, where operatives (investors) gain access to classified strategies, insider analytics, and the ability to vote on high-stakes missions. Holding $AGNT will unlock: Membership in a top-secret DAO Access to classified strategies Insider analytics Ability to vote on high-stakes missions Profits from the mutual DAO fund will be allocated to those who stake their $AGNT, ensuring the spoils of the trade go to the most loyal agents. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Codename:Pepe isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount Luna Classic (LUNC): The Comeback Story in Crypto Payments Luna Classic, known as LUNC, has caught the eye of many in the crypto world. Part of the Terra ecosystem, it uses stablecoins linked to traditional currencies. This means it combines the steadiness of regular money with the speed and openness of blockchain technology. Starting in 2018, Terra launched its main network in 2019. It offered stablecoins tied to currencies like the U.S. dollar and South Korean won. In 2022, a major event led to the birth of Luna Classic. The original Terra chain was renamed, and LUNC began its new journey. LUNC aims to provide quick and affordable payments worldwide. By using stablecoins, it seeks to keep prices steady. This makes it useful for everyday transactions, without the wild swings often seen in other cryptocurrencies. Between 2022 and 2025, LUNC faced ups and downs. After some challenges in 2022, it showed strength and recovered over time. Its focus on stability attracted users who wanted reliable performance. This helped it grow in popularity. In the current market, LUNC stands out. It blends traditional currency features with modern technology. This gives it potential in the global payments space. As the crypto landscape evolves, LUNC offers something unique for those looking for consistency and innovation. Stellar Lumens: Bridging the World with Fast, Affordable Global Payments Stellar Lumens (XLM) is a blockchain-based global payment network designed to make international currency transfers quick, secure, and inexpensive. Unlike traditional money transfer methods, which can be slow and costly, Stellar offers a seamless way to move money across borders. Acting as a bridge between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial systems, Stellar connects banks, payment services, and people. It uses blockchain technology to facilitate faster and more efficient transactions, enabling low-cost, cross-border payments that are accessible to everyone. Historically, XLM reached its all-time high of $0.9381 on January 4, 2018. As of 2025, its price remains below this peak, but many believe it has the potential to surpass previous highs. Positive social media sentiment and growing investor interest could drive demand and prices upward. Stellar’s focus on speed and affordability makes it appealing to both financial institutions and individual users. Partnerships with major organizations enhance its adoption. As more entities embrace Stellar for efficient transactions, the demand for XLM could increase significantly. Analysts predict that by 2030, Stellar could reach prices as high as $2.30, indicating strong long-term growth potential. While competition from other cryptocurrencies exists, Stellar’s unique positioning and strategic focus may help it overcome challenges and set new price records in the future. SEI’s Speedy Ascent: Charting Its Journey and Future Price Prospects Launched in August 2023, SEI burst onto the crypto scene with a mission to revolutionize digital asset exchanges. By November, it announced integration with Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), emphasizing its commitment to speed and low transaction costs. SEI’s focus on delivering the fastest blockchain technology quickly garnered attention in the crypto community. SEI reached an all-time high in March 2024, reflecting strong market enthusiasm. However, despite the broader market thriving, the coin entered a downtrend. Not even its V2 upgrade in May 2024 could reverse this trajectory, leaving investors curious about its future prospects. Price predictions made on January 23, 2025, suggest a promising recovery for SEI. Analysts forecast an average price of $0.75 in 2025, with potential to reach up to $1. By 2026, the average price could rise to $1.10, and by 2030, significant adoption and innovations might drive it to an average of $2.50, with possibilities of hitting $4 in a fully bullish market. According to its whitepaper, SEI aims to simplify trading by offering a general-purpose, open-source Layer 1 blockchain specialized for digital asset exchange. Boasting transaction speeds as low as 250 milliseconds, SEI utilizes a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism to ensure fast and efficient operations, positioning itself as the fastest blockchain in the industry. Considering SEI’s technological advancements and the optimistic price forecasts, the coin appears to hold potential in the current market cycle. Its focus on speed and efficiency addresses key needs in the crypto trading space. While past performance has seen fluctuations, the projected growth suggests that SEI could be an attractive option for investors looking toward 2030. Pi Network: The Mobile Cryptocurrency Mining Revolution Pi Network is changing the way people think about cryptocurrency. Launched in 2019 by Stanford graduates, it allows anyone with a smartphone to mine Pi coins without expensive hardware. Unlike Bitcoin, which requires powerful computers, Pi mining is as simple as tapping a button daily on an app. The secret lies in Pi’s innovative technology. It uses an energy-efficient system called the Stellar Consensus Protocol. Users build trust circles by nominating a few reliable contacts. These connections form a global web that secures the network without draining your phone’s battery. This approach makes cryptocurrency accessible to everyone. By engaging with the app and expanding their trusted network, users earn rewards. Those who run full nodes on their computers can contribute more and gain additional benefits. The network also encourages app usage and supports ecosystem growth through Pi lockups. Since December 2021, Pi has been operating on its own blockchain during an “enclosed” phase. Users verify their identities to transfer mined Pi onto the blockchain. The project plans to enter an “open network” phase, lifting restrictions and allowing full connectivity with other systems. Pi Network’s potential lies in its community-driven model and ease of use. As the digital currency landscape evolves, Pi offers a fair and decentralized option that anyone can participate in. Its growth and adoption could make it an attractive choice in the current market cycle, positioning it as a key player in the future of cryptocurrency. HYPE Coin Set to Soar: Exploring Hyperliquid’s Promising Future Launched in late 2024, Hyperliquid’s HYPE coin quickly surged into the crypto spotlight. Offering perpetual futures trading without transaction fees, it entered the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Stabilizing around $25, HYPE set a strong foundation for future growth. Hyperliquid provides a fully on-chain open financial system. According to its whitepaper, it allows user-built applications with efficient native components, all while ensuring a smooth user experience. HYPE uses a proof-of-stake system, letting holders secure the network and earn rewards. In 2025, HYPE seems set for significant growth. Building on bullish momentum, it could boost confidence in its fundamentals. Predictions suggest an average price of $45, with potential highs at $70. Market corrections might see it bottom out at $30, but overall growth appears steady. Looking ahead, broader adoption could drive HYPE even higher. In 2026, it might average $75, reaching up to $120 under favorable conditions. By 2030, integration into new industries could elevate HYPE to an average of $150, with peaks potentially hitting $250. With its innovative technology and promising projections, HYPE offers an intriguing prospect. Its past performance and future outlook suggest strong potential in the blockchain space. Investors might find HYPE worth considering in today’s market. Conclusion As the crypto market surges forward in this bullish phase, altcoins such as LUNC, XLM, SEI, and PI present intriguing possibilities but may show less immediate potential.

That rally comes on the heels of a decisive improvement in broader macro risk sentiment and positive technical developments. However, in the background, new narratives are gaining strength that could propel the Solana 10x higher from current levels this bull run – institutional adoption, and “real world asset” (RWA) leadership. On Thursday this week, Superstate, a fintech firm bridging traditional and crypto finance, launched Opening Bell. This new platform enables SEC-registered public equities to be tokenized and traded on the Solana blockchain in a compliant manner. DeFi Pioneer’s Superstate To Bring Public Equities To Solana https://t.co/7IgiCwbMrZ pic.twitter.com/BgLF0TN93o — Forbes (@Forbes) May 8, 2025 SOL Strategies, a Canadian Solana-focused firm, will be the first to list its shares, leveraging Solana’s high-speed infrastructure for real-time settlement and DeFi integration. This development positions Solana as a market leader in the fast growing RWA space and is likely to substantially bolster institutional adoption, driving significant interest and investment into its ecosystem. Solana Price Prediction – 10x Gains Possible? Things were already looking good for the Solana price this week even before Superstate’s announcement on Thursday. Firstly, the leading altcoin has been riding the wave of risk on sentiment that has seen Bitcoin smash back through $100,000. Bitcoin $100,000 … you know what's next pic.twitter.com/HiivrkUE81 — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) May 8, 2025 This rise in risk appetite has been driven by positive “trade war” developments, such as the recently announced US/UK trade deal , and hopes that more positive trade news is coming soon (like a de-escalation in US/China trade tensions ). That is all seen as reducing downside risks to the US and global economy, hence the rally in risk assets like crypto. Secondly, the Solana price found strong support at its 21DMA earlier this week, a sign that the bulls remain in control of the market. That strong rebound from the 21DMA comes following a decisive breakout above a medium-term downtrend back in April. Technical analysis thus suggests an increasingly likelihood that Solana’s next stop will be a retest of its record highs near $300. That said, it will first need to break above support-turned-resistance in the $180 area. A retest of record highs would mark nearly 2x gains from current levels. But can the Solana price 10x? Well, Solana put itself on the map as a leading blockchain in 2024 as it dominated the meme coin trading frenzy. While the meme coin hype has cooled off since then, Solana is demonstrating that its high performance blockchain can lead in even more important crypto use-cases sectors. Superstate’s decision to launch Opening Bell on the Solana blockchain highlights that it is likely to be a RWA market leader, as well as a leader in many other budding areas of crypto, like DeFi, GameFi and more. With spot Solana ETFs likely to launch in the USA within a few months, many institutional investors will likely be keen to get exposure to one of crypto’s most exciting blockchains. The Trump administration appears hell bent on powering crypto industry growth (and market upside) over the next four years. Solana is well positioned to see its ecosystem swell and institutional adoption surge in the years ahead, suggesting 10x gains before the end of President Trump’s term to a price in the $1,700 area is very feasible. High Beta Alternative That Could Deliver Even Bigger Gains – Solaxy (SOLX) Solaxy (SOLX) , Solana’s first Layer-2 blockchain, aims to address network congestion and enhance scalability, positioning itself as a high-beta play within the Solana ecosystem. By processing transactions off-chain using rollup technology, Solaxy boosts transaction speeds and reliability, targeting DeFi and GameFi applications. Its presale, raising over $34 million by May 2025, reflects strong investor interest, with SOLX priced at $0.001716.

Set for a mid-2025 launch, Solaxy’s success hinges on adoption and exchange listings. As Solana thrives, leading projects within its ecosystem are likely to see even bigger gains. As Solana rallies back to record highs, it wouldn’t be out of the question to see SOLX rally 10x or more this year.

But one DeFi project is quietly building momentum while still flying under the radar — and that project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently priced at just $0.025 during its fourth presale phase, it’s beginning to draw the attention of serious crypto investors looking for long-term upside. With over 65% of the current phase completed, investors are now moving quickly to secure positions. The next price increase to $0.03 is just around the corner, and with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, those entering now are effectively locking in early gains before exchange listings begin. But pricing alone isn’t what’s making MUTM stand out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t offering empty promises. It’s built around a straightforward goal: unlocking liquidity from crypto assets without forcing users to sell. Through the protocol, users can deposit major tokens like Ethereum or Bitcoin into smart contracts, and in return, they receive mtTokens — digital representations that not only mirror the original deposit but also earn yield over time. These mtTokens maintain a live value that adjusts as interest accumulates, giving users passive income just for participating. The protocol’s interest rates aren’t fixed — they shift with demand. When capital is being borrowed actively, APYs rise. For example, a user depositing $5,000 worth of ETH at an 11% APY could earn around $550 in a year — and this rate can move higher depending on pool usage. Borrowing Without Liquidation The borrowing side of Mutuum is equally appealing. Users can unlock liquidity without having to part with their existing assets. Instead, they can lock them as collateral and borrow stablecoins directly. This means someone holding $10,000 in ETH, MATIC, or ADA can borrow funds while still benefiting from any future price appreciation. It’s a model that works for both short-term needs and long-term strategies — especially in a market where flexibility is crucial. MUTM isn’t just a concept on paper. The developers have scheduled a beta release of the platform to coincide with the token’s official launch, ensuring users can start exploring its core features right from day one. That means real functionality from day one — something that very few presale tokens can offer. The momentum is also measurable. With more than $7.7 million already raised and thousands of holders on board, the community is growing, and early supporters are positioning themselves before the broader market wakes up. What’s more, the protocol is undergoing a full audit by CertiK, ensuring that the smart contracts are secure and ready to handle real transactions. This step reinforces trust and helps draw in more cautious, long-term-minded participants. While the 140% gain between $0.025 and the $0.06 launch price is already impressive, analysts believe that’s just the beginning. When MUTM reaches even $0.30 in the first few months post-launch — a price target that many believe is well within reach — that would represent a 1,200% increase from current levels. The upside is even more dramatic in the long term. With the protocol’s real use case, smart yield generation, and growing community, it’s not unrealistic to project the token surpassing the $1 mark. At that level, someone who invests $5,000 today would be sitting on a portfolio worth $200,000 — a 40x return based on timing and fundamentals. Mutuum Finance is starting to check the right boxes for those who are looking beyond the usual top 10 cryptocurrencies. It offers a combination of active use, passive income, smart tokenomics, and transparency — all at a price point that still looks early. With the next presale phase just ahead, the opportunity to get in before broader exposure increases is limited. For investors asking what crypto to buy now with a long-term view in mind, MUTM is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about low-cap options in serious portfolios.

According to the announcement made by the developers, a new era for the token will begin on May 22, at a dinner attended by TRUMP's largest owners and Donald Trump. The details of the new term, stated in the statement, “TRUMP’s new term will be announced in Washington DC on May 22, which is Dinner Day,” are not yet known. While Trump attracted attention with this cryptocurrency, which he started promoting just a few days before his inauguration, it came to the agenda again with an announcement made in the past weeks. Accordingly, the top 200 holders of the TRUMP token will be invited to a special dinner to be held at his golf club in Virginia on May 22. In addition, the top 25 investors will also receive an invitation to a special reception and “VIP” tour to be held before this event. Related News: This Altcoin Founder Reacts to Ethereum's Growing Popularity: “Our Update Was Five Times Bigger Than Pectra's” But a new analysis by Bloomberg News has raised some ethical and legal questions about these invitees. According to the analysis, only six of the top 25 investors registered on the website’s leaderboard traded outside of exchanges that do not accept users outside the US. The remaining 19 investors appear to have used foreign crypto exchanges that have stated that they do not provide services to US citizens. More broadly, at least 56% of the top 220 investors have similarly traded on foreign exchanges. This suggests that a significant portion of investors may be outside the U.S. While some Democratic members of Congress have questioned the ethics of providing physical access to the President through a memecoin, how participants will be monitored and their identities verified has also become a separate topic of discussion along with this analysis. Those who are eligible to participate in the event are identified only by their 3-4 letter usernames, creating a lack of transparency in terms of identification. *This is not investment advice.

After breaking from a multi-week consolidation range, Bitcoin price spikes pushed it well above the $100,000 psychological mark, gaining bullish traction after breaking out from a descending triangle near the $96,000 zone on May 7. The rapid advance has now placed BTC within striking distance of upper resistance, and traders are closely watching Bitcoin price action for clues on whether this move can sustain.

The filing asks Judge Torres to make two determinations: first, to dissolve the injunction previously included in the Final Judgment entered against Ripple; and second, to approve the distribution of the $125,035,150 civil penalty, with $50 million paid to the SEC and the remainder returned to Ripple. According to the letter, if the Court grants this indicative ruling, the parties will move the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to remand the case to the district court to grant the relief. Fred Rispoli’s Notable Observation Legal analyst and defense attorney James K. Filan alerted the public to the development through a tweet, stating : “BREAKING: The @SECGov has filed the Settlement Agreement Letter.” In response, crypto lawyer Fred Rispoli pointedly noted the absence of Jorge G. Tenreiro, Chief Litigation Counsel at the SEC, from the settlement agreement. Rispoli tweeted: “You know what’s so great about this? On the Settlement Agreement attached (Ex. A), ZERO APPEARANCE by a certain Mr. Tenreiro. In all fairness to him, though, he has been dealing with a massive temperature regulation problem in the IT room. You can’t just walk away from that.” You know what's so great about this? On the Settlement Agreement attached (Ex. A), ZERO APPEARANCE by a certain Mr. Tenreiro. In all fairness to him though, he has been dealing with a massive temperature regulation problem in the IT room. You can't just walk away from that. — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) May 8, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Rispoli’s comment, which includes a sarcastic reference to an IT-related distraction, highlights Tenreiro’s absence from the SEC’s latest filing. Tenreiro played a central role throughout much of the SEC’s litigation against Ripple and its executives, particularly in earlier phases of the case concerning XRP’s legal classification and related enforcement actions. His name not appearing on the settlement documents suggests a reduced role in the final negotiations or a broader shift in the SEC’s internal handling of crypto asset litigation. Case History and Appeal Timeline The joint letter also recounts the procedural background leading up to this request. After the August 2024 Final Judgment imposed a $125 million penalty on Ripple and included an injunction related to violations of the Securities Act of 1933, the Court later stayed enforcement of the monetary penalty in September 2024. Ripple was ordered to deposit the penalty into an interest-bearing account pending appeal. The appeals remain active in the Second Circuit under cases Nos. 24-2648 and 24-2705(XAP), with the SEC and Ripple having filed respective notices of appeal and cross-appeal in October 2024. Proposed Resolution and Next Steps According to the settlement terms described in the May 8 filing, $50 million would be paid to the SEC in satisfaction of the penalty, and the rest returned to Ripple. This agreement effectively resolves the monetary penalty dispute contingent upon the Court’s approval. The final disposition of the matter now depends on whether Judge Torres will issue the indicative ruling the parties seek. The case has been closely monitored due to its implications for digital asset regulation and enforcement in the United States. Rispoli’s comment, while humorous, underscores attention on personnel developments at the SEC as the agency appears to move toward concluding one of the most significant enforcement actions in the crypto sector to date.

The broader crypto market responded in kind, with total market capitalisation rising over 8% to approximately $3.37 trillion by Friday. Sentiment indicators reflected the rally, as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index climbed from 67 to 73, reinforcing its position within the “greed” zone. Gains were stronger across the altcoin markets, with most of the top 99 closing the week in the green, and several notching double-digit gains. Why is Bitcoin going up? As of late Asian trading hours on Friday, Bitcoin was up over 6% on the week, with most major crypto assets also spiking. The late week surge followed reports of renewed US-China trade talks and rising geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan, two catalysts that injected fresh volatility into global risk markets. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed plans to meet with China’s Ministry of Commerce in Switzerland to discuss trade barriers. The announcement was met with a constructive response from Beijing, fuelling optimism across risk markets and helping lift sentiment in the crypto sector. Adding to the bullish backdrop, a new US-UK trade dea l announced on May 8 further lifted sentiment. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell warning that inflation risks remain elevated. However, the absence of unexpected tightening gave traders some reassurance, no rate cuts, but no unwelcome surprises either. That clarity, combined with a shift back toward risk appetite and fresh institutional inflows, helped propel Bitcoin higher. Institutional activity played a key role in sustaining the momentum. Data from Farside Investors shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded cumulative net inflows of $142.3 million on May 7 alone. Inflows remained strong on May 8, with Bitcoin ETFs attracting another $117 million, led by BlackRock’s IBIT at $69 million. Bitcoin price outlook With Bitcoin seemingly stablising over the $100k mark, analysts were seen setting ambitious targets for the benchmark cryptocurrency. When writing, Bitcoin was trading roughly 5% below its all-time high of around $109K hit in late January this year, though several analysts believed a fresh all-time high may be due. In the near term, traders like AlphaBTC are eyeing a move toward $106,000. He pointed to Bitcoin’s breakout from an ascending parallel channel, with Fibonacci retracement levels lining up neatly with support zones. “It makes me think BTC has another leg to 106K+ before it corrects,” he said, noting the strength of the current trend. Others, like market analyst Skew, believe the recent rally was driven more by headlines than fundamentals, particularly news about US-UK trade agreements and speculation involving President Trump’s tariff strategies. That, he says, makes it a “crucial trading day,” where volume and passive flows will determine whether Bitcoin can hold ground above six figures or fall back under pressure. For now, the technicals are still supportive. BTC/USD recently cleared a key Fibonacci level at 1.618 and is now trading near a major volume-area high (VAH), according to analyst Patric H. BTC/USD perpetual futures 1-day chart. Source: Patric H. A sustained push from here could remove the final resistance before new all-time highs. Backing that theory, Bitcoin liquidation data on CoinGlass shows sellers are starting to thin out above $103K, which could give Bitcoin the space it needs for a clean breakout. Zooming out, some analysts are already looking far beyond the $100K zone. Pseudonymous analyst Egrag Crypto has placed a long-term target around $170,000 if BTC can pull off a clean break and close above $109K. However, anything short of that, he warns, could be just another bull trap. Joining Egrag was Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who speculated a cycle top of a whopping between $500,000 and $1 million driven by institutional flows, government-level accumulation, and what he calls a “pro-crypto US administration.” Altcoin market recap The altcoin market rallied nearly 15% over the past week, climbing to $1.28 trillion by Friday. While renewed risk appetite played a big role, growing speculation around the start of altseason added fuel to the surge. Bitcoin dominance has been steadily rising, and some analysts are watching it closely for a potential shift. Historically, the 71% dominance level tends to mark the point where Bitcoin starts consolidating, giving altcoins room to run. Right now, BTC dominance sits around 64%, setting the stage for what could be a key retest, as noted by Rekt Capital. With altcoins making a strong comeback, the Altcoin Season Index jumped from 18 last week to 37, an early sign that risk appetite is returning to the market. The top performers were: Pepe Pepe (PEPE) jumped 41.3% over the past week and was trading at $0.00012 at the time of writing. This rally pushed its market cap up to $5.24 billion, its highest level since February. Source: CoinMarketCap Most of the gains came after Elon Musk shared a picture of Pepe the Frog and the Pepe memecoin mascot dressed in American-themed armor, sparking fresh excitement among investors. Musk has a history of moving markets with his tweets, especially with meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe. PEPE also got a boost after forming a “double-bottom” pattern on the charts, a bullish signal in technical analysis that could mean more gains ahead in the coming weeks. Pyth Network Over the past 7 days, Pyth Network (PYTH) shot up 33% to around $0.20 at the time of writing, pushing its market cap to over $730 million. Daily trading volume also surged, jumping nearly 600% as of May 9 to hover above $225 million. Source: CoinMarketCap Most of these gains came after Jupiter Exchange announced it had integrated Pyth’s Express Relay into Juno, its new liquidity system. This integration allows traders to get the best possible price by tapping into Pyth’s real-time data feeds. Further investor hype also seems to be driven by the possibility that Pyth will reward its community members who qualified for the April Kaito leaderboard, potentially through a PYTH token airdrop by the end of this week. Pudgy Penguins Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) jumped 21% over the past week, with its market cap climbing past $4.9 billion at the time of writing. Daily trading volume also got a boost, rising 36% as about $540 million worth of tokens changed hands between traders. Source: CoinMarketCap The main catalyst that fueled the majority of its gains was its listing on Upbit, a top crypto exchange in South Korea, which added PENGU to its spot trading platform. On top of that, Pudgy Penguins’ NFT sales have been soaring lately. Data from Crypto Slam shows sales spiked 140% in the past 24 hours, pulling in $680,000 and making Pudgy Penguins the 7th most popular NFT collection in the world.

Cosmos, Polkadot, and Chainlink are racing to connect blockchains… But XRP may have a secret weapon—and it's not what you think. Let’s unpack the truth. — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 10, 2025 XRP’s Strength in the Real World XRP isn’t just fast and cost-effective. It has already integrated into over 200 financial institutions through RippleNet, with transaction speeds of 3-5 seconds and costs of a fraction of a cent. Ripple’s established trust with major banks such as Santander, Bank of America, and American Express is a notable advantage. Beyond banking, XRP is expanding its use, with projects like Colle AI leveraging it for cross-blockchain NFT functionality. Moving from Finance to Interoperability XRP is stepping into the multichain realm, now integrated with Cosmos through IBC and developing an EVM-compatible sidechain. These strides position XRP to act as a bridge, interacting with DeFi ecosystems that were previously out of its reach. The future of XRP is not just about banking but expanding into a multichain environment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Rally Raises Questions About Market Integrity , XRP Faces Challenges Despite its solid infrastructure and regulatory progress, XRP faces key hurdles. Ripple Labs controls over 50% of XRP’s token supply, raising concerns of centralization. Its DeFi presence remains in its early stages, and compared to Polkadot or Cosmos, XRP’s smart contract functionality is still lacking. The Path to Victory XRP’s potential for dominance in interoperability doesn’t hinge on hype but infrastructure. While others build the technology for blockchain communication, XRP is already entrenched in real-world finance. By strengthening its payment rails and building interoperability on top of them, XRP has the chance to become the ultimate value bridge, connecting not just banks, but the entire crypto ecosystem. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The cryptocurrency has confirmed its breakdown from a bullish reversal pattern and eyes a surge toward new targets Related Reading: Ethereum Jumps To $2,000 Amid Market Surge – Analyst Says This Resistance Is Next Stellar Breakout Targets $0.39 Amid the market pump, Stellar has broken out of a key demand zone and retested the $0.30 mark for the first time since March. The cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend since its November 2024 breakout, when it reached a three-year high of $0.63. During this year’s retraces, XLM dropped 68% from the highs to a five-month low of $0.20. However, the late-April market recovery saw the cryptocurrency surge above the downtrend and attempt to confirm the breakout after recording a weekly close above the $0.28 mark. On Friday, Stellar has reclaimed the $0.29 resistance and retested the $0.30 mark for the first time in nearly two months. Following today’s performance, Ali Martinez pointed out that Stellar is breaking out of a two-month inverse head and Shoulder pattern. This pattern is a bullish reversal setup that suggests a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. Earlier this week, the analyst pointed out that the pattern’s right shoulder was forming and the neckline sat around the $0.29 mark. According to his post, a breakout from this formation potentially eyed a 30% rally toward the $0.39 resistance, lost during the February retraces. XLM To Repeat Historical Tendencies? Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the cryptocurrency confirmed the end of its multi-month downtrend and a breakout from its Downtrending Channel. Per the post, if XLM weekly closes above its key area, between $0.27-$0.29, any dips into this zone would figure as a successful reclaim of the area as support to support a move to higher regions. The analyst explained that reclaiming the $0.27-$0.29 area is crucial because it is a “historical demand region on the monthly timeframe.” In the past, turning this zone into support during bull markets has enabled Stellar to rally toward the $0.37-$0.40 mark. In 2021, the cryptocurrency rallied toward its cycle high of $0.80 after retesting the key demand zone and breaking out of the $0.37 barrier. Similarly, it hit its all-time high (ATH) of $0.87 after a breakout from this area. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 If XLM repeats history and rallies to the next resistance, it must reclaim and confirm that level to continue with its historical tendencies. “As such, a reclaim could see XLM challenge the $0.52 blue highs over time,” Rekt Capital concluded. Meanwhile, analyst CW has noted that after breaking the upper line of the downtrend channel, Stellar would encounter resistance in two selling walls, one between the $0.34-$0.38 levels, and a big one around the $0.47-$0.70 zone. As of this writing, Stellar trades at $0.296, a 2% increase in the daily timeframe.

Stone, a Republican strategist, mentioned this because the lawmaker accused Trump of cashing in on his tokens from a position of power in the White House. According to previous reports, the Arizona Senator introduced legislation banning cryptocurrency-related corruption by federal government officials. The End Crypto Corruption Act seeks to ban the President, Vice President, Senior Executive Branch Officials, and their immediate families from issuing, endorsing, or sponsoring digital assets such as meme coins and stablecoins. The Senator had also previously slammed the $TRUMP meme coin, calling it a “corruption in daylight.” Now, Trump has been actively promoting investment in the token from the White House, in addition to hosting a dinner for top investors in the token later this month, where each investor pays $1.5 million for the event. Many of the investors are non-Americans and have raised concerns that they may be seeking favors from Trump in exchange for benefits that may not be in the interest of America. Roger Stone wants Mark Kelly investigated for treason Roger Stone, in reaction to the development, has accused Kelly of treason. According to his post on X, he added that Kelly has been using his seat in the Senate as a partner of the Chinese communist company that makes spy balloons. “Senator Mark Kelly is cashing in on his US Senate seat as a partner in a Chinese communist company that makes surveillance balloons. He should be charged with treason and, if convicted, executed, consistent with federal law,” Stone said on X. Senator Mark Kelly is cashing in on his US Senate seat as a partner in a Chinese communist company that makes surveillance balloons. He should be charged with treason and if convicted executed , consistent with federal law. https://t.co/wqVMFxFchr — Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) May 8, 2025 Kelly, a former astronaut, was a co-founder at the Tucson-based Arizona firm World View Enterprise, specialising in high-altitude balloon near-space exploration. Chinese firm Tencent was an investor in the company from 2013 to 2016, with Kelly’s stock in the company reportedly being held at a blind trust since 2021. Democrats have been trying to crack down on what they described as “cryptocurrency corruption by Trump and other government officials.” The development has also gotten some Republicans worried , with Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski openly suggesting that it is improper for a president to openly profit from digital assets while still in office. Senator Lummis has also called for a regulation that would address the issue. Trump’s investor dinner raises eyebrows There have been concerns and raised eyebrows after investors in Trump’s meme coin started submitting bids to become one of the Top 220 owners of his digital asset. The move has been seen as one that could earn them an invite to a dinner with the president at his Virginia golf club later this month. While about 80% of the meme coin supply is controlled by the Trump Organization and close associates, about 19 of the top 25 investors use foreign exchanges that are closed to United States residents. The opportunity to be invited to a dinner with the American president has triggered a buying frenzy, with the move triggering a 20% jump in the value of the meme coin. According to reports, the Trump family has raked in profits of about $320 million from the meme coin since January. When challenged about profiting off the presidency by NBC’s Kristen Walker, Trump said, “I’m not profiting from anything.” He further added that if he owns a stock in a product and he does a good job and the value goes up, it means he is profiting. The controversy surrounding the Trump token comes as his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr, have been embarking on a world tour in the last few weeks to prop up business, making stops in Europe and the Middle East. The pair has carried out acts that are related to Trump-associated businesses, which could directly benefit the president. However, the Trump Organization has mentioned that the president’s businesses and assets are in a trust while he’s president, and he has no direct links to them.

M2 money supply growth supports bullish move in crypto assets. Analyst lists low-cap tokens like Flare, Drift, and Sonic. The crypto market may be entering the early stages of a new altcoin season, according to analysts. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin’s market dominance dropped by 2%, while prices for many altcoins surged. Ethereum has started rising against Bitcoin, which is often a signal that altcoins are about to outperform. If Bitcoin dominance drops further as it did in 2021 when it fell by 40%, the market could see altcoins surge even more. Macro Factors and Market Sentiment Point to Altcoin Growth A major factor behind this growth is the global M2 money supply, which tracks the total money circulating in the economy. Historical patterns show a strong link between this indicator and crypto market movements. As more money enters the system, especially from countries like China, the UK, and the EU, crypto assets tend to follow with upward moves.

While SOL holds above $120, uncertainty lingers as whale activity offsets bearish signals. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance (RXS) surges past $48 million in presale funding, defying the cautious mood gripping Solana investors. Priced at $0.20, RXS has rallied 6.6x since its initial presale stage, with 92% of its 500 million token allocation already sold. Backed by real-world asset tokenization and a CertiK-audited ecosystem, RXS positions itself as a tangible alternative to speculative tokens. Revolutionizing Asset Ownership Rexas Finance is transforming how global investors interact with high-value assets. By tokenizing real estate, gold, and commodities, the platform breaks barriers to entry. A retail investor in Tokyo can now own a fraction of a Parisian apartment, earning passive income from rental yields. Similarly, a small investor in Nairobi might hold shares in a Dubai-based gold reserve. The $15.8 trillion global real estate market and $12 trillion commodity sector are now accessible through blockchain, eliminating intermediaries and geographical limits. The process starts with the Rexas Token Builder, a tool enabling anyone to convert physical assets into digital tokens. Users define ownership percentages, set terms, and launch tokens in minutes. This democratizes asset creation, allowing businesses and individuals to monetize properties, art, or intellectual property. For instance, a New York restaurant owner could tokenize 30% of the venue, raising capital while retaining control. Building and Funding Tokenized Assets Rexas Launchpad connects creators with investors, streamlining capital formation. Startups and established firms pitch tokenized assets, attracting backers through transparent smart contracts. A recent $150,000 RXS purchase by whale wallet “0x3fD1…A9c2” highlights institutional interest—equivalent to 750,000 tokens at the current $0.20 price. Unlike traditional fundraising, the launchpad ensures liquidity from day one, with tokens tradable on decentralized exchanges post-launch. The presale’s velocity underscores market confidence. Stages 1–11 sold out rapidly, raising $41 million before the final stage began. With 460.5 million RXS tokens (92% of the presale supply) already claimed, the $0.20 entry point closes soon. Post-presale, RXS will list at $0.25 on three top-tier exchanges in 2025, offering early backers an immediate 25% gain. Analysts project a climb to $10+ within months of launch, fueled by real-world utility and expanding adoption. Security and Market Momentum Rexas Finance prioritizes trust through rigorous security protocols. A CertiK audit verified its ERC-20 smart contracts, ensuring robustness against exploits. This validation matters in a market wary of rug pulls, attracting cautious investors seeking stability. Listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko amplify visibility, placing RXS before 100 million monthly users. These platforms vet projects thoroughly, adding credibility that meme coins rarely achieve. A $1 million giveaway adds urgency, with 20 winners set to receive $50,000 each. Participants submit ERC-20 wallet addresses, complete social tasks, and refer friends for bonus entries. Combined with a 22.5% staking pool, Rexas incentivizes long-term holding—a strategy contrasting Solana’s volatile trading patterns. Seizing the Presale Window While Solana navigates FTX-related turbulence, Rexas Finance capitalizes on blockchain’s next frontier: real-world asset integration. Its presale nears completion, with $7.9 million left before hitting the $56 million cap. Early buyers benefit from a fixed $0.20 rate, avoiding higher post-launch prices. For context, a $1,000 investment today could yield $50,000 if RXS hits $10—a 50x return mirroring early Bitcoin gains. The team’s decision to bypass venture capital underscores their community-first ethos. Instead of reserving tokens for insiders, RXS empowers retail investors to lead this financial shift. As tokenization reshapes trillion-dollar industries, Rexas positions itself at the intersection of innovation and accessibility. Final Call for Early Entry Rexas Finance merges blockchain’s potential with tangible asset markets, offering a hedge against crypto’s speculative swings. With Solana’s trajectory uncertain, RXS emerges as a structured, high-growth alternative. The final presale stage closes once the remaining 39.5 million tokens sell out. Post-launch, analysts foresee relentless demand as tokenized assets gain mainstream traction. Rexas represents a rare convergence of innovation, security, and profit potential for investors seeking projects grounded in real utility.

US Lawmakers Push DOJ for Clarity,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-trump-protecting-binance-us-lawmakers-push-doj-for-clarity/,"The post Is Trump Protecting Binance? US Lawmakers Push DOJ for Clarity appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto is no longer just about money or tech anymore, it’s now a big part of politics, too. A fresh storm is brewing in Washington as top U.S. senators raise red flags over Donald Trump’s rising influence in crypto. They are asking questions about his reported links with Binance, one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world. And they want answers fast. US Senators Question Trump’s Crypto Ties With Binance Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Chris Van Hollen, have raised serious concerns about President Donald Trump’s growing connection with the crypto world, especially with Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange. Eventually, the concern came right after news broke that MGX, an investment firm from Abu Dhabi, plans to use a stablecoin called USD1, linked to Trump’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), to invest $2 billion in Binance . It’s not just about the money. Lawmakers are asking whether Trump and his allies might be influencing crypto policy behind the scenes. And that has some people worried. Binance’s History Raises Concerns Let’s not forget, Binance recently had to pay $4.3 billion in fines in a settlement with U.S. regulators. Its former CEO, CZ Zhao, also had to step down and serve a 4-month prison sentence, along with a $50 million personal fine. This has made the senators question whether Trump is trying to protect Binance or benefit from the exchange. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Slashes China Tariffs to 80% Ahead of May 10 Trade Talks , Trump’s Crypto Moves Raise Eyebrows Adding to the controversy, Trump has become increasingly active in the crypto world. From launching his own memecoin project that’s already pulled in millions from fees to hosting private dinners for top trump memecoin holders on May 22 . And with his family’s crypto company behind the USD1 stablecoin now tied to a Binance investment, his presence in the digital asset world is hard to ignore. Senators Demand Clear Answers All this controversy began when the U.S. tried to pass new crypto rules. Senator Elizabeth Warren blocked a vote on a stablecoin bill called the GENIUS Act . Warren said lawmakers shouldn’t help “facilitate this kind of corruption” without asking the tough questions. Senator Warren is now asking the Justice Department and Treasury for a full update. They want to know: Is Binance following its legal agreement? Is it really leaving the U.S.? If yes, then when? Whether Trump’s stablecoin being pushed for listings on Binance? Has anyone talked about a pardon for CZ? They’ve asked for a reply by May 21. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul. Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed , described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control. Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns. “Fake money leads to dishonest money, dishonest statistics, dishonest accounting, dishonest balance sheets, dishonest compensation, dishonest relations, dishonest leaders, and corruption in everyday life,” Kiyosaki wrote. He called on Americans to “fight back” by opting out of fiat systems and instead embracing decentralized stores of value like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and precious metals. Source: Robert Kiyosaki Related: ‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad’ author calls for $1 million BTC by 2035 Kiyosaki remains a major fiat critic Kiyosaki’s disdain for fiat currency is not new. He has repeatedly criticized the US dollar, labeling it a “dying” currency inflated by government spending and central bank manipulation. His financial philosophy, rooted in Austrian economics and personal sovereignty, champions assets that cannot be debased or politically controlled. Kiyosaki has long argued that bearer assets like gold, silver, and more recently Bitcoin, are critical hedges against inflation and key to long-term generational wealth accumulation through economic cycles. “Don’t work or save fake money,” he advised. “Get on your own decentralized gold, silver, and Bitcoin standard.” In an April 18 post, Kiyosaki forecasted that Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2035 as the US dollar continues to lose value to inflationary monetary policies. “I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $ 1 million, gold will be $30,000, and silver $3,000 a coin,” he said. Kiyosaki is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s future. In February 2025, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said that Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million by 2030 if demand for the digital asset continues to grow. More recently, on Dec. 10, Eric Trump delivered the keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and predicted that Bitcoin would hit $1 million due to its scarcity.

This milestone has shaken the cryptocurrency market and pulled investors back into full discovery mode. Many are now looking beyond Bitcoin and exploring the next big opportunities that could ride this momentum. Cryptocurrencies that combine innovation with cultural relevance are starting to stand out. Meme coins with actual utility. AI projects built on secure blockchains. Community-driven tokens with long-term goals. These aren’t just trends — they are signs of what’s gaining traction in the post-$100K era. One cryptocurrency that’s catching attention for the right reasons is Dawgz AI. It merges artificial intelligence with the Ethereum network. It speaks to both the meme coin crowd and long-term crypto investors. In this article, we’ll explore how Dawgz AI and a few established players are riding the wave of Bitcoin’s breakout and shaping what could come next. What Bitcoin’s $100K Breakout Signals for Altcoins Bitcoin reaching $100,000 has sparked renewed interest in the broader crypto market. This price level has been a psychological trigger for retail and institutional investors. When Bitcoin hits a major milestone, it often draws liquidity into other cryptocurrencies that offer different use cases or early-stage potential. Historically, Bitcoin's major price moves have been followed by altcoin activity. During the 2017 and 2021 cycles, many altcoins saw large percentage gains after Bitcoin reached new highs. According to CoinDesk, analysts believe this behavior reflects a market pattern where traders rotate into smaller assets after Bitcoin consolidates. The current market environment shows similar signs. Data from Glassnode reveals an increase in exchange inflows and address activity across multiple tokens. It includes projects focusing on artificial intelligence, blockchain infrastructure, and community-led token models. Investors are not only reacting to Bitcoin’s rise. They are actively searching for cryptocurrencies that offer use, purpose, and long-term upside. Why Crypto Investors in 2025 Are Focusing on Utility Over Hype In 2025, investors are prioritizing cryptocurrencies with real-world applications over speculative assets. According to Blockchain News , Bitcoin's dominance has decreased from 54.3% to 51.7% between May 1 and May 8, 2025, indicating a shift towards altcoins that offer tangible utility. This trend reflects a growing preference for tokens that provide practical solutions rather than depending only on market sentiment. Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin recently, attracting capital due to its robust ecosystem supporting decentralized applications. This movement underscores the market's inclination towards platforms that facilitate real-world use cases. Investors increasingly value cryptocurrencies that enable decentralized finance, supply chain management, and other practical applications. Dawgz AI exemplifies this shift by integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. By offering AI-powered tools and services, it caters to the demand for functional and innovative crypto projects. Such utility-focused tokens are gaining traction among investors seeking long-term value and real-world applicability. 3 Cryptos to Watch if You Missed the Bitcoin Bull Run Dawgz AI – AI-Powered, Ethereum-Based Meme Coin with a Utility Roadmap Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is currently priced at approximately $0.004 during its presale phase. The token has a total supply of 8.888 billion $DAGZ, with 30% allocated for presale. The project has raised over $3.47 million towards its $3.61 million target, indicating growing investor interest. The project aims to integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. It plans to offer AI-powered trading bots capable of making real-time decisions based on market trends. Additionally, Dawgz AI intends to provide staking incentives and community rewards to engage its user base. Security is a focus for Dawgz AI. The project's smart contract was audited by SolidProof in June 2024, addressing common concerns associated with early-stage crypto investments.

Investors in 2025 are more selective about where they put their money. They are drawn to tokens that provide real value through use cases, not just hype. It includes cryptocurrencies that support decentralized finance, artificial intelligence, or on-chain data services. Long-term performance often depends on whether a token solves a real problem and continues to attract developer attention. Tokenomics also plays a major role in long-term viability. Coins with fair distribution, low inflation, and transparent supply plans tend to build trust with investors. Security audits, on-chain transparency, and strong community involvement are key indicators a project is designed to last beyond short-term cycles. Dawgz AI, for example, completed a SolidProof audit and disclosed its supply model early in its presale phase. These signals help investors identify the best crypto to buy now as Bitcoin's rally draws more attention to the market. A token that combines utility, vision, and transparency stands out. Whether it’s powering AI tools, securing smart contracts, or scaling transaction volume, real-world function separates potential from speculation in this cycle. Long-Term vs Short-Term Thinking – Which Cryptos Are Worth Holding? Short-term cryptocurrency trading often involves capitalizing on market volatility to achieve quick gains. This approach requires constant monitoring of price movements and swift decision-making. While it can yield profits, it also carries higher risks due to the unpredictable nature of the market. Traders must be prepared for rapid changes and potential losses. In contrast, long-term investing focuses on the potential growth of cryptocurrencies over an extended period. Investors adopting this strategy look for assets with strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and a clear roadmap. They are less concerned with short-term price fluctuations and more interested in the overall trajectory of the asset. This approach often involves holding onto investments through market ups and downs, believing that the asset's value will increase over time. Dawgz AI exemplifies a cryptocurrency suitable for long-term holding. Its integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology offers practical applications that extend beyond mere speculation. With a focus on utility and a commitment to transparency, Dawgz AI presents a compelling case for investors seeking assets with enduring value. Prioritizing functionality and long-term potential aligns with sustainability principles.

In a new interview on the White Crypto YouTube channel, Hayes says an increase in the global money supply will act as a bullish catalyst for BTC and crypto. “I think it’s a great time to be in the crypto ecosystem because we have sort of this reflation happening across the world. More fiat money chasing a scarce asset and the bull market’s going to continue. And I think it’s going to be a fun party.” According to Hayes, Bitcoin could go up by about 10x from the current level by January of 2029. “I think by the end of Trump’s presidency, so end of 2028, Bitcoin will be around $1 million. Or we’ll have crossed $1 million. It might be lower than that at that point but I think we’ll get to that nominal figure within the next three to four years.” Bitcoin is trading at $103,045 at time of writing. On the US dollar’s prospects in the face of increasing money supply, the Maelstrom Fund CIO says, “I think the dollar depreciates against gold, the dollar depreciates against Bitcoin. US Treasuries are probably the worst thing to own versus any other sort of financial asset out there, as they need to devalue because there’s too much out there.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to the company’s May 9 earnings report, revenue for the quarter dropped 19% year-over-year to $34.4 million, while operational costs surged — with cost of revenue more than doubling to $24.5 million from $14.4 million last year. The company pointed to multiple factors for its dismal quarter: Bitcoin’s April halving, which cut miner rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block; rising network difficulty; and unexpected weather disruptions at its New York facility. With cost of revenue now consuming over 71% of its total income — compared to 34% a year ago — TeraWulf is clearly grappling with squeezed margins and structural challenges. Tariffs Fuel TeraWulf Sell-Offs Beyond the halving, macroeconomic pressure from President Donald Trump’s revived trade tariffs is compounding the miner’s woes . The new duties are making imported mining hardware, especially ASIC machines, more expensive — and are expected to widen the gap between U.S. miners and their overseas competitors. Industry insiders warn that the extra costs could cripple domestic mining expansion unless exemptions or workarounds are introduced. The financial strain appears to be pushing miners toward liquidity. Data from March shows that mining firms sold off 40% of their mined Bitcoin — the most significant liquidation since October 2024. The trend marked a sharp reversal from the post-halving accumulation strategies many miners had adopted in hopes of long-term profitability. Outlook Murky for U.S. Miners TeraWulf’s earnings mirror a broader reality within the crypto mining space: shrinking returns and heightened uncertainty. The combination of reduced block rewards, inflationary pressures, and trade tensions has eroded what were once reliable business models. While some miners are diversifying into AI or high-performance computing, companies like TeraWulf remain heavily tied to Bitcoin’s economics. Unless the policy climate becomes more favorable or Bitcoin’s price sees a significant lift, miners may continue facing tough quarters ahead — with the halving cycle now ushering in a far more competitive and uncertain era.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs).

WIF is trading well above the 20-day SMA. The rally looks healthy, but a short-term reversal could be imminent. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF is riding strong bullish momentum The 1-day price analysis on May 10 shows that WIF is riding strong bullish momentum, surging over 24% today and trading within a clearly defined ascending channel. Price closed at $0.897, far above the upper Bollinger Band ($0.799), signaling aggressive momentum. WIF is riding strong bullish momentum The MACD and RSI both support ongoing buying pressure, though the market is inching close to overbought territory. As long as WIF holds within this rising channel, the uptrend is intact—but any break below support could invite quick profit-taking. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: Buyers maintain control of the market WIF continues to climb, consolidating just under $0.89 after a strong rally. The MACD remains bullish with widening lines, suggesting momentum is intact. Price holds well above the upper Bollinger Band at $0.884, indicating overextension but no rejection yet.

WIF is surging near $1 with strong momentum. MACD is bullish, RSI is overbought (78), and price broke above Bollinger Bands. A pullback might be imminent – traders should watch out. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1 by the end of 2025 and about $3 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

This time, he reminds Altman of his stance on Trump in 2016. However, Altman did not sit still as usual; he fought back with a tweet against Musk published in 2022. Musk reposted a tweet that Altman wrote in 2016. Altman had said, “I am voting against Trump because I believe the principles he stands for represent an unacceptable threat to America.” In response, Altman replied with a tweet from 2022 that reported Musk saying that the ex-president should “hang up his hat.” Altman argues, “We were both wrong, or at least I certainly was, but that was from 2016, and this was from 2022.” Musk’s xAI is a competitor to OpenAI, but it hasn’t caught up yet. xAI bought Musk’s social media site X last month. In February, Musk made an offer to buy OpenAI that wasn’t asked for, offering $97.4 billion but Altman turned it down. Musk’s lawyer, Marc Toberoff, said in a statement, “Had OpenAI’s Board genuinely considered the bid, as they were obligated to do, they would have seen just how serious it was.” Musk had also said that he doesn’t trust Altman to lead the biggest AI in the world. To that end, his efforts are still directed to, if not acquired, the company to fight against, especially when he is still under Trump’s administration. Elon Musk to go ahead with the fight against OpenAI After Elon Musk, Meta, and others fought against it, OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said the company gave up on its plan to change from a nonprofit to a for-profit business. However, Musk plans to proceed with his highly watched lawsuit against OpenAI. Under OpenAI’s newly proposed plan, its non-profit parent would continue to control the for-profit business and become a major shareholder. Musk’s lawyer said the announcement did not clarify important details about the claimed “non-profit control” arrangement. On the other hand, OpenAI said, “Elon continuing with his baseless lawsuit only proves that it was always a bad-faith attempt to slow us down.” OpenAI sued Musk back in April, and the company said Musk was trying to hurt its image and relationships with investors and customers on purpose. A federal judge in Oakland has set a trial for March 2026 between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. It will be a very important fight over the future of AI ethics, nonprofit governance, and corporate responsibility. Meanwhile, Sam Altman claimed none of the outside pressure mattered. “We’re all obsessed with our mission. You’re all obsessed with Elon,” he said. Sam Altman asks US lawmakers not to make rules that can slow down US AI Other than Musk’s fight, Altman is fighting another fight. He said America’s AI efforts shouldn’t be slowed down by rules that aren’t thought through. He said this on Capitol Hill. The hearing was about beating China to become the world leader in AI. When asked by Sen. Ted Cruz asked Altman how close China is to being as good at AI as the U.S. He said, “ It’s hard to say how far ahead we are, but I would say not a huge amount of time.” He said he thought OpenAI, Google, and other models were the best models in the world. But he also said that to keep winning, we would need “sensible regulation” that “does not slow the US down. However, China’s Alibaba said that its Qwen3 is better than OpenAI’s o3. Altman also said that the American spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship is special. He advised that for now, the US should only do the things that have worked in the past and not mess up.

In the last 24 hours, ETH has jumped and institutions have aligned with more ETH adoption. Coinbase added 21,000 ETH to its treasury last quarter, now holding over 140,000 ETH, worth around $315 million. Institutions launching Layer-2 networks like Kraken, Worldcoin, and Uniswap are also adopting ETH as a treasury asset, pushing Ethereum further into the “store-of-value” category.

New players are entering the space, promising investors massive gains. Among these are interesting projects like Bonk and Codename:Pepe, stealing the attention of investors looking for profits. Codename:Pepe mixes a clever use of AI with the benefits of a community, aiming to change the crypto space. It is not seen as just another meme coin, but as a serious project that could deliver gains. However, its mission to provide returns will depend on its growing community. Codename:Pepe Unleashes True Intelligence for Maximum Profits The crypto underworld has witnessed the rise of fake AI agents–untrustworthy operators promising to use next-gen intelligence, while barely providing what users need. This nonsense ends today. Codename:Pepe has come to replace these fake AI agents. This undercover agent does not pretend; it is doing something useful, helping investors make money in the chaotic meme coin industry. Codename:Pepe is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: The True Identity of Codename:Pepe Keep this under wraps: Codename:Pepe is a Pepe in disguise. The token is designed after the PEPE coin, which rose as high as 22,000%, and is adopting the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Codename:Pepe Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Codename:Pepe is powered by the people. The bigger the support it gets, the higher the price of the token goes. This is why the project adopted a presale plan that is powered by its community: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Codename:Pepe Mission Explained Codename:Pepe plans to use the power of artificial intelligence to track the best meme coins in the industry. It will also predict market trends and deliver AI-powered trading signals before the FOMO starts. Beyond smart analysis, this powerful agent will also help you trade, using its automated AI-trader, turning the signals into big gains. Every great agent needs the best organization behind them, and this is where $AGNT comes in. Holding the $AGNT tokens allows members to join the project’s DAO, where investors (operatives) can access classified strategies, insider analytics, and the ability to vote on important missions. Holding $AGNT will unlock: Membership in the project’s DAO Access to classified strategies Insider analytics Ability to vote on high-stakes missions Profits from the mutual DAO will be shared among those who stake their $AGNT, ensuring that the profits from trades go to the most loyal agents. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This project is dependent on the community, so 25% of the total token supply is reserved for staking and rewards. Codename:Pepe is not just sharing tokens around; the supply is capped at 5 billion tokens, meaning that there are no inflation surprises. Further breaking down its tokenomics, only 20% of the supply will be available in the presale, noting that the offer at a discounted rate is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your opportunity to join the most ridiculous yet profitable mission. The profits go to traders who choose to invest early. Don’t be the trader who wishes they had gotten in earlier. The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the fake AI win? Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount Bonk Holds Steady Near Support, Eyes 18% Breakout Bonk is currently trading between $0.00001418 and $0.00002023. This shows that the token is consolidating after recent market movements. The coin is presently close to its support levels at $0.00001193, which could be a safety net for investors if the price drops. In the past week, Bonk has shown a little volatility. The coin has maintained its position without a major rise or drop. The performance shows that sentiment between traders remains balanced and could be the foundation for future growth. The closest resistance level is at $0.00002403. If Bonk makes it way to this point, it would be an 18% rise from its current price. Breaking through this resistance could also show a bullish shift and attract more investors into the market. Based on this data, Bonk may be set for an upward move. The closeness to the resistance level and price stability shows that it has enough room for growth. Traders might need to watch out for the resistance, which could lead to more gains if the market conditions remain favourable. Conclusion In the current bull run, traditional meme coins like SHIB and DOGE are no longer attracting investors. New tokens like Bonk are showing the appeal, but they offer limited room for profits. The market is ready for a new project that can deliver quick gains and new features. Codename:Pepe enters the market as that contender, introducing artificial intelligence. Unlike most projects that claim to use AI, this token uses the best algorithms to analyze market trends and identify the best opportunities in the market. It also offers investors access to the best insights, automated trading, and participation in its community. With its supply capped, the project is focused on rewarding users, positioning itself as a game-changer ready for growth.

This move has taken the entire market by surprise after calls for lower prices dominated the crypto space for the last few months. As sentiment has moved back into the positive, Young has turned bullish, explaining the change in his stance and what is going on with the market right now. Bitcoin Bull Cycle Is Not Over In an X post, CEO Ki Young Ju explained how the current market has deviated from the previous cycles. For one, he explains that the market is no longer reliant on old Bitcoin whales, retail investors, and miners to move the market. This used to be the way to know the cycle top, which was when old whales and miners were offloading their bags. However, the market has managed to move on, and the Bitcoin price is now better positioned to absorb large sell-offs without issue. Related Reading: Bullish Continuation For XRP Price Shows Possible Recovery To $4 Young explains that this can be attributed to how diverse the market has become so far. The advent of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) back in 2024, have opened up new avenues for liquidity. Now, it is not only new retail investors playing the field, but also institutional investors who have been given an avenue to enter the market, and with much larger pockets. This new and substantial flow of liquidity has made it so that even sell-offs from large whales are no longer impacting the Bitcoin price the way they used to. Thus, the CEO believes that it is time to actually shift focus from the old to the new. Given this change in the tide, the CryptoQuant CEO stated that it might be time to throw out the cycle theory. This is because of the changes in liquidity flow, as sources have become more uncertain. “Now, instead of worrying about old whales selling, it’s more important to focus on how much new liquidity is coming from institutions and ETFs since this new influx can outweigh even strong whale sell-offs,” Young explained. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes Signal That Has Led To A Surge Every Time Nevertheless, he still posits that the current market isn’t flashing a clear bearish or bullish pattern when it comes to the profit-taking cycle. As he explains, the market is still sluggish around absorbing all of the new liquidity coming from the different sources and indicators are still “hanging around the borderline.” As for the Bitcoin price, it continues to show strength after crossing $100,000, as bulls eye new all-time highs above $109,000. Investor profitability has also skyrocket and a whopping 99% of all Bitcoin holders are now sitting in profit, according to data from IntoTheBlock.

The document references Ripple’s success in tokenizing “hundreds of millions of dollars of RWAs on the XRP Ledger (XRPL),” positioning Ripple alongside global institutions such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs in the tokenization space. It outlines the transformation of traditional finance through blockchain-enabled digital representation of assets. It stresses how tokenization boosts liquidity and efficiency, making historically illiquid assets like real estate and art more accessible. SMQKE emphasized the importance of Robinhood’s recognition, stating that the document “highlighted the success of Ripple’s tokenization of RWA on the XRPL,” and framed the perceived relationship between Robinhood and Ripple as institutional validation of XRP’s role in this growing sector. Remember, a 2025 Robinhood document on tokenization highlighted the success of Ripple’s tokenization of RWA on the XRPL. Robinhood Ripple https://t.co/y3um4vbI3b pic.twitter.com/LTnM4YyKyV — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 7, 2025 Institutional Momentum and Ripple’s Strategic Position According to the Robinhood paper, demand for tokenized assets is increasing across traditional finance. It notes that several major financial institutions have disclosed an intention to actively pursue the development and utilization of blockchain networks to facilitate the tokenization and transfer of RWAs. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which tokenizes U.S. Treasuries, is cited as an example. Immediately following that, the document acknowledges Ripple’s contribution to the space. The mention of Ripple is particularly significant due to XRPL’s inclusion as a dedicated infrastructure for RWA tokenization. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike more generalized references to digital assets, Robinhood directly connects Ripple’s efforts to the XRPL, reinforcing its relevance as a blockchain optimized for financial-grade tokenization. A recent Coinbase report highlighted XRP as an attractive asset to institutions , and this level of clarity in a mainstream financial document further enhances the legitimacy of XRP in institutional eyes. Growth Projections and Competitive Landscape The Robinhood document also references Goldman Sachs’ focus on tokenizing real estate and money market funds and cites a McKinsey & Co. projection estimating that tokenized fund markets could approach $2 trillion by 2030, excluding stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. Ripple has predicted an even more ambitious target of $16 trillion by 2033, and other experts place the market’s potential value at $18.9 trillion by 2033. Recent reports suggest capturing just 20% of that market could send the asset as high as $54 . Ripple’s achievements and infrastructure are among the major players driving the transition from pilot programs to widespread institutional adoption. For XRP supporters, this validation adds weight to Ripple’s long-term strategy and potential market share. With real-world usage confirmed by a broker-dealer such as Robinhood and a clear role in facilitating tokenization via XRPL, Ripple is increasingly difficult to overlook in conversations about blockchain’s future in capital markets.

According to data shared by the company, many altcoins have been moved from millionaire wallets to exchanges in recent hours, which may indicate selling pressure. The most notable transfer was on the Eurite (EURI) side, with a $3.3 million transfer that took place eight hours ago, equivalent to 7.38% of the token’s total supply. Other important whale transfers highlighted by Santiment are as follows: Ethena-USDe (USDe): $7.7 million (0.16%) Pepe (PEPE): $6.3 million (0.16%) Ondo Finance (ONDO): $3.3 million (0.12%) Ethena (ENA): $2.1 million (0.12%) Maker (MKR): $1.7 million (0.13%) Illuvium (ILV): $1.4 million (1.25%) Mantra DAO (OM): $1.1 million (0.32%) Related News: Following Bitcoin's Surpass of $100,000, Predictions for This Year's Peak Price Have Been Updated - Here Are the New Expected Price Levels It is important to note that these show the largest individual whale transfers made during the day, not the total centralized cryptocurrency exchange transfers made by whales in these altcoins.

The company’s crypto debit cards—both physical and virtual—are now accepted at all Korean merchants that support Visa, according to a May 9 report by The Korea Economic Daily. The move marks RedotPay’s latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities. RedotPay, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled since the soft launch of its crypto card program in late 2024. It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide. In South Korea, users can receive a virtual card for $10 or a physical card for $100, with minimal verification requirements, including name, address, and ID. Reports on social media indicate that the card is currently available to Korean users. “You can use it right away with your smartphone without a physical card by simply verifying your identity upon issuance,” one user wrote on X. Source: Blippi Related: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interview RedotPay cards support major cryptocurrencies The RedotPay cards support major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) and stablecoins such as USDC ( USDC ) and USDt ( USDT ). Users can load their cards with crypto assets from several blockchains , including Solana, Polygon, BSC, Tron, and Arbitrum. One standout feature is RedotPay’s real-time stablecoin payment and refund system. When a purchase is made, stablecoins are deducted instantly from the user’s wallet. If a transaction is canceled, refunds in USDC or USDT are processed within minutes. RedotPay is also compatible with Apple Pay in Seoul, giving it an edge in a market where Apple Pay is currently limited to Hyundai Card customers. The compatibility could prove crucial as RedotPay challenges Korea’s established payment infrastructure. Crypto adoption has been accelerating in South Korea, where over 16 million people reportedly hold crypto . This has also made crypto a key topic in the 2025 South Korean presidential race. On May 6, South Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung became the latest presidential candidate to promise the approval of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other crypto-friendly measures, should he be elected. South Korea’s ruling party, the People Power Party, also reportedly made crypto policy promises in late April, which included allowing spot crypto ETFs, dismantling Korea’s controversial one-exchange-one-bank rule, and establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

While giants like Cardano and XRP enjoy gains in this positive market, now is also the best time to invest in new projects with high prospects. Among others, Yeti Ouro is one project that has impressed investors and crypto gurus around the world. Many analysts note that several XRP and ADA investors are now turning to Yetio as they find it the one with the biggest potential. Yeti Ouro Yeti Ouro is an Ethereum token with next-gen tokenomics and utility. It comes with a hard cap of 1 billion YETIO and deflationary features. The presale buyers are given half of the supply, and a considerable amount has been kept aside for ecosystem incentives. Additionally, the smart contract was professionally audited ( SolidProof ), so the project is totally secure. This is different from inflationary models in certain old-school altcoins with effectively limitless supply mechanisms. Yeti Ouro has differentiated itself from its contemporaries in the market through the Yeti Go game. The premium racing game has impressed hardcore gamers and draws users with its pioneering play-to-earn model. Thus, by focusing on turning the game into a superhit in the real world, Yeti Ouro creates sustainable demand for itself. Analysts note that YETIO is focused on utility, sustainable tokenomics, deflationary traits, and staking incentives. This makes it attractive to DeFi users who believe in scarcity and utility. The same has also been witnessed during presale. The presale has sold more than 237 million YETIO and raised more than $4 million, showcasing strong investor demand. Current Stage 1-3 investors have seen a 100% ROI because of rising stage prices. Stage 4 (current) price is $0.041, and there are offers that enable you to maximize the investment. YETIO Vs. ADA And XRP: Why Traders Are Shifting As some modern cryptocurrencies continue to innovate brilliantly, investors are shifting their resources. Cardano, specifically, has seen tremendous fluctuations in the recent past. The Cardano token gained from the current positive market sentiment, growing by over 11% last week. Currently, Cardano price is at approximately $0.7891. Cardano boasts a sizable community and significant staking base but still enjoys no regulatory assurances and has also demonstrated a considerably slow rate of development activity. Credits:CoinMarketCap Ripple’s XRP is another example. XRP price is sitting at about $2.37, waiting for an SEC ruling and clarity on spot ETFs. While XRP has experienced renewed enthusiasm with favorable legal news, there are traders stuck in limbo. On the other hand, YETIO has genuine utility. To retail investors and players, the token is tied to an interesting product (Yeti Go), as well as community hype created through races and competitions. Apart from that, the majority argue that investment in Yetio provides them with indirect benefits arising from the fast-growing gaming industry. The advanced strategy in the game development, strategic ecosystem projects, and co-operations in later stages also add to the benefits of Yeti Ouro. So if blockchain gaming is 2025’s formula for expansion, projects like Yeti Ouro could be some of the most well-positioned players. Of course, all crypto investments carry risk. However, presale numbers and market trends suggest YETIO is a coin to watch as a substitute for Cardano or XRP for those seeking high returns.

The Bank of America Institute says consumer transactions and spending on unnecessary expenses have been waning since the beginning of the year. “The gradual easing in consumer spending momentum is not just due to lower inflation – the growth in the number of transactions has also cooled. Consumers appear to be pulling back particularly on bigger ticket discretionary services like airline tickets and lodging.” Data shows that since January, total credit and debit card spending across all households is contracting, with lower-income households showing the largest decline in growth rate. “Some slowdown in spending growth is consistent across income cohorts since the beginning of the year, though the spending growth of lower-income households is weakest. In our view, this partly reflects relative softness in their after-tax wage growth. In fact, lower-income households saw an after-tax wage gain of just 1.5% YoY (year-over-year) in April, a slight improvement from the previous month, but still a lower rate than the past two years, according to Bank of America deposit data.” The banking giant also warns that while the labor market continues to be strong, unemployment payments are on the rise. “While the overall labor market remains very healthy, we see some signs of a rise in households receiving unemployment payments. Notably, the number of higher-income households receiving such payments in Bank of America deposit accounts accelerated to 6.1% YoY growth in April from 1% YoY in February. Meanwhile, it increased 4.1% YoY for lower-income households and 5.7% YoY for middle-income households in April.” The report is based on aggregated and anonymized transaction data from the Bank of America.

After months of sideways action, Ripple’s token is picking up speed — with traders eyeing a breakout as regulatory clarity inches closer. But while attention turns to XRP, some early investors are already rotating into newer tokens with lower caps, live products, and presale entry. One of them is Kaanch Network , a governance infrastructure protocol in Stage 5 of presale at $0.16. Why the XRP Rally Is Driving Presale Interest Whenever XRP gains ground, two things happen: Investor confidence in regulatory green lights increases Altcoin volume rises, especially for Layer-1 and utility projects That second effect is important — it shifts focus to other infrastructure tokens. Kaanch is one of them. And it’s still flying under the radar. What Kaanch Is Building On-chain staking No-code DAO tools Governance modules for Web3 teams It’s not a base chain like XRP. But it’s an essential layer for teams building on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and other chains. And it’s already live. Presale buyers are entering at $0.16 , before Stage 6 lifts the price to $0.32. Why Early Buyers Are Paying Attention Kaanch is delivering now — not post-listing The token is used in live tools The valuation is low, and the market hasn't priced in utility It’s the kind of setup that early XRP backers saw:Useful infrastructure, overlooked by the crowd. FAQ What stage is Kaanch in right now?Stage 5 of presale. Price: $0.16. Stage 6: $0.32. Is the product live?Yes. DAO and staking tools are already deployed and used. What does the token power?Voting logic, staking flows, DAO permissions, and governance actions. Where do I join the presale?

For the past several years, web3 has been dominated by one metric: Total Value Locked. Entire ecosystems have been valued, ranked, and rewarded based on how much capital they can silo within their smart contracts and bridges. However, while TVL has been an easy number to point to, it’s also led us down a narrow path that reinforces fragmentation, not freedom. You might also like: Breaking free from the Matrix: Web3 search engine can reshape the internet’s future | Opinion I feel it’s time to shift the narrative. Web3 shouldn’t be about how much value is locked away on isolated chains; it should be about how much value is unlocked and made usable everywhere. The industry needs a new north star: Total Value Unlocked (TVU). The failure of TVL as a metric Some readers might argue that TVL is a necessary measure for assessing economic security and user trust. Others may contend that full interoperability increases systemic risk, especially given the growing frequency of cross-chain bridge exploits. While I agree that these risks must be addressed, they do not justify the continued fragmentation of the ecosystem. TVL incentivizes protocols to hoard assets through staking rewards, yield farming and native token lockups, creating liquidity silos, fragmented networks that are difficult and risky to bridge. Developers are pressured to align with specific ecosystems while users must navigate a fractured, complex landscape. Recent trends, such as the proliferation of Layer 2s (a Gemini Institutional Insights report noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched roughly every 19 days) and application-specific chains have exacerbated this problem. Projects like Base and Blast are expanding Ethereum’s reach but are also reinforcing value lock-in. Meanwhile, interoperability promises, such as those made by Cosmos and Polkadot , have yet to fully solve cross-chain composability at scale. Introducing Total Value Unlocked Total Value Unlocked shifts the focus from isolation to accessibility. TVU is a measure of how much usable, verifiable, and interoperable value a blockchain ecosystem can unlock, not just on its own, but in concert with others. It’s about enabling liquidity, data, smart contracts, and infrastructure to be accessed universally, across all chains. This is what web3 urgently needs now: the ability to use the best applications, the most relevant data, and the deepest liquidity, regardless of where they originated. To make this possible, the ecosystem needs more than just cross-chain bridges. It requires a universal foundation for verifiability and interoperability, a settlement layer that validates data, transactions, and smart contracts across diverse environments. Unlocking value through universal verification Instead of relying on trust-based integrations, systems could use mathematical proofs to ensure correctness. Whether it’s a transaction from Ethereum ( ETH ), a smart contract execution on Solana ( SOL ), or an AI model inference on a Layer 3 network, a verifiable settlement layer would allow developers to verify once and use anywhere. This model allows liquidity from one chain to be deployed across others without losing integrity, while enabling smart contracts written in one language to be verified and referenced by another chain’s execution environment. Additionally, it allows AI models and off-chain computations to be cryptographically verified and made usable across applications and chains, ultimately bringing together off-chain knowledge and on-chain state under a single verifiable architecture. With TVU, we stop measuring how much value is trapped and start measuring how much is empowered. As more chains launch and as application-specific infrastructure continues to proliferate, the fragmentation of web3 will only accelerate in tandem. If we cannot share liquidity, contracts, or data easily across environments, user experience will remain fractured and mainstream adoption will stall. TVU offers a new framework for thinking about growth, prioritizing composability, reach, and usability over isolated numbers. It rewards developers who build interoperable systems, and it guides ecosystem architects to design infrastructure that connects rather than isolates. By focusing on TVU, and by developing a universal settlement and verification infrastructure, web3 can move beyond liquidity islands and toward a truly interconnected ecosystem.

As Ethereum (ETH) steadily reasserts its dominance, some of its long-term backers are starting to turn their attention toward a new project still in its early stage: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This under-the-radar token is quietly gathering momentum — and for those asking what the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now is, MUTM is becoming a serious contender. Why ETH Investors Are Taking a Look at MUTM Ethereum holders typically don’t chase hype. Most have weathered multiple cycles and prefer projects with actual utility, clear mechanics, and long-term potential. What’s caught their eye with Mutuum Finance is its focused approach to solving a persistent issue in decentralized finance — unlocking liquidity from digital assets without giving up ownership. Mutuum offers a clean, practical structure. Users can deposit crypto assets and borrow stablecoins in return, keeping full exposure to the original assets while tapping into capital for other investments. This is particularly appealing to ETH holders, many of whom are already familiar with leveraging crypto positions and are now looking for more efficient, yield-generating alternatives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is not a meme token, nor is it positioning itself as another copycat platform. The project is structured around sustainable yield, capital efficiency, and responsible growth. Its non-custodial protocol allows users to lend or borrow while keeping complete control over their assets. The platform also plans to issue its own overcollateralized stablecoin, adding another layer of functionality and ecosystem depth. This stablecoin won’t be backed by vague reserves or off-chain promises. Instead, it’s created directly from excess collateral deposited by users, and its supply adjusts automatically through minting and burning. When users repay loans or are liquidated, the stablecoin is removed from circulation, keeping its peg to the dollar intact and ensuring systemic stability. All interest from stablecoin borrowing flows into Mutuum’s treasury, reinforcing long-term value instead of relying on inflationary models. With more capital staying within the ecosystem, MUTM becomes more than just a token — it becomes a utility-backed asset linked to platform activity. And for those planning to hold over the long run, that structure supports real yield growth, not just speculation. One of the reasons serious investors are starting to trust Mutuum’s potential is its approach to security. The protocol’s smart contracts are undergoing a full CertiK audit, a step that puts it in line with other respected DeFi platforms. In an industry that’s had its share of security mishaps, this kind of third-party review is essential for building trust, especially among those moving large amounts of capital. This audit sends a clear message: Mutuum is not rushing to market. It’s building deliberately, with a product-first approach that values transparency and resilience. Combined with a plan to roll out a beta version of the platform by the time the token launches, it shows the team is focused on usability from day one — something many early-stage tokens can’t offer. As of now, Mutuum Finance is in the fourth phase of its presale, with over $7.75 million raised and more than 9,500 holders already on board. The $0.025 pricing won’t be around much longer, as the upcoming fifth presale phase will raise it to $0.03. With a launch price confirmed at $0.06, early participants are locking in a 140% gain even before listings begin. This pricing structure is designed to reward those who act early — and it’s working. The presale is over 65% completed, and demand is only growing as more investors recognize the opportunity. For anyone focused on long-term ROI, entering before the next phase isn’t just an advantage — it could be the difference between a good return and a great one. What makes this project even more compelling is its roadmap. From stablecoin development to lending infrastructure, everything has been laid out with a long-term strategy in mind. Unlike projects that burn through hype cycles, Mutuum is positioning itself as a steady, value-driven protocol that rewards participation. Projections from analysts point to potential prices well beyond the launch price. Some are estimating the token could reach $0.25 in the short term and climb toward $1.25+ within a broader market rally. Given the current entry point, that kind of movement represents major upside. To further incentivize community participation, the team has also introduced a $100,000 giveaway, giving users the chance to win rewards by engaging with the platform ahead of launch. Details are available on the official website, and entries are already stacking up — another sign of growing interest in the project. For those in the Ethereum community seeking fresh opportunities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a compelling option. It’s not trying to replace ETH — it’s offering something complementary: yield, control, and functionality. With its presale still live, a fast-approaching price increase, and a product that’s nearly ready, the window to get in early is still open — but it won’t be for long. If you’re looking for the best crypto investment right now with long-term potential, MUTM deserves serious consideration.

The token is up by 8.8% this week, with strong bullish momentum building as traders eye the critical $2.50 resistance level. However, this recent price action is driven by a combination of favorable regulatory news, bullish market sentiment, and promising long-term price predictions. XRP Price Surge Fueled by SEC Settlement and Market Confidence Ripple reached a significant settlement with the SEC, agreeing to pay a reduced penalty of $50 million , substantially lower than the initial $125 million fine. This settlement marks the resolution of a long-standing legal dispute that had weighed heavily on XRP’s price and market sentiment. The market has responded positively, viewing this as a step toward regulatory clarity for the broader crypto sector. RIPPLE & SEC TO REACH $50M SETTLEMENT SEC and Ripple plan to dismiss respective appeals. $XRP Legal Battle Finally Over! pic.twitter.com/Jx7GKwtiRH — King Solomon (@IOV_OWL) May 8, 2025 The SEC settlement reflects a broader shift in regulatory tone, particularly with the recent appointment of SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, who has signaled a more balanced approach to digital asset regulation. The market has reacted positively to this leadership change, as it suggests a less aggressive enforcement environment for cryptocurrencies moving forward. XRP/USD Technical Analysis – May 10, 2025 XRP price prediction is bullish as XRP is currently trading at $2.3725, approaching a key resistance at $2.4288, where a horizontal barrier and a rising trendline converge, potentially forming a significant supply zone. A breakout above this level could trigger a rapid move toward the next resistance at $2.4772, aligning with the upper trendline. Trade Setup: Entry: Consider entering on a confirmed breakout above $2.4288, targeting $2.4772. Stop Loss: Below the key support at $2.3342 to limit downside risk. Take Profit: Near $2.4772, where the trendline and horizontal resistance align. Risk Management: Monitor the MACD, which shows increasing bullish momentum, but be cautious as a pullback to $2.3342 remains possible if resistance holds. Key Takeaways: XRP’s price surged 8.8% this week, driven by a favorable SEC settlement and bullish market sentiment. Technical analysis suggests a breakout above $2.4288 could lead to further gains toward $2.4772. Market confidence is growing as regulatory risks diminish and institutional interest rises. As XRP continues to attract institutional interest and sees reduced regulatory risks, the cryptocurrency remains well-positioned for potential further gains, especially if it can break through key resistance levels in the coming sessions.

According to well-known crypto analyst Rekt Capital, this is not just a price jump, it’s the start of something huge. He says a new Bitcoin Four-Year Cycle has begun, and if history repeats, there’s money to be made this year. So let’s walk through this timeline and see what’s coming next. New Cycle Begins with a Bullish Signal Rekt Capital’s tweet highlights that 2025 isn’t just any year. It’s expected to be the peak year of Bitcoin’s current bull market cycle. His analysis is based on historical Bitcoin data, where every four-year period follows a similar pattern, a strong bull run, a bear market, and then a period of recovery or bottoming out. It’s 2025 A new #BTC Four Year Cycle has therefore begun 2025 will be the year of the $BTC Bull Market peak 2026 will be the year of the Bitcoin Bear Market And 2027 will be the Bottoming Out year to precede an entirely brand new future Bull Market #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/xlphQM3r8f — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) May 9, 2025 By reaching $100K again , Bitcoin has likely kicked off the most explosive phase of the cycle, what many call the “bull peak” year. What History Tells Us About Bitcoin’s Cycles Rekt Capital’s 12-month chart shows how Bitcoin has behaved over the previous four-year cycles. The pattern is clear, Year 1: The bull market peak (like 2021) Year 2: A big drop or bear market (like 2022) Year 3: A period of accumulation or recovery (like 2023–2024) Year 4: A breakout and strong rally (2025) 2026 — The Bitcoin Bear Market Based on this chart, next year won’t be as fun. Rekt Capital warns that 2026 is likely to bring a bear market. Prices could drop sharply, and many investors who enter too late may face losses. This is the part of the cycle when emotions run high, and only smart planning can help you survive the dip. 2027 — The Bottoming Out Phase By 2027, the worst of the bear market should be over. This is when Bitcoin usually hits its lowest point before gearing up for the next big run. If you missed the 2025 bull party, 2027 might be your next best chance to get in early for the next cycle.

According to a letter sent to the Southern District of New York (SDNY) filed today, the prosecutors mentioned that they did not withhold exculpatory evidence. In the letter, the prosecutors also urged the judge to deny any request by Samourai for a late hearing to discuss the late disclosure of key information they obtained from the FinCEN two years ago. Earlier in the week, Samourai had sent their letter to the judge, alleging that they had learned that FinCEN had strongly suggested that Samourai Wallet was not acting as a money-transmitting business. In the letter, they said that it was mainly down to the noncustodial nature of the product in a discussion between certain FinCEN members and the prosecutors on August 23, 2023. Prosecutors deny violating the Brady Rule in the Samourai Wallet case This new information came to light after the defense submitted a Brady motion . This motion was named after the Brady v. Maryland Supreme Court case, which occurred in 1963. The case established the Brady rule, which mentioned that exculpatory evidence should be provided to the defense so it can be used as part of the due process. In this case, the defense felt that the evidence was hidden, causing the need for a new hearing. Also, since one of the two charges against the Samourai Wallet developers is conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business, some people felt this new information might be grounds to dismiss the entire case. However, in the letter, the investigators specifically mentioned that they have no intentions of dropping the case. They also feel the defense has no special basis to demand a new hearing. “There is no basis for a hearing, nor is there anything to remedy: the disclosure itself shows that the government has not violated Brady,” the prosecutors stated in the letter. “The Government disclosed all known substantive communications between the prosecution team and FinCEN months in advance of pretrial motions and trial.” The prosecutors also added that they want to go ahead with the case, noting that they are going to include a second charge, which is conspiracy to commit money laundering. In their letter, they mentioned that Samourai helped launder over $100 million of criminal proceeds originating from questionable sources, including illegal darkweb markets like Silk Road and Hydra Market. They also added that they moved funds associated with wire fraud, computer fraud, and schemes that stole funds from their victims, including phishing and other schemes to defraud multiple decentralized finance protocols. Prosecutors play down input from FinCEN communications The prosecutors also mentioned that the fact that they recently disclosed their communication with FinCEN is irrelevant to the case, adding that much of the charged conduct does not rely on FinCEN regulations. They downplayed the importance of the details shared by the FinCEN employees who spoke to the prosecutors. Kevin O’conner, Chief of FinCEN’s Virtual Assets and Emerging Technology Section in the Enforcement and Compliance Division, and Lorena Valente, an employee of FinCEN’s Policy Division, spoke with the prosecutors. According to the prosecutors, the input from O’Connor and Valente was based on their individual processes, noting that they already provided “substantive email correspondence between the prosecution team and members of FinCEN relating to the August 23, 2023, call.” “The individual employees of FinCEN were not speaking on behalf of FinCEN, they were not providing FinCEN’s opinion, and they did not have a sense of what FinCEN would decide if this question were presented to their FinCEN policy committee,” they added. In the letter’s final section, the prosecutors denied violating legal norms. “The record shows that there was no Brady violation in this case,” wrote the prosecutors. “The government disclosed the contents of this informal conversation to the defense in advance of pretrial motions and approximately seven months in advance of trial in response to a request for that information,” they added. “Nothing more is required.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Lido DAO contributors published an outline proposal on May 8, describing it as a work that has been years in the making. According to the post announcing the proposal, Dual Governance is a dynamic mechanism that allows staked ETH (stETH) holders on Lido to be involved in the governance of the Lido ecosystem. The Lido DAO is responsible for the governance of the Lido ecosystem, meaning only those who hold the native LDO tokens can vote on any changes to the protocol. This has disenfranchised ETH stakers who, despite being crucial to the protocol, do not have a say in the decisions that may also affect them. Dual Governance will change that by allowing stETH holders to actively voice their dissent to any motion DAO governance on Lido that they are unsatisfied with. In such situations, the new mechanism allows them to use the threat of withdrawing their stETH tokens from Lido as a bargaining chip to get the Lido DAO to reconsider decisions. The protocol describes the proposed governance model as a way to de-escalate conflicts between the protocol stakeholders. Works on the proposal have been ongoing since as far back as 2022, with Lido lead developer at the time, Sam Kozin , noting that the dual governance process is all about aligning incentives between all participants. Lido Dual Governance mechanism explained Meanwhile, the Dual Governance Proposal, known officially as Lido Improvement Proposal (LIP) 28, explains how it will work in detail. According to the post, the model introduces a timelock contract between Lid DAO governance motions and execution with the timelock connected to an escrow. When there is a motion that the stETH holders do not support, they can communicate their intention to exit the protocol by depositing their stETH, wstETH, and stETH withdrawal NFTs into a specific escrow contract. If the funds deposited in the contract reach a first threshold, the duration of the timelock will start growing proportionately to the amount deposited. Once the locked funds reach the second threshold, the rage quit mechanism is triggered, which blocks the execution of any motion under Dual Governance until the stakers withdraw their stETH into ETH. For the first threshold, Lido DAO has proposed to be 1% of the Lido total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum, while the second threshold is currently set at 10% of Lido on Ethereum TVL. Beyond the percentage required to trigger the model, the proposal also includes parameters such as minimum or maximum hours or days required before any step would be taken. For example, a proposal held in Dual Governance must be there for a minimum of 3 days before execution, while the minimum duration of the dynamic timelock is 5 days as long so far the shares of stETH locked are higher than the first threshold. Ethereum stakeholders praise Lido’s proposal as LDO sees a rise in value Meanwhile, the proposal has attracted positive reactions from many in the Ethereum community who believe it represents a great step for Lido and Ethereum by mitigating governance risks for the protocol on Ethereum. Lido is the second biggest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, with $21.48 billion in TVL, mostly on Ethereum. According to Flashbots strategy lead Hasu , this proposal is the most important Lido upgrade ever. Ethereum developer Tim Beiko also congratulated the Lido Team on the proposal, even though the date for implementation remains unknown. With Lido set for an upgrade, its native token, LDO, has also seen massively positive performance in the last seven days with over 19% gains. It is up 8.66% in the last 24 hours and trades at $1.02. However, it remains down 43.31% year-to-date. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The Bitcoin 2025 event, scheduled for May 28 in Las Vegas, will host Vance on stage in person — a move that echoes President Donald Trump’s own appearance at Bitcoin 2024 while he was still a candidate. The announcement, made by event organizers on May 9, signals a continued intertwining of American politics and the cryptocurrency world. Vance, who reportedly holds between $250,000 and $500,000 in Bitcoin, according to his August 2024 financial disclosure, has thus far maintained a low profile on crypto-related policy issues since taking office in January. While the Trump administration has pushed forward with executive orders related to stablecoin regulation and the creation of a national crypto reserve, Vance has primarily focused on artificial intelligence oversight. Crypto and Campaigns: A Complicated Relationship The announcement comes during a politically charged week, with Democratic lawmakers sharpening their criticism of President Trump’s ties to the crypto space . Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, who are both involved with the controversial crypto platform World Liberty Financial, are also slated to speak at the Bitcoin 2025 event. Their involvement — and the platform’s issuance of the USD1 stablecoin — has drawn accusations of self-enrichment and conflict of interest from opponents on Capitol Hill. In Congress, Representative Maxine Waters led efforts to block a hearing on a crypto market structure bill, citing concerns over “Trump’s crypto corruption.” Meanwhile, in the Senate, nine Democrats prevented a vote on a key stablecoin bill, citing inadequate protections and insinuating that the Trump family’s growing influence in the crypto sector is skewing legislative priorities. What to Expect from Vance Speech While no details have emerged regarding the content of Vance’s upcoming remarks, industry observers are closely watching. If the vice president addresses regulation, innovation, or economic freedom in his speech, it could mark a significant pivot in how the administration communicates with the crypto community. It could also simply reinforce the narrative that crypto has become a central talking point in the 2025 political cycle. Either way, the eyes of both Wall Street and Washington will be on Las Vegas later this month.

As Bitcoin surged, a wave of holders without long-term conviction took the opportunity to cash out. But there’s a twist. A new group of investors, including those entering through ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies, are stepping in. Could they be the key to Bitcoin’s next breakout? Here’s what Saylor has to say. Short-Term Mindset Fuels the Sell-Off Michael Saylor, the founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), didn’t hold back when discussing the current market dynamics. Speaking with Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast, Saylor explained that many Bitcoin holders, especially those like governments, lawyers, and bankruptcy trustees, lack the “10-year investor mindset.” When Bitcoin’s price surged, these short-term holders saw an opportunity to liquidate, which has created space for new investors with a more long-term outlook. “I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said. “Non-economically interested parties are rotating out, while new investors are coming in.” In a market where volatility is constant, short-term panic sellers often react to price drops, adding to the challenge. It’s a cycle that can hurt Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory. Strategy’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off (Despite the Rollercoaster) For Strategy, it’s been a ride of highs and lows, but they’ve stuck to their plan. With 555,450 BTC valued at around $57.54 billion, the company’s Bitcoin holdings are now 50.27% above their average purchase price of $68,569. This long-term strategy has paid off, even as Bitcoin fluctuates between highs of $109,000 (reached on January 20) and dips as low as $76,273 (by April 9). Despite the dip, Bitcoin has shown signs of recovery, hitting $100,000 on May 8. Saylor, ever the optimist, sees the current market conditions as a great opportunity for those willing to weather the volatility. And he’s right: Bitcoin’s price may bounce around, but Strategy’s continued commitment to holding shows their confidence in its long-term value. U.S. Government’s Surprising Embrace of Bitcoin Perhaps one of the most surprising developments has been the U.S. government’s growing embrace of Bitcoin. Despite a historically cautious stance, the U.S. government has taken significant steps to support Bitcoin, including the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, signed into law by President Trump on March 7. Saylor, who has long been bullish on Bitcoin, admitted he was surprised at how quickly the U.S. government embraced Bitcoin after Trump’s inauguration “I was surprised the U.S. embraced Bitcoin as radically as it has,” he said. The Road Ahead: Will Bitcoin Hit $1 Million? Looking ahead, Saylor remains confident about Bitcoin’s future. He has made bold predictions before, and he stands by them. Saylor believes Bitcoin could hit $1 million within the next five years, driven by growing institutional interest, clearer regulations, and a shift in investor mindset. Of course, this future depends largely on how the market responds to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility.

He emphasized its price movement within the established Bull Market Support Band (BMSB). As of May 5, 2025, EGRAG CRYPTO reports that there have been no significant changes in XRP’s price trend since April 30. According to the analyst, “the market continues to hold within the established support zone,” reflecting a period of short-term stagnation. #XRP — Bull Market Support Band (UPDATED) Close three days above or below: Above $2.41 — #BULLISH Below $2.15 — #Bearish Anything in between? Just micro noise! #XRPFamily Together We Rise , MACRO TARGETS STILL THE SAME pic.twitter.com/AvUtARqrbF — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 8, 2025 Support Band Parameters and Market Implications The support band is defined by two key levels. The upper boundary is at $2.41, while the lower boundary is set at $2.15. XRP is trading at $2.29. The digital asset has been rising since Donald Trump’s recent announcement . The asset is trading within the key boundary levels, and the analyst identifies this range as a critical area that distinguishes between bullish and bearish momentum in the short term. A close above the $2.41 threshold would indicate strong bullish sentiment, whereas a decline below $2.15 would be interpreted as a bearish reversal. Current Market Conditions and Observations Despite the narrow range, EGRAG CRYPTO emphasizes that XRP remains stable, with no disruptions to the broader market outlook. His analysis predicts short-term behavior, and the digital asset’s long-term perspective remains positive as experts predict massive breakouts . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The chart shows that XRP has experienced minor fluctuations around the support levels over the past few weeks. The asset has seen brief touches near the lower bound and modest rebounds, but none have resulted in a sustained directional breakout. Its position is visibly constrained within the BMSB . The price hovers near the midsection of the support zone, suggesting a temporary equilibrium between buying and selling pressure. Next Support Level and Cautionary Outlook Should XRP begin to close below $2.14 consistently, EGRAG CRYPTO identifies $1.90 as the next critical level to monitor. This level would act either as a point of price retest or serve to reaffirm the previous support. For now, EGRAG CRYPTO advises that XRP remains within the valid boundaries of the BMSB and states that “no significant deviations to report” have occurred. If the asset falls, it could rebound to $1.9 and begin building toward another breakout. If it breaks above $2.41, that gives the asset the boost the community has been anticipating, and we could see the asset finally cross $3 again soon.

After all, new BTC is mined every day, and none is being destroyed in the traditional sense of the word, which is the opposite of deflationary. However, CryptoQuant’s CEO explained how Strategy and its co-founder, and BTC champion, Michael Saylor, made bitcoin into a deflationary asset. Is BTC Deflationary? By definition, deflationary means that the asset’s supply is designed to decrease over time. So, by that explanation, the newly minted BTC every day (currently ~450 BTC/day) does not put the cryptocurrency into that category. Someone would argue that BNB should be there since it has a burning mechanism to reduce the overall supply from 200,000 to 100,000. Ethereum also made some progress on that matter, but that’s a different and rather controversial topic (and it doesn’t really work as promised, at least not always). In BTC’s case, though, there’s one big (un)spoken hero who deserves a big “thank you” from Bitcoin Maxis, according to CryptoQuant’s chief exec, Ki Young Ju (even though he deleted the original post with the thank you note). In the updated one, he explained that Michael Saylor, through the company he co-founded, has turned Bitcoin into a deflationary asset because the entity is “buying BTC faster than it’s mined.” CQ’s CEO determined that Strategy’s strategy (yeah, we get how it sounds) not to sell at any cost has turned its massive stash of over 555,000 BTC into an illiquid supply. This means that MSTR’s holdings are equal to -2.23% annual deflation rate for bitcoin. The percentage could be even higher when we examine other “stable institutional holders” who have incorporated the HODL strategy. #Bitcoin is deflationary. @Strategy is buying BTC faster than it’s mined. Their 555K BTC is illiquid with no plans to sell. MSTR’s holdings alone mean a -2.23% annual deflation rate—likely higher with other stable institutional holders. pic.twitter.com/9VKT3IdcYo — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) May 10, 2025 555,450 and Counting The company began its massive accumulation spree in September 2020 when it was called MicroStrategy and Saylor was still CEO. At a time when bitcoin was fighting to stay above $10,000 (yes, one zero less than now), the NASDAQ-listed business intelligence software firm bought 21,454 BTC via 78,388 off-chain transactions. In the following year, the cryptocurrency’s price skyrocketed to an all-time high of almost $70,000. The company kept buying. Then, the asset plunged deep below $20,000 following the FTX crash as well as many other industry blow-offs. The firm continued accumulating, even though its stash was now well in the red. The 2024 US elections only strengthened Strategy’s conviction, and the firm now owns 555,450 BTC , valued at almost $58 billion at current prices.

That’s what the White House told reporters on Friday, just hours after the president threw out the idea of reducing the brutal 145% tariff rate to 80%. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “That was a number the president threw out there, and we’ll see what happens this weekend.” She made it clear nothing’s changing unless the Chinese side comes to the table with real concessions. This is happening as top officials from both countries are heading to Geneva for talks this Saturday and Sunday. These will be the first face-to-face meetings since Trump pushed US tariffs on Chinese imports up to 145%, and China hit back with a 125% rate on American goods. That back-and-forth has slammed the brakes on trade between the two biggest economies on earth, and now there’s a real fear that this mess could drag everyone into a wider economic crash. Talks begin with both sides digging in Even though both governments are walking into the room, no one expects some big breakthrough. It took weeks just to agree to meet, and right now, the goal seems to be figuring out where to even begin. The vibe isn’t friendly. It’s tactical. No one wants to look like they gave in first. “Neither side wants to appear to be backing down,” said Stephen Olson, who used to be a trade negotiator for the US and now works as a senior visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. “The talks are taking place now because both countries have judged that they can move forward without appearing to have caved into the other side.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters on Wednesday that the meeting is only happening because Washington requested it. The Commerce Ministry backed that up, saying the talks are a response to pressure from American companies and buyers. But Trump isn’t having any of that. At the White House this week, he pushed back hard. “They said we initiated? Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files,” he said. In his view, it’s China that wants a deal because, according to him, “their economy is collapsing.” Still, the damage from the tariffs is obvious on both sides. Chinese factories have slowed down. Official data shows manufacturing output fell to its lowest level since December 2023, and Caixin’s latest survey says services are at a seven-month low. The BBC reported that Chinese exporters are stuck with stockpiles sitting in warehouses while they scramble to find buyers outside the US. American industries and voters feel the pain Trump says the tariffs will make America stronger in the long run, but he’s also admitted they’re going to hurt. He told his cabinet that US kids “may have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,” and those two might cost a few bucks more. A toy company owner in Los Angeles told the BBC that their business is staring down the “total implosion of the supply chain.” And it’s not just toys. Across multiple industries, companies that rely on parts or goods from China are reporting shortages, rising costs, and delayed deliveries. Over in Beijing, officials waited until the long May Day holiday ended before agreeing to sit down. Bert Hofman, a professor at the National University of Singapore, said, “I think [China] realises that a deal is better than no deal.” He added, “So they’ve taken a pragmatic view and said, ‘OK, well, we need to get these talks going.’” Meanwhile, the US economy just shrank for the first time in three years. That’s not something the Trump administration can spin away easily. His approval numbers have slipped, with more than 60% of Americans saying he’s putting too much focus on tariffs. The fear of inflation and another recession is growing, and the White House knows it. Sadly, it doesn’t care very much. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

At the same time, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drop continues, falling another 10%, though signs of quiet accumulation are appearing beneath the surface. Both ETH and SHIB are attempting to stabilize, but one project has already taken major steps forward. BlockDAG (BDAG) has successfully passed its CertiK audit, positioning it for launch. With $233.5 million raised and 19.9 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is gaining serious traction as a top decentralized crypto pick. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Drop Sparks Accumulation Interest The recent Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drop has pushed the token down another 10%, now trading near $0.000012. Despite the decline, several indicators suggest accumulation may be underway. The Chaikin Money Flow index points to growing inflows, while a negative Network Realized Profit/Loss value implies that many holders are avoiding selling at a loss. SHIB’s technicals also hint at a possible rebound. A bullish divergence is forming, and futures funding rates remain positive, suggesting a leaning toward long positions. If SHIB can reclaim the 20-day EMA and build some momentum, a short-term bounce to $0.000014 could follow. Ethereum (ETH) Bullish Signal Builds as Support Is Reclaimed A fresh Ethereum (ETH) bullish signal has emerged after the price bounced back above a key support level. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe views this move as a critical moment, reflecting renewed buyer interest and the potential for upward momentum. The recent dip followed by a swift recovery is seen as a positive shift. The next target is $2,100, and many investors are now watching closely for confirmation. The Ethereum (ETH) bullish signal is based on a pattern where regained support often leads to further gains, signaling a stronger short-term outlook for ETH. BlockDAG Secures CertiK Approval & Prepares for Exchange Listings BlockDAG has reached a major turning point with its CertiK audit now officially complete. As the second security check following Halborn’s review, this double-audit approach confirms BlockDAG’s focus on both safety and readiness. Most presale projects don’t go this far before launch. CertiK ’s stamp of approval does more than verify security, it signals that BlockDAG is nearly ready to hit exchanges. This transition from presale to public listing is generating excitement, especially with the team expected to announce 10 exchange partnerships soon. Buyers are responding. The current Batch 28 still offers BDAG at $0.0019, far below its original price of $0.0262 and the confirmed $0.05 listing rate. That gives early participants a projected 2,531% return. The discounted offer remains open until May 13. BlockDAG has already sold over 19.9 billion coins and raised $233.5 million in presale funding. For those tracking the top decentralized crypto contenders, this level of verification and market preparation stands out. CertiK’s audit marks the beginning of BlockDAG’s move into active trading. Key Highlights The Ethereum (ETH) bullish signal reflects renewed energy in the market, with ETH holding key support and pointing to a potential recovery. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drop continues to pressure holders, even as some data hints at quiet strength building. BlockDAG is moving at a different pace. With back-to-back audits from Halborn and CertiK, the project isn’t just making claims, it’s delivering verifiable progress. As exchange announcements approach and the presale window narrows, more buyers are paying attention. At $0.0019 until May 13, and with a 2,531% ROI built in at launch, BlockDAG offers a rare combination of clarity, timing, and trust. Among today’s top decentralized crypto projects, few have taken steps this precise, and that makes all the difference.

The catalyst: Crypto.com’s rollout of XRP payment support at gas stations throughout the United Arab Emirates. The announcement follows a broader movement by Crypto.com to integrate digital assets into real-world use cases across the region. What distinguishes this deployment is the asset’s unique regulatory status. Breaking News: Crypto com is rolling out $XRP payment support at gas stations across the UAE! Notably, XRP stands as the only cryptocurrency licensed by UAE’s VARA — a major regulatory milestone. This move signals a bullish trend for XRP and broader crypto adoption in the… pic.twitter.com/HR4ri3mPXB — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) May 8, 2025 XRP is the only cryptocurrency licensed by the UAE’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). This positioning gives a distinct advantage in a market where regulatory clarity is often lacking. Integrating XRP into fuel payments marks a significant evolution in the practical utility of digital currencies in the Gulf. The UAE, particularly Dubai, has been positioning itself as a global hub for blockchain and crypto innovation. Crypto.com’s selection of XRP for this rollout reflects technical confidence in the network and strategic alignment with the country’s regulatory environment. XRP’s Global Expansion Brett noted that this move signals how far the digital asset has come and emphasized its relevance in the region’s maturing crypto infrastructure. XRP’s recognition by VARA underlines its status as a tradable asset and a compliant and functional tool for payment solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The decision to support XRP payments at fuel stations contributes to increasing the visibility and legitimacy of crypto in everyday transactions, where most projects have struggled to gain ground. XRP adoption has been expanding as Ripple continues to partner with institutions worldwide. The company recently expanded its services with a strategic partnership in South Korea . With Crypto.com’s support in the UAE, the digital asset could see a significant increase in adoption in the coming months. What’s Next for XRP? In regulatory terms, XRP’s VARA licensing is a pivotal differentiator. While many cryptocurrencies face scrutiny and uncertain status in various jurisdictions, XRP’s acceptance by a key Middle Eastern regulatory body positions it as a trusted entity for further integrations. It also reinforces the perception of the asset’s long-term viability and adaptability in a regulated market. XRP’s journey into the UAE began years ago when it received approval from the DIFC , opening up access to 72 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. While other digital assets remain in limbo regarding legal classification, XRP has been making history, and it recently got its first ETF approved in Brazil . Its licensed status in the UAE gives businesses confidence to proceed with integration. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

44420577,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159257,1746875416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Stablecoin Regulation: GENIUS Act’s Dramatic Expansion to Foreign Issuers,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/genius-act-stablecoin-regulation/,"The landscape of Stablecoin Regulation in the United States is constantly shifting, and a recent development surrounding the GENIUS Act highlights just how far regulators might be willing to reach. While the initial version of this Senate bill, aimed at creating a framework for stablecoins, reportedly failed to advance to formal debate, a revised version has emerged, revealing significant changes that could send ripples through the global crypto market. What’s New in the Revised GENIUS Act? The most striking revision in the updated GENIUS Act is its ambitious expansion of U.S. regulatory oversight. Previously focused primarily on domestic entities, the bill now seeks to exert jurisdiction over Foreign Stablecoins issuers. What does this mean in practice? If a foreign stablecoin issuer, like the widely used Tether, provides services to users in the United States, they would be required to comply with U.S. law under this proposed legislation. This marks a significant potential shift, demanding that global players adhere to American rules if they wish to operate within the U.S. market or serve U.S. persons. Beyond foreign issuers, the revised bill also broadens the definition of “digital asset service providers.” This expanded scope now includes entities previously thought to be outside traditional financial regulation: Developers: Those writing the code for protocols or applications. Validator Nodes: Participants confirming transactions on certain blockchain networks. Self-Custody Wallet Operators: Providers of software or hardware that allows users to hold their own private keys. By classifying these entities as service providers, the bill aims to subject them to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligations. This could introduce complex compliance burdens for participants in the decentralized ecosystem. How Could This Impact the DeFi Ecosystem? The provisions targeting developers, validators, and self-custody wallet operators are particularly relevant for the DeFi Regulation discussion. DeFi protocols are designed to operate without central intermediaries. Imposing AML requirements on decentralized components challenges the core ethos of decentralization. Consider the implications: Challenges for DeFi: Identity vs. Anonymity: AML typically requires Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. How do you apply KYC to a validator node or a piece of open-source code? Responsibility: Who is responsible for implementing AML in a decentralized protocol? The original developers? The current users? The validators? This is a complex legal and technical question. Innovation: Will the burden of compliance stifle innovation in the U.S. DeFi space, potentially driving development offshore? While the bill’s intent might be to mitigate risks associated with illicit finance, the proposed methods raise significant questions about their feasibility and impact on decentralized technologies. What Key Provisions Remain from Earlier Drafts? Despite the significant revisions, the revised GENIUS Act retains foundational elements seen in earlier versions, reinforcing a consistent regulatory philosophy: Licensing Requirements: Issuers would likely need to obtain specific licenses to operate. Full Reserve Backing: Stablecoins would need to be backed by reserves equal to their value, held in safe and liquid assets. Mandatory Disclosures: Issuers would be required to provide clear information about their reserves, operations, and risks. These provisions aim to ensure stablecoin stability and transparency, addressing concerns about potential runs or lack of clarity regarding backing assets. What Are the Legislative Hurdles for the GENIUS Act? According to reports, the GENIUS Act is currently backed solely by Republican senators. In the U.S. legislative system, particularly in the Senate, passing significant bills often requires bipartisan support to overcome procedural hurdles like filibusters. The lack of Democratic co-sponsorship could be a major obstacle to the bill’s progress. However, it remains a prominent proposal and signals the direction some lawmakers wish to take regarding US Crypto Regulation . The ideas within the bill could influence future bipartisan efforts or serve as a starting point for negotiations on stablecoin legislation. Potential Paths Forward: Even without immediate bipartisan support, the concepts introduced in the GENIUS Act could resurface: They might be incorporated into broader financial regulatory bills. They could influence discussions within regulatory bodies like the Treasury or SEC. They could pressure Democratic lawmakers to propose alternative stablecoin frameworks that address similar concerns about foreign issuers and DeFi. The debate around stablecoin regulation is far from over, and the revised GENIUS Act ensures that topics like the oversight of foreign issuers and the regulation of decentralized components remain central to the conversation. What Does This Mean for You? Whether you are a stablecoin user, a DeFi participant, a developer, or simply an observer of the crypto space, these proposed regulations are important: For Users: Increased regulation could potentially lead to more stable and transparent stablecoins, but also limit access to certain foreign-issued stablecoins or DeFi protocols. For Issuers (especially foreign): Compliance with U.S. law could become a necessity to serve the U.S. market, requiring significant operational changes. For DeFi Participants: The regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) around developers, validators, and wallets will shape the future development and use of decentralized applications in the U.S. Staying informed about these legislative developments is crucial as they have the potential to reshape how digital assets are used and regulated in one of the world’s largest economies. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Stablecoin Oversight The revised GENIUS Act, while facing legislative challenges, offers a compelling look into the potential future of Stablecoin Regulation in the United States. Its dramatic expansion of oversight to include foreign issuers and its attempt to bring decentralized components under AML obligations signal a strong desire among some lawmakers to broaden the reach of US Crypto Regulation . While the path to becoming law is uncertain, the principles laid out in this version of the GENIUS Act are likely to heavily influence future debates and regulatory frameworks concerning Foreign Stablecoins and the broader DeFi Regulation landscape. The industry and users alike must pay close attention as these proposals could fundamentally alter the global digital asset ecosystem.

44420883,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159258,1746876020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock Insights: Crypto Fear and Greed Index Holds Strong in Greed Zone at 70,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-greed-6/,"Ever wonder what the collective mood of the crypto market is? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index offers a fascinating snapshot. As of May 9th, this key indicator stands at 70, registering a slight dip of three points from the previous day’s 73. Despite this small shift, the index firmly remains within the ‘Greed’ zone, signaling continued positive sentiment among market participants. But what exactly does this mean for you and your crypto holdings? What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? At its core, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a tool designed to visualize the dominant emotions driving the cryptocurrency market at any given time. Think of it as a sentiment meter for digital assets. Provided by Alternative.me, the index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear (Investors are very worried, potentially overselling) 25-49: Fear (Market anxiety is present) 50: Neutral (Sentiment is balanced) 51-74: Greed (Investors are optimistic, potentially buying aggressively) 75-100: Extreme Greed (Market is likely overheating, potential for correction) Understanding what is fear and greed index helps investors gauge whether the market is being driven by irrational exuberance (greed) or irrational panic (fear). Historically, extreme fear can signal a potential buying opportunity, while extreme greed might suggest the market is due for a pullback. Breaking Down the Index: How is Crypto Market Sentiment Measured? Measuring something as complex as crypto market sentiment isn’t based on a single factor. The index aggregates data from six key sources, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive view: Let’s look at the components: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average values. High volatility often signals a fearful market. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): This compares the current market volume and momentum to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts on platforms like Twitter. A rapid increase in posts mentioning specific coins, combined with specific hashtags, can indicate growing interest and potentially FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), which aligns with greed. Surveys (15%): Polls users to gather their sentiment (though currently paused). High participation and bullish responses indicate greed. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear (as investors move from altcoins to BTC, seen as safer), while decreasing dominance might signal increasing greed (as investors speculate on altcoins). This factor helps inform the overall Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index perspective. Google Trends (10%): Looks at search queries related to Bitcoin (and sometimes other major cryptos). Rising search interest for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” suggests fear, while searches like “buy Bitcoin” or related queries at peak prices might indicate greed. By combining these factors, the index provides a weighted average, giving us the single number that reflects the overall market mood. The Current Picture: Why is the Index at 70 (Greed)? With the Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently sitting at 70, the message is clear: optimism is high. A reading in the ‘Greed’ zone (51-74) indicates that market participants are feeling confident, potentially driven by recent price increases, positive news, or anticipation of favorable events. The fact that it dipped slightly from 73 to 70 suggests a minor cooling off, but not enough to shift the overall sentiment category. This level of greed often correlates with upward price trends, as more people are willing to buy, pushing prices higher. What Does a High Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index Mean for You? While the index reflects overall crypto sentiment, it is heavily influenced by Bitcoin, given its market dominance. A high Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index reading suggests that the flagship cryptocurrency is experiencing significant positive sentiment. For investors, this can mean: Confirmation of Bullish Trend: High greed often occurs during upward price movements. Potential for Overheating: While not a direct sell signal, extended periods in extreme greed can precede corrections. Increased Volatility: Markets driven by strong emotions can experience sharper swings. It’s a reminder to proceed with caution and not get swept up entirely by the market’s enthusiasm. Using the Index for Crypto Market Analysis: Benefits and Challenges Incorporating the Fear and Greed Index into your crypto market analysis can offer valuable perspective. Its main benefits include: Quick Sentiment Snapshot: Provides an easy-to-understand visual of the market mood. Counter-Emotional Trading: Helps identify when your own emotions might be aligning too closely with the prevailing market sentiment (e.g., feeling extreme greed when the index is high). Historical Context: Can be compared to past market cycles to see how sentiment correlated with price tops and bottoms. However, it’s crucial to recognize its limitations: Not a Trading Signal: The index itself doesn’t tell you when to buy or sell. It’s a sentiment indicator, not a technical analysis tool. Lagging Indicator: Sentiment can sometimes follow price action rather than predict it. Simplified View: It aggregates complex data into one number and doesn’t capture nuances within different crypto assets. Therefore, it’s best used as one tool among many in your analytical arsenal. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Greed Zone Given the index is currently in the ‘Greed’ zone at 70, here are a few actionable insights: Stay Grounded: Avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on market excitement or FOMO. Stick to your investment plan. Review Your Positions: High greed periods can be a good time to re-evaluate your portfolio, perhaps taking some profits if you have reached your targets. Increase Caution: Be aware that a market fueled by greed can be more susceptible to sharp pullbacks. Consider setting stop-losses or reducing leverage if trading. Focus on Fundamentals: Don’t let the market sentiment distract you from the underlying technology and long-term potential of the projects you invest in. Conclusion The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , currently holding strong at 70 in the ‘Greed’ zone, offers valuable insight into the prevailing mood of the crypto market. While this optimism reflects positive price action and enthusiasm, it also serves as a reminder that sentiment can shift rapidly. By understanding what is fear and greed index and how its components measure crypto market sentiment , investors can gain perspective beyond just price charts.

The deal does not reduce the overall 10% tariff rate that Trump imposed back in April. Nothing has really changed—except a few favors carved out for luxury cars and airplane parts. According to CNN’s full breakdown of the announcement, this deal is already being treated as a win by Wall Street and the administration, even though it leaves global supply chains frozen and American businesses stranded. Trump’s team declared the agreement a “very big and exciting day.” They held a press event in the Oval Office, where UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined in over speakerphone. Keir wasn’t even in Washington. Trump had called him at the last minute, what the British ambassador described as “a very typical, 11th-hour intervention.” The British side said the arrangement was “historic,” although Keir’s tone was so flat it might as well have been automated. Even so, the UK agreed to it—because, as Keir put it, “The question you should be asking is: Is it better than where we were yesterday?” Trump cuts car tax but leaves global tariffs untouched Under this new agreement, the US will not increase its baseline 10% tariff on British imports. That rate stays exactly where it was on April 2. The only real changes are some custom adjustments for UK industries. British luxury cars, including Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar, and Bentley, were going to be taxed at 27.5%, but now they’ll only face 10%. These changes do not apply to other consumer goods. British aerospace companies can now send aircraft parts to the US without paying any tariffs. In return, British Airways is expected to purchase 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, a detail confirmed by Bloomberg. On steel and aluminum, both sides agreed to scrap taxes completely, though no quantities or enforcement mechanisms were announced. In agriculture, both countries granted each other tariff-free exports on beef and other unnamed farm products. However, no timelines or export limits were disclosed. The officials from both countries made it clear: the details of the so-called “comprehensive” agreement are still being negotiated. Chief economist at RSM, Joe Brusuelas, responded on social media, “A trade agreement where the details are still being negotiated is not an agreement. This does not provide the clarity necessary to lift the fog of uncertainty created by a trade war of choice.” Despite this, US markets rallied. Investors reacted to the White House’s tone, interpreting it as a sign that Trump might slow down the economic destruction his tariffs have caused. But there’s no sign of real change. The US-UK trade relationship only represents 3% of total US trade. That’s a sliver compared to the China trade freeze, which still hasn’t moved an inch since Trump imposed 145% tariffs on most imports. Global businesses still locked out while Trump celebrates On the same day, the UK deal was announced, Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, reminded the public that the rest of the world is still stuck behind Trump’s wall. “Overwhelmingly, the most important fact about today’s trade deal is that the 10% across-the-board tariffs are staying,” Justin said online. “Tiny tweaks here and there with some trading partners won’t change that. The US is a high tariff country for the foreseeable future, and the trade war continues.” Before Trump returned to office, the average effective tariff rate was 2.5%. It’s now 22%, the highest in over a century. Thursday’s deal does not change that. It just puts a few extra Bentleys on American roads and some Dreamliners in the air. Even the White House knows the rest of the global trade grid is in worse shape. The US and China are set to meet this weekend in Geneva, but there’s no optimism. The best Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could say was he’s hoping for “de-escalation.” So while Trump calls this a “very big and exciting day,” global exporters, manufacturers, and crypto-linked trade ecosystems are still jammed. This “deal” is a receipt, not a product. And the rest of the world is stuck waiting for real terms that may never come.

This amendment intends to broaden American regulatory oversight to foreign stablecoin issuers within the U.S. financial ecosystem. The news was highlighted by Whale Insider on X, drawing considerable attention from the crypto community. JUST IN: $USDT issuer Tether to be brought under U.S. jurisdiction, regardless of where it is based, according to newest version of GENIUS stablecoin bill. pic.twitter.com/0MQndZwQ4t — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) May 9, 2025 Background on the GENIUS Act The GENIUS Act requires stablecoins to be fully backed 1:1 with U.S. dollars or approved liquid assets, aiming to create a robust regulatory framework. The GENIUS Act also mandates transparent redemption policies and stablecoin price stability relative to the U.S. dollar. The Act delineates federal standards for permitted payment stablecoin issuers, including requirements for fully backed reserves, segregation of reserves, monthly certification, and compliance with capital and liquidity standards. Challenges and Revisions Despite its initial bipartisan support , the GENIUS Act faced hurdles in the Senate. The bill stalled on May 8, 2025, amid concerns about regulating foreign stablecoins and strengthening anti-money-laundering provisions. Democrats expressed heightened concerns following revelations about World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm linked to President Donald Trump , planning to use its stablecoin in a $2 billion deal with an Abu Dhabi investment firm for Binance. Senator Mark Warner, who had previously supported the bill, withdrew his backing, citing unfinished legislative text. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for Tether and the Crypto Industry The revised GENIUS Act’s provision to bring foreign-based stablecoin issuers like Tether under U.S. jurisdiction signifies a move towards stricter regulatory oversight. This could have far-reaching implications for the crypto industry, potentially setting a precedent for how the U.S. regulates foreign entities operating within its financial system. For Tether, this means adhering to U.S. regulatory standards, including compliance with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer requirements, regardless of its operational base. Looking Ahead As the amended GENIUS Act is presented to the Senate, its progress will be closely monitored by stakeholders across the financial and crypto sectors. The outcome will affect Tether and influence the regulatory landscape for other stablecoin issuers and the broader cryptocurrency market.

A group of Senate Democrats has sent a letter to the heads of the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department, expressing alarm over Donald Trump’s deepening ties with the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. According to a Bloomberg report published May 9, the senators asked Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to provide an update on Binance’s compliance with the terms of its November settlement with US authorities. Under that agreement, Binance paid billions in penalties to the Justice Department, Treasury, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, stepped down from his position. Presidential Interests in the Crypto Sector Since Trump’s victory in the most recent presidential election, many lawmakers have accused him of corruption, pointing to his personal profits from cryptocurrency while having the power to influence industry laws and regulations. Trump launched his own memecoin, which generates millions of dollars in transaction fees, and offered top token holders the chance to attend an exclusive dinner in Washington, DC. Additionally, his family-backed crypto project, World Liberty Financial, recently announced that an Abu Dhabi investment firm plans to invest a substantial sum in Binance using the USD1 stablecoin, which is associated with the Trump family. “Our concerns about Binance’s compliance obligations are even more pressing given recent reports that the company is using the Trump family’s stablecoin to partner with foreign investment companies,” the senators wrote, as quoted by Bloomberg. Stablecoin Bill Vote Blocked The letter was sent less than a day after some of the same senators blocked a key vote on the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who reportedly signed the letter and opposed advancing the bill, stated that the Senate should not “enable this kind of corruption” by Trump. Treasury Secretary Bessent commented that the Senate “missed an opportunity” by not passing the stablecoin bill but did not directly address questions about Trump’s crypto interests. It remains unclear if or when the chamber will reconsider the legislation. Questionable Presidential Assets A report from the nonpartisan group State Democracy Defenders Action indicated that a significant portion of Trump’s net worth is tied to cryptocurrencies. The group noted that the GENIUS Act, in its current form, would not prevent President Trump from using his executive authority to create a regulatory environment and enforcement program that prioritizes his personal enrichment over the broader interests of US stakeholders. Amid these legislative challenges, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has reportedly applied for a federal pardon from Trump. Although Zhao has already served time in prison, a pardon could allow him to return to a leadership role in the crypto industry. Ongoing Concerns Over Crypto Regulation Trump’s influence over cryptocurrency regulation continues to raise questions among lawmakers. While the US government seeks clear rules for digital assets, the president’s personal financial interests present a clear conflict of interest. The intertwining of political power and financial gain in the rapidly evolving crypto sector is prompting calls for greater transparency and stricter oversight. Lawmakers and regulatory bodies are now under pressure to ensure that public policy decisions are made in the best interests of the country, rather than for the benefit of individual officeholders. As the debate intensifies, the outcome could have far-reaching implications for the future of digital asset regulation and the integrity of the nation’s political system.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-10 11:28:07

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently priced at just $0.025 during its fourth presale phase, is being highlighted as one of the most affordable tokens with serious $1 potential — and not in the distant future. With its smart tokenomics, real DeFi utilities, and strategic focus on Layer 2 compatibility, this project is beginning to look like one of the best crypto investments right now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At the core of the optimism is a simple value proposition: Mutuum offers utility from day one. While most presale tokens launch without a working product, the MUTM team has announced that a beta version of the platform will go live at the same time as the token, allowing users to start using core features like lending and borrowing right away. The project runs on a decentralized, non-custodial model where users can deposit popular digital assets such as ETH or ADA as collateral. This unlocks access to stablecoins, allowing users to maintain exposure to their original holdings while putting that value to work. For anyone who’s been waiting for a crypto lending platform that’s both flexible and user-first, this is a promising setup. Mutuum Finance is optimizing for Layer 2 by cutting down transaction costs through smarter data handling. Instead of sending bulky data, the protocol uses compact, byte-encoded strings and short asset IDs. This keeps interactions fast and affordable, especially on networks like Arbitrum, making lending and borrowing more accessible to everyone. To date, Mutuum has raised more than $7.75 million in its presale, with over 65% of the ongoing phase already finalized. At $0.025, investors are still buying in at the lowest available rate. But that window is closing fast. Once the fifth phase begins, the price will rise to $0.03, with a confirmed launch price of $0.06. That’s already a 140% increase baked in for early participants — and we’re not even factoring in post-launch demand. Analysts now project that MUTM could reach $1 shortly after listings begin, driven by protocol usage, exchange exposure, and yield distribution. Based on current trends and community momentum, those projections are looking increasingly realistic. Let’s break that down: an investor allocating $1,100 at the current price of $0.025 would see that position grow to $44,000 when MUTM reaches $1. It’s based on platform activity, community support, and token-linked revenue systems already in place. One of the main reasons long-term holders are circling MUTM is the protocol’s buy-and-distribute model. The system directs protocol-generated revenue toward buying MUTM tokens from the open market. These are then redistributed to users, creating a passive income loop fueled by actual borrowing and lending activity. This model is already appealing to whales, DeFi veterans, and those searching for the next big crypto that can deliver both utility and yield without overcomplicating the process. The platform is also preparing to introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be minted directly from user-supplied collateral within the protocol. Interest from these stablecoin loans flows back into the treasury, strengthening reserves and reinforcing the protocol’s long-term sustainability. Combined with mtTokens, which represent a user’s deposited asset and continue to accumulate value over time, Mutuum is constructing a full ecosystem — one where assets work for the holder and not the other way around. MUTM’s price won’t remain below $0.10 much longer. The fifth presale phase is quickly approaching, and with it comes a 20% price jump — followed by the broader public exposure that tends to drive prices even higher. For those asking what crypto to invest in, the answer might just be the project quietly building value before the crowd catches on. With the infrastructure, token design, and DeFi features to back its growth, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be more than just a speculative bet. It’s becoming one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch in 2025 — especially for those getting in before the $1 breakout becomes a headline.

You’re not alone. The latest reading from a key market indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , suggests we are firmly in a period known as Bitcoin Season . This shift has significant implications for anyone involved in the crypto market , especially when considering their cryptocurrency investment strategy. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? Let’s break down this important metric. The Altcoin Season Index , tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC), is designed to give us a snapshot of market sentiment and performance relative to Bitcoin. It helps answer a crucial question: are altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) collectively outperforming the market leader, or is Bitcoin leading the charge? Here’s how it generally works: The index analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CMC. It specifically looks at their performance over the past 90 days. Stablecoins and wrapped tokens are typically excluded from the calculation to focus on organic market movements. The index compares how many of these top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during that 90-day window. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. A high score indicates that a large percentage of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, suggesting an Altcoin Season is underway. Conversely, a low score signals that Bitcoin is dominating, pointing to Bitcoin Season . According to the data from May 9th, the index registered 40. This is up nine points from the previous day, showing some recent positive movement for altcoins relative to Bitcoin, but still well within the range that signifies Bitcoin dominance. Understanding Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market These terms describe different phases in the cryptocurrency market cycle, each with distinct characteristics: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the 90-day period. The index score is typically high (often above 75). During this phase, we often see significant price pumps in various altcoins, sometimes resulting in higher percentage gains than Bitcoin. Enthusiasm shifts towards newer technologies, specific narratives (like DeFi, NFTs, AI tokens), and smaller-cap projects. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the 90-day period. The index score is typically low (often below 25, though the threshold can vary slightly depending on the index provider; CMC’s definition uses During this phase, Bitcoin often sees strong price appreciation, sometimes consolidating gains while altcoins lag behind or even decline. Capital tends to flow into Bitcoin as the perceived safer, more established asset in the crypto space. The current index reading of 40 tells us that while not strictly meeting the Altcoin Season . Less than 75% (and likely significantly less based on a score of 40) of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin recently, confirming Bitcoin’s relative strength in the current crypto market environment. Why the Altcoin Season Index Matters for Your Cryptocurrency Investment Understanding which ‘season’ we are in is crucial for investors for several reasons: Portfolio Allocation: It helps you decide whether to overweight Bitcoin, altcoins, or maintain a balanced approach. Risk Management: Altcoins are generally more volatile and riskier than Bitcoin. Knowing if we’re in Bitcoin Season might suggest a more cautious approach to altcoin exposure. Profit Potential: Different phases offer different opportunities. Riding an Altcoin Season wave can yield massive returns, but participating in Bitcoin Season can also be highly profitable while potentially offering more stability. Expectation Setting: It manages expectations about potential gains. During Bitcoin Season, expecting explosive growth from most altcoins might be unrealistic. The index acts as a directional signal, helping investors align their strategies with prevailing market trends. It’s not a crystal ball, but it provides valuable context for decision-making in the volatile crypto market . Factors Driving Bitcoin Season Several elements contribute to periods where Bitcoin outperforms altcoins: Bitcoin Dominance: As Bitcoin’s price rises and its market cap grows, its dominance (Bitcoin’s market cap relative to the total crypto market cap) often increases, drawing attention and capital away from altcoins. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic uncertainty, investors often retreat to perceived safer assets. In crypto, Bitcoin is often seen as the primary ‘safe haven’ or store of value compared to riskier altcoins. Institutional Interest: Large institutional investors often enter the market via Bitcoin first, through products like Bitcoin ETFs. This influx of capital can significantly boost Bitcoin’s price and dominance. Halving Cycles: Historically, the period following a Bitcoin halving event has often seen Bitcoin lead the initial bull run phase before altcoins catch up later. Market Consolidation: After a period of rapid altcoin growth (Altcoin Season), the market may consolidate, with capital flowing back into Bitcoin as investors take profits or seek relative stability. The current index reading of 40 suggests that a combination of these factors is likely contributing to the ongoing Bitcoin Season narrative within the broader crypto market . Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights for Cryptocurrency Investment Given the current state of the Altcoin Season Index and the indication of Bitcoin Season , what steps might investors consider? (Remember, this is not financial advice, always do your own research!) Focus on Bitcoin: If you believe Bitcoin’s rally will continue, increasing your exposure to BTC might be a consideration. Selective Altcoin Exposure: Instead of broad altcoin bets, focus on specific projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and upcoming catalysts that might allow them to outperform even during Bitcoin dominance. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of the market season. This helps mitigate risk and build positions over time. Research for the Next Cycle: Use this period to deep-dive into altcoin projects you are interested in. Build your watchlists and understand potential entry points for when the market sentiment eventually shifts towards Altcoin Season again. Consider Profit-Taking: If you had significant gains during previous altcoin pumps, Bitcoin Season might be a time to take some profits and potentially reallocate to Bitcoin or stablecoins. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market indicators like the Altcoin Season Index , Bitcoin dominance charts, and overall market news to anticipate potential shifts. The nine-point increase in the index from the previous day, while not signaling an immediate shift to Altcoin Season , is a reminder that market dynamics are fluid. It could represent minor fluctuations or early signs of altcoins starting to show relative strength, though it’s too early to call a trend reversal based on one day’s data. Looking Ahead: When Could Altcoin Season Return? Predicting the exact timing of the next Altcoin Season is impossible, but historical cycles suggest it often follows a strong Bitcoin rally. As Bitcoin’s price potentially consolidates or its growth slows down, capital often rotates into altcoins in search of higher returns. Factors that could trigger the next Altcoin Season include: A period of Bitcoin price stability or sideways movement. Major positive news or developments specific to popular altcoin sectors (e.g., Ethereum upgrades, significant dApp launches, regulatory clarity for certain types of tokens). Increased retail investor interest flowing into the market, often starting with Bitcoin and then spilling over into altcoins. A decrease in Bitcoin dominance. Keeping an eye on the Altcoin Season Index will be key to identifying when this potential shift begins. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index currently sitting at 40 clearly indicates that the crypto market is not experiencing widespread altcoin outperformance. We are in a period best characterized as Bitcoin Season , where the leading cryptocurrency is showing relative strength. While the index saw a small uptick recently, it remains far from the levels that would signal a true Altcoin Season . For investors, understanding this market phase is vital for making informed cryptocurrency investment decisions. Whether focusing on Bitcoin, being selective with altcoins, or preparing for the next cycle, staying aware of these market dynamics is essential for navigating the exciting, albeit volatile, world of cryptocurrency.

From strong fundamentals to aligned technical indicators, these assets should be on the list of any crypto enthusiast positioning themselves for the 2025 bull run. In this article, the focus will be on Solana, Bitcoin Pepe , and Ripple. Increased usage and popularity of the Solana blockchain bolsters SOL value Solana has advanced to be one of the top blockchain platforms for decentralized applications. It is known for speedy transactions and reduced fees; gaining popularity in gaming, DeFi, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs. Its vast usage has increased the value of the SOL token, with the dApps on the Solana blockchain reporting strong revenue. For instance, according to Syndica, earnings by individual Solana dApps have surpassed those of entire ecosystems. In a recent post on X , the firm stated, “April marked another month of Solana DApp revenue supremacy, capturing 57% of DApp revenue across crypto”. Based on the popularity and increased revenue of the Solana blockchain, the SOL token is set to further increase in value in 2025 and beyond. It has since rebounded by close to 80% since hitting a 14-month low in April. As the market sentiment in the broader crypto space improves, the bulls will be eyeing the psychologically crucial zone of $200. Bitcoin Pepe: The first Bitcoin meme ICO embodying the future of meme crypto Bitcoin Pepe is the world’s first Bitcoin meme ICO. It seeks to bring meme coins home by allowing one to launch a meme coin on the secure Bitcoin network. Through its meme layer-2 solution, it gives investors the best of both worlds; Solana-style transaction speed and Bitcon’s stability. It is this first-of-its-kind merger between Bitcoin’s security and the meme culture that places Bitcoin Pepe as one of the tokens to consider buying in 2025. It embodies the future of meme crypto and now is the ideal time to jump onto the bandwagon. Currently in its presale stage, investors have an opportunity to rake in hefty gains before it hits the public shelves in Q2. At a token price of $0.031, early adopters have already secured 40.5% in cumulative gains. By the end of the 90-day presale, they’ll have earned up to 311.4% gains, with the token expected to record up to 100X growth in the foreseeable future. Hurry up and buy Bitcoin Pepe here . Ripple: A key player in cross-border payments with its legal challenges coming to an end The longstanding Ripple Labs – SEC case is approaching its end, and it couldn’t have come at a more opportune time. A joint request filled by both parties on Thursday seeks to have the current restrictions on Ripple’s operations lifted. Besides, Ripple agreed to a $50 million fine. Once the judiciary approves the filing, Ripple price is expected to benefit from the improved market sentiment and heightened investor interest. Besides, its role in cross-border payments makes Ripple a top crypto to buy in 2025. It has already been adopted by financial institutions across the world, making it a proven case.

The recent price surge has been fueled by the formation of a “Three White Soldiers” candlestick pattern, a classic bullish reversal signal characterized by three consecutive long green candles with small or no wicks. This formation often marks the start of a strong uptrend, indicating sustained buying interest. The breakout above the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $0.2109 has further reinforced this positive sentiment, with DOGE now testing the 2.272 extension at $0.2298. EMA and MACD Indicators Signal Continued Uptrend; Dogecoin Supported The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.1867 has provided consistent support throughout this rally, confirming the strength of the upward trend. DOGE’s price remains comfortably above this level, reflecting strong market confidence. Dogecoin Breaks Out – Can It Join Bitcoin’s Boom? DOGE hits $0.2297, fueled by a ""Three White Soldiers"" pattern and strong EMA support. Next targets: $0.2398 and $0.2476. Will the rally continue? #Dogecoin #Crypto #Altcoins #MemeCoins #CryptoTrading #BTC #CryptoNews pic.twitter.com/24b3tdLnRU — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) May 10, 2025 The MACD also supports this view, showing a positive crossover with the MACD line well above the signal line, highlighting accelerating bullish momentum. This combination of supportive technical indicators suggests that the current uptrend may have more room to run. Dogecoin Outlook: Key Price Levels and Potential Pullbacks Looking at key price levels, immediate resistance lies at the 2.272 Fibonacci extension of $0.2298, followed by the 2.618 extension at $0.2398. A break above these levels could clear the path for DOGE to challenge the psychologically significant $0.2476 mark. On the downside, immediate support is at $0.2109, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, which recently flipped from resistance to support. Below this, the next significant support levels are at $0.2050 (1.414 Fibonacci) and the 50 EMA at $0.1867, which remains a critical level for maintaining the bullish trend. Conclusion and Trade Outlook In summary, Dogecoin price prediction seems bullish as recent price action is supported by a strong technical setup, including the “Three White Soldiers” pattern, a bullish MACD crossover, and steady support from the 50 EMA. Traders should watch for a confirmed breakout above $0.2298 to target higher levels around $0.2398, while a pullback below $0.2109 could indicate a potential correction.

As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $103,754, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours and over 8% for the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

The AI model projects a potential trading range between $108,000 and $118,000, assuming the current uptrend continues. Key bullish factors include Bitcoin’s breakout above the psychologically significant $100,000 level, increasing whale accumulation, consistent inflows into spot ETFs , and the post-halving effect. ChatGPT also flagged $95,000 as a crucial support level. A dip below this threshold could indicate a short-term correction, but may offer an attractive entry point for long-term investors.

The model expects Bitcoin to trade between $98,000 and $115,000, with a median target around $106,500. Grok’s outlook considers Bitcoin’s historical performance following halving events and ongoing institutional interest, while also cautioning against potential overbought conditions. Despite differences in projected ranges, both AI tools agree that the recent move above $100,000 appears sustainable, provided there are no significant macroeconomic disruptions or unexpected regulatory headwinds. Bitcoin technical outlook Trading expert RLinda also highlighted that Bitcoin is now at a pivotal point following its recent surge above the $100,000 mark. In an analysis shared on X on May 9, she noted that BTC has entered a consolidation phase, a temporary pause in momentum during which the price moves within a tight range, often signaling that the market is preparing for its next major move. However, the direction of that move remains uncertain. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/RLinda Bitcoin is trading within a horizontal channel between approximately $102,000 and $104,800, a textbook example of market consolidation. A decisive breakout above the $104,800 resistance could reignite bullish momentum, with price targets in the $106,800 to $107,000 zone. Conversely, a breakdown below the $102,000 support could trigger a short-term correction, potentially pushing BTC toward the $99,000 level. Such a move would suggest the recent rally may be losing steam, at least for now.

Analyst Predicts BTC Price To Hit $200K by Summer appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Economic experts Tomas, in a recent post on the X platform, has highlighted a critical market signal that could drive Bitcoin and other risk assets much higher this summer. According to the expert, the sharp decline in the US Dollar Index seen in Q1 historically triggers strong rallies in assets like Bitcoin, typically with a three-month lag. He predicts that if this pattern holds, Bitcoin could reach the range of $150,000 to $200,000 in the coming months. Curious to know more? Read on! Weakened Dollar Index: Its Correlation with BTC Explained US Dollar Index Analysed At the beginning of this year, the US Dollar index was $108.512. In the first quarter of this year, the index slipped by no fewer than 3.93%. In the previous month, it declined by over 4.36%. Currently, the index sits at $100.424. This shows that the US dollar has weakened a lot in recent months, specifically in the first quarter of 2025. Tomas notes that historically, a weaker dollar usually leads to higher prices for risk assets like Bitcoin and stocks, though with a delay ( often around three months). On May 8, with a single day surge of 6.46%, the Bitcoin market once again broke the crucial mark of $100K . Bitcoin Price Analysis: In Short At the start of this month, the BTC price was $94,147.61. So far this month, the BTC market has jumped nearly 10.2%. Even though, in the early days of this month, the market witnessed severe volatility (a rise of around 2.84% between May 1 and 2 and a fall of 2.68% between May 3 and 4), since May 5, it has grown by at least 10.23%. In the last seven days alone, the Bitcoin price has witnessed an impressive rise of 7.8%. Bitcoin Price Prediction: What Economist Says Tomas states that the recent rise of Bitcoin could be the early sign of the BTC-Dollar Index correlation pattern playing out. All you have to do is watch the dollar – is it really this simple? While all the tariff/growth slowdown concerns are ongoing, it's easy to forget that the dollar has weakened massively. History strongly suggests this is bullish for risk assets, often on a lag. We're at that… pic.twitter.com/BTdKaAO3NP — Tomas (@TomasOnMarkets) May 9, 2025 The expert forecasts that if the usual inverse relationship between Bitcoin and the US Dollar index holds, the BTC price could reach the range of $150K to $200K by this summer. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 10 May, 2025 , US Dollar Index’s Correlation with US Stocks and Gold: What You Should Know Tomas notes that the same pattern might also boost US stock indices, although the link is less precise than with Bitcoin. In the first quarter of 2025, the S&P 500 index registered a notable drop of 4.96%. In the previous month, the market recorded a minor decline of 0.54%. Since the start of this month, it has experienced a small surge of 0.96%. Likewise, in April, the Nasdaq 100 index reported a rise of 1.92%. So far this month, the index has jumped 0.95% to $20,062.45. Meanwhile, the expert emphasises that gold often moves in sync with the dollar, not in the opposite direction. 2025 has been a fantastic year for gold . In Q1 2025, the gold price saw an enviable growth of no fewer than 19.16%. In the previous month, the price reported a rise of at least 5.25%. So far this month, the market has shown a minimal growth of 1.25%. The expert warns that since the dollar already weakened, gold has likely already risen and might fall if the dollar strengthens again. FAQs How does the US Dollar Index affect Bitcoin price? A weaker dollar historically leads to higher Bitcoin prices about three months later, as investors seek alternative assets. Does a falling dollar always boost gold and stocks?

44421605,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159260,1746877257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Significant Goldman Sachs Boost to IBIT Holdings Reaches $1.4B,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/goldman-sachs-boosts-ibit/,"The world of traditional finance is increasingly turning its gaze towards digital assets, and recent reports highlight a significant move by a major player. Goldman Sachs , a name synonymous with global investment banking, has reportedly made a substantial increase in its holdings of BlackRock’s iShares spot Bitcoin ETF, known by its ticker IBIT . Goldman Sachs Makes a Significant Move in IBIT According to recent data cited by CryptoBriefing from MacroScope, Goldman Sachs significantly ramped up its exposure to the Bitcoin market through BlackRock’s IBIT in the first quarter of 2024. The investment bank is reported to have increased its stake to an impressive 30.8 million shares of IBIT. To put this into perspective, based on the value at the end of Q1, these holdings are valued at over $1.4 billion. This represents a considerable jump – a 28% increase – from the previous quarter, where Goldman Sachs held approximately 24 million shares. This substantial boost underscores a growing confidence or strategic allocation towards digital assets within the bank’s portfolio or managed funds. Understanding IBIT and the Bitcoin ETF Landscape IBIT is one of several spot Bitcoin ETF products that launched in the United States in January 2024. These ETFs provide institutional and retail investors with regulated, accessible avenues to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without directly owning the underlying cryptocurrency. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is behind IBIT, and its entry into the space was seen as a major catalyst for institutional interest. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs was a landmark moment for the crypto industry, effectively bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. They offer benefits like: Regulatory Clarity: Operating within existing financial frameworks. Accessibility: Easy to buy and sell through traditional brokerage accounts. Convenience: No need to manage private keys or crypto wallets. While Goldman Sachs significantly increased its IBIT holdings, the report noted little change in its holdings of Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF , FBTC. This specific focus on IBIT by Goldman Sachs could indicate various factors, perhaps related to liquidity, management fees, or specific strategic reasons tied to BlackRock’s product. Why is This Significant for Institutional Crypto Adoption? The decision by a major institution like Goldman Sachs to not only hold but actively increase its stake in a Bitcoin ETF like IBIT is a powerful signal for broader institutional crypto adoption. While the exact nature of these holdings (whether proprietary trading, client assets, or seed investments) isn’t always fully disclosed in these filings, the presence of a name like Goldman Sachs on the list of IBIT holders is noteworthy. This move suggests that even the most traditional financial players are finding ways to incorporate Bitcoin exposure into their strategies. It lends further credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class and highlights the success of the ETF structure in attracting traditional capital. It moves the conversation beyond just hedge funds and crypto-native firms to include established Wall Street giants. The Growing Trend of Institutional Crypto Investment Goldman Sachs’ increased IBIT holding is part of a larger trend of growing institutional crypto investment. Since the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, billions of dollars have flowed into these products, primarily driven by institutional investors, wealth managers, and even some sovereign wealth funds exploring allocations. This influx of traditional capital is often seen as a positive development for the market, potentially bringing more stability, liquidity, and maturity to the crypto ecosystem. While direct Bitcoin ownership still exists, the ETF route has clearly become a preferred method for many institutions seeking regulated and familiar investment vehicles. What Does This Goldman Sachs Investment Mean for the Future? The significant increase in Goldman Sachs ‘ IBIT position could potentially foreshadow increased interest from other large financial institutions. As more banks, asset managers, and corporations witness their peers gaining exposure to Bitcoin via ETFs and as the regulatory landscape becomes clearer, the path for further crypto adoption becomes smoother. It’s important to note that while $1.4 billion is a substantial figure, it still represents a relatively small fraction of Goldman Sachs’ overall assets under management. However, the direction of travel – a 28% increase in a single quarter – is what captures attention and suggests a potential for continued growth in institutional digital asset exposure. Key Takeaways: Goldman Sachs significantly increased its IBIT (BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF) holdings in Q1 2024. Holdings reached over $1.4 billion, a 28% increase from the previous quarter. This move highlights growing institutional crypto adoption via regulated Bitcoin ETF products. The trend suggests traditional finance is finding accessible ways to gain Bitcoin exposure. Increased institutional participation is generally viewed positively for the long-term maturity and stability of the crypto market. Conclusion The reported increase in Goldman Sachs ‘ IBIT holdings to over $1.4 billion in Q1 is a compelling indicator of the accelerating pace of crypto adoption within traditional finance. As major players like Goldman Sachs deepen their engagement with Bitcoin through regulated products like spot ETFs, it sends a clear signal about the asset class’s evolving role in global portfolios. This development is a significant step in the ongoing convergence of Wall Street and the world of digital assets, reinforcing the narrative of Bitcoin’s journey towards mainstream acceptance.

With over $15 million in TVL, the protocol uses institutional custodians. Doppler’s phased roadmap aims to expand XRP’s utility through staking, real-world assets, and multichain restaking. XRP, long known as a payment-focused digital asset with high liquidity and institutional use, now sees its on-chain utility expand. This shift addresses previous limitations, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi), where most XRP holdings previously remained idle. Now, according to Jeremy Koch, a researcher at Messari, that dynamic could be shifting. In a recent post , Koch highlighted Doppler Finance, a platform built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) that allows users to earn passive returns on XRP through structured yield strategies. The platform’s current total value locked (TVL) surpasses $15 million.

In a new note to clients, Wells Fargo’s Ken Gawrelski and other analysts raise Uber’s price target to $100 from $90 and reiterate an overweight rating, reports Barron’s. The analysts also say Uber’s share price may rise to as high as $126, a more than 52% increase from the stock’s $82.81 close on Friday, as competition is likely to drive company efficiencies. “We believe the stock is likely to outperform as healthy fundamental trends drive upward estimate revisions.” The update comes after Uber’s reported earnings for the first quarter topped analysts’ estimates with earnings per share of $0.83, soaring above the $0.51 consensus forecast. The company also printed $11.5 billion in revenue in Q1, a 14% growth on a year-over-year basis. However, the company fell short of the anticipated revenue of $11.6 billion in the first quarter of the year. One highlight reported was that users booked more than three billion “trips,” up 18% from the first quarter of 2024. The Wells Fargo team notes that top-line trends remain strong for both Uber’s mobility and delivery segments. They also say that Uber’s deployment of autonomous vehicles in the near term should attract more investor interest.

44422013,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159261,1746877859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,DeFi Technologies Secures Monumental Nasdaq Listing: A Win for Crypto Adoption,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/defi-technologies-nasdaq-listing/,"Get ready for a significant moment at the crossroads of cryptocurrency and traditional finance! DeFi Technologies , a key player in the digital asset space and the parent company behind the Swiss-based crypto ETP provider Valour, has just announced a groundbreaking development: they’ve received approval to list on the prestigious U.S. Nasdaq Capital Market. This isn’t just another corporate announcement; it’s a powerful signal about the increasing legitimacy and integration of crypto-native companies into mainstream financial markets. Trading is set to commence on May 12 under the ticker symbol “DEFT,” marking a new chapter for the company and potentially paving the way for others in the decentralized finance realm. What Does the Nasdaq Listing Mean for DeFi Technologies? Listing on a major U.S. exchange like Nasdaq is a monumental step for any company, and for one deeply rooted in the crypto ecosystem, the implications are even more profound. Here’s a breakdown of what this move signifies: Increased Visibility and Access: Trading on Nasdaq immediately puts DeFi Technologies in front of a vast pool of U.S. and international investors, including large institutions and retail traders who may not currently have direct access to crypto markets or who prefer trading through regulated exchanges. Enhanced Credibility and Trust: The rigorous listing requirements of Nasdaq provide a level of validation and regulatory legitimacy that can build trust among a wider investor base. It signals that the company meets high standards of transparency, corporate governance, and financial reporting. Potential for Greater Liquidity: A Nasdaq listing typically leads to increased trading volume and liquidity for the company’s stock, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. Improved Access to Capital: Being a publicly traded company on a major exchange can make it easier for DeFi Technologies to raise capital in the future through stock offerings, funding further growth and expansion initiatives. This Nasdaq listing is not just about a stock symbol; it’s about bringing a crypto-focused business model into the heart of traditional finance, potentially accelerating institutional adoption . DeFi Technologies and Their Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Adding another layer to their forward-thinking approach, DeFi Technologies has previously adopted Bitcoin (BTC) as a primary treasury asset. They made significant BTC purchases last year, aligning their corporate balance sheet with the leading digital currency. This decision places them among a growing number of public companies, notably spearheaded by firms like MicroStrategy, that see Bitcoin not just as an speculative asset, but as a strategic reserve asset, a hedge against inflation, or a store of value in an uncertain economic climate. Holding a Bitcoin treasury demonstrates a strong conviction in the long-term value proposition of BTC and signals this belief to investors. For a company focused on decentralized finance and digital assets, incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate strategy is a natural fit and reinforces their commitment to the crypto space. It also provides investors with indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through holding the company’s stock. Valour: The Crypto ETP Connection DeFi Technologies is the parent company of Valour, a prominent provider of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) focused on digital assets. Valour offers investors regulated and easy ways to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets through traditional brokerage accounts on European exchanges. Valour’s suite of Crypto ETP offerings allows investors to participate in the growth of the digital asset market without the complexities of directly buying, storing, and securing cryptocurrencies themselves. The Nasdaq listing of their parent company, DeFi Technologies, could potentially: Increase awareness of Valour’s products among a broader investor base. Strengthen the perceived stability and credibility of the parent company supporting the ETPs. Potentially lead to future opportunities for Valour’s products in new markets, leveraging the parent company’s increased profile. The success of Valour’s Crypto ETP business is a key driver for DeFi Technologies, and the Nasdaq listing is expected to provide significant tailwinds. Why This Matters for Institutional Adoption of Crypto The listing of a company like DeFi Technologies on Nasdaq is a clear indicator of the maturation and growing acceptance of the crypto industry within mainstream finance. Steps like these are crucial for driving broader institutional adoption . Institutions, wealth managers, and traditional funds often face hurdles when looking to invest directly in cryptocurrencies due to regulatory uncertainties, custody challenges, and internal compliance requirements. However, investing in publicly traded companies with significant exposure to the crypto space, or companies that provide regulated crypto investment products like ETPs, offers a more familiar and accessible pathway. DeFi Technologies’ presence on Nasdaq provides a publicly traded vehicle for investors seeking exposure to the digital asset ecosystem, encompassing both direct corporate exposure through their business activities and indirect exposure through their Bitcoin treasury holdings and their Valour Crypto ETP subsidiary. This accessibility is a vital component in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of decentralized assets, fueling further institutional adoption . What’s Next for DEFT and the Market? With trading set to begin on May 12, market participants will be watching closely to see how DEFT performs. The listing opens up DeFi Technologies to a new pool of investors and potentially new avenues for growth. It underscores the ongoing trend of crypto-native businesses seeking integration with traditional financial markets to scale and gain legitimacy. This move follows other significant milestones in the industry, such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., all contributing to the narrative of digital assets moving from the fringes to the mainstream. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment DeFi Technologies securing approval for its Nasdaq listing is undeniably a landmark moment for the company and a positive development for the broader cryptocurrency industry. It represents increased validation, visibility, and accessibility for a company at the forefront of providing exposure to digital assets through regulated structures like Crypto ETPs and embracing strategies like maintaining a Bitcoin treasury . As trading commences under the ticker DEFT, it will be interesting to observe how this integration into the U.S. public markets impacts DeFi Technologies’ trajectory and contributes to the ongoing wave of institutional adoption in the digital asset space. This step is a powerful testament to the evolving landscape where crypto innovation is increasingly finding its place within established financial frameworks.

Under the proposed rules , crypto exchanges, dealers, and agents will be regulated similarly to traditional financial firms, with requirements for transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience, the UK Treasury said in a statement released following Reeves’ remarks. Per the statement, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025 introduces six new regulated activities, including crypto trading, custody, and staking. Rather than opting for a light-touch regime similar to the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) , the UK is applying the full weight of securities regulation to crypto, according to UK-based law firm Wiggin. That includes capital requirements, governance standards, market abuse rules, and disclosure obligations. “The UK’s draft crypto regulations represent a meaningful step toward embracing a rules-based digital asset economy,” Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, told Cointelegraph. “By signaling a willingness to provide regulatory clarity, the UK is positioning itself as a safe harbor for responsible innovation.” Disparte added that the proposed framework can provide the predictability needed to “scale responsible digital financial infrastructure in the UK.” Source: MiCA Crypto Alliance Related: Revolut doubles profits to $1.3B on user growth, crypto trading boom UK’s new crypto rules are “net positive” Vugar Usi Zade, the chief operating officer (COO) at Bitget exchange, also expressed optimism regarding the new regulations, claiming that it “is a net positive” for the industry. “I think a lot of companies recently exited or hesitated to enter the UK because they were not clear about what activities, products, and operations need FCA authorization. Firms finally get clear definitions of “qualifying crypto assets” and know exactly which activities—trading, custody, staking or lending—need FCA authorization.” For exchanges, including Bitget, the UK’s draft rules mean they need full approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to offer crypto trading, custody, staking, or lending services to UK users. The rules also give companies two years to adjust their systems, like capital and reporting. “Mapping each service line to the new perimeter adds compliance overhead, but that clarity lets us plan product roll‑outs and invest in local infrastructure,” Zade said. The new draft regulations reclassify stablecoins as securities, not as e-money. This means UK-issued fiat-backed tokens must meet prospectus-style disclosures and redemption protocols. Non-UK stablecoins can still circulate, but only via authorized venues. Zade claimed that excluding stablecoins from the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 (EMRs), which keeps them out of the e‑money sandbox, could slow their use for payment. However, Disparte, whose firm is the issuer of USDC ( USDC ), the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, said predictability is key to fostering responsible growth in the UK. “What matters most is predictability: a framework that enables firms to build, test, and grow responsibly—without fear of arbitrary enforcement or shifting goalposts. If realized, this could mark a pivotal moment in the UK’s digital asset journey.” Ripple’s Cassie Craddock praising new UK draft rules. Source: Cassie Craddock Related: UK regulator moves to restrict borrowing for crypto investments UK to require FCA approval for foreign crypto firms Among the biggest changes as part of the new draft rules is the territorial reach. Non-UK platforms serving UK retail clients will need the FCA authorization. The “overseas persons” exemption is limited to certain B2B relationships, effectively ring-fencing the UK retail market. Crypto staking enters the perimeter as well. Liquid and delegated staking services must now register, while solo stakers and purely interface-based providers are exempt. New custody rules extend to any setup that gives a party unilateral transfer rights, including certain lending and MPC (multiparty computation) arrangements. “Some DeFi nuances still need fleshing out, but the direction is toward efficient, tailored compliance rather than blanket restriction,” Bitget’s Zade said. He added that the broad “staking” definition might sweep in non‑custodial DeFi models lacking a central provider. “Proposed credit‑card purchase restrictions—though aimed at high‑risk use — could dampen retail participation in token launches,” he said. Furthermore, Zade said bank‑grade segregation rules for client assets could burden lean DeFi projects. “Final rule tweaks will need to mitigate these side effects.” The FCA plans to publish final rules on crypto sometime in 2026, setting the groundwork for the UK regulatory regime to go live. The roadmap to greater regulatory clarity in the UK could follow the European Union, which started to implement its MiCA framework in December.

The conversation signals growing momentum for integrating blockchain technologies into mainstream finance. According to a memo published by the SEC on May 9, BlackRock aimed to share perspectives on enabling staking within ETPs. BlackRock Says Ethereum ETFs Incomplete Without Staking Option BlackRock has previously argued that Ethereum-based ETFs would be more complete if staking were permitted. Staking allows users to lock up tokens to support blockchain operations in return for yield—a key feature of proof-of-stake networks like Ethereum and Solana. BlackRock is not alone in advocating for this functionality. In February, the New York Stock Exchange proposed a rule change to allow staking services for Grayscale’s spot Ether ETFs. The SEC has since delayed a final decision on the matter, but approval could pave the way for staking-enabled ETFs across other blockchains, including Solana. The meeting also covered tokenization—transforming traditional securities like stocks and bonds into blockchain-based tokens. Tokenized securities offer advantages such as 24/7 trading, faster settlements, and reduced operational costs compared to legacy financial systems. BlackRock met with the SEC Crypto Task Force on May 9, sought guidance on staking, tokenization, ETF approval standards, and options on ETFs. pic.twitter.com/GSKgJnikq1 — db (@tier10k) May 9, 2025 BlackRock already manages BUIDL, a tokenized fund backed by U.S. Treasury assets with a market cap of $2.9 billion—the largest of its kind. Competitors include Franklin Templeton’s BENJI fund. Robinhood is also reportedly exploring tokenized securities, developing a blockchain to let European retail users trade U.S. stocks. As institutional players push for regulatory clarity, these discussions may help shape the future of blockchain in traditional markets. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Surpasses Gold Rival BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has recorded $6.96 billion in net inflows since the start of 2025, surpassing the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) to become the sixth most popular ETF by inflows. GLD, the world’s largest physically backed gold ETF, slid to seventh place on Monday with $6.5 billion in net inflows. Despite Bitcoin’s recent price dip, which is down more than 10% from its January peak, investors appear confident in the cryptocurrency’s long-term value. In contrast to Bitcoin, gold has climbed more than $3,000 this year amid concerns over inflation, global trade tensions, and geopolitical instability. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X that the strong inflows into IBIT are “a really good sign for the long term” and support projections that Bitcoin ETFs could eventually hold three times as much capital as their gold counterparts. $IBIT took in another half a billion yest, extending inflow streak to 15 days and is now 6th in YTD flows, passing $GLD which is notable bc IBIT is only up 4% vs GLD having the run of its life.

In a parallel development, the Crypto Council for Innovation, backed by major firms including a16z crypto, Consensys, and Kraken, has called on the SEC for regulatory clarity on staking. Currently, more than 70 crypto ETF applications are awaiting a decision from the SEC, according to Bloomberg.

Solana ( SOL ) rose to $170 at last check on Saturday and is now hovering at its highest level since March 3 this year. The rally has coincided with the ongoing crypto and stock market bull run. Bitcoin and most altcoins have jumped, bringing the market cap of all cryptocurrencies to over $3.2 trillion. Most Solana meme coins have also jumped in the past few weeks, pushing their market cap from $6 billion in April to $13 billion today. Some of the top performers were Bonk ( BONK ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), Popcat ( POPCAT ), and Peanut the Squirrel.

The volume processed by protocols in the network, like Raydium and Meteora, rose to $20 billion in the last seven days and $78.93 billion in the last 30 days. This is a big increase compared to Ethereum’s protocols, which handled $13 billion and $51.5 billion in this period. Solana price will also benefit from the upcoming approval of spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. 7 firms like VanEck, 21Shares, Grayscale, and Bitwise have applied for a spot SOL ETF. If the SEC allows staking , JPMorgan estimates that these funds will attract over $6 billion in inflows in the first year. Solana price analysis: textbook pattern points to a surge to $500 SOL price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that the SOL price has formed a classical chart pattern known as a cup and handle. This pattern is characterized by a horizontal resistance, a rounded bottom, and a handle section. This pattern’s upper section was $258, while the lower side was $8.05. It is now forming the handle section of this pattern. The best way to approximate the price target using this pattern is to measure the cup’s depth, which is at 97% in this case. One then measures the same distance from the cup’s upper side, bringing the target to about $500. The bullish Solana price forecast will become invalid if the coin drops below the key support at $94.50.

He made the appeal during the National Conference and amplified the message on X. His purpose is straightforward: incorporate Bitcoin along with gold and foreign currency to assist in protection against shock drops. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Push For Bitcoin In Reserves In the opinion of Ju‑Chun, Bitcoin is capable of withstanding large fluctuations in the global economy. He informed the conference that introducing even a thin slice of Bitcoin to Taiwan’s asset stack might make the financial system more resilient. He also appealed to crypto enthusiasts on X, referring them to his speech and asking for feedback. His tone was assertive and straightforward. He explained that this action would not be a substitute for current reserves, but possibly reinforce them. Meeting With Bitcoin Advocate According to reports, Ju‑Chun last week had a meeting with Samson Mow, who is the CEO of Jan3, a firm that specializes in extensive Bitcoin adoption. Jan3 released a statement on Thursday emphasizing the imperative for countries to prepare against currency fluctuations through the holding of Bitcoin. Mow explained to Ju‑Chun that fiat currencies have turned more volatile.

He contended that for over 15 years, Bitcoin has demonstrated it can defy external pressure and remain accessible when other assets collapse. That, he added, is worth a place in the national locker.

That is approximately $2.5 billion. He mentioned that New Hampshire recently approved the same action, and referenced US President Donald Trump’s directive to create a US Bitcoin reserve. He also mentioned that some large economies, such as the UK and Japan, are still waiting on the sidelines. He indicated that Taiwan can lead Asia if it acts now.

He called on lawmakers to examine how central banks could buy, hold and insure Bitcoin. He also requested clear rules to ensure any losses do not spill over into the broader economy.

Conor McGregor thinks so. The UFC champion has urged Ireland to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve, arguing it could help return financial power to the people. His bold call on social media is tied to the core values Bitcoin was built on: decentralization and financial freedom. But the road is not easy – just ask the United States. So, the question remains – will Ireland take the leap? An Appeal to Ireland McGregor isn’t a stranger to making a noise. Recently, he seems to have shifted focus from fighting to finance, urging Ireland to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Crypto in it's origin was founded to give power back to the people. An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people’s money. I will be cohosting a Twitter space to talk about what I want to see changed. Victory to Ireland! — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) May 9, 2025 He argued that Bitcoin, in its essence, was designed to give power back to the people, and establishing a national Bitcoin reserve would do just that. AND, to further his cause, McGregor plans to co-host a Twitter Space to share his vision for Ireland’s crypto future. We love to see the commitment! While the Irish government has yet to respond officially, McGregor’s tweet gained over 735,000 views in less than 12 hours, proving the growing demand for state-level Bitcoin adoption. Bitcoin Reserves: The Hot Topic of 2025! 2025 is proving to be a defining year for Bitcoin. Global interest in Bitcoin reserves is skyrocketing. Germany and Switzerland have already taken steps to integrate Bitcoin into their national financial strategies, and with McGregor’s reach, Ireland may not be far behind. The push is becoming impossible to ignore. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and growing global use as “digital gold” make it an attractive alternative to traditional reserve assets like gold and oil. It’s time governments woke up. Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the U.S. While we’re on the topic, it’s hard not to bring up the flag-bearer of reserves in the US. Back in March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as part of a broader digital asset stockpile. This move aligned with Trump’s campaign promises to turn the U.S. into the “global hub for digital assets” and reduce the regulations imposed under the previous administration. And progress (though slow) is underway. U.S. States Join the Race to Stack Bitcoin Within just 48 hours, New Hampshire and Arizona became the first U.S. states to establish state-level Bitcoin reserves. Arizona, led by Governor Katie Hobbs, passed a law converting unclaimed property funds into Bitcoin. This is a significant step forward in the state’s financial strategy, and it marks a bipartisan consensus around Bitcoin as a tool for modernizing state finances. Now other states may soon follow suit. Will Ireland Be Next? So, what does this mean for Ireland? McGregor’s call for a Bitcoin reserve has sparked conversations, but so far, it hasn’t led to any major government action. However, with the U.S. taking bold steps and countries around the world experimenting with Bitcoin reserves, Ireland may soon find itself having to make a decision. We’ll be watching closely.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-10 12:03:53

Reports have surfaced indicating a massive crypto exchange deposit from a wallet allegedly linked to the TRUMP team. This isn’t just any deposit; we’re talking about a substantial amount that has certainly caught the attention of market watchers and the broader crypto community. What’s Behind the Massive TRUMP Token Deposit? According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, a wallet associated with the TRUMP team initiated a large transfer of tokens. Within a remarkably short timeframe of approximately 30 minutes, a staggering 3.5 million TRUMP tokens were moved to various centralized exchanges. At the time of the report, this deposit was valued at an impressive $52.66 million. Such a large movement of assets from a single wallet to exchanges is often referred to as whale activity in the crypto space. ‘Whales’ are individuals or entities holding significant amounts of a particular cryptocurrency, and their movements can potentially influence market dynamics due to the sheer volume involved. Why Do Large Crypto Exchange Deposits Matter? When a significant amount of a token is deposited onto centralized exchanges, it typically suggests that the holder intends to sell or increase liquidity available for trading. This potential increase in selling pressure can sometimes lead to price volatility or downward movement, depending on market conditions and the actual execution of trades. For a token like TRUMP, which falls under the category of political meme coins and has seen considerable attention and price swings, such a large deposit is particularly noteworthy. It raises questions about the team’s intentions, whether it’s strategic liquidation, market making, or something else entirely. Which Exchanges Received the TRUMP Token? The 3.5 million TRUMP tokens weren’t sent to just one location. The deposit was distributed across several major cryptocurrency exchanges. Here’s a breakdown of where the tokens landed: Binance: 1.5 million TRUMP tokens OKX: 1 million TRUMP tokens Bybit: 500,000 TRUMP tokens Coinbase: 500,000 TRUMP tokens The distribution across multiple high-volume exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, along with others, suggests a potential aim to access broad market liquidity. This multi-exchange approach is a common strategy for large holders looking to execute trades without causing excessive slippage on a single platform. What Could This Mean for Political Meme Coins and the TRUMP Token? This significant crypto exchange deposit is bound to spark speculation within the community. For holders and potential investors of the TRUMP token , this whale activity could be interpreted in several ways: Potential Selling Pressure: The most immediate concern is that the tokens are being prepared for sale, which could increase supply on exchanges and potentially lower the price if demand doesn’t absorb it. Increased Liquidity: Alternatively, the deposits could be intended to provide liquidity for larger trading pairs, making it easier for others to buy and sell the token on these platforms. Strategic Move: Given the political nature of the token and the upcoming US elections, this could be part of a larger strategic financial move by the team or associated entities. Market Signal: Regardless of the intent, such a large, public deposit serves as a market signal that could influence trader sentiment. The impact isn’t necessarily confined to just the TRUMP token . As one of the leading political meme coins , its significant movements can sometimes have ripple effects or draw attention to the broader political token niche within the crypto market. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors For those involved in trading or holding the TRUMP token or other political meme coins , this news warrants attention. While a deposit doesn’t automatically mean selling, it increases the potential for it. Key takeaways include: Monitor Order Books: Keep an eye on the order books on the mentioned exchanges (Binance, OKX, Bybit, Coinbase) for signs of large sell orders. Watch Price Action: Observe how the price reacts in the hours and days following the deposit. Increased volatility might occur. Assess Market Sentiment: Gauge the overall market mood regarding political tokens and meme coins. Consider Risk Management: As with any potentially volatile asset, especially one influenced by specific events like political developments, maintaining sound risk management practices is crucial. This event underscores the importance of staying informed about significant whale activity and major crypto exchange deposit events in the tokens you follow. Conclusion The deposit of $52.66 million worth of TRUMP token into major exchanges marks a significant event for this prominent political meme coin . While the exact intentions behind this massive crypto exchange deposit remain subject to speculation, the potential implications for market dynamics are clear. As the cryptocurrency news cycle continues, market participants will be closely watching the price action and further developments related to this substantial movement of assets, analyzing the potential impact of this whale activity on the TRUMP token and the broader political token landscape.

Speaking in the same broadcast on the X platform, Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas stated that they do not want to compete with their customers. “We will not stop at this point,” Haas said, adding that the company will continue to increase its crypto assets. On the other hand, many companies have started to follow similar strategies, following Saylor’s model of financing Bitcoin investments through equity and debt sales.

This isn’t just a small bump; it represents a staggering 54% increase compared to the previous quarter, according to insights shared by Unfolded on X. This surge signifies renewed confidence and heightened interest from venture capital firms in the potential of this rapidly evolving sector. It’s the highest quarterly total seen since Q3 2022, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment and investment appetite. Understanding the Surge in Venture Capital Crypto What exactly is driving this impressive surge in Venture Capital Crypto funding? While several factors contribute, one deal stands out significantly. A massive $2 billion investment in the global exchange Binance by Abu Dhabi-based firm MGX played a crucial role, representing the largest single contribution of the quarter. However, this isn’t the whole story. The broader market environment, including the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and a general recovery in crypto asset prices, has likely improved investor confidence across the board. VCs often look for signs of market maturity and potential for mass adoption, and Q1 2024 provided several positive indicators. Here are some potential factors contributing to the increased inflow: Improved Market Sentiment: A recovering market post-bear cycle makes investment opportunities appear more attractive. Increased Institutional Interest: The regulatory landscape is slowly becoming clearer in some regions, encouraging larger players. Sector-Specific Growth: Certain areas within crypto, such as Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), AI integration, and GameFi, are showing promising signs of innovation and user adoption, attracting targeted Blockchain Investment . Availability of Capital: Many VC firms raised large funds during the previous bull cycle and are now actively deploying that capital into promising ventures. Breaking Down the $4.8 Billion in Blockchain Investment While the headline figure is substantial, it’s helpful to look at where this Blockchain Investment is being directed. While the Binance deal heavily skewed the Q1 numbers, the funding is distributed across various segments of the crypto ecosystem. This includes investments in: Infrastructure Projects: Layer 2 scaling solutions, cross-chain bridges, and decentralized storage. DeFi Protocols: Decentralized finance applications focusing on lending, borrowing, and trading. Web3 Gaming & NFTs: Projects building blockchain-based games and exploring new use cases for non-fungible tokens. Enterprise Blockchain Solutions: Companies developing blockchain technology for business applications beyond pure cryptocurrency. Security & Compliance Tools: Essential services for a maturing industry. The diversity of investment areas suggests that VCs are betting on the fundamental technology and its various applications, not just speculative trading platforms. This broad approach is often seen as a sign of a healthy and developing ecosystem. Why is Crypto Funding So Important for the Ecosystem? The inflow of Crypto Funding from venture capitalists is more than just numbers on a chart; it’s fuel for innovation and growth. Here’s why it matters: Accelerates Development: Capital allows startups to hire talent, build technology faster, and iterate on their products. Enables Scaling: Funding provides the resources needed to expand operations, acquire users, and enter new markets. Brings Expertise: VC firms often bring valuable experience, strategic guidance, and network connections that are crucial for navigating the complex crypto landscape. Signals Validation: Significant investment from reputable firms can lend credibility to projects and attract further interest from other investors and users. Fosters Innovation: Funding allows teams to focus on groundbreaking research and development, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with blockchain technology. Without venture capital, many ambitious projects would struggle to get off the ground or achieve widespread adoption. It plays a critical role in transforming theoretical ideas into functional, impactful products and services. Navigating the World of VC Funding Crypto: Challenges and Opportunities While the surge in VC Funding Crypto is largely positive, it’s not without its challenges. For founders, securing funding is highly competitive. VCs perform extensive due diligence, scrutinizing everything from the team’s expertise and the technology’s viability to the project’s tokenomics and regulatory compliance. The regulatory environment remains a significant hurdle globally, creating uncertainty for both projects and investors. For retail investors watching this trend, VC activity can be a double-edged sword. While it can signal potential growth areas, early-stage VC investments are high-risk, and not all funded projects succeed. The valuations at which VCs invest can sometimes seem inflated, potentially leading to volatility when tokens eventually become publicly traded. It’s crucial for all participants to conduct their own research and understand the inherent risks involved in the crypto space. Actionable Insights: For Founders: Focus on building a strong team, developing a clear use case with real-world utility, and demonstrating a path to sustainability beyond initial funding. Understand the regulatory landscape relevant to your project. For Investors: View VC funding trends as indicators of where smart money is looking, but don’t blindly follow. Research the specific projects, understand their technology, team, and market potential before making investment decisions. Diversification remains key. What Does This Surge Mean for the Future? The strong start to 2024 for Crypto VC Investment suggests a potential turning point after a more subdued period. If this trend continues, we could see a new wave of innovation and development within the blockchain space. Increased funding can lead to more robust infrastructure, user-friendly applications, and potentially breakthrough technologies that address current limitations. However, the market remains dynamic. Factors such as global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments in major jurisdictions, and the overall performance of key cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum will continue to influence investment levels. While the $4.8 billion figure is impressive, sustained growth will depend on the successful execution of funded projects and continued positive momentum in the wider crypto market. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal for the Ecosystem The significant jump in Venture Capital Crypto funding in Q1 2024 to $4.8 billion is undeniably a strong bullish signal for the industry. It highlights renewed confidence from institutional investors and provides essential capital for the next generation of blockchain projects. While challenges remain, the increased flow of Crypto Funding promises to accelerate innovation, improve infrastructure, and potentially drive broader adoption of decentralized technologies. This surge underscores the long-term potential that VCs see in the transformative power of blockchain, paving the way for exciting developments ahead.

In a post that drew widespread attention, BarriC stated that the digital asset’s rise to $1,000 will happen sooner than investors anticipate. He added that most people “won’t realize their mistake and how badly they fumbled XRP” until the price surpasses $500, and it’s too late. This prediction suggests an exponential rise in the asset value, which is currently trading at $2.39. BarriC’s post was framed with confidence, indicating an imminent rally for XRP that would catch the majority of market participants off guard. Community Reactions Highlight Diverging Opinions The reaction to BarriC’s statement included a mix of support and skepticism. One user challenged the math behind the forecast, pointing out that a $1,000 price would translate to a $100 trillion Fully Diluted Value (FDV). He described the claim as “fiction,” highlighting that such a figure would exceed global GDP estimates. Another commenter dismissed the idea of XRP reaching even $100, citing the coin’s large supply as a limiting factor. While some prominent voices believe the $100 target is a mathematical certainty , these concerns about its market cap are common among critics who believe the asset’s tokenomics make ultra-high price targets unrealistic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The circulating supply of XRP is 58.55 billion, with its total supply at 99.98 billion. Many community members believe these values pose a significant challenge to achieving valuations in the hundreds or thousands of dollars without massive shifts in demand or a drastic reduction in supply. However, some experts have dismissed these claims , arguing that the asset’s market cap cannot limit its growth in the crypto space. Is XRP Going to $1,000? Not all responses were negative. One individual suggested the asset could experience life-changing growth in June, showing confidence in a near-term breakout. Others used sarcasm to question the feasibility of the prediction, with one user writing , “If sooner is between now and the year 2145, then I guess you’re right,” while reiterating concerns over market cap implications. While XRP is designed for fast and low-cost transactions and has found success in cross-border payments, its adoption has not reached a level that supports the valuation that BarriC projects. However, the asset’s user base is growing rapidly, and Ripple is expanding its global network, pushing to make XRP a reserve asset . If this happens, the $1,000 valuation will become more feasible.

Here’s What the Chart Says,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-bitcoins-last-pump-has-started-heres-what-the-chart-says/,"Renowned crypto analyst MMCrypto has stirred the digital asset community with his latest prediction on X, asserting that Bitcoin’s last major pump has officially begun. The big question on everyone’s mind: Will this mark the final phase of Bitcoin’s current market cycle? MMCrypto’s Bold Prediction MMCrypto, known for his in-depth technical analysis and timely market insights, recently took to X to share his perspective on Bitcoin’s price trajectory . According to his assessment, the leading cryptocurrency is entering the final bullish phase of this cycle, a movement often referred to as the “last pump.” The post quickly ignited debate among crypto enthusiasts due to its significant historical implications. Bitcoin: The last Pump has started! pic.twitter.com/BUwIxxRk42 — MMCrypto (@MMCrypto) May 10, 2025 The phrase “last pump” signifies the concluding upward surge before a significant correction or market consolidation. This prediction comes when Bitcoin has shown renewed strength , breaking past key resistance levels that had previously capped its growth. MMCrypto’s assertion is based on a comprehensive chart analysis that suggests a parabolic trend, reminiscent of past bull markets. Examining the Chart: A Technical Breakdown Bitcoin’s recent price movements align with the bullish momentum that MMCrypto has highlighted. The analyst highlighted key indicators like RSI and MACD, which have recently signaled bullish trends. Bullish sentiment dominates as the market breaks out of a symmetrical triangle pattern with strong trading volume. According to MMCrypto, the chart also reveals a series of higher lows, a classic sign of sustained upward pressure. Additionally, the 200-day moving average (MA) has flipped from resistance to support, indicating that the bears are losing market dominance. Historical data from previous cycles suggests that such a setup often precedes a significant price surge. Market Sentiment and Broader Implications While MMCrypto’s prediction is gaining traction, not all analysts agree that this is the final pump. Skeptics argue that macroeconomic factors, including ongoing regulatory scrutiny and interest rate fluctuations, could dampen Bitcoin’s rally. Nonetheless, the broader sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with some investors suggesting that a Bitcoin ETF approval could act as a major catalyst for further price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Seasoned traders relate to the ‘last pump’ concept, recalling the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. In both instances, Bitcoin exhibited parabolic growth before experiencing sharp corrections. Whether the current setup mirrors those historical patterns remains to be seen, but the parallels have not gone unnoticed. What Investors Should Watch For MMCrypto advises caution despite its optimistic outlook. He notes that while the technical indicators point toward a final upward push, investors should be prepared for heightened volatility. Stop-loss orders and profit-taking strategies are essential in such a high-stakes environment. The community is watching whale movements, as significant sell-offs during a parabolic move could quickly reverse gains. Currently, the chart indicators support MMCrypto’s prediction of a final bullish surge. Bitcoin’s current path could shape the future for long-term holders and new investors. However, the unpredictable nature of the crypto market warrants a balanced approach, blending optimism with prudence. Bitcoin’s latest rally has reignited hopes of a final breakout before a market cooldown. MMCrypto’s confident assertion that the “last pump” is underway has added a new layer of excitement, but it also serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of crypto cycles. As always, investors are encouraged to conduct their research and remain vigilant, as even the most well-reasoned predictions can be upended by unforeseen market dynamics.

On the weekly chart, SOL has convincingly reclaimed the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $156, a zone that previously acted as a mid-cycle support. This reclaim now opens the door for a possible retest of the 0.382 Fib level at $189 — the next major resistance barrier in Solana’s recovery arc. Solana price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The Solana price action is being driven by a clean bullish breakout on the 4-hour chart, where price broke above a multi-week triangle formation and surged past multiple horizontal resistance zones, notably the $162–$167 band.

But those who recognized its potential early on were rewarded with returns that changed their entire outlook on crypto investing. Now, in 2025, a similar setup is unfolding — and this time, it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) catching attention, not just from retail traders, but from serious long-term holders. With a growing number of analysts calling it the best cryptocurrency to buy now, Mutuum is proving that price alone doesn’t tell the full story. Priced at just $0.025, this under-the-radar project is gaining momentum for all the right reasons. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The real appeal of Mutuum Finance lies in its design. It’s a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol built to support both lending and borrowing of digital assets. But unlike many platforms that rely on hype cycles, Mutuum is developing a system rooted in utility, where the protocol’s value is driven by actual usage, not speculation. One standout feature is its dual approach to lending. Mutuum supports overcollateralized loans, allowing users to borrow against their crypto without needing to sell — a strategy many prefer when trying to retain upside exposure. Borrowers remain in control of their assets while gaining access to stablecoins or other tokens for new opportunities. On the other side, users who supply liquidity are rewarded through mtTokens — tokenized receipts of their deposits that increase in value over time as interest is accrued. These mtTokens are fully ERC-20 compatible, meaning they can be traded, held, or even used in external DeFi protocols. This flexibility gives lenders more than just yield — it gives them options. Solana’s rise wasn’t just about fast speeds — it was about building an ecosystem with real user value. Mutuum takes a similar approach, but from a financial utility perspective. One of the most important mechanics within the platform is how it redistributes value. Part of the fees collected by the protocol is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the market, which are then distributed to users holding mtTokens. This structure doesn’t rely on constant token emissions or inflation. Instead, it rewards actual participation and anchors the token’s utility in a sustainable feedback loop. It’s this design that’s attracting long-term interest. MUTM isn’t trying to create temporary yield — it’s focused on building an ecosystem where consistent activity feeds back into token value. For those who are looking for what crypto to invest in without worrying about diluted returns, this setup checks the boxes. Momentum is building around Mutuum’s presale, and the numbers reflect that. Over $7.77 million has already been raised, more than 9,550 holders are on board, and Phase 4 is more than 65% completed. At the moment, MUTM is priced at $0.025, though the upcoming phase will raise it to $0.03. By the time it hits launch, MUTM is expected to open at $0.06 — a 140% increase from the current price. Considering that entry into Solana under $1 is now a thing of the past, MUTM offers a rare second chance. For those who missed the early stages of other successful coins, this is one of the few current options that presents a similar early-stage structure, but with clear fundamentals behind it. The total presale consists of 11 phases, so the opportunity is still open — but not for long. With every completed round, the price adjusts upward, meaning the earlier one gets in, the more room there is for upside. For those scanning crypto charts and watching for strong entry points, this might be one of the clearest setups on the market right now. Another element that positions Mutuum for success is its upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin. Designed to maintain a reliable value against the U.S. dollar, this stablecoin will be created directly from collateral supplied within the lending protocol. It’s fully permissionless, backed on-chain, and burned upon repayment or liquidation — making it one of the most transparent and flexible stable assets in development. By keeping everything within the ecosystem — from stablecoin issuance to interest distribution — Mutuum ensures that value remains internal. This kind of economic design helps create durability and lowers dependence on external systems or centralized actors, which is increasingly becoming a deciding factor for long-term cryptocurrency holders. Solana’s early success came from being ahead of the curve, building infrastructure before the crowd caught on. In a similar way, Mutuum Finance is creating a protocol that addresses real needs in DeFi while offering attractive incentives to early supporters. With a smart lending system, utility-driven tokenomics, and an engaged presale already over halfway complete, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the most promising cryptocurrency investments heading into the next market cycle. For those asking what’s the next crypto to explode, it may not be the names you already know. Sometimes, it’s the ones still flying under the radar — and right now, Mutuum looks like one of them.

In his recent post on X, Kiyosaki mentioned that investors and the populace in general should be doing enough to fight back against this system using Bitcoin. In his post on X, Kiyosaki cited insights from United States Congressman Ron Paul, who had been a long-time advocate for abolishing the Federal Reserve and all central banks. Paul, the author of End the Fed, described rate sheeting by central banks as price fixing, equating the move to socialist and Marxist economic control. Paul had always warned that such mechanisms rob personal wealth and undermine economic freedom, something Kiyosaki has always agreed with Robert Kiyosaki wants investors to ditch ‘fake money’ for Bitcoin In his latest X post, Kiyosaki called on all investors to ditch what he has always considered ‘fake money.’ “Fake money leads to dishonest money, dishonest statistics, dishonest accounting, dishonest balance sheets, dishonest compensation, dishonest relations, dishonest leaders, and corruption in everyday life,” Kiyosaki said. He also urged Americans to fight back by moving away from the corrupt fiat system and instead embracing fiat systems like Bitcoin and precious metals. WORDS of WISDOM from former US Congressman Ron Paul: Author of “End the Fed” and advocate for ending the Fed, all Central Banks, and getting back to a sound honest money system. Ron Paul states: “A central bank setting interest rates is price fixing and a form of central… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 10, 2025 Kiyosaki’s hard stance towards fiat currency is not new, with the famous author repeatedly criticizing the US dollar, labelling it a dying currency that has been inflated by government spending and central bank manipulation. His financial philosophy is rooted in Austrian economics and personal sovereignty, supporting assets that cannot be debased or controlled by the political elites. He has always argued in favor of precious metals like gold and silver, even before he became a Bitcoin proponent. He believes that the assets are the best bets against inflation and the key to long-term generational wealth accumulation through economic cycles. “Don’t work or save fake money,” he advised. He has also repeatedly warned against putting funds in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), urging users to go for only direct ownership. “Get on your own decentralized gold, silver, and Bitcoin standard,” he added. Kiyosaki says Bitcoin is the best bet in trade turmoil Earlier this week, Kiyosaki posted a tweet detailing how major Japanese firms are adjusting their plans regarding the sales and production of their cars in the United States. Notably, the post concerns Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, with Nissan and Honda, in particular, canceling their plans for part of their automobile production in the United States. These firms are canceling things because of the tariffs imposed by United States President Donald Trump against China. Trump’s tariffs against imports from China have hit about 145%, with China also mirroring the same tactic against goods coming into the country from the US. In his post, Kiyosaki mentioned that people should be prepared for one of the biggest market crashes, urging them to purchase Bitcoin. “Regardless, gold, silver, and Bitcoin are still your defense in this global war caused by greed, insanity, and fear,” he said. Meanwhile, Kiyosaki is still not holding back about his predictions about the price of Bitcoin, with the author mentioning last month that the premier token could hit $1 million by 2035 as the US dollar continues to lose value as a result of the inflationary monetary policies. “I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $ 1 million, gold will be $30,000, and silver $3,000 a coin,” he said. Kiyosaki is not the only one with such confidence, with ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood saying that she sees Bitcoin hitting $1.5 million in 2030 should the demand for the asset rise. Eric Trump also predicted that the asset could hit $1 million very soon due to its scarcity. He said this while delivering a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at $103,469 as of press time, up by 0.5% in the last 24 hours and by 7.8% in the past week. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In the world of finance and technology, a quiet software development company just made a very loud statement. Next Technology Holdings , listed on the U.S. Nasdaq exchange, recently saw its stock price experience a truly dramatic surge. What was the catalyst? A significant increase in its Bitcoin holdings during the first quarter of the year. Dramatic Stock Jump: Next Technology Holdings Shares Soar On May 10th, investors watched in astonishment as shares of Next Technology Holdings skyrocketed, recording an incredible 740% increase. This wasn’t a gradual climb; it was a sudden, sharp upward movement that immediately captured the attention of the market. Such a substantial stock jump is rare, especially for established companies, and it signaled that something major had happened behind the scenes. The immediate explanation provided by the company pointed directly to its strategic financial moves in the preceding quarter. The market’s reaction was a clear indicator that investors viewed these moves, particularly those involving digital assets, very favorably. Fueling the Fire: The Significant Bitcoin Purchase Details The core reason for the market’s excitement was the announcement regarding Next Technology Holdings’ substantially increased Bitcoin reserves. As of March 31st, the company reported holding approximately 5,833 BTC. This figure represents a massive leap compared to their position at the end of the previous period (specifically, before the start of Q1 2024), when they held just 833 BTC. Let’s look at the numbers: Holdings Before Q1 2024: ~833 BTC Holdings as of March 31, 2024: ~5,833 BTC Increase in Q1 2024: ~5,000 BTC This Bitcoin purchase wasn’t a small, incremental addition. It was a large-scale acquisition, increasing their holdings by roughly 600% in just three months. The company explicitly stated that these substantial BTC holdings were acquired using capital raised through the issuance of stock and warrants in March. This funding mechanism allowed them to make a significant splash in the cryptocurrency market. Beyond the Balance Sheet: Why Cryptocurrency Investment is Gaining Traction Next Technology Holdings’ move is part of a broader trend where corporations are exploring cryptocurrency investment as a treasury strategy. While pioneers like MicroStrategy have been accumulating Bitcoin for years, more companies are starting to consider digital assets for various reasons: Store of Value: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Balance Sheet Optimization: Seeking potentially higher returns than traditional low-yield assets. Attracting Investors: Signaling innovation and forward-thinking to a market increasingly interested in the digital economy. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset class to their treasury reserves (though Bitcoin’s correlation varies). By using funds from stock and warrant issuances, Next Technology Holdings effectively leveraged investor capital to build its crypto reserves, a strategy that appears to have been well-received by the market, at least in the short term. A Nasdaq Success Story: Implications for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption The fact that a company listed on the prestigious Nasdaq exchange experienced such a positive market reaction to its Bitcoin strategy sends a strong signal. It suggests that mainstream financial markets are becoming more accepting, and even enthusiastic, about corporate exposure to cryptocurrencies. While significant BTC holdings come with inherent volatility risks, the market’s response to Next Technology Holdings highlights a growing appetite among investors for companies willing to strategically incorporate digital assets into their operations or balance sheets. This event could serve as an interesting case study and potentially encourage other publicly traded companies to explore similar strategies, albeit with careful consideration of the risks involved. What Does This Mean for Investors? For investors, this event underscores the potential impact of corporate treasury strategies on stock performance. Companies that successfully navigate the integration of digital assets might see their valuations influenced by both their core business performance and their crypto holdings. However, it also serves as a reminder that such investments tie a company’s fortunes, in part, to the volatile cryptocurrency market. In Conclusion Next Technology Holdings’ remarkable 740% stock jump following its substantial Bitcoin purchase in Q1 is a compelling example of how corporate cryptocurrency investment can dramatically impact market valuation. By significantly increasing its BTC holdings , funded through strategic capital raising, the Nasdaq -listed company captured investor attention and generated significant excitement. While the long-term implications and the inherent risks of holding volatile assets remain, this event clearly demonstrates the growing influence of Bitcoin on traditional financial markets and corporate strategy.

According to MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, a significant factor lies not just in external pressures, but within the very structure of the crypto market itself – specifically, the behavior of certain investors . Understanding the Bitcoin Market Rotation, According to Michael Saylor Michael Saylor, a well-known advocate and major holder of Bitcoin , recently shared his perspective on the current state of the market and what’s holding back the next major price milestone. Speaking on Natalie Brunell’s podcast on May 9th, Saylor pointed to a crucial dynamic: the presence of short-term oriented investors who are cashing out, counteracting the influx of new, potentially longer-term capital. He described this phenomenon as a ‘rotation’ within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Essentially, two different groups of participants are influencing the market’s trajectory: The Exiting Group: These are often early participants or those who entered with a speculative, short-term mindset. They may lack a deep economic conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and are quicker to sell during volatility or after modest gains. The Entering Group: This newer wave of investors is accessing BTC through more traditional or regulated channels. This includes significant inflows via spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States and corporations adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, following MicroStrategy’s pioneering lead. Saylor’s argument is that the selling pressure from the exiting short-term investors is absorbing the buying pressure from the entering long-term players, creating a temporary equilibrium or slowing down rapid price appreciation towards targets like the $150,000 mark for the BTC price . Why Short-Term Investors Impact the BTC Price The presence of short-term traders is a natural part of any market, but in a relatively young and volatile asset class like Bitcoin , their collective actions can have a pronounced effect on the BTC price in the short to medium term. Unlike long-term holders who believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value as digital gold or a global reserve asset, short-term traders are primarily focused on profiting from price swings. When a significant number of these investors decide to take profits, it increases the supply of Bitcoin on exchanges, which can counterbalance demand and prevent aggressive upward price movements. Saylor suggests that this current phase sees a substantial amount of such supply hitting the market, tempering the bullish momentum despite strong underlying demand from new sources. The Rise of New Investment Channels and Their Long-Term Impact One of the most significant developments Saylor highlighted is the emergence of new, accessible channels for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin . The approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year marked a watershed moment. These ETFs provide a regulated, familiar investment vehicle for institutional and retail investors who might have previously been hesitant or unable to invest directly in Bitcoin . The consistent inflow of capital into these ETFs demonstrates a strong, sustained demand from a new segment of the market – one that is often characterized by longer-term investment horizons compared to speculative retail trading. Furthermore, the concept of corporations holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, popularized by companies like MicroStrategy under Michael Saylor’s leadership, represents another layer of long-term demand. These aren’t speculative trades; they are strategic allocations aimed at preserving capital and hedging against inflation over years, if not decades. The rotation Saylor describes is therefore a transition from a market heavily influenced by native crypto participants and short-term traders to one increasingly shaped by traditional finance players and corporations with longer-term perspectives. While the exit of short-term holders might delay the immediate surge in BTC price , the entry of these new players lays a stronger foundation for future growth and stability in the crypto market . Shifting Government Stance: A Surprising Catalyst? Adding another layer to the evolving landscape, Saylor expressed surprise at the rapid shift in the U.S. government’s attitude towards Bitcoin . Historically, regulatory uncertainty and skepticism from authorities have been perceived as potential headwinds for Bitcoin’s adoption and price. However, recent developments, including the approval of spot ETFs and increasing dialogue between policymakers and the crypto industry, suggest a move towards greater clarity and potentially more favorable regulation. This shift could further accelerate institutional adoption and reinforce investors’ confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Saylor’s observation implies that this changing regulatory environment, combined with the new investment channels, is fundamentally altering the playing field for Bitcoin . It suggests that while short-term trading dynamics might cause temporary delays, the structural forces driving long-term adoption are strengthening, potentially paving the way for future price milestones like $150,000 and beyond. Key Takeaways for Bitcoin Investors What does this ‘rotation’ mean for you as a Bitcoin investor ? Here are some actionable insights: Long-Term Perspective: Saylor’s analysis reinforces the idea that Bitcoin’s true potential is realized over the long term. Short-term price movements influenced by trading activity may be noisy, but the fundamental adoption trend by institutions and corporations is a powerful underlying force. Understand the Market Dynamics: Recognize that periods of sideways movement or pullbacks can be influenced by profit-taking from short-term holders. This doesn’t necessarily invalidate the long-term bullish case driven by increasing demand from new channels. New Entrants Matter: The growing accessibility through ETFs and corporate adoption signifies maturing market infrastructure and broader acceptance, which are crucial for sustainable growth of the crypto market . Stay Informed on Regulation: Keep an eye on regulatory developments, particularly in major economies like the U.S., as they can significantly impact institutional participation and overall market sentiment towards Bitcoin . While the path to $150,000 might be influenced by the ebb and flow of different types of investors , the underlying trend of increasing adoption and strengthening infrastructure, highlighted by figures like Michael Saylor , suggests a positive long-term outlook for the BTC price . Summary: Navigating Bitcoin’s Path Forward In conclusion, Michael Saylor’s recent comments provide valuable insight into the current state of the Bitcoin market. He posits that the anticipated surge towards significant price levels like $150,000 is being temporarily held back by the natural cycle of short-term investors exiting the market. However, this is happening concurrently with a significant influx of new capital from longer-term focused players entering through channels like ETFs and corporate treasury allocations. This ‘rotation’ is a sign of a maturing market, transitioning from being dominated by early adopters and speculators to attracting traditional finance and corporate interest. Coupled with a surprisingly evolving regulatory landscape in the U.S., these factors paint a picture of a market undergoing fundamental shifts that, while potentially delaying immediate price targets, are building a more robust foundation for Bitcoin’s future growth and its journey towards becoming a globally recognized and adopted asset class.

And now, with a new pro-crypto wave hitting Washington, Ripple’s strategy might just be what kickstarts the next chapter for the entire industry. Lauren Belive, Ripple’s Global Co-Head of Policy, recently shared how the company didn’t just survive the SEC’s crackdown, but helped reshape U.S. crypto policy from the inside out. ‘Proactive Engagement Is Essential,’ Says Lauren Belive In a recent Crypto in One Minute video, Belive stressed the importance of engaging with regulators early and often – not just in Washington, but around the world. Showing up matters. In one minute, @BeliveLauren , Ripple’s Global Co-Head of Policy, explains why proactive engagement and education with regulators and policymakers in Washington D.C. (and globally) is essential to building a smart, responsible framework for crypto… pic.twitter.com/UIlokGThdw — Ripple (@Ripple) May 9, 2025 Her main point is that crypto companies can’t afford to sit on the sidelines. Education and open conversations with lawmakers are critical to building rules that protect users and allow innovation to thrive. Ripple’s Legal Fight: How It All Started Ripple’s battle with the SEC began in December 2020, just as SEC Chairman Jay Clayton was leaving office. On his last day, he hit Ripple with a lawsuit, accusing it of selling unregistered securities through XRP. Then came Gary Gensler. Under his leadership, the SEC became even more aggressive, filing over 100 lawsuits against crypto firms – including keeping the pressure on Ripple. 2024 was a tough year for the company. With the Biden administration still in office, Ripple stayed on the defense but didn’t back down. After all, they weren’t just fighting for themselves – they were pushing for clear, fair rules across the board. 2025 Settlement: A Turning Point for Ripple and U.S. Crypto The long legal fight finally came to an end in 2025. With Paul S. Atkins stepping in as the new SEC Chair , things shifted. Atkins brought a more balanced, crypto-friendly approach, and Ripple reached a settlement with the SEC. It helped reshape the direction of U.S. crypto regulation . Ripple was finally validated. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple vs SEC Settlement Makes XRP the Sole Regulated Crypto in The U.S , Ripple’s Political Strategy: Showing Up and Speaking Out ! Belive revealed that the company made a real push to be part of the political conversation. Ripple invested time and resources into educating lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. They supported both the Democratic and Republican national committees, and actively participated throughout the campaign season. “We went to the DNC. We invested in the RNC. We participated throughout the campaign cycle,” Belive said. This kind of direct involvement helped bring in what she calls “the most pro-crypto Congress” the U.S. has ever seen along with a president who’s open to blockchain innovation. Now, the company is working alongside Congress to help build a fair, forward-looking regulatory framework – one that encourages growth but keeps investor protections in place. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With President Trump’s announcement of a fresh UK trade deal adding further fuel to global market optimism, crypto is once again dominating headlines. The milestone not only marks a psychological turning point but also signals renewed confidence in the digital asset space, driving significant activity across altcoins. This renewed maarket energy is reflected in surging trading volumes, aggressive token moves, and rising community engagement. As Bitcoin crosses this historic threshold, capital is flowing swiftly into projects that demonstrate real-world value, solid fundamentals, and clear roadmaps. Amid this spike, Solana is gaining attention for its policy reforms around validator decentralization, Immutable X is climbing on the back of Web3 gaming expansion, and one rising name— Qubetics —is attracting early buyers thanks to its presale momentum and real utility in blockchain interoperability. Qubetics ($TICS) is not chasing relevance—it’s building it. While most blockchain networks continue to operate in silos, Qubetics is positioning itself as the Web3 aggregator that breaks those barriers by enabling seamless communication across leading blockchains. This focus on interoperability isn’t theoretical; it’s the foundation for making cross-chain functionality practical for real use cases. Meanwhile, Solana is making structural shifts to broaden participation in its validator ecosystem, and Immutable X is catching the attention of developers and gamers alike with its onboarding tools and surging traction in Web3 gaming. As the market heats up, these three projects are standing out in discussions around the most potential crypto of 2025—each for very different reasons, and each carrying distinct opportunities for participants navigating this next phase of the crypto market. Qubetics’ Real-World Fix: Making Blockchain Interoperability Work for Everyone Qubetics stands apart as a true infrastructure layer—not just a blockchain, but a framework that enables other blockchains to talk to each other. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics links networks like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana into a unified ecosystem where users and developers can transfer assets, access apps, and execute functions without switching platforms. This shift toward interoperability addresses one of the longest-standing issues in the blockchain space: siloed systems that can’t effectively share data or work together. For example, a DeFi application running on Ethereum can now communicate with an NFT marketplace on Solana or manage liquidity across multiple chains without additional middleware. Qubetics doesn’t just remove complexity—it adds efficiency. The application layer of Qubetics is powerful for all types of users. Think of a mid-sized logistics company managing real-time supply chain data across multiple jurisdictions. With Qubetics, that company could connect systems running on different chains, reducing costs and ensuring transparency. A Web3 startup could deploy on one blockchain but benefit from features on another, increasing their market reach. Even average users benefit by not having to jump between wallets or interfaces. By simplifying these interactions, Qubetics supports both scale and accessibility. It’s not just a backend tool—it’s a bridge to broader adoption, and this core utility cements its place as the most potential crypto poised for sustainable relevance in an increasingly multi-chain world. Qubetics Presale: Where Utility Meets Opportunity in the Most Potential Crypto Market Right now, the Qubetics presale is generating serious traction—and for good reason. It’s currently in Stage 33, priced at $0.2302 per $TICS token, with over 511 million coins already sold. The structured format is clear: each stage lasts only 7 days and ends every Sunday at 12 AM sharp, followed by an automatic 10% price increase. This creates a consistent, transparent buying experience and encourages early action, especially for those hunting the most potential crypto opportunities before the next leg of the market moves. As of now, the crypto presale has raised more than $16.8 million and attracted over 26,000 token holders. And with the Qubetics mainnet set to launch in Q2 2025, many early adopters are positioning themselves ahead of what could be a pivotal rollout. The projected returns here are eye-opening. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, participants could see a return of 334.33%. If it climbs to $5, the ROI shoots to 2,071.63%. A $6 valuation brings that to 2,505.96%, and at $10, it’s a staggering 4,243.26%. If the token reaches $15, the ROI peaks at 6,414.90%. For instance, someone contributing $2,000 today would acquire approximately 8,684 tokens. At a $10 valuation, that would translate to $86,840—an aggressive growth trajectory not often seen in this market. These figures not only validate the hype around the Qubetics presale, but also explain why it’s being widely considered the best crypto presale currently open. Immutable X Rallies 11.54% as Web3 Gaming Gains Market Momentum Immutable X (IMX) has recorded a strong +11.54% price surge in the last 24 hours, with the token currently priced at $0.64489. Backed by a market cap of $1.17 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $70.94 million, this move reflects growing confidence in the protocol’s positioning within the Web3 gaming sector. IMX is now up 19.06% over the past 60 days, building on long-term optimism and increased platform engagement. The circulating supply currently stands at 1.82 billion, and this recent momentum marks a potential reversal from its previous 90-day drop of -13.99%. Much of the renewed interest around Immutable X is fueled by its expanding reach in gaming, bolstered by strong technical execution and rising ecosystem adoption. The token’s current breakout comes during a wider market rally, with Bitcoin surpassing $100K and altcoins gaining renewed traction. With key metrics turning green and community sentiment on the rise, IMX is once again being seen by many as a contender among the most potential crypto assets in the Web3 utility space. Solana’s Validator Reform Fuels Ecosystem Expansion Solana has taken a definitive step toward decentralization by reshaping how validators operate within its network. In a recent move, the Solana Foundation confirmed that it would no longer delegate stake to validators who have relied heavily on the Foundation’s support over long periods. This policy aims to reduce dependency and shift power back to the community, supporting a healthier distribution of network responsibility. It’s a foundational change, signaling Solana’s commitment to sustainable scaling and long-term ecosystem integrity. This realignment is expected to increase confidence among developers and community participants looking for decentralized networks with transparent governance structures. The impact is already evident in Solana’s broader metrics. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana recently rose from $6.1 billion to $7.65 billion—a 25% increase in under a month. At the same time, the stablecoin market cap hit a record $13 billion, with USDC dominating at 77% of that total. These numbers confirm more than just community sentiment—they reflect active engagement and platform trust. As developers rally around Solana’s ecosystem, the project continues to attract early adopters eyeing scalable infrastructure with growing liquidity support. Amid today’s bull run, this strategic shift puts Solana in prime position to benefit from the rising market interest in purpose-built DeFi ecosystems. Market Trend Analysis: How Bitcoin’s Surge Is Lifting These Three Contenders Bitcoin’s push past $100,000 is bigger than a headline—it’s a signal. The move is catalyzing renewed optimism across the crypto space, creating bullish conditions that benefit not only large-cap assets but also rising projects with real tech. Qubetics, Solana, and Immutable X are three such examples—each operating in a different vertical, but all positioned to ride the wave of this market surge. For Qubetics in particular, the ongoing crypto presale offers structured growth, with its built-in price increase mechanism ensuring predictability and rewarding early movers every week. While Solana’s validator reforms reflect an internal strengthening, and Immutable X capitalizes on external adoption through gaming, Qubetics benefits from the sheer utility of enabling all blockchains to work together. These types of real-world functions are more relevant than ever in a market that’s favoring platforms with tangible, near-term value. As confidence returns to the crypto market, these three tokens are set to benefit from the capital inflow and renewed demand across user segments. Why These Three Projects Stand Out in a Recharged Crypto Market With the crypto space heating up again, knowing which projects truly have staying power is key. Qubetics has emerged as a breakout contender by solving the interoperability challenges that have held blockchain adoption back for years. Its modular design, cross-chain flexibility, and structured crypto presale framework offer a real-world solution with long-term upside. Solana’s validator reforms and rising TVL reinforce its place as a DeFi heavyweight with serious backing and strategic foresight. Immutable X, meanwhile, is executing flawlessly in the Web3 gaming sector, combining user experience with institutional-grade partnerships. Each of these three projects answers a different need in the current ecosystem—communication, infrastructure, and engagement—and each has the momentum and clarity to sustain relevance beyond the current bull phase, cementing their status as some of the most potential crypto offerings available. For early buyers scanning for opportunities, the chance to join this best crypto presale with Qubetics might offer one of the sharpest ROIs this cycle has to offer—particularly as utility, not just hype, becomes the primary driver of project value.

Qubetics is widely considered among the most potential crypto options due to its interoperability use case and structured presale. What is Solana doing to improve decentralization? Solana is shifting away from internal validator reliance by removing Foundation delegation to long-term validators, encouraging community-driven node support. How is Immutable X growing its user base? Through tools like Immutable Passport and ongoing developer partnerships, Immutable X has onboarded over 4 million users and now supports 440+ live games.

Vance will make history as the first serving US vice president to speak at an event dedicated to digital assets, marking a significant milestone for both the political and crypto communities. According to a statement from the organizers released in early May, Vance is scheduled to address conference attendees later that month at The Venetian as part of the “Code + Country” program, with his remarks expected to reach a global audience. His appearance follows in the footsteps of Donald Trump, who spoke at the same event during his presidential campaign the previous year. Bitcoin in Government Circles Vance is personally invested in Bitcoin, with financial disclosures indicating his crypto holdings are substantial. Since taking office with President Trump in January, however, the vice president has mostly kept a low profile on cryptocurrency policy, choosing instead to focus on topics like artificial intelligence regulation. Meanwhile, President Trump has already signed executive orders related to the creation of a national crypto reserve and the regulation of stablecoins, signaling direct White House involvement in the digital asset sector. The same May conference will also feature appearances by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, both connected to the crypto platform World Liberty Financial. This has sparked concern among lawmakers, who fear that the Trump-backed platform could be used for the personal enrichment of the president and his family. Crypto Controversies and Legislative Gridlock The announcement of the vice president’s participation comes during a week of heightened scrutiny in Congress. House and Senate Democrats have sharply criticized Trump’s ties to the crypto industry. House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters paused a joint hearing on digital asset market structure and is leading a group of lawmakers investigating what they describe as “Trump’s crypto corruption.” In the Senate, several Democrats blocked a key vote on stablecoin legislation, citing a lack of safeguards and raising concerns about the Trump family’s potential enrichment through the stablecoin USD1, issued by World Liberty Financial. Vance’s keynote at Bitcoin 2025 is expected to focus on themes such as financial independence, technological innovation, and the evolving role of Bitcoin in US economic policy. His presence at the world’s largest Bitcoin conference highlights the increasing influence of digital assets in American political life and the ongoing debate about how government officials should engage with the rapidly growing crypto industry. Innovation and Networking at Bitcoin 2025 Bitcoin 2025 is set to be more than just a conference-it’s a dynamic hub for innovation, education, and collaboration within the cryptocurrency sector. Held at The Venetian in Las Vegas, the event will bring together thousands of participants, including developers, policymakers, investors, and industry leaders from around the world. Attendees can expect a packed agenda featuring keynote speeches, hands-on workshops, and panel discussions on the latest trends in blockchain technology, regulatory developments, and digital finance. The expo hall will showcase cutting-edge products and services, while networking events and afterparties will create opportunities for meaningful connections. This environment is designed to foster new ideas, drive partnerships, and accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin as both a technology and a practical financial tool.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-10 12:51:17

According to Rocko , XRP is poised to hit the $10 mark by the end of Q2 2025, especially given recent legal and market developments. The Perfect Storm for XRP Rocko’s assertion comes after the official conclusion of the long-standing SEC versus Ripple case, which saw XRP emerge as the only regulated cryptocurrency in the United States. This monumental outcome has reignited investor confidence, propelling XRP into the spotlight as one of the most promising digital assets in the current market. Trump saying to go buy US stocks and they will be like a ROCKETSHIP! SEC Case against #Ripple all over! This is the time for $XRP to reach its goal! Drop a LIKE if you are buying $XRP , $10 by end of Q2 2025 pic.twitter.com/SKQayJfdhw — WSB Trader Rocko (@traderrocko) May 9, 2025 In his post, Rocko also referenced a recent statement from former U.S. President Donald Trump, who encouraged Americans to invest in U.S. stocks, predicting that they would perform like a ‘rocket ship.’ Drawing parallels, Rocko suggested that just as Trump expects a boom in traditional equities, XRP is primed for explosive growth within the crypto market. Why $10 by Q2 2025? Rocko’s price prediction of $10 is not just speculative hype; it is grounded in a series of strategic catalysts. The finalization of the SEC case has removed a significant legal hurdle, clearing the path for broader adoption and institutional involvement. Additionally, XRP’s status as a regulated asset in the U.S. has positioned it favorably for integration into mainstream financial systems. Market sentiment around XRP has shifted markedly positive, with major exchanges relisting the token and trading volumes surging. Analysts argue that the newfound regulatory clarity could attract significant capital inflows, bolstering liquidity and driving price appreciation. Community Reaction and Bullish Sentiment The XRP community has largely embraced Rocko’s bullish outlook, with many investors expressing renewed confidence in the token’s future. The $10 target aligns with longstanding community hopes for a major breakout, especially following a prolonged period of regulatory uncertainty. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, some traders remain cautiously optimistic, emphasizing that while the SEC case resolution is a major win, external factors such as macroeconomic conditions and broader crypto market dynamics could still impact price movements. Nonetheless, Rocko’s optimistic projection has sparked enthusiasm and buying interest. The Road to $10: Key Factors to Watch For XRP to hit the $10 mark by the end of Q2 2025, several factors must align. First, sustained institutional adoption will be crucial. Ripple’s expanding partnerships and use cases in cross-border payments could be pivotal growth drivers. Moreover, the broader crypto market sentiment, driven by factors like Bitcoin’s performance and regulatory clarity, will also play a significant role. Investors will also closely monitor the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and its impact on risk assets. Should the macroeconomic environment remain favorable, coupled with increased XRP utility, the $10 target may be within reach. As the dust settles from Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, XRP’s future looks increasingly promising. WSB Trader Rocko’s projection of a $10 price by mid-2025 reflects optimism and a belief in the asset’s underlying value proposition. While the journey to that price point is far from guaranteed, the prevailing sentiment is hope and resilience within the XRP community. Whether Rocko’s forecast comes to fruition or not, one thing is clear: the next few months will be pivotal for XRP’s journey to its ambitious goal.

However, less than two weeks later, the imageboard was back online, defiant as ever. “4chan is back,” an official blog post proclaimed . “No other website can replace it, or this community. No matter how hard it is, we are not giving up.” The imageboard has left its mark on the world in many consequential ways, birthing countless memes and conspiracy theories, serving as a platform for political movements ranging from the alt-right to Anonymous, and acting as a dumping ground for leaks and hacks of all sorts. Crypto is no exception, with 4chan also a historically influential gathering place to share altcoin alpha, coordinate campaigns to pump tokens, share price prophesies and more. With the imageboard back from the dead, here are just a few of the ways it has influenced the crypto space during its storied history. Finding alpha on 4chan’s /Biz/ imageboard The primary hub of crypto activity on 4chan is its /Biz/, or “Business & Finance,” imageboard, where traders, gamblers, investors and commentators gather to share info, shill tokens, and discuss the state of the crypto industry at large. The imageboard has gathered a reputation for being a place where intrepid investors can go to learn about moonshot tokens the broader community has yet to discover, though X and Telegram have since given 4chan a run for its money. It has also been ground zero for countless shilling campaigns that have helped pump prices for various tokens. A Reddit user shares some tokens they discovered early on, thanks to /Biz/. Source: Deleted Reddit account /Biz/ has also become known for the various prophecies, lore and legends that emerge from its anonymous users. People who claim to have inside knowledge on major market movements often leak alleged secret info on the imageboard or issue prophecies, and every once in a while, they actually turn out to be accurate. In January 2019, a user correctly predicted that Bitcoin ( BTC ) would hit $5,300 by April and $9,200 by July, sparking huge interest online . Unfortunately, their remaining price predictions quickly fell short of reality, including that Bitcoin would hit $87,000 by October 2020. Another user claimed in May 2021 to work at a Chinese firm that collaborated closely with the government and said they had insider information that Bitcoin would sell off due to major news out of China. A few hours later, reports emerged that China would ban payment companies and financial institutions from offering services related to crypto transactions, and Bitcoin sold off . /Biz/ was also the source of a June 2017 rumor that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had died in a car crash. The fake news led to Ether’s ( ETH ) market cap crashing by $4 billion before Buterin stepped in to share that he had, in fact, not died. The fake news that Vitalik Buterin had died in a car crash started on /Biz/. Source: Warosu Chainlink and the LINK Marines Perhaps the most successful shilling campaign to come out of 4chan is that of Chainlink ( LINK ), which saw a massive rally that started in 2020 and continued into 2021 . Many of the oracle project’s most diehard community members, known as the LINK Marines, first discovered Chainlink on /Biz/. Much of the excitement among the early Chainlink community was galvanized by a mysterious figure known as “ AssBlaster ,” who claimed to have insider knowledge about the project and would share alpha on /Biz/. Source: Warosu The LINK Marines relentlessly promoted Chainlink on 4chan and social media platforms, and by 2020, LINK had experienced its first major rally — from $1.80 at the start of the year to a high of $16.64 on Aug. 12. Following the rally, Mechanism Capital co-founder Andrew Kang declared that “4chan has become the largest market driver” in crypto, “more powerful than even China or institutional crypto fund capital.” Related: Mechanism Capital founder doubles Bitcoin position with a $200M long LINK went on in 2021 to hit an all-time high of $49.54, becoming one of the year’s most talked-about crypto success stories. LINK’s price exploded to nearly $50 in 2021. Source: CoinMarketCap LINK Marine Albert Nazarov told Cointelegraph Magazine in March 2021 that “4chan is basically a crucible of raw thoughts; the best and balanced make it to the top. It’s almost anything goes there, and it trains the brain to decipher good info from bad stuff.” Chainlink remains the third most mentioned stock or cryptocurrency on /Biz/ over the last 24 hours as of the time of writing, behind only Bitcoin and Ether. Pepe the Frog and memes galore One of the most well-recognized memes associated with 4chan is Pepe the Frog, though its origins have nothing to do with the imageboard. Pepe was created by artist Matt Furie back in 2005 for a comic titled Boy’s Club. Over the next several years, Pepe was popularized by 4chan and eventually became a mainstream meme. But in 2015, posters from 4chan’s /R9k/ board decided to “reclaim” Pepe and began a campaign to intentionally associate it with the far right. Nevertheless, the frog remains a popular meme on 4chan and in crypto circles. In the cryptosphere, Pepe became closely associated with Chainlink. Sanctum CEO Tyler Ward, who sparked a Pepe non-fungible token (NFT) craze in 2021, told Magazine, “When Chainlink started doing well, it just became this cultish prophecy of 4chan, and 4chan really likes Pepe the frog, so it was kind of this merger.” “A lot of people that posted about Chainlink would post with Pepe the Frog, and they kind of became intertwined.” Crypto’s obsession with Pepe the Frog has since grown significantly beyond its early association with Chainlink. In 2023, the memecoin Pepe ( PEPE ), named after the frog, was launched and quickly became popular among traders. The token truly took off in 2024 amid the memecoin mania, going from a $591-million market cap at the start of the year to $11 billion by December , flipping Uniswap’s UNI ( UNI ) token. But Pepe is not the only 4chan meme to be tokenized and explode in price. Mog Coin ( MOG ), a memecoin based on the phrase “mogging” — dominating, outclassing or outshining others — gained 1,800% in early 2024. According to CoinGecko, 4chan-themed memecoins command a $37-billion market cap as of May 8. The popular phrase “we’re all gonna make it,” or WAGMI, was also popularized on 4chan. It was borrowed from Australian bodybuilder Aziz “Zyzz” Shavershian, who would frequently post on the Bodybuilding.com forum as well as 4chan’s fitness board and who passed away in 2011. It later made its way into crypto around 2017, seemingly as users who had been active in online fitness communities got into digital assets. Source: Snoop Dogg Despite the growing attention platforms like Telegram and X command among the crypto community, 4chan remains a cultural powerhouse, and these are just a handful of the ways it has influenced crypto culture and markets. And with 4chan back online and seemingly fully committed to continuing its operations, they won’t be its final influences — at least as long as 4chan can avoid being taken down for good.

Robert Kiyosaki says ditch ‘fake money’ for Bitcoin, gold, and silver Robert Kiyosaki, businessman and best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , is once again sounding the alarm on the dangers of centralized monetary policy, urging his followers to abandon what he calls “fake money” and adopt alternatives like Bitcoin , gold, and silver. In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul. Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed , described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control. Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns. “Fake money leads to dishonest money, dishonest statistics, dishonest accounting, dishonest balance sheets, dishonest compensation, dishonest relations, dishonest leaders, and corruption in everyday life,” Kiyosaki wrote. He called on Americans to “fight back” by opting out of fiat systems and instead embracing decentralized stores of value like Bitcoin (BTC) and precious metals.

The fund has now extended its inflow streak to 19 consecutive days — its longest run of inflows so far this year. IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1 . Over the past trading week alone, IBIT posted $1.03 billion in inflows, according to Farside data. Prior to the current 19-day streak, IBIT’s longest inflow streak in 2025 was a nine-day stretch surrounding US President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, spanning from Jan. 15 to Jan. 28.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $2,890.24 and a minimum price of $2,528.96. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $4,696.64 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Binance coin Token BNB Price $652 (+2.3%) Market Cap $92.01 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $2.46 Billion (+6.75%) Circulating Supply 140.88M BNB All-time High $788.84 Dec 04, 2024 All-time Low $0.09611 Oct 19, 2017 24-hour High $677.35 24-hour Low $631.92 Binance coin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility 1.87% 50-Day SMA $603.39 14-Day RSI 74.82 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green Days 18/30 (60%) 200-Day SMA $ 623.79 Binance coin price analysis: BNB devalues to $648 amidst downside TL;DR Breakdown: Binance Coin price analysis confirmed a downtrend at $648. Cryptocurrency gained 2.1% of its value. BNB coin prices seek a support level at $644. On May 10, 2025, Binance Coin price analysis revealed a downward trend. The altcoin value has dropped down to $648 in the last 24 hours. However, it gained buyers’ support around the dip and rebounded strongly. As a result, the altcoin gained around 2.3% in the last 24 hours. Bears are currently aiming to gain the control after BNB recorded massive gains recently. BNB/USDT price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of Binance Coin confirmed a declining trend for the altcoin. The cryptocurrency value dropped toward $648 level. A red candlestick on the price chart signifies a rising bearish resistance. However, buyers quickly gained control and rebounded the price toward $652. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening, leading to an increasing volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the immediate support, has shifted to $647.8. BNB/USDT shows domination between traders The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present close to the overbought area. The indicator’s value has dropped down to index 69.11 today. This decline confirms a bearish market trend for the currency. BNB price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Binance Coin referred to a downward trend in the market. The BNB/USD value rebounded to $652 the past four hours. The rising volatility signifies a higher chance of an upcoming reversal. The Bollinger bands are widening, leading to a rising volatility. This rise in volatility signals a higher market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $666.31, indicating the resistance. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $584.60, securing the support. Binance Coin descends to $654.88 The RSI indicator is present above the overbought area for now. Its value has decreased to index 71.50 in the past few hours. The current overbought condition might strengthen the chances of a bearish reversal in the coming hours.

Binance Coin price analysis gives out a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The BNB/USD value dropped toward the low of $648 but it later rebounded quickly. From an overall analysis, if the altcoin maintains its current recovery, it might trigger a retest of the breakdown level at $666. A failure to maintain the current buying demand might send the price below the immediate support of $644. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,696.64 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB’s price faced strong selling pressure toward $648. However, this price dip triggered strong accumulation, resulting in a rebound rally above $650. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,696.64 by 2031. Recent news/opinion on BNB CZ shared a tweet by Elja, a crypto enthusiast, who said that the stablecoin supply on BNB chain has increased by $2.1 billion over the past three days that is from 28th to 30th April 2025.

It is important to consider that the predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested before investing in the volatile market. Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, a level it continues to maintain above in May.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-10 13:15:59

Top U.S. and China officials are also currently in Switzerland, trying to reach an agreement that will lead to lower tariffs. Beijing’s delegation to the Switzerland talks will be led by Vice Premier He Lifeng, a close ally of Xi Jinping, who is expected to take a hardline stance against Trump’s escalating trade offensive. The hope is that a trade deal between the U.S. and its top trading partners (i.e., China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico) would reduce recession risks and raise the odds of Federal Reserve cuts. Top analysts are highly bullish on Bitcoin. In a note to clients this week, Standard Chartered analysts apologized for their $120,000 price target, arguing that it was too low. They still expect Bitcoin to end the year at $200,000 . BlackRock, the biggest asset manager globally, predicts that Bitcoin’s price will surge to $700,000 over time. In a September white paper , the analysts noted that Bitcoin had become a safe-haven asset that is uncorrelated with stocks. They also highlighted its strong performance compared to equities after key crises like Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war.

That valuation would make it bigger than the U.S. and China GDP, combined. Tom Lee, the popular founder of FundStrat, believes that Bitcoin will jump to $250,000 this year, while Chamath Palihapitiya sees it jumping to $500,000. Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, sees it jumping to $250,000.

WHY BITCOIN is a better asset than gold or silver: One reason why I trust Bitcoin is there are only to ever be 21 million. I own gold and silver mines and oil wells.

At the same time, Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges continues to fall and is at its lowest level in five years. Bitcoin price technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that Bitcoin has remained in an uptrend for a long time. Its recent retreat found substantial support at the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since November 2022. Bitcoin also remains above the upper side of the cup and handle pattern at $68,835 and the 50-week moving average. It now must cross the all-time high at $109,300, and more gains will follow. The likely price target in this cycle will be $123,000, which is derived by measuring the cup’s depth and then the same distance from the upper side.

Readers will discover which of these coins show strong potential for growth. NEAR Protocol: Short-Term Rally Amid Long-Term Setbacks Last month NEAR witnessed a 44.47% uplift with an 8.47% weekly gain, contrasting sharply with a 40.63% drop over the past six months. The coin experienced volatile swings that marked brief recoveries amid deeper price declines. Historical movement reflects a market where short-term rally bursts have not erased longer-term bearish pressure. The current trading range sits between $1.95 and $2.86, with bulls pushing near a resistance of $3.25 and support firm at $1.43. A secondary resistance of $4.17 adds caution while a lower support at $0.51 offers a safety net. Momentum and an RSI around 63 signal a balanced mood, suggesting trades could focus on buying near support and aiming for potential breakouts at resistance levels. Aave: Short-Term Surge and Steady Long-Term Climb Aave ’s last month saw a rally of over 63%, while the half-year performance remained modest with gains close to 5%. The price has bounced amid short-term energy and slower, steadier growth over six months. The price history reflects an active trading environment in the past month, marked by significant momentum, contrasting with the more subdued progress observed over the longer period. Currently, Aave trades between $125 and $191 with support near $87 and resistance around $217. Bulls are showing strength, indicated by an 18% weekly rise, although an RSI near 71 suggests caution. Traders can look for opportunities with a break above $217 or consider entries near the support level for potential upward movement. GALA Price Action: Monthly Surge Amid Mixed 6-Month Trends GALA delivered a strong monthly surge, climbing over 53%. However, a 22% decline over the past six months indicates significant volatility. The asset showed a fast rebound in the short term following pressure, marking a shift from earlier downward trends. These fluctuations highlight dynamic market behavior as GALA experienced rapid gains despite past losses. Current trading ranges lie between $0.0125 and $0.0203, with nearby resistance at $0.0235 and solid support at $0.0080. Moderately bullish sentiment is visible, with an RSI near 61, though the trend lacks clarity. Trading within these limits suggests monitoring for potential breakouts or reversals while exercising caution. Conclusion Markets are showing signs of activity. NEAR , AAVE , and GALA have been noteworthy. Their movements should be tracked. Each coin has unique factors that could push its value higher. Observing their performance could provide insights. While Bitcoin's trend remains a key indicator, these coins may also see significant gains. Keep a close watch on market changes. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

44425357,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-blackrock-meets-with-sec-to-discuss-cryptocurrency-regulation,1746883255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/44425357.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now As BlackRock Meets With SEC To Discuss Cryptocurrency Regulation,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-blackrock-meets-with-sec-to-discuss-cryptocurrency-regulation,"BlackRock isn’t just a heavyweight in traditional finance—it’s become one of crypto’s most consistent institutional advocates. While many firms kept a cautious distance from digital assets in recent years, BlackRock made quiet but deliberate moves toward deeper engagement, from launching Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to investing heavily in Bitcoin-exposed companies. Now, as the space matures and regulation inches closer to clarity, BlackRock is once again stepping to the front of the conversation. In its latest initiative, the $10 trillion asset manager has opened direct lines with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, sitting down with the agency’s Crypto Task Force to talk staking frameworks, tokenization of securities, and the evolving expectations around crypto-based ETFs. Why This Meeting Matters for Crypto’s Future BlackRock’s recent meeting with the SEC wasn’t just a routine check-in—it was a signal that the world’s largest asset manager is preparing for a deeper role in the next phase of crypto regulation. The firm walked regulators through its growing suite of crypto products, from its flagship iShares Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts to its tokenized liquidity fund. But the key topics went far beyond product pitches. BlackRock engaged the SEC in discussions about how staking can be legally structured within exchange-traded products—a matter of serious regulatory debate. They also raised questions about tokenizing traditional securities and how those might fit within existing frameworks. These are the kinds of nuanced conversations that could influence the next wave of ETF approvals and set new compliance standards. At a time when Bitcoin has just crossed $100,000 and geopolitical shifts are driving fresh momentum into digital assets, this kind of institutional-regulator collaboration couldn’t be more timely. For investors, it means one thing: the guardrails are coming, and BlackRock wants a say in how they’re built. That’s good news for legitimacy, liquidity, and the broader evolution of crypto as an asset class. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Utility-Driven Undervalued Gems SUBBD SUBBD introduces a tokenized framework for creators who want more control—not just over distribution, but over how access, monetization, and audience interaction are structured from the start. Using the $SUBBD token, creators can lock content, segment access levels, and reward their communities directly without third-party platforms dictating the terms. This structure is built for clarity. Every interaction—whether it’s a tip, a vote, or access to premium material—is settled transparently through the token. That level of traceability aligns with the kind of mechanics regulators are now evaluating more seriously. In fact, BlackRock’s recent meeting with the SEC to discuss token design and staking principles places renewed focus on utility-first models like this one. SUBBD isn’t bogged down by unnecessary governance. It doesn’t require users to wade through whitepapers to understand what they’re buying into. The product is clear, and the token is what makes it work. With integrations already underway for major creator tools and social extensions, its ecosystem continues to expand without losing coherence. As debates around how tokens should be classified intensify, SUBBD may find itself in favorable territory—not because it’s trying to be compliant, but because it was designed with usability in mind from the start. In a content economy where transparency and ownership are becoming central issues, this project’s timing and structure feel well-aligned with what’s unfolding on the institutional level. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet has taken what should be the default standard for crypto management and made it seamless. It supports over 60 blockchains, lets users track real-time performance, swap tokens via an accessible DEX, stake, and even explore presales from inside a unified mobile app. No extensions, no bridging tools—everything flows through a system that works immediately out of the box. $BEST powers this entire operation. Holding it means more than just speculation: users get fee reductions, access to exclusive features, staking perks, and governance rights within the wallet ecosystem. The airdrop mechanism rewards actual usage, meaning participation is continuously incentivized. This isn’t just important for user experience—it speaks to a larger shift in how regulators are beginning to approach infrastructure projects. In recent talks with BlackRock, the SEC has focused on how staking yields are structured and how custody rules apply to token-backed applications. Best Wallet’s architecture, where tokens interact with live features rather than speculative mechanisms, positions it closer to that emerging compliance standard. 🔥 Over $12M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and swap across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/RDGvIhPLRo — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) May 6, 2025 With over $12 million raised already, it’s also relevant for institutions and everyday traders alike. While most wallets are still feature-sparse or chain-limited, Best Wallet quietly covers all the bases without shouting about it. Its token, meanwhile, avoids fluff and sits at the center of real, ongoing use. That’s rare. And if regulation is headed toward clarity and consistency, this project is already there. MIND of Pepe MIND of Pepe doesn’t operate like most tokens. It isn't pushing a character, a theme, or a viral gimmick. Instead, it acts as a key to a constantly updating stream of market insight. The project’s AI engine tracks meme coin traction in real time—scanning wallets, social media, and behavioral data to identify patterns before they appear in price action. What makes this interesting now is that BlackRock’s recent discussion with the SEC touched on how data-driven mechanisms could shape the structure of future staking products and ETF approvals. In that light, MIND of Pepe begins to look like more than just a meme ecosystem—it becomes a signal layer that offers meaningful insight into crypto attention markets. Holders of $MIND gain access to trend diagnostics, early alert systems, and eventually, a say in how the AI itself is refined. The data isn’t surface-level either. The engine picks up on things like wallet clustering before project announcements, sudden shifts in Telegram engagement, and unusual liquidity movements tied to meme-based assets. This makes MIND of Pepe part analytics, part automation, and part community research tool. And in an industry that still reacts more than it prepares, those insights hold serious value. Especially now, as the line between speculation and structure is being redrawn at high levels. MIND of Pepe may have started with a meme—but it’s evolving into something built to outlast one. Solaxy Solaxy is quietly solving a problem that major exchanges, developers, and now regulators have all acknowledged: bridging is broken. Most cross-chain activity relies on wrappers and synthetic tokens—systems that are slow, fragile, and often exploit-prone. Solaxy avoids this entirely by allowing seamless asset movement and contract execution across Ethereum and Solana, with no wrapping or complicated middle layers. This kind of structural cleanliness is becoming increasingly important as the SEC begins evaluating how token liquidity and throughput affect ETF compliance and staking models. Solaxy’s native token, SOLX, supports validator operations, governs bandwidth usage, and anchors the fee model—all in a way that reflects network activity without bloating supply or introducing artificial yield systems. The user experience reflects this philosophy. Transfers are fast, confirmations are consistent, and applications can be built once and deployed across both chains. No translation layers, no bottlenecks—just throughput. Key crypto content creators like 99Bitcoins call it a 100x potential project, which could also be considered a major green flag for investors to consider the project. It’s not trying to sell a vision two years out. It’s already live, doing the job many larger chains have overcomplicated. That’s especially relevant now, as BlackRock and others begin to influence how infrastructure tokens might be categorized and what technical benchmarks they should meet. Solaxy doesn’t need to change course—it’s already built with those conditions in mind. If regulatory clarity leads to a future where simplicity, throughput, and traceability matter more than hype metrics, Solaxy may already have the right architecture in place. Conclusion As regulatory conversations grow more constructive and institutional players like BlackRock begin shaping the rules from within, the tone of the crypto market is shifting. In this environment, projects with real functionality, clear design, and active development are likely to thrive. These suggestions aren’t shots in the dark—they reflect where crypto is headed as the space prepares for its next phase under more defined rules and growing legitimacy.

Bitcoin is holding strong at $103,656, up 8% this week. Altcoins are gaining momentum, with Ethereum rallying 31.7% after the Pectra upgrade, now trading at $2,403. XRP is up 9% this week at $2.39. Dogecoin made a solid comeback, jumping 26%. Solana is up 15%, and Cardano’s ADA gained 14%. Strategies To Play This Bull Run Altcoin Sherpa has laid out two exciting strategies to play this bull run. Firstly, he suggests chasing the runners, meaning coins that have already pumped, like meme coins or trending AI tokens. These coins tend to have momentum, volume, and liquidity, making them easier to trade, like Popcat, Moodeng, and AVA Virtual. You can buy the dips and ride them as long as possible. But the downside? These coins have already made big moves, so the upside could be smaller. And if the market flips, they could crash hard. Accumulate the Sleepers? The other strategy is to accumulate the sleepers—coins that haven’t moved much yet, such as older projects or coins with untapped narratives (like AI, gaming, or zk-tech). These coins have higher upside potential since they’re at lower prices and could see big pumps if they catch a new trend. However, they are often illiquid, and it may take a long time for them to take off. Besides, there’s also a risk that they may not move at all. Sherpa suggests that if you’re more active, chasing the runners might be a better option, while option two is better suited for a long-term play. Analyst Crypto Rover also believes that the altcoin season is starting. As Bitcoin’s market share hits a key level, analysts expect a shift toward altcoins, with Ethereum and others showing strength. This could kick off a big altcoin rally in 2025.

44427019,https://invezz.com/?p=2712450,1746883800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Experts say MUTM may outperform MATIC and DOGE,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/10/experts-say-mutm-may-outperform-matic-and-doge/,"While legacy coins like MATIC and DOGE continue to dominate headlines, some investors are quietly turning their attention to a low-cost DeFi token still flying under the radar. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at just $0.025, but the setup suggests it might offer far more upside in 2025 than many of its more established counterparts. What’s fueling this shift? For starters, Mutuum’s presale is gaining momentum. With over 65% of the fourth phase completed, interest is growing fast. The opportunity to buy at $0.025 is almost over, with Phase 5 of the presale set to bump the price up to $0.03. Since the launch value is already fixed at $0.06, those getting in now are locking in a potential 140% increase before the token even makes its exchange debut. That alone has created a growing sense of FOMO across cryptocurrency communities looking for the next undervalued gem. But pricing alone isn’t what sets MUTM apart. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance offers a versatile lending structure that gives users two different ways to participate: one through contract-based lending (P2C) and the other through direct user-to-user agreements (P2P). This setup gives users the freedom to engage with the protocol in a way that matches their specific goals and asset preferences. With the P2C method, users place their crypto assets into shared liquidity pools managed by the protocol. Borrowers can then draw from these pools by offering collateral, and the interest rates shift automatically based on how much of the pool is currently in use. This approach simplifies the lending process and works well for mainstream, lower-volatility assets. Meanwhile, the P2P path offers a more tailored experience. Users can connect directly with others to create custom lending agreements — a format well-suited for assets that aren’t included in the shared pools, such as meme tokens like SHIB, DOGE, or PEPE. This peer-driven model keeps risk separate from the main system while opening the door to more speculative opportunities. This flexibility is one reason why early-stage whales — including those previously in MATIC and DOGE — are now tracking Mutuum. For many of them, it’s becoming a clear choice when exploring what crypto to invest in heading into the next market cycle. Another aspect that’s drawing attention is Mutuum’s Layer 2 compatibility. The protocol is being developed to integrate with scalable networks, helping reduce transaction costs and increase throughput. For DeFi users who are tired of congested Layer 1 environments, this design decision positions Mutuum as a forward-thinking alternative. By optimizing for speed and efficiency from the start, Mutuum gives lenders and borrowers the kind of experience typically only seen on more mature protocols — all while maintaining a permissionless, non-custodial structure. Behind the scenes, Mutuum’s smart contracts are undergoing a full audit by CertiK, a step that’s becoming a must for serious DeFi contenders. It reinforces trust at a time when users are increasingly cautious about protocol security. What makes this even more significant is the team’s intention to launch a beta version of the platform at the same time the token goes live. That means new investors won’t be waiting months to use the product — they’ll be able to explore lending, borrowing, and interacting with the core system right away. MATIC helped solve Ethereum’s scalability problem and DOGE gained attention through cultural momentum. However, heading into 2025, practical use cases are likely to play the most important role in determining value. Analysts are already noting that MUTM offers something both coins currently lack: real-time passive income generation through a structured on-chain economy. Mutuum’s revenue system collects protocol fees and uses them to buy back MUTM tokens, which are then distributed to users. This creates a yield loop based on actual usage — not hype or speculation — and it’s already resonating with long-term portfolio builders searching for the best crypto to buy now with solid fundamentals. From a valuation perspective, the difference is striking. At $0.025, MUTM is still in early territory. But with strong features, Layer 2 compatibility, dual lending options, and product rollout planned around the token’s debut, the pieces are lining up for a breakout year. Investors looking for the next big crypto or the best cheap crypto to buy now for 2025 gains may find that Mutuum Finance checks all the right boxes — especially before its price begins to reflect what’s being built beneath the surface.

According to a crypto analyst, this forecast is rooted in the Elliott Wave Theory, which indicates that Wave 5, which is the final and usually the most explosive leg up, is getting ready to run. Elliott Wave 5 Signals XRP Price Explosion In one of his latest Elliott Wave analyses, X (formerly Twitter) crypto expert Dark Defender forecasts a powerful rally for the XRP price, suggesting that the third-largest cryptocurrency could skyrocket to $6 soon. According to the analysis, XRP has been moving in a predictable wave structure since February 2025, and recent price action confirms the partial completion of the monthly Wave 5 bull pattern. Related Reading: XRP Price At $9 In September: Gann Angle Resistance Grid Predicts Surge The chart shows that since February, XRP has been following what Dark Defender refers to as the ”green path,” aligning with the expected trajectory of the Monthly Wave 4. This wave has recently concluded after unfolding into five smaller sub-waves, highlighting a precise and structured technical behavior. The fourth sub-wave peaked at around $2.36, a level previously identified as a key confirmation point. As predicted, the XRP price bounced off this level before retracing to $2.07, forming the final leg of sub-wave 5 of the monthly Wave 4. XRP’s current bullish setup reveals that the monthly Wave 5 is now in its early stages, with the drop to $2.07 possibly marking the bottom of the corrective structure. Dark Defender emphasizes that while Wave 5 has already begun, the larger upward move still awaits full confirmation, indicating that there may be significant room left for XRP to rally. Technical projections place the potential upside target of this Wave 5 near $6.85, representing a sharp bullish breakout if market momentum aligns with the expectations of the wave structure. Analyst Says The Real Bull Rally Is About To Begin The XRP price is approaching a major technical breakout, as crypto analyst CW highlights the emergence of a classic bull flag pattern. After experiencing months of consolidation, the analyst suggests that the next explosive leg in XRP’s price action may be around the corner. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Bullish Path To $5 As Long As This Level Holds The daily chart reveals a clear bull flag structure, formed after XRP’s powerful rally in 2024 when its price jumped from $0.5 to over $2. This aggressive and unexpected move created the flagpole, followed by a multi-month period of consolidation, forming the descending flag pattern. Now, XRP is testing the upper boundary of the bull flag, trading just above $2.36 at the time of the analysis. A decisive breakout and close above the resistance trendline could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. According to CW, this breakout would mark the beginning of a true bull rally for XRP.

According to a new report by Reuters, two anonymous sources familiar with the matter say that Saudi Arabia – which was invited to BRICS in 2023 – is holding off on formally joining the alliance despite joining one of their meetings in Brazil last week and being listed as a member on the group’s website. The inclusion of Saudi Arabia in BRICS is a diplomatically sensitive issue, and the nation has refrained from formally joining the economic bloc as it did not want to anger the US and President Trump. BRICS – which officially formed in 2009 – is an alliance between Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and other countries as a means of countering Western economic dominance. In 2024, it expanded to include other nations, such as Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia’s hesitancy to join is due to it being caught between China, its biggest exporter of oil, and the US, its security and technology partner. The US is poised to offer Saudi Arabia a $100 billion arms deal. Last December, Trump threatened to raise tariffs on all BRICS nations to 100% if the alliance committed to creating a new currency or to another currency that would usurp the US dollar. As stated by Trump at the time, “The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar or, they will face 100% tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

33767162,[object Object],1746883991,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,“Crypto’s First Live Trading Cup Is Just the Beginning”: Interview with the President of the WhiteBIT Group,https://bitcoinist.com/cryptos-first-live-trading-cup-is-just-the-beginning-interview-with-the-president-of-the-whitebit-group/,"During the International Crypto Trading Cup 2025 (ICTC) , the first-ever livestreamed crypto trading competition, our staff spoke with the WhiteBIT CEO, Volodymyr Nosov, and their CMO, Alex Kozenko, to gain insight into the event, its origins, purpose, and the value it attempts to provide to the crypto community. This is what they told us. Paradigm Shift: Crypto Trading As The Ultimate E-Sport? Interviewer: Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us. We’re excited to hear more about WhiteBIT. To start, could you tell us a bit about the early days of the platform? How much has it grown since then, and where do you see it heading in the next year? Volodymyr Nosov: Thank you. First, it’s important to note that WhiteBIT is just one of many products within the larger WhiteBIT Group. Our group specializes in blockchain development, and today, we manage over 12 active projects. We now have a team of more than 1,300 people, including over 240 in-house developers. All of our products are built entirely in-house. That’s critical to us. Many players in this industry rely on outsourced development or white-label solutions, which often leads to technical vulnerabilities. You constantly hear about hacks and data leaks—and that’s often why. In contrast, during our seven years of operation, we’ve never had a single hack or data breach. That’s something I’m truly proud of. And it’s not just about crypto. Yes, the crypto space has many exchanges and companies, but the truth is, about 98% of them are essentially just marketing shells—often run by one person with a front-end and no infrastructure. At WhiteBIT, our core focus has always been on development. That’s why we continue to grow year after year. In terms of the exchange itself, last year alone, WhiteBIT facilitated over $2.7 billion in trading volume in 2024 —without a single technical issue. That tells you something about the resilience of the platform. Interviewer: Can you speak more about WhiteBIT’s broader strategy and future vision? Volodymyr Nosov: Our vision is to bridge traditional finance and crypto. We’re developing features that replicate the functionality of classic financial systems but reimagined for blockchain. The idea is that you’ll be able to do everything you need—from trading to managing your finances—within one integrated application. We’re also investing heavily in infrastructure that supports institutional clients and professional traders. Beyond crypto, our team has been building blockchain-based solutions for traditional industries—banking, telecommunications, and even esports. These products live “under the hood” of Web2 companies, giving them seamless access to Web3 functionality. Here’s the reality: big Web2 companies aren’t going away, but they lack the developers and experience to integrate blockchain properly. One day, they’ll realize they need crypto-native infrastructure. When that moment comes, we’ll be ready. We’ve spent the last four years building systems that are easy to integrate into their existing stacks. Interviewer: Are you already seeing institutions adopt these solutions? Volodymyr Nosov: Yes, it’s already happening—quietly but steadily. Right now, it’s hundreds of companies. In a year, it’ll be thousands. In three years, it’ll be millions. The wave is here. Interviewer: Let’s talk about today’s event. What inspired WhiteBIT to host a trading competition? Volodymyr Nosov: Good question. This isn’t our first event—we’ve partnered with football clubs, esports organizations, and other industry leaders. But we noticed that no one had ever organized something truly meaningful just for crypto traders. In the entire 14–15 year history of crypto, no one has done this. So we decided to create something special for our community—something that celebrates traders as professionals. This tournament is our first major step, and we plan to host it annually. It’s a learning experience, and we’re collecting feedback so the next one will be even bigger and better. Interviewer: I also noticed there’s a strong educational component. Would you say this event is geared toward helping people become better traders? Volodymyr Nosov: Absolutely. It reminds me of how esports began. I remember 15 years ago, sitting in a computer lab with friends playing Counter-Strike. Back then, our families told us it was a waste of time. Today, esports is a billion-dollar industry. We’re trying to build the same kind of infrastructure for trading. Imagine you’re a 25-year-old sitting at your computer all day studying charts, and your parents don’t understand what you’re doing. Now, suddenly, you’re competing on an international stage. That changes the narrative. This event legitimizes trading as a serious discipline, not just a hobby. Interviewer: So it’s not just about trading—it’s about elevating the entire culture around it. Volodymyr Nosov: Exactly. This is about more than just markets. It’s about friendship, community, and access. Traders can meet each other, exchange ideas, and get inspired by others at the top of their game. We’re building an ecosystem that goes far beyond numbers on a screen. A Chat With WhiteBIT’s CMO, The Origins of the ICTC 2025, And A Look Into Its Future In a different conversation with multiple crypto news outlets, including Cripto Noticias, Crypto Insiders, and Bitcoinist, WhiteBIT’s CMO, Alex Kozenko , spoke about the idea that gave form to the ICTC 2025, and how the team behind the event was able to pull it off, sorting out many challenges. Alex Kozenko: (…) It was a highly complex project. We tried to combine everything we’ve learned as a team and do something that had never been done before: the world’s first offline crypto trading tournament . I told my team, if we’re going to do something, it needs to be extraordinary —a true “first ever” moment. Interviewer: So, anyone, even a beginner or a fan, could compete against top traders? Alex Kozenko: Exactly. That was the magic of it. This is the first event where anyone could test their skills in real-time, against seasoned professionals. In traditional esports, you can’t just show up and play with the pros. But in our tournament, everyone starts at the same time, on the same data feed—it’s a level playing field. Interviewer: That makes it more interactive and immersive than just watching a game. Alex Kozenko: Yes! Imagine if you’re a fan of FC Barcelona, and instead of watching El Clásico, you could play in it. That’s the emotional hook. Here, fans of trading don’t just watch—they participate. They test themselves against the best. Interviewer: And how was the response from the community and influencers? Alex Kozenko: It was mixed at first. When we reached out, maybe 80–85% didn’t respond. Some didn’t understand the concept. Others were skeptical. But those who did engage told us, “This is the dream. This is what we’ve been waiting for.” We were fully transparent—no hidden tricks, no fake numbers. Some participants even told us, “If I don’t win this thing, my followers won’t buy my course!” It added pressure, but also made it more real. Traders had the chance to showcase their skill, strategy, and style live on stage. It’s a dream scenario for them. Interviewer: That’s a bold way to turn trading into a spectator sport. Alex Kozenko: It is. We designed this as a professional showcase—a place where traders can demonstrate their ideas, their decision-making, their aggression, their experience. It’s about showing the world that trading is more than numbers—it’s a craft. Interviewer: Was this a difficult project to execute? Alex Kozenko: Extremely. Every week, we had meetings with 40–50 team members. Everything—from partnerships to stage design—was carefully planned. One funny example: we had to coordinate LED approval with La Liga for part of the broadcast. That normally takes two weeks; we had 12 days. Our original venue didn’t have enough electricity to power all the equipment. We had to move the entire event to a new location and completely recalibrate everything. But it was worth it. I told my team, “We’re launching a rocket here.” And somehow, we did. Interviewer: What was the most challenging part for you personally? Alex Kozenko: The people. Managing the team’s energy and motivation was harder than anything else. We had to push the event from February to May, and that delay was tough. But now, seeing 99% of the idea executed exactly how I imagined it—that’s the most rewarding feeling. Even in some areas, it exceeded my expectations. I’m proud of what we achieved. This event is more than marketing—it’s a movement. And if this is just the beginning, I can’t wait to show you what we do next.

The change could bring Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, under U.S. regulation for the first time. The law also expands the definition of digital asset service providers to include developers, validator nodes, and self-custody wallet providers. These groups could also have to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (AML) laws. This bill could be a historic turning point for Tether, which has managed to avoid criticism about transparency regarding its reserves by operating outside of regulation for nearly a decade. The new bill also brings some conveniences that could benefit companies like Tether by expanding the scope of the asset types behind stablecoins. However, it is stated that the same bill could impose serious restrictions on the DeFi sector. On Thursday, a vote was attempted in the Senate to begin a formal debate on the bill, but it failed because some senators had not yet read the text. The following day, an updated version of the bill was obtained by Unchained. The new bill includes signatures from Democratic sponsors Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks, but only those from Republican sponsor Bill Hagerty, along with Tim Scott, Cynthia Lummis and Dan Sullivan. Without Democratic support, the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate. Related News: Critical Date Set for TRUMP Memecoin: Developers Announce “A New Era Begins on This Date” Changes in the updated version of the GENIUS Act include: US Regulation for Foreign Issuers: The bill requires stablecoin issuers located outside the US but serving US users to comply with US regulations. This provision directly impacts Tether, which has long been outside of regulation. Expanded Digital Asset Service Provider Definition: Now, not only exchanges but also DeFi protocol developers, validator nodes, and those providing their own wallet infrastructure are also regulated. These groups can also be held accountable for the use of illegal or unauthorized stablecoins. “Safe Harbor” Authority: The bill grants the Treasury Secretary limited “safe harbor” flexibility for small-scale or experimental projects. But granting unilateral authority to intervene in “emergency” situations has been criticized by some experts as an overreach of the executive branch. It is not yet clear when Democratic senators saw the new version of the bill, but the changes are thought to be the result of behind-the-scenes negotiations ahead of the vote. Experts predict that the Senate could hold a new vote by the end of the month to begin formal debate on the bill. *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally. Technical patterns suggest a potential 40% rally toward $3,400 as ETH bounces off key support. Ether ( ETH ) is on course to record its best weekly performance since May 2021, having risen by over 37.50% in the week ending May 11, including 10.30% gains in the last 24 hours. US tariff updates, Pectra upgrade boost Ethereum The announcement of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK on May 8 and the initiation of US-China trade talks afterward have bolstered upside sentiment in Ether and the broader crypto market. Additionally, Ether benefits from its Pectra upgrade on May 7, which introduced key improvements like higher staking limits and account abstraction (EIP-7702) to make Ethereum easier and more flexible. ETH/USD vs. TOTAL crypto market and BTC/USD five-day performance. Source: TradingView These upgrades are helping ETH’s price rise faster than the broader crypto market. Since May 8, Ether has gained over 34.3%, outperforming the crypto market’s 10.91% increase in total capitalization during the same period. Bitcoin ( BTC ), despite breaking above the symbolic $100,000 mark, has also trailed Ethereum’s percentage gains. Source: Crypto Goos Ethereum short squeeze boosts ETH price Short liquidations in the Ethereum Futures market have been fueling upward momentum further. Since May 8, traders betting against Ethereum have been forced to close their positions, with $437.94 million in short liquidations recorded. At the same time, $211.29 million in long liquidations have also occurred. ETH total liquidation chart. Source: CoinGlass As prices climbed, short sellers had to buy back ETH to cover their losses, pushing the price even higher. At the same time, Ethereum’s open interest—the total value of outstanding futures contracts—has increased sharply from $21.28 billion on May 8 to $26.77 billion on May 10. ETH funding rates and open interest. Source: CoinGlass Additionally, weekly funding rates for Ethereum perpetual futures rose from 0.10% to 0.15% during this period. This rise in open interest shows more traders are entering the market and opening new positions. Higher funding rates indicate that more traders are going long (betting on higher prices) and are willing to pay extra fees to keep those positions open. Both metrics signal bullish bias among Ethereum futures traders. Ethereum rally precedes mega-whale accumulation Ether’s price rally in the past days has preceded substantial accumulation among its “mega-whales,” i.e., wallets holding over 10,000 ETH. The Glassnode chart illustrates that mega-whale net position change has flipped positive since late April, with whales steadily increasing their ETH holdings.

The collaboration aims to unlock continuous access to one of the world's oldest safe-haven assets through a blockchain-native framework. Investors can now trade gold futures any time, any day, including weekends and holidays, with real-time settlement and zero trading fees. Bringing Gold to the Blockchain Era Gold has historically served as a hedge during financial uncertainty, but participating in gold markets typically requires navigating intermediaries, restricted trading hours, and manual settlement processes. RabbitX and Paxos are addressing these pain points by offering on-chain gold futures backed 1:1 by physical gold. PAXG is issued by Paxos Trust Company, a regulated entity that holds the underlying gold in secure vaults and undergoes regular audits. By offering gold perpetuals on RabbitX, traders can now gain exposure to gold price movements transparently, efficiently, and in a decentralized manner, without taking custody of the metal itself. ""This launch marks a leap forward in how commodities like gold are traded,"" said Ming Wu, Founder of RabbitX. ""We're giving traders around the world unrestricted access to a historically stable asset — now in a faster, more transparent format."" Why Timing Matters The launch comes against a backdrop of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty. With inflation, banking instability, and geopolitical tensions impacting global markets, gold remains a go-to asset for preserving value. Offering gold futures on a decentralized platform meets growing demand from crypto-native investors looking to hedge with real-world assets, without exiting the digital ecosystem. RabbitX's platform operates across multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Blast. With over 100,000 connected wallets and deep liquidity for popular pairs like BTC and ETH, the addition of PAXG marks a strategic expansion into the real-world asset (RWA) sector. ""This is about bringing traditional assets into the digital age,"" said Ronak Daya, Head of Product at Paxos. ""Our partnership with RabbitX is a natural extension of our mission to modernize financial infrastructure and make financial products more accessible."" The PAXG perpetual futures allow users to take long or short positions on the price of gold without expiration. Trades are executed on-chain, and margining, liquidation, and funding payments are all handled algorithmically, removing human error and centralized risk. With no middlemen involved, users benefit from complete transparency, self-custody of funds, and real-time access to market data. RabbitX has also introduced cross-margining, allowing traders to manage risk across assets more efficiently. A Glimpse Into the Future RabbitX's move sets the stage for a broader transformation in trading real-world assets. As regulators and investors grow more comfortable with asset-backed tokens and on-chain finance, this model could extend beyond gold to include oil, equities, and more. For now, the partnership offers a powerful signal: the lines between traditional and decentralized finance are not just blurring, they're being redrawn entirely.

This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge. While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we have recently seen. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, the price of gold soared 148% but stagnated for nearly a decade before the COVID-19 pandemic triggered another rally, and it's likely we will see gold hold, if not fall from it's new record high once markets revive. While it remains an excellent hedge, gold’s long-term track record is not a growth story. Investors prefer US Treasurys or high-yield savings accounts as part of a balanced portfolio. While gold may outperform these assets in uncertain times, it offers a better balance of security and predictable income over the long term. The DeFi solution This is where DeFi brings innovation to the world’s oldest asset. DeFi can significantly modernize gold investing, offering the speed and transparency of blockchain-based transactions and the ability to earn returns. Currently, though, most tokenized gold is much the same as holding it in an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Stablecoin giants like Tether and Paxos have launched gold-backed tokens, which they say are fully backed by physical, audited gold reserves, yet offer no yield. Recent: Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal grows during trade war uncertainty Most DeFi investors prefer liquid, tradable assets like cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, which can generate attractive returns. Many would rather, for example, buy Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) stablecoin and stake it, earning rewards while still maintaining ownership. Perhaps this is why the market capitalization of gold-backed tokens remains modest. Tether Gold, the world’s most significant gold token, has a market capitalization of just under $835 million, for example, while Paxos Gold sits at around $799 million. Combined, this is equivalent to just 1% of the market cap of USDT. Unlocking income from the world’s oldest asset To unlock gold’s full potential, we need to take tokenization a step further by creating a DeFi ecosystem where tokenized gold is actively put to work — borrowed, lent and integrated into yield-bearing strategies. One possibility is for companies such as gold miners is to issue tokenized versions of their reserves that can be turned into stablecoins that can then be staked to earn a yield. Leveraging protocols whose liquidity mechanisms enable the trading of stablecoins and real-world asset (RWA) tokens, holders could take advantage of further yield opportunities throughout the DeFi ecosystem. Beyond the benefits of yield opportunities, blockchain technology means investors in tokenized gold can benefit from the flexibility of 24-hour trading, near real-time price discovery and near-instant settlement without compromising the stability of the asset. The future of gold investing It is, perhaps, ironic that — just as governments worldwide are starting to put their stamp of approval on digital finance — gold is becoming a highly desirable commodity again. The public’s interest in it will grow as governments essentially ratify digital finance. At the same time, the appetite for gold in these uncertain times will also increase. DeFi could bring these trends together and kickstart a natural evolution in gold ownership that provides a solid bridge between traditional and digital finance. While gold inside traditional markets attracts investors looking for stability, DeFi brings opportunities that don’t compromise that stability, as it presents new and unique yield opportunities. Gold has captivated humanity for thousands of years. It’s the foundation of myths, the standard of wealth and the ultimate hedge against uncertainty. But in today’s financial world, it needs an upgrade. Through integrating gold into the DeFi ecosystem, we could unlock its true potential — not just as a store of value but as an income-generating asset. The world’s oldest safe haven asset is finally on the brink of a digital evolution. Opinion by: Kevin Rusher, founder of RAAC.

AAVE ( AAVE ) rose to $221.91, up by 95% from its lowest level on April 7, bringing its market cap to over $3.3 billion. CoinGlass data shows that investors continue accumulating more AAVE tokens, especially after Ethereum ( ETH ) made a strong breakout and tested the key resistance point at $2,400 for the first time since February. AAVE balances on exchanges dropped to 4.76 million, down from 4.87 million a week ago. This decline brought the total supply on exchanges to 29.74%. Falling exchange balances is a sign that holders are not selling, which is a positive thing for a coin. You might also like: Arkham integrates portfolio management platform Haruko AAVE price also jumped as it solidified its position as the biggest player in the decentralized finance industry. DeFi Llama data shows that its total value locked rose by 35% in the last 30 days to $24.2 billion, making it much bigger than Lido (LDO), which has $21.6 billion in assets. This growth has made AAVE one of the most profitable players in the crypto market, as its year-to-date fees jumped to $224 million. AAVE is a decentralized ‘banking’ platform that enables users to earn interest from their idle assets. This interest comes from its lending operations, enabling users to borrow at competitive rates. AAVE price technical analysis AAVE price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that AAVE price bottomed at $113.50 on April 7, bouncing back to its highest level since March 6. It has jumped above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average and the crucial psychological point at $1,000. The Relative Strength Index has moved to the overbought level at 75, while the MACD indicator has crossed the zero line. This rebound happened after it formed a falling wedge pattern between December and April. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $400, its highest point in December. Such a move would signal an 83% surge from the current level. A drop below the support at $170 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

The Litecoin (LTC) price drop deepened this week, falling 7% to $81.81 after the SEC postponed its ETF decision, citing fraud risks and inviting public commentary. Meanwhile, the TRUMP coin price remains locked between political controversy and concerns over centralization, even as large holders quietly shift millions off exchanges in a pattern that looks like strategic accumulation. Although both assets may recover, they currently carry high risk. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) is managing to do what few projects pull off at this stage, deliver returns and passive income even before launch. With more than $233.5 million raised and 19.9 billion BDAG sold, BlockDAG is using its 25% referral payouts to help users earn before the coin hits exchanges. This momentum is solidifying its position as a crypto gem 2025 to watch closely. Litecoin (LTC) Price Drop Accelerates After SEC Delays ETF Approval The Litecoin (LTC) price drop intensified after the SEC announced it would postpone its decision on Canary Capital’s proposed Litecoin ETF. That announcement drove LTC down 7% to $81.81 and triggered a steep fall in Polymarket’s approval odds for Q2 2025, dropping from 42% to just 27%. Despite the setback, Litecoin’s long-term chart shows signs of strength, with a bullish pennant formation developing. If LTC can break through the $88 to $90 zone with strong volume, a reversal could follow. Until then, doubts around ETF approval may lead to continued weakness in Litecoin’s short-term outlook. TRUMP Coin Price Reacts to Whale Activity and Political Exposure The TRUMP coin price could be approaching a turnaround following significant whale accumulation. In one move, over 1 million tokens worth $10.84 million were pulled from Binance. This follows a sharp 23% weekly decline, signaling that some investors are scooping up TRUMP at lower prices. Even with concerns about centralization, with 80% of the supply held by the Trump Organization, the project continues to attract attention. Former President Trump has defended his crypto ties, calling digital assets essential for U.S. innovation. If momentum builds alongside political coverage, the TRUMP coin price may quickly reverse course. BlockDAG’s Referral Program Gains Traction Before Public Launch BlockDAG’s referral model, introduced as a simple incentive plan, has quickly become a key force in its presale success. Rather than giveaways, users are earning real value by helping others join the project early. When someone buys BDAG through a referral link, the original user gets a 25% bonus, and the new buyer receives 5%. There’s no limit on the number of referrals or the rewards. As more people get involved, early adopters are converting referrals into serious BDAG holdings, all without extra investment. This extra incentive has powered a presale that’s already breaking records. BlockDAG has raised $233.5 million, sold over 19.9 billion coins, and climbed 2,520% from its $0.001 starting point to the current batch 28 price of $0.0262. Despite the massive growth, a special price of $0.0019 is still available until May 13. That’s well below the current rate and far under the confirmed exchange listing price of $0.05. This makes it one of the few chances left to earn extra BDAG at scale. As the referral program and presale approach their closing dates, this offer continues to stand out as one of the most accessible ways to earn passive income in crypto right now. Which Crypto Gem 2025 Has the Most Potential Now? To recap, the Litecoin (LTC) price drop was directly tied to the SEC’s ETF delay, causing LTC to dip to $81.81 and lowering approval expectations to 27%.

Since then, the entire market has turned extremely bullish. Bitcoin surged above $103,000, while Ethereum managed to rise close to $2400. On the other hand, the memecoins surged with a huge margin, with PEPE’s price attracting over 40% gains in 24 hours. However, after undergoing a huge rise, the markets are consolidating within a narrow range, but around the gains. Meanwhile, the whale activity has raised some concerns over the upcoming price action. Whale activity plays a major role as it deeply influences the sentiments of the market participants. The rise in whale accumulation usually increases the bullish sentiments, but the drop in their holdings raises concerns. Meanwhile, this latest whale movement has raised skepticism around the next price action of Bitcoin, Solana & Ethereum. As per the data from Lookonchain, a whale deposited 13M USDC to Hyperliquid to short these 3 top cryptos with 5x leverage.

A 5x leverage short across these tokens after a macro breakout and reflexive ignition does not demonstrate their intelligence. This does not seem to have hedged but a bet against momentum, liquidity, belief and reflexivity all at once. This kind of trade works in structurally broken markets or when the narratives are collapsing. Presently, the market sentiments have reversed as the retail is awakening, wherein the institutional flows are returning. One possibility could be that they could have bet on the long-term bearish action, probably the next bear market. However, the bear market ignition is a little compressed, with the ETF flows, sovereign adoption, and retail re-entry delaying the bearish trajectory. Although the bullish possibilities are higher, the retail participants are required to remain vigilant during the upcoming price action, as the rise in the volatility could attract more whale activity.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-10 14:02:24

XRP’s rally toward the $2.50 resistance level may now be at risk following the dumping of over $130 million worth of the token on the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange . The first notable transfer occurred on May 3, when a wallet moved 29.53 million XRP, worth approximately $64.4 million, to Coinbase. Just six days later, on May 9, an identical transfer of 29.53 million XRP was recorded, valued at $69.5 million due to the token’s price appreciation during that period, according to on-chain data shared by Whale Alert. XRP transfer to Coinbase on May 9. Source: Whale Alert Combined, these transactions represent 59.06 million XRP, totaling approximately $133.9 million sent to the exchange, presumably with the intent to sell. Motivation for dumping XRP on Coinbase While the exact motive behind the transfers remains unclear, large deposits to centralized exchanges from unknown wallets (as opposed to custodial or cold storage) often suggest selling intentions by whales. The timing is also notable, as XRP recently broke out of a consolidation phase. Profit-taking opportunities amid renewed bullish momentum may have triggered the sales. It’s worth noting that XRP had been consolidating just above the $2 mark before gaining fresh momentum in line with broader market sentiment. On May 10, crypto trading analyst Ali Martinez noted in an X post that XRP had flashed a buy signal, potentially marking the start of a bullish reversal after weeks of sideways movement. The signal appeared as XRP’s price broke above the $2.35 resistance zone, possibly setting the stage for a renewed push toward the $2.50 mark. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts At the same time, on-chain fundamentals have been mixed, but the price has held relatively steady. For example, despite Ripple unlocking 1 billion XRP early this month, the token remained stable, with whales accumulating roughly $1.8 billion of XRP over the past month. Crucially, investors are closely watching for a price reaction following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) official filing of a settlement agreement in the long-standing legal case against Ripple. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.40, up nearly 0.5% over the past 24 hours and 9% on the weekly chart. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold So far, the recent whale transactions have had minimal impact on XRP’s short-term price action, with overall sentiment remaining bullish. The token is trading above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages ( SMA ), currently around $1.90, a positive technical signal. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 62.97, suggesting XRP is approaching overbought territory. A volatility rate of 3.67% points to moderate price fluctuations.

From meme to millions: How PEPE took over the crypto scene PEPE is a new cryptocurrency that’s making headlines in the crypto world. Launched on Ethereum, it’s a memecoin inspired by the famous Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. PEPE aims to follow in the footsteps of popular memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a straightforward approach, it keeps things pure and simple, appealing to many in the crypto community. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a massive surge, with its market cap soaring to an astonishing $1.6 billion. Early holders saw incredible gains, and a strong community of fans grew around it. This surge sparked what some call a “memecoin season,” leading to other meme-based coins emerging and experiencing wild price swings. PEPE’s roadmap includes ambitious goals like getting listed on major exchanges and aiming for a “meme takeover.” While it’s hard to predict the future, the excitement around PEPE reflects the growing influence of internet culture on cryptocurrency. As the market evolves, PEPE stands out as a coin capturing the spirit of the moment. Conclusion As PEPE’s top whale invests in undervalued tokens, XYZVerse stands out with its sports-meme fusion, targeting significant gains in the current 2025 bull run.

Ethereum (ETH) jumped over 32% in just one week, sparking excitement across the crypto space. But as momentum builds, many investors are left wondering: should they take profits, or double down? Let’s break down what’s really driving this sudden surge and what it could mean for the months ahead. China Lights up the Rally Michael van de Poppe, a popular crypto trader and analyst, said this rally didn’t start because of anything the U.S. did. Instead, he says it all began in China. Poppe further noted that China’s central bank cut interest rates to a record low of 1.3%, and also lowered the amount of money banks need to keep in reserve. This is called quantitative easing (QE), and it often pushes more money into the market. Poppe believes this move from China gave global markets a boost, especially crypto. He pointed out that the Chinese Yuan (CNH) is getting stronger. When that happens, the U.S. Dollar gets weaker, which is usually good for Bitcoin and Ethereum. As per Poppe’s chart analysis, whenever CNH/USD goes up, ETH/BTC often rises too. FED Rate Kept Unchanged Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s May 7 meeting kept interest rates unchanged —no surprises there. While investors are now keeping an eye on rising unemployment and tariff tensions, which could eventually force the Fed to cut rates. If U.S. unemployment rises above 5%, the Fed might be forced to cut rates to boost economic activity. Ethereum Leading Altcoin Rally Ethereum isn’t just going up, it’s now outperforming Bitcoin by over 30%. He says this could be the early sign of an altcoin season, when smaller coins rally more than Bitcoin. Poppe also highlighted two major bullish catalysts for Ethereum: Stripe is now supporting stablecoin payments on Ethereum. The new Pectra upgrade is on the way, which will improve the Ethereum network. These upgrades make Ethereum more useful, not just something to invest in. What’s Next For Altcoin Holders? Poppe says the market is split right now, some people think this is the start of a new bull run, while others think it’s just a short-term bounce. While Poppe is on the bullish side, he says crypto follows a 4-year cycle: 2 years of a bear market, followed by 2 years of a bull run. And based on that, he believes the next big move is just beginning.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-10 14:10:25
