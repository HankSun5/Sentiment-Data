For many in the crypto and tech space, understanding how centralized entities handle valuable user data is paramount. A recent development at SoundCloud, a popular audio distribution platform, has brought these concerns into sharp focus, particularly regarding SoundCloud AI training on user-uploaded content. Understanding the SoundCloud AI Training Policy Change SoundCloud has reportedly updated its terms of use, a move that appears to grant the company permission to utilize user-uploaded audio for training artificial intelligence models. This change was highlighted by tech ethicist Ed Newton-Rex. According to the updated terms, which were last revised on February 7, 2024, users now explicitly agree that their content may be used to “inform, train, develop or serve as input to artificial intelligence or machine intelligence technologies or services.” Ed Newton-Rex noted via social media that this specific clause seems to have been introduced around February 12, 2024. This suggests a relatively recent addition to the platform’s policy framework. Implications for Creator Content AI The primary concern raised by this policy update revolves around creator content AI usage. Artists, musicians, podcasters, and other audio creators who upload their work to SoundCloud are essentially providing the raw material that could be used to train AI models. While SoundCloud states this is part of “providing the services,” the implications for creators are significant. It raises questions about: Consent: Was this change adequately communicated to users, or was it a “quiet” update to the terms? Compensation: Will creators whose content is used for training receive any form of credit or payment? Control: Do creators retain any control over whether their specific work is used for AI training? The terms do mention a carve-out for content under “separate agreements” with third-party rightsholders like record labels. This suggests that licensed content from major publishers like Universal Music and Warner Music Group might be subject to different rules, but the situation for independent creators or those without such agreements remains less clear. The Broader Trend in Platform AI Policies SoundCloud is not alone in making such changes. This development is part of a broader trend where major content hosting and social media platforms are amending their policies to facilitate user data AI training . Recent examples include: X (formerly Twitter): Updated its privacy policy in October 2023 to allow outside companies to train AI on user posts. LinkedIn: Amended its terms in September 2023 to permit scraping user data for training purposes. YouTube: Began allowing third parties to train AI on user clips in December 2023. These changes reflect the increasing demand for vast datasets to fuel AI development across various industries. However, they also highlight a growing tension between platform innovation and user rights. Navigating the AI Policy User Data Landscape The shift towards platforms using AI policy user data for training has often been met with user backlash. A common point of contention is the preference for an opt-in model rather than an opt-out. Users argue that they should have explicit control over whether their contributions are used for AI training and that they should be credited and potentially compensated for the value their data provides to these training sets. SoundCloud’s previous statements on AI suggest an awareness of these concerns. Last year, the platform partnered with AI vendors and mentioned implementing content ID solutions to “ensure rights holders receive proper credit and compensation.” They also pledged to “uphold ethical and transparent AI practices that respect creators’ rights.” The recent terms update allowing AI training on user content will test these commitments and require clear communication and potential opt-out mechanisms to build user trust. As of the original report, an explicit opt-out option within SoundCloud’s settings was not readily apparent. The platform had not yet responded to requests for comment on the policy change. Summary: What This Means for Users The reported update to SoundCloud’s terms allowing platform AI policies to include training on user-uploaded audio is a significant development. It places SoundCloud alongside other major platforms leveraging user data for AI development. While this could potentially lead to improved services, it raises crucial questions about user consent, data ownership, and compensation for creators. Users of the platform should be aware of this change and consider its implications for their content and data rights in the age of AI.

44395356,https://cryptonews.com/?p=359502,1746829907,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44395356.jpeg,AI Agents Set to Spark $615B Boom in Blockchain Gaming Engagement,https://cryptonews.com/news/ai-agents-blockchain-gaming-boom/,"$614.9 billion—that’s where blockchain gaming revenue is now forecast to land by 2030 after AI agents began running wallets, cutting trades, and even bluffing at on-chain poker tables this week. Recent data shows that the global blockchain gaming market size was valued at $128.62 billion in 2022. While this growth is impressive, on-chain games still primarily appeal to Web3 users. Research from Web3 gaming company Immutable found that more than 40% of Web3 gamers spend over 10 hours playing Web3 games weekly. However, traditional gamers tend to lean towards mainstream games. AI Agents Make Blockchain Games More Appealing Max Giammario, CEO of Kindred—an AI company focused on intellectual property—told Cryptonews that AI is quickly evolving from a background system into an active operator within on-chain games. “Today, we’re seeing AI agents that can manage crypto wallets, execute smart contract transactions, and autonomously participate in in-game economies,” Giammario said. “AI is making decisions on asset trades, staking, or even negotiating with other agents on a user’s behalf.” Giammario elaborated that AI agents can allow players to delegate repetitive or complex tasks to the AI. These agents can even continue to earn, trade, or strategize while players are offline. “Take, for example, EVE Online’s economy, which allows players to mine, trade, and wage corporate wars. Now, imagine AI agents that act like EVE’s most skilled industrialists—they could analyze real-time blockchain data to optimize yield farming across games, predict NFT floor prices, or even launch decentralized arbitrage strategies while players sleep,” Giammario explained. Giammario, therefore, believes that AI agents are capable of shaping game economies while driving liquidity, and over time, this may even blur the line between human and machine agency. On-Chain Poker Powered By AI-Agents While AI agents are still evolving in the Web3 sector, a handful of on-chain games have begun to incorporate these models. For example, TEN—an entertainment network for AI‑native iGaming—recently launched “House of TEN.” This is an on-chain poker application featuring autonomous AI agents. Cais Mainai, Ten’s co-founder and head of product, told Cryptonews that House of TEN showcases an entirely new vertical of AI-native iGaming. “It’s the first-ever fully on-chain poker game powered by autonomous AI agents, each with unique personalities and strategies. Players stake on these agents, earning ‘ZEN’ prediction rewards based on their performance,” Mainai explained. 1/House of TEN is live. The world's first true poker game on blockchain. For the next 48 hours only, witness AI agents bluff, deceive, and outsmart each other using technology previously impossible on chain. Pick the winning AI and prove your predictive skills. Game starts… pic.twitter.com/KzQPAQEVMx — TEN ( / ) (@tenprotocol) April 3, 2025 According to Mainai, House of TEN runs entirely on-chain with encrypted logic, private card hands, verifiable randomness, and no off-chain computation. Each AI agent in the game comes equipped with its own poker strategy. “Some bluff, some play safe, some tilt—and players stake on them in real time. Players are not playing against the AI, but rather betting on it by backing the mind they believe will win,” he explained. Mainai pointed out that on-chain gaming is evolving from static experiences to dynamic ones, where AI agents play alongside users, and sometimes on their behalf. “Staking on AI agents is just the beginning. These agents will evolve and soon be upgraded, traded, or deployed across multiple games in the TEN arcade, forming a composable ecosystem of user-owned gameplay,” he noted. The Sandbox Looks To Incorporate AI Popular Web3 gaming platform The Sandbox is also looking at incorporating AI elements. Sebastien Borget, The Sandbox’s chief operating officer, told Cryptonews that AI is increasingly becoming a transformative tool in on-chain gaming. He noted this is particularly the case for enhancing game economies and player engagement. “We’re seeing AI agents actively participating in game economies by trading tokens, influencing market dynamics, and attracting audiences through social media channels,” Borget said. Borget mentioned that while The Sandbox is not currently implementing AI agents in its on-chain ecosystem, the platform is actively exploring how AI could facilitate liquidity and trading of in-game assets. He added that there is interest in learning how AI-driven non-playable characters (NPCs) could interact with players. This would offer dynamic trading experiences or provide market insights based on in-game asset trends. An AI Agent Trained To Release Crypto Funds Another way AI is reshaping on-chain gaming is through interactive experiences that reward players. Alex Casassovici, executive director of the Fight.Fi Foundation and core contributor to h011yw00d.ai, told Cryptonews that Freysa is an autonomous AI agent on the Base blockchain . Freysa challenges players to persuade it to release a cryptocurrency prize pool, blending AI decision-making with human interactions. $FAI | @freysa_ai Big Moves Coming For $FAI Altseason Target: $0.37 Nothin' But Math Baby pic.twitter.com/UZK3mKXPYz — Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) April 21, 2025 “AI enhances game development by generating assets, crafting narratives, and enabling adaptive gameplay, resulting in unique experiences for each player,” Casassovici said. Challenges To Consider Although AI agents are revolutionizing blockchain games, several challenges remain . For instance, Borget mentioned that while AI presents compelling opportunities, The Sandbox is careful to remain player-centric. “We’re focused on integrating AI where it genuinely enhances the player experience, without compromising the authenticity of creator-driven content or the integrity of player interactions,” he said. Borget added that The Sandbox is not in a hurry to implement AI across all of the platform’s elements. “Instead, we’re thoughtfully assessing where it can add value without diluting the uniquely human touch that defines The Sandbox experience,” he stated. Giammario further explained that the biggest hurdles are currently around trust, transparency, and technical complexity . He noted that players need to trust that AI agents act in their best interest. “Whether that’s managing assets, making trades, or shaping gameplay, which is why transparency in AI decision-making and on-chain verifiability are essential,” he said. Giammario added that there are concerns around data privacy, ethical use, and the risk of AI-generated content diluting creativity or introducing bias. On the technical side, he explained that integrating robust AI with blockchain’s current limitations (like transaction speed and cost) is non-trivial. “Ensuring smooth, scalable experiences is an ongoing challenge,” he said. “The path forward is open standards, clear ethical guidelines, and hybrid architectures that combine on-chain transparency with off-chain AI and community oversight to keep both the tech and the incentives in check.” The post AI Agents Set to Spark $615B Boom in Blockchain Gaming Engagement appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|AI Agents|Gaming|Web3 gaming,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-09 22:31:47

The exchange is actively pursuing a MiCA license to expand its offerings and cement its role in the evolving European crypto regulatory environment. Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has received regulatory approval to expand its crypto derivatives trading business across the European Union. The exchange, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced on May 9 that it had secured a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) license from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). Source: Gemini Gemini Expands European Footprint With Malta-Backed MiFID II Approval According to the announcement , the new license from Malta allows Gemini to offer crypto derivatives, including perpetual futures, to advanced users throughout the EU and the European Economic Area. The exchange said it is now working with regulators to meet the conditions for a full-scale launch of its derivatives platform. Source: MFSA “Once we commence business activities, we will be able to offer regulated derivatives throughout the EU and EEA under MiFID II,” said Mark Jennings, Gemini’s head of Europe. The approval follows months of regulatory engagement in Malta, where Gemini chose to base its European licensing efforts. Malta is known for its crypto-friendly regulatory environment, making it a common hub for digital asset firms seeking access to EU markets. MiFID II, which was launched in January 2018, is not a single license but a framework that allows companies to operate across EU member states through a system known as “passporting.” Once licensed in one EU country, a firm can offer services across the region without requiring separate local approvals. According to MFSA records, Gemini’s Maltese entity, Gemini Intergalactic EU Artemis, was issued the MiFID II license on May 8. The license is a major step in the company’s broader European expansion strategy. “This is a significant milestone,” said Jennings. “It puts us one step closer to delivering a secure and regulated derivatives offering to both retail and institutional users in Europe.” The announcement further noted that Gemini plans to introduce a range of crypto derivatives in the coming months, beginning with perpetual futures for advanced users. The exchange said it will continue to work with regulators to fulfill all launch requirements. The firm also stated that it is actively pursuing a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license, allowing it to provide a wider suite of regulated crypto services across the EU. Gemini Advances Global Ambitions With New EU License, U.S. Office, and IPO Plans Gemini’s latest EU license marks another step as the crypto exchange accelerates its global derivatives push. In January, the firm named Malta its European hub for compliance under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, indicating its intent to anchor deeper within the EU regulatory fold. This followed Gemini’s sixth virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration in Europe, secured from Malta’s Financial Services Authority in December 2024.

News has surfaced that a prominent figure from US Politics Crypto discussions, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, is slated to speak at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference . This development, initially reported by Watcher Guru on X, signals a growing and undeniable engagement from high levels of government with the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. It raises questions and sparks anticipation across the industry – what will he say? What does this mean for the future of US Crypto Policy ? The Significance of JD Vance Crypto Engagement The participation of a sitting U.S. Vice President at the Bitcoin Conference is far from a trivial matter. Historically, engagement from such high-ranking officials at dedicated cryptocurrency events has been limited. While politicians often address technology or finance sectors, directly stepping onto the stage of a major Bitcoin gathering like this underscores the increasing mainstream relevance and political weight that digital assets are acquiring. JD Vance’s decision to speak suggests that discussions around Bitcoin and blockchain technology are moving beyond niche financial circles and into the core of national political discourse. This isn’t just about giving a speech; it’s a powerful symbol. It grants a level of legitimacy to the crypto space in the eyes of traditional finance and the broader public. For years, the industry has sought clearer communication and understanding from policymakers. Having the Vice President address the community directly provides an unparalleled platform for dialogue, even if one-sided initially. It acknowledges the significant economic impact, technological innovation, and growing voter base associated with the crypto ecosystem. What Does This Mean for US Crypto Policy ? The landscape of US Crypto Policy has been characterized by uncertainty and a fragmented regulatory approach. Various government agencies have asserted jurisdiction, leading to confusion and challenges for businesses operating in the space. The lack of comprehensive federal legislation has been a major point of concern for innovators and investors alike. VP Vance’s appearance could be a signal that the administration is preparing to take a more defined stance on digital assets. While his specific views on Bitcoin and broader crypto regulation are subject to public scrutiny and interpretation, his willingness to engage directly with the community at the Bitcoin Conference suggests these topics are on the administration’s radar. Potential policy areas that could be touched upon include: Regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, exchanges, and other crypto businesses. Taxation of digital assets. The role of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) versus decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin. National security implications of cryptocurrencies. Fostering innovation while mitigating risks. His speech could offer clues about the administration’s direction, potential legislative priorities, or simply serve as an opportunity to gauge the industry’s reaction to certain ideas. It’s an opportunity for the crypto community to hear directly from a key decision-maker and, perhaps, for the administration to signal its intentions regarding future regulatory clarity or action. Exploring Political Interest Bitcoin at the Conference The presence of high-profile politicians at the Bitcoin Conference is becoming increasingly common, highlighting the growing Political Interest Bitcoin holds. This interest stems from several factors: Growing Voter Base: The number of Americans who own or are interested in cryptocurrencies is significant and growing. This represents a substantial block of potential voters who are increasingly paying attention to candidates’ stances on digital assets. Economic Potential: Policymakers recognize the potential for job creation, investment, and economic growth offered by the blockchain and crypto industries. States and cities are already competing to become crypto hubs. Technological Innovation: Bitcoin and blockchain represent significant technological advancements with potential applications beyond finance, including supply chain management, digital identity, and more. Politicians are keen to understand and potentially harness this innovation. National Debt and Monetary Policy: Some politicians, particularly those concerned about inflation and national debt, see Bitcoin as a potential hedge or alternative store of value, aligning with certain political philosophies. VP Vance’s participation elevates this trend. It moves the conversation from individual politicians expressing support or concern to a high-level administration official addressing the community directly at one of its most important annual gatherings. This kind of engagement validates the industry’s importance on a national stage. Potential Topics and Implications for Bitcoin Adoption US What might VP Vance discuss? While the exact topic is unknown, given the context of the Bitcoin Conference and the current political climate, potential themes could include: The administration’s perspective on Bitcoin as an asset class or technology. How the U.S. can maintain its competitive edge in financial innovation. Balancing consumer protection and financial stability with fostering innovation. The role of Bitcoin in a global economic context. Potential pathways for future legislation or executive actions impacting Bitcoin Adoption US . The implications for Bitcoin Adoption US could be significant. Positive remarks or a clear signal towards supportive policy could encourage institutional investment, provide clarity for businesses looking to integrate Bitcoin, and boost overall confidence among retail users. Conversely, negative sentiment or a focus on strict regulation could introduce headwinds. The speech will be closely watched for any indication of the administration’s stance on integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. The Stage is Set: Bitcoin Conference 2025 The Bitcoin Conference is renowned as one of the largest and most influential events in the Bitcoin ecosystem, bringing together developers, investors, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts from around the globe. The 2025 iteration, set to host VP JD Vance, is now guaranteed to attract even more attention from traditional media, policymakers, and the global financial community. The conference serves as a vital platform for discussing the latest developments, challenges, and future directions of Bitcoin. Having the Vice President speak here provides an unparalleled opportunity for the industry to be heard and for the administration to communicate its perspective directly to a key audience. It’s a chance to bridge the gap between the fast-moving world of decentralized technology and the often slower-paced realm of government policy. The interactions and discussions sparked by his presence could have lasting effects on how Bitcoin and crypto are perceived and regulated in the United States. Conclusion The news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to speak at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference is a pivotal moment. It signifies a clear escalation in the level of engagement between high-ranking US Politics Crypto figures and the digital asset industry. This event has the potential to shape discussions around US Crypto Policy , highlight the growing Political Interest Bitcoin holds, and influence the trajectory of Bitcoin Adoption US . While the specifics of his address remain unknown, his presence itself is a powerful statement about the increasing importance of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on the national agenda. The crypto world will undoubtedly be watching and listening intently.

The world of digital assets is buzzing with news surrounding the TRUMP coin ($TRUMP), a prominent player in the political meme coin space. An exclusive event is set to take place on May 22 , hosted by none other than former U.S. President Donald Trump himself. What’s Happening at the Exclusive Crypto Event ? According to an announcement from the official TrumpMeme X account, a special “TRUMP Dinner” is scheduled for May 22 in Washington, D.C. This isn’t just any dinner; it’s a high-profile crypto event specifically for the most dedicated supporters of the TRUMP meme coin. The dinner will be hosted by Donald Trump and is set to gather the top 220 holders of the TRUMP coin. This direct engagement from a major political figure with the community of a specific cryptocurrency is highly unusual and signals a unique moment for the TRUMP coin ecosystem. Who’s Invited to the Donald Trump Dinner? Exclusivity is key for this event. The invitation list is strictly based on the amount of TRUMP coin held. The top 220 holders will receive an invitation to the main dinner. But the perks don’t stop there. An even more exclusive group – the top 25 holders – will gain access to additional benefits, including: Access to a pre-dinner reception. A coveted tour of the White House. This tiered access model rewards the most significant investors and creates considerable buzz within the community, highlighting the value placed on high-conviction holders. Anticipating the New Phase for TRUMP Coin The most exciting aspect of the May 22 dinner, according to the TrumpMeme announcement, is the promised revelation of a “new phase” for the TRUMP coin. While details are scarce, this announcement has fueled significant speculation within the crypto community. What could this new phase entail? Potential possibilities discussed by market observers include: Utility Expansion: Moving beyond a pure meme coin to introduce actual use cases or integrations. Tokenomics Adjustments: Potential burns, staking mechanisms, or other changes impacting the supply and demand dynamics. Political Integration: Closer ties to political campaigns, fundraising efforts, or specific initiatives. Partnerships: Collaborations with other projects or entities.

This event on May 22 elevates the profile of the TRUMP coin significantly. It legitimizes the project in the eyes of some and certainly generates massive media attention, both within the crypto space and mainstream news. For the invited holders, it’s a unique opportunity to interact directly with Donald Trump and potentially gain insights into the future direction of the project directly from the source or those closely associated with him. The White House tour adds another layer of prestige, further blurring the lines between political influence and crypto investment. Impact on the Meme Coin Market The TRUMP coin is part of a broader trend of politically themed meme coin s. Events like this can have a ripple effect, drawing attention not only to $TRUMP but also to other tokens associated with political figures or themes. The success or impact of this event could influence how future political figures engage with the crypto community. However, it’s crucial to remember the inherent volatility and speculative nature of meme coin s. Prices can be heavily influenced by hype, social media trends, and events like the one planned for May 22 . Investors should approach such assets with caution, understanding the risks involved. What Does This Mean for TRUMP Coin Holders? If you are among the top holders, congratulations on the exclusive invitation! This is a rare opportunity.

These impressive milestones place Solana firmly among the top blockchains driving the crypto ecosystem forward. However, while seasoned investors may see Solana as a steady and reliable option, early-stage gems like Ruvi present even greater profit potential. Ruvi, an AI-powered cryptocurrency still in its presale phase, is forging a future defined by blockchain innovation and unparalleled growth possibilities. If you’re looking for game-changing returns, Ruvi just might be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Solana’s recent achievements Solana’s recent rally can be attributed to its groundbreaking work in asset tokenization, a move likely to attract institutional investors. Through collaborations like the one with SOL Strategies, Solana is paving the way for tokenized equities on its high-performance blockchain. Projects like these highlight Solana’s growing relevance in institutional-grade applications, making it a key player in next-generation finance. The $250 price target With Solana already trading above *$162, its path to $250 by Q2 2025 seems plausible, especially considering its rising adoption and market demand. This bullish sentiment has brought an influx of retail and institutional capital, further reinforcing Solana’s position in the crypto hierarchy. Despite its impressive outlook, Solana’s well-established status means its growth will likely be incremental. This is where Ruvi comes into play, offering potentially explosive returns for those willing to get in early. Why Ruvi stands out Ruvi isn’t just another blockchain project. It combines the power of AI with blockchain technology to tackle real-world problems across industries like healthcare, logistics, and fraud detection. Here’s why Ruvi is capturing the attention of savvy investors. Key features of Ruvi Deflationary Economics Ruvi has a total capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens, ensuring scarcity and driving long-term value appreciation. Game-Changing Tech Integration By merging AI with blockchain, Ruvi enhances decision-making, efficiency, and transparency in ways no other cryptocurrency currently offers. Generous Presale Bonuses Ruvi rewards early investors generously with tiered bonuses depending on the size of their initial purchase. With its focus on cutting-edge innovation and incentivized early participation, Ruvi presents an exciting alternative to mature projects like Solana. The investment potential of Ruvi For investors seeking a high-growth opportunity, Ruvi offers massive potential. With predicted token prices ranging from $1 to $3, and presale bonuses to amplify returns, here’s how investments could stack up. $500 investment Tokens Bought: 50,000 Presale Bonus: 40%, increasing your total to 70,000 tokens. Potential Value (at $2/token): $140,000 $3,000 investment Tokens Bought: 300,000 Presale Bonus: 80%, increasing your total to 540,000 tokens. Potential Value (at $2.50/token): $1.35 million $10,000 investment Tokens Bought: 1,000,000 Presale Bonus: 100%, doubling your holdings to 2,000,000 tokens. Potential Value (at $3/token): $6 million These figures underscore Ruvi’s potential to deliver life-altering returns. Ruvi vs Solana While Solana is a giant in blockchain and boasts promising developments, it lacks the “ground-floor” appeal that Ruvi offers to early investors. Here’s how the two compare. Scope of Innovation Solana’s focus on tokenized equities is significant but narrowly defined. Ruvi, on the other hand, combines AI and blockchain to disrupt multiple industries, making it more versatile. Growth Potential Solana is poised to grow steadily, but Ruvi’s presale stage offers the kind of exponential growth that established projects can no longer provide. Accessibility Solana primarily attracts institutional participation, while Ruvi caters to investors of all sizes, offering exceptional value regardless of starting capital. Don’t wait to invest in Ruvi Solana’s rise to $173 and its projected climb to $250 are undoubtedly impressive. But for investors seeking unimaginable returns, Ruvi offers an unprecedented opportunity. Whether you’re an experienced trader or new to crypto, Ruvi’s early accessibility, deflationary structure, and AI-driven innovation make it the investment of a lifetime. Why settle for incremental gains when you can secure substantial returns? Act now to join the Ruvi revolution and redefine your financial future.

However, the momentum is being tested as strong resistance builds around the $0.205 level. A recent analysis highlights this crucial zone and outlines the roadmap for Dogecoin’s next move. Dogecoin Price Recovery Faces Critical Resistance TradingView crypto analyst Lingrid recently shared a technical analysis featuring a classic continuation pattern unfolding for Dogecoin. The analyst revealed that the Dogecoin price is attempting a recovery after rebounding from a key ascending trendline and breaking out of a Falling Wedge pattern. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Ready For Next 500% Wave, Here’s The Target Following this, Dogecoin is now retesting the breakout level around $0.175, where both the wedge resistance and ascending trendline converge. The cryptocurrency has also formed a higher low structure on its price chart. Notably, this breakout zone is critical, as holding above it would confirm the breakout and set the stage for potential gains. Lingrid has revealed that traders are currently watching closely for continuation toward the next resistance area. The $0.19 level has been set as the next immediate breakout target, aligning with the top of the previous range and the midpoint of the broader resistance area. A push beyond $0.19 would open the door for a run toward the range between $0.2 – $0.21, a key resistance area where selling pressures could intensify. While Dogecoin’s structure remains relatively bullish with higher lows forming, Lingrid has also cautioned that overhead resistance near $0.19 and $0.2 could slow down the momentum. Notably, Dogecoin’s trading volume will also play a key role in its price action and future moves. As the price approaches the wedge apex, fluctuations in volume could either sustain the strength of the rally or weaken it. DOGE To Decline Further If Support Fails Since the beginning of this year, the Dogecoin price has recorded its fair share of unexpected price declines and volatility. While Lingrid’s analysis shares encouraging signs of a potential price recovery and bull rally, Dogecoin’s breakout remains at risk. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Poised For Breakout Amid Accumulation, Here’s The Target If its price fails to hold the critical support zone at $0.175, especially with a strong candle close below this level, the projected breakout could be invalidated. This would, in turn, potentially lead to a steeper price breakdown toward $0.15, representing a 25% decrease from its current market value of $0.2. Lingrid also mentions that a failure to maintain buyer interest near the wedge apex and weakening volume could also contribute to market indecision, making a swift recovery less likely. As a result, traders are advised to watch the $0.175 zone closely as a key breakout point that will determine whether Dogecoin resumes its climb or faces renewed downward pressure.

44396332,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159137,1746831613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BlackRock SEC Meeting: Pushing for Crucial Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/blackrock-sec-crypto-regulation/,"In a move signaling growing institutional engagement with digital assets, representatives from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently held a significant BlackRock SEC meeting with officials from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Cryptocurrency Task Force. This interaction, reported by Solid Intel on X, centered on the urgent need for clear crypto regulation across several key areas of the burgeoning digital asset landscape. Why the BlackRock SEC Meeting Matters for Crypto Regulation When an entity as influential as BlackRock engages directly with top regulators like the SEC, it sends a powerful signal to the market. With trillions of dollars under management, BlackRock’s interest and participation are often seen as a bellwether for broader institutional adoption. Their decision to proactively discuss crypto regulation indicates not only their commitment to the space but also the critical need for regulatory clarity to facilitate further institutional investment and mainstream integration. The meeting agenda was comprehensive, touching upon areas that are currently at the forefront of regulatory debate and technological innovation: Regulation concerning crypto staking services. Standards for the growing field of tokenization. Establishing clear approval standards for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly focusing on Bitcoin ETF approval . Discussion around standards for options based on crypto ETFs. This direct dialogue highlights the industry’s desire for a predictable and understandable regulatory environment, moving beyond enforcement actions towards proactive rule-making. Understanding the Push for Bitcoin ETF Approval Standards For years, the crypto industry, particularly proponents of Bitcoin, has sought the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. Such a product would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the asset, potentially unlocking significant capital inflows. The SEC has historically been hesitant, citing concerns primarily related to market manipulation and inadequate surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets. The discussion on Bitcoin ETF approval standards during the BlackRock SEC meeting likely focused on addressing these very concerns. Key standards typically involve: Surveillance Sharing: Agreements with significant crypto trading platforms to detect and prevent market manipulation. Custody Solutions: Ensuring robust and secure methods for holding the underlying Bitcoin. Valuation: Reliable methods for determining the price of Bitcoin. Liquidity: Sufficient market depth to support the ETF’s creation and redemption process. BlackRock, having filed multiple ETF applications, including a prominent spot Bitcoin ETF application (the iShares Bitcoin Trust), is deeply invested in seeing these standards clarified and met. Their large size and existing relationships with regulators potentially position them uniquely to navigate the approval process. Demystifying Crypto Staking Regulation Needs Crypto staking is a process used by many proof-of-stake blockchains to validate transactions. Participants lock up their cryptocurrency holdings to support the network, and in return, they earn rewards. It’s a fundamental mechanism in the operations of many modern cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum after its transition to Proof-of-Stake. The SEC has raised questions about whether certain staking-as-a-service offerings constitute unregistered securities. Actions against platforms like Kraken and Coinbase have highlighted the regulatory uncertainty in this area. BlackRock’s interest in staking regulation suggests they are considering offering such services or see staking rewards as a potential component of digital asset investment products. Clear regulation around crypto staking is needed to define: When staking services are considered securities. Required disclosures for staking providers. Protections for investors participating in staking. How institutional players can offer or participate in staking compliantly. Lack of clarity here creates risk for both service providers and investors, potentially stifling participation in a core function of many blockchain networks. Charting the Course for Tokenization Standards Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital token on a blockchain that represents ownership of an underlying asset. This asset can be anything from real estate and art to stocks, bonds, or even intellectual property. Tokenization holds immense potential for increasing liquidity, enabling fractional ownership, and streamlining transactions. However, tokenization also presents complex regulatory challenges, particularly when the underlying asset is a traditional security or represents a share in a venture. The SEC needs to determine how existing securities laws apply to tokenized assets and the platforms where they are traded. BlackRock’s interest in tokenization standards underscores their view that this technology could revolutionize capital markets, provided there’s a clear regulatory framework. Discussions on tokenization standards likely included: Defining what constitutes a tokenized security versus other types of tokens. Requirements for issuing tokenized securities (e.g., registration). Regulation of platforms that list and trade tokenized assets. Custody rules for tokenized assets. Developing clear standards is essential for unlocking the potential of tokenization while protecting investors and ensuring market integrity. Navigating the Broader Landscape of Crypto Regulation Beyond staking, tokenization, and ETFs, the conversation likely touched upon the broader challenges and opportunities in crypto regulation . Regulating a global, decentralized, and rapidly evolving technology is no simple task. The SEC faces the challenge of applying decades-old securities laws to novel digital assets and technologies. Key challenges in establishing effective crypto regulation include: Defining various types of crypto assets (security, commodity, currency, utility token). Jurisdictional issues in a global market. Keeping pace with technological advancements (e.g., DeFi, NFTs). Balancing investor protection with fostering innovation. Despite these hurdles, the potential benefits of clear crypto regulation are significant: Increased investor confidence and protection. Greater institutional participation and capital flow. Reduced market manipulation and illicit activity. A clear framework for businesses to innovate and operate legally. The discussion regarding standards for options on crypto ETFs is another facet of this maturing market. Options trading adds layers of complexity and requires specific rules to ensure fair pricing, settlement, and prevent manipulation, especially given the volatility of crypto assets. What Does This Meeting Signal for the Future? The BlackRock SEC meeting is a positive indicator that major financial players and regulators are actively engaging to shape the future of digital asset markets. While regulatory clarity is still a work in progress, these dialogues are crucial steps towards establishing the necessary frameworks for widespread adoption and responsible innovation. Investors and market participants should view this as a signal of the market’s evolution and the increasing likelihood of more defined rules governing the space in the future. Understanding the nuances of upcoming crypto regulation , particularly around areas like crypto staking , tokenization standards , and the path towards Bitcoin ETF approval , will be vital for navigating the digital asset landscape effectively. Conclusion: A Step Towards Regulatory Maturity BlackRock’s proactive engagement with the SEC on critical issues like staking, tokenization, and ETF standards marks a significant moment in the journey towards clearer crypto regulation . It underscores the industry’s desire for rules that facilitate growth while ensuring market integrity and investor protection. While the path to comprehensive regulation is long and complex, dialogues like this are essential steps in building a bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. The outcome of these discussions will undoubtedly shape the future structure and accessibility of crypto markets for years to come.

44396720,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159142,1746832241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Bitcoin Transfer: $497M Departs Bitfinex in Shocking Whale Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/massive-bitcoin-transfer/,"The cryptocurrency world is often abuzz with news of significant movements on the blockchain. When a substantial amount of digital assets changes hands, especially from a major exchange, it naturally captures the attention of traders, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. A recent event that sparked considerable interest was a notable Bitcoin transfer originating from the Bitfinex exchange. Understanding the Massive Bitcoin Transfer According to data shared by the popular blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert , a staggering 4,812 Bitcoins were moved from the Bitfinex platform. At the time of the report, this colossal sum was valued at approximately $497 million. The destination of this significant cache of BTC was identified simply as an ‘unknown wallet’. Such large-scale movements are often referred to as ‘whale’ transactions because they involve amounts substantial enough to potentially influence market dynamics or signal significant strategic shifts by large holders. Tracking these movements is a key activity for many in the crypto space seeking to gain insight into potential market trends or the behavior of major players. Why Track Whale Alert? Services like Whale Alert play a crucial role in enhancing transparency within the often-opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. While the blockchain itself is a public ledger, identifying the entities behind specific wallet addresses can be challenging. Whale Alert monitors vast amounts of transaction data across various blockchains, flagging unusually large transfers and, where possible, identifying the source or destination (e.g., known exchanges, specified wallets). For the average market participant, following Whale Alert provides a real-time feed of significant capital movements. While a single transaction doesn’t dictate market direction, a pattern of large inflows to exchanges might suggest potential selling pressure, while large outflows could indicate accumulation or movement to cold storage. The Bitfinex Connection: A Major Exchange’s Role The origin of this large Bitcoin transfer being Bitfinex is noteworthy. Bitfinex is one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Exchanges serve as central hubs where millions of users buy, sell, and store digital assets. Large transfers originating from an exchange can signify several possibilities: A large client withdrawing funds to personal storage (cold wallet). The exchange itself moving funds for internal management purposes (e.g., consolidating hot wallets, moving to cold storage). An over-the-counter (OTC) trade settlement, where a large block of Bitcoin is purchased and immediately moved off the exchange. Without further information about the destination wallet or the parties involved, pinpointing the exact reason behind a transfer from a major exchange like Bitfinex remains speculative. Interpreting a Large Bitcoin Transfer What does a transaction of this magnitude, nearly half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, actually mean? Interpreting a large Bitcoin transfer requires considering various factors. Is it an inflow to an exchange or an outflow? Is it between known entities or to/from an unknown wallet? In this specific case, the outflow from a known exchange (Bitfinex) to an unknown wallet is the key characteristic. Potential interpretations include: Institutional Movement: Large firms or funds often move significant capital for strategic reasons, such as rebalancing portfolios or securing assets long-term. Cold Storage: The owner might be moving assets from the exchange’s hot wallet to a more secure cold storage solution for enhanced safety. OTC Deal: A large private purchase might have been executed off the main exchange order book, with the seller transferring the BTC from their exchange account directly to the buyer’s wallet. Exchange Management: Bitfinex could be relocating funds as part of its internal wallet management and security protocols. The term ‘unknown wallet’ simply means the address hasn’t been publicly linked to a specific individual, institution, or service. This maintains a degree of privacy for the recipient. What Does This Crypto Whale Activity Mean for You? Tracking crypto whale activity can offer valuable, albeit indirect, insights into market sentiment and potential future movements. While you shouldn’t base investment decisions solely on a single transaction, observing patterns of large transfers can be part of a broader market analysis strategy. Benefits of Tracking Whale Activity: Market Transparency: Provides a glimpse into where large amounts of capital are moving. Potential Signals: Large movements off exchanges can sometimes signal long-term holding intentions; large movements onto exchanges might precede selling. Awareness: Keeps you informed about significant events happening on the blockchain. Challenges and Risks: Anonymity: ‘Unknown wallets’ make it hard to know the true intent behind the transfer. Misinterpretation: A single transaction can be misinterpreted; it’s crucial to look for patterns. Not Predictive: Whale movements are not guaranteed predictors of price changes. Actionable Insights: Use Whale Alert and similar services as one tool among many for market observation. Focus on patterns of large transfers rather than reacting to individual ones. Understand that large outflows from exchanges to unknown wallets often suggest a move towards holding rather than immediate selling, though this isn’t always the case. Prioritize your own research and strategy over simply following whale movements. Conclusion: The Enigma of the Unknown Wallet The transfer of 4,812 BTC from Bitfinex to an unknown wallet, valued at nearly half a billion dollars, is a significant event that highlights the constant movement of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem. While the exact reason for this particular Bitcoin transfer remains unknown, it underscores the activity of large holders, often referred to as whales, and the transparency provided by blockchain tracking services like Whale Alert . Such a large Bitcoin transfer from a major exchange like Bitfinex to an anonymous destination is a common occurrence, often related to security, strategic holding, or large private transactions. For those interested in the crypto market, keeping an eye on this kind of crypto whale activity, while not a crystal ball, can add valuable context to broader market analysis.

That question is echoing louder as the market shifts focus from hype to infrastructure. It’s no longer about inflated roadmaps or speculative rallies—it’s about execution. This shift is accelerating as macroeconomic signals intensify. Experts now warn that a potential Fed pivot—a change from hawkish interest rate policies to more accommodative ones—could trigger a massive Bitcoin rally. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), HYPE, and Bitcoin—three blockchain initiatives tackling essential but often overlooked challenges. Each fulfills a unique demand: Qubetics redefines cross-border functionality; HYPE fuels decentralized liquidity for derivatives markets; and Bitcoin continues to anchor decentralized value with growing institutional endorsement. Let’s explore the best cryptos to join for long term based on utility, adoption, and real-world application. Qubetics : The Infrastructure Behind Seamless Cross-Border Blockchain Qubetics ($TICS) is laying down the digital rails for something that should’ve been solved years ago—cross-border crypto payments without the usual delays, fees, or conversion friction. In a world where capital doesn’t wait, Qubetics enables near-instant, multi-currency transactions across countries, protocols, and dApps. This is especially critical for those operating across international supply routes, fintech platforms requiring seamless on-chain/off-chain transfers, and stablecoin integrations demanding precision speed and trustless routing. Its non-custodial structure means wallets aren’t held hostage by centralized entities, and thanks to its native QubeQode deployment environment, smart contracts for transactions, identity, and insurance can run concurrently across chains. A logistics network can finalize payment while simultaneously triggering delivery confirmation and asset tokenization, all in under 10 seconds. Now in its 33rd crypto presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 511 million $TICS tokens to more than 26,000 holders, raising $16.8 million. At $0.2302, the current presale rate still reflects steep upside potential. If $TICS hits $1 post-mainnet, participants could see 334% ROI. That number escalates to over 6,415% ROI if $TICS hits $15. With layered utility and surging adoption, early entrants aren’t just buying in—they’re becoming part of the infrastructure. Investment Scenario for $2,500 Allocation If a community participant deploys $2,500 into Qubetics at the current presale rate of $0.2302, that translates to 10,860 $TICS tokens. Should $TICS reach $1 post-mainnet, this would yield $10,860—an ROI of 334%. If the token climbs to $10, the same allocation returns $108,600, and at $15, it skyrockets to $162,900. As weekly demand continues to rise and cross-chain usage increases, missing out on this presale phase could mean watching an era-defining infrastructure evolve from the sidelines. HYPE: A New Velocity in On-Chain Derivatives Hyperliquid’s HYPE token isn’t waiting for validation. At $23.72 and climbing 10.5% in 24 hours, it’s clear the platform is striking a nerve with crypto-native traders who’ve had enough of sluggish centralized exchanges. What sets HYPE apart is speed—built for those who don’t want a five-second delay between executing a perp and seeing it reflect on-chain. Its zero-order book model and deep liquidity from LP staking pools make trade execution nearly instant. But it’s not just the numbers. The recent integration of Ethena’s USDe stablecoin added another layer of composability. Traders can now swap, hedge, and stabilize gains without off-ramping, creating a tighter feedback loop for high-frequency strategies. And the markets noticed. With analysts floating potential recovery levels of $28.41 and even a bullish surge to $35.47, participants are rotating into HYPE not just for speculation, but because it gives them tools they can’t find elsewhere. Bitcoin’s Strategic Evolution: From Digital Reserve to Institutional Portfolio Anchor Bitcoin isn’t reinventing itself—it doesn’t have to. But what’s changing is how it’s being absorbed into structured finance. Bitwise Asset Management’s partnership with iCapital is more than another headline. It’s a tactical deployment of regulated Bitcoin exposure to over 100,000 financial advisors. With strategies like Trendwise ETFs rotating between crypto futures and Treasuries, Bitcoin is now being offered with downside protection and upside allocation. Bitcoin surged past $100,000, reaching approximately $101,525, driven by optimism. This rally led to significant market activity, including over $118 million in short positions being liquidated and a 7% increase in open interest, surpassing $70 billion. Bitcoin remains the benchmark for digital value, but now it’s absorbing structured capital flows. The inclusion into ETF strategies shifts it from static asset to dynamic engine—one that even the old guard can’t ignore. One Ecosystem, Three Visions: What Unites Them? These projects might appear unrelated on the surface, but their trajectories show convergence in one critical area—solving what blockchain was supposed to fix. Qubetics tackles global transfer inefficiencies; HYPE builds lightning-fast infrastructure for derivative markets; and Bitcoin, the archetype of decentralization, now proves its place within institutional financial engineering. While each protocol speaks its own language, they echo a singular truth: The best cryptos to join for long term are no longer those with the loudest marketing—they’re the ones building quietly but deeply. Conclusion: Why These Are the Best Cryptos to Join for Long Term Participants seeking more than speculation are pivoting toward utility-first ecosystems. Qubetics delivers real-world applications like cross-border liquidity and smart wallet independence. HYPE arms the trader class with instant execution and composable derivatives. Bitcoin absorbs the weight of institutional demand without altering its decentralized foundation. Together, they embody the next era of blockchain maturity—one where long-term relevance matters more than short-term noise. Those looking to engage with blockchain’s future aren’t waiting for permission—they’re choosing the best cryptos to join for long term today.

44397032,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159173,1746832839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price Correlation: How Global M2 Money Supply Drives Astounding Growth,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-m2-money-supply/,"Have you been watching the recent surge in the Bitcoin price and wondering what’s truly driving it? While many factors influence the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, a significant narrative gaining traction among analysts points to a powerful force from the traditional financial system: increased global liquidity . This connection suggests that the flow of money around the world has a profound impact on digital asset valuations, particularly for the leading cryptocurrency. Understanding the Connection: Bitcoin and M2 Money Supply At the heart of this analysis is the concept of the M2 money supply . What exactly is M2? Simply put, it’s a measure of the total amount of money circulating within an economy, including physical cash, checking deposits, savings accounts, money market securities, and other time deposits. When economists talk about ‘global M2 money supply’, they are aggregating this measure across major economies worldwide. An increase in M2 often indicates more money is available in the system, potentially seeking investment opportunities. Multiple analysts have highlighted a compelling correlation between the expansion or contraction of this global money supply and the price movements of assets, including Bitcoin. Cointelegraph recently reported on this trend, citing various experts who see global liquidity as a primary driver for Bitcoin’s recent performance. What Do Macro Investors Say About This Correlation? One prominent voice discussing this link is macro investor Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision. Pal has extensively analyzed historical data, demonstrating that Bitcoin’s price movements often mirror changes in global M2. His analysis suggests that as central banks and governments inject more liquidity into the system (often through quantitative easing or stimulus measures), a portion of that capital flows into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Conversely, when liquidity tightens, these assets can face downward pressure. This perspective shifts the focus from purely crypto-specific catalysts (like technological developments or adoption rates) to broader macroeconomic forces. It positions Bitcoin not just as a disruptive technology but also as a global macro asset, sensitive to the tides of international finance. Is the Current Global Liquidity Cycle Sustainable? Understanding the current environment requires looking at the broader liquidity cycle. Michael Howell, founder and CEO of CrossBorder Capital, a firm specializing in tracking global liquidity flows, provides a crucial outlook. Howell suggests that the current phase of increasing global liquidity is likely to continue for some time, potentially peaking around mid-2026. This prediction has significant implications for assets like Bitcoin. If liquidity continues to expand towards a peak in 2026, it could provide a tailwind for crypto prices. However, Howell also notes that a downward phase is likely to follow this peak. This suggests that while the coming couple of years might be supported by macro tailwinds, the subsequent period could present challenges as liquidity potentially tightens globally. Key Takeaways from the Analysis: Strong Correlation: Analysts see a significant link between global M2 money supply and Bitcoin price performance. Liquidity as a Driver: Increased global liquidity provides capital that can flow into risk assets, including crypto. Macro Asset Status: Bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a macro asset influenced by global financial conditions. Cycle Peak Prediction: The current liquidity cycle is predicted to peak around mid-2026, with a subsequent downturn expected. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Price? For investors and enthusiasts, this correlation is vital information. It suggests that simply analyzing on-chain data or technological updates might not be enough to fully understand Bitcoin’s trajectory. Paying attention to global macroeconomic indicators, particularly central bank policies and liquidity measures, becomes increasingly important. Benefits: Understanding this correlation can help anticipate potential price movements based on macro trends. It provides a framework for viewing Bitcoin within the broader global financial system. During periods of high liquidity expansion, it can signal potential upside for the asset. Challenges: When global liquidity tightens (as predicted after the potential 2026 peak), it could pose a significant headwind for Bitcoin. Macro trends can be complex and influenced by numerous unpredictable factors (geopolitics, inflation, etc.). Relying solely on this correlation ignores other important drivers of Bitcoin’s value. Actionable Insights: Monitor reports on global liquidity and central bank policies from major economies (US, Eurozone, China, etc.). Consider how different phases of the liquidity cycle might impact your investment strategy. Diversify your analysis beyond just crypto-specific metrics. Be aware that a potential tightening phase after 2026 could introduce increased volatility or downward pressure. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin’s Future Through a Macro Lens The narrative linking Bitcoin’s price to global liquidity and the M2 money supply offers a compelling perspective for understanding its recent performance and potential future trajectory. Insights from experts like Raoul Pal and Michael Howell underscore that macro forces are powerful drivers in the crypto market. While the predicted peak in global liquidity around mid-2026 suggests potential support for asset prices in the near term, the subsequent forecast of a downturn highlights the importance of preparing for different market environments. For anyone invested in or considering Bitcoin , keeping a close eye on these overarching macroeconomic cycles is becoming increasingly crucial for navigating the exciting yet complex world of digital assets.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $89.8 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $8.8 billion, recorded a 17 percent pump in the past week to trade about $173 on Friday, May 9, during the later North American trading session. Following the heightened volatility, Solana’s leveraged market recorded a net liquidation of about $31 million in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Solana’s on-chain liquidations on native perpetual exchanges reached a high of over $47 million in the past 24 hours, thus increasing the odds of a short squeeze. Solana Network Thrives with Institutional Investors The Solana network has attracted significant cash inflow from institutional investors, led by Sol Strategies , in the past few quarters. The notable memecoin growth within the Solana network helped increase its total value locked to over $8.7 billion. As Coinpedia reported, several fund managers are seeking to offer spot Solana ETFs in the United States. Moreover, the U.S. SEC under the Donald Trump administration has accelerated its pro-crypto stance in two months compared to Gary Gensler’s four-year term. Midterm Target for SOL Price From a technical standpoint, it is now safe to say that Solana price is under the influence of bullish sentiment. In the 2-hour timeframe, the SOL price successfully rebounded from a breakout of a falling logarithmic trend. With the 2-hour timeframe MACD line having crossed the zero line and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above the 70 percent level, SOL price is now aiming for $187 and $240 next. The macro-bullish stance for SOL price will be fully confirmed once the altcoin crosses above the 200-day Moving Average Simple (SMA).",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-09 23:30:21

However, the performance of traditional markets often provides crucial context and can even signal shifts that impact digital assets. Let’s dive into the recent movements in the major US indexes and explore what they might mean for your crypto portfolio. What Happened with Recent Stock Market Performance? In recent trading sessions, the three major U.S. stock indexes concluded the day on a positive note, signaling continued resilience in traditional financial markets. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: S&P 500: Increased by 0.13% Nasdaq Composite: Saw a modest gain of 0.01% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Led the pack with a rise of 0.29% While these individual percentage changes might appear small, collectively they represent a broader positive trend in the stock market performance . This uptick often reflects underlying confidence among investors regarding economic conditions, corporate earnings, or future growth prospects. Understanding this traditional market strength is the first step in seeing how it might ripple through to other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Is There a Crypto Market Correlation? This is the million-dollar question for many crypto enthusiasts. Historically, the relationship between the US stock market , particularly tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq, and the cryptocurrency market has shown periods of significant correlation. During times of high liquidity or widespread risk-on sentiment, both stocks and crypto might rise together as investors are eager to put capital into growth assets. Conversely, in periods of economic uncertainty or tightening monetary policy, both can experience sell-offs as investors move towards safer havens. However, this crypto market correlation is not a constant. The crypto market is also driven by its own unique catalysts: Regulatory news and developments Technological advancements (e.g., blockchain upgrades, new protocols) Specific project milestones or failures Adoption rates and institutional interest So, while a positive day in the stock market doesn’t guarantee a green day for Bitcoin or Ethereum, it often contributes to the overall market mood and can be an indicator of broader investor sentiment . How Do Macroeconomic Factors Play a Role? The performance of both stocks and crypto is heavily influenced by larger macroeconomic factors . Think about things like: Inflation: High inflation can lead central banks to raise interest rates. Interest Rates: Higher rates generally make borrowing more expensive and can reduce the appeal of riskier assets like growth stocks and cryptocurrencies, as safer investments (like bonds) yield more. Central Bank Policy: Decisions by entities like the Federal Reserve regarding quantitative easing or tightening directly impact the amount of liquidity in the financial system, affecting all asset classes. Geopolitical Events: Wars, political instability, and trade disputes can introduce uncertainty, often leading investors to reduce exposure to volatile assets. When the US stock market reacts positively to economic data (like employment numbers or inflation reports), it often signals that the market interprets the data favorably in the context of these macroeconomic factors . This positive interpretation can sometimes spill over into the crypto market, reinforcing the idea of a prevailing risk-on environment. Gauging Investor Sentiment: What Does it Tell Us? Ultimately, market movements are a reflection of collective investor sentiment . When major indexes like the S&P 500 and the Dow close higher, it suggests that the dominant sentiment among traditional investors is one of optimism or at least reduced pessimism. This sentiment isn’t confined to one market; it’s a psychological force that can permeate across different asset classes. A strong traditional stock market performance can indicate: Confidence in corporate profitability Belief in the economy’s ability to withstand challenges A willingness to take on more risk While crypto has its own unique drivers of investor sentiment (like community enthusiasm or fear of missing out), it is not immune to the broader market mood shaped by macroeconomic trends and traditional market performance. Monitoring the crypto market correlation with stocks can offer valuable insights into the prevailing risk appetite in the global financial system. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, how should a crypto investor use this information about the US stock market ? Stay Informed on Macro: Don’t just watch crypto charts. Pay attention to major economic announcements, central bank meetings, and inflation data. These macroeconomic factors are key drivers for both markets. Understand the Correlation, But Don’t Rely Solely on It: Recognize that a crypto market correlation exists but is variable. Crypto can decouple based on internal news or trends. Assess Overall Investor Sentiment: Look at the performance of traditional markets as one gauge of global investor sentiment and risk appetite. Diversify Wisely: Understand how different asset classes behave in various economic conditions. Conclusion: Connecting the Dots The recent positive close for the major US stock market indexes serves as a reminder that traditional finance and the crypto world are increasingly interconnected. While the crypto market has its own unique dynamics, its performance is often influenced by the same broad macroeconomic factors and shifts in global investor sentiment that drive the stock market performance . Understanding this complex crypto market correlation is essential for making informed decisions in today’s intertwined financial landscape.

44397715,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159224,1746834034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Altcoin Season Approaches: Bitcoin Dominance Drop Signals Opportunity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-bitcoin-dominance/,"The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, presenting unique opportunities for investors. Recently, a significant shift has caught the attention of analysts and enthusiasts alike: a notable decline in Bitcoin Dominance . This metric, which measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market cap, is often seen as a key indicator of market sentiment and capital flow. When Bitcoin dominance falls, it can suggest that funds are moving away from Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies, commonly referred to as altcoins. This phenomenon is widely anticipated as a potential precursor to what the community calls ‘ Altcoin Season ‘. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and its Significance Before diving into the potential for an Altcoin Season , it’s crucial to understand what Bitcoin Dominance is and why its movement matters. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the largest by market cap. Its dominance chart reflects its share of the entire crypto market pie. Historically, Bitcoin often leads market rallies, with investors initially buying BTC. As profits are taken or confidence grows, some of these funds tend to flow into larger, more established altcoins (like Ethereum), and then potentially into smaller, more speculative ones. A falling dominance chart suggests this latter phase might be beginning. Recent data highlighted by BeInCrypto shows Bitcoin Dominance dipping from a high of around 65% to approximately 63.31%. While a few percentage points might seem small, in the fast-moving crypto world, this can be a significant signal of shifting sentiment and capital allocation across the Crypto Market Trends . What is Altcoin Season and Why Does it Matter? Altcoin Season is a period where altcoins, as a class, significantly outperform Bitcoin. During such times, many altcoins can see massive price increases, often far exceeding Bitcoin’s gains. For investors, identifying and participating in an altcoin season can lead to substantial returns, though it also comes with increased risk. Key characteristics often observed during a potential altcoin season include: Falling Bitcoin Dominance: As discussed, this is a primary indicator. Rising ETH/BTC Ratio: Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency. A rising ratio against Bitcoin suggests ETH is gaining value relative to BTC, often seen as a leading indicator for broader altcoin strength. Increased Trading Volume in Altcoins: More capital is actively trading in altcoin pairs. Positive News and Developments for Specific Altcoins: Project milestones, upgrades, or partnerships can fuel individual altcoin rallies. The prospect of an altcoin season is exciting for those looking for high-growth opportunities beyond Bitcoin. However, it requires careful analysis and risk management. Analyzing the Current Signals: ETH/BTC and the Altcoin Season Index The analysis pointing towards a potential Altcoin Season is supported by more than just the drop in Bitcoin Dominance . The report also highlights the movement of the ETH BTC Ratio . The ETH BTC Ratio tracks the price of Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. A rebound in this ratio from recent lows, coupled with a rise of over 12% in just 24 hours as noted, is a strong signal that Ethereum is gaining ground on Bitcoin. Given Ethereum’s size and influence in the altcoin market, its strength against Bitcoin is often interpreted as capital flowing into the broader altcoin space, starting with the majors like ETH. Furthermore, the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index provides a quantifiable measure. This index compares the performance of the top 50 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index surging from 23 to 36 in a short period indicates that altcoins have collectively started to outperform Bitcoin recently. While an index value between 25 and 75 is considered ‘neutral’ (meaning neither Bitcoin nor altcoins have a clear dominance over the 90-day window), the rapid move upwards suggests momentum is building in favor of altcoins. An index value above 75 is typically considered confirmation of a full-fledged Altcoin Season . These combined signals – falling Bitcoin Dominance , a rising ETH BTC Ratio , and an increasing Altcoin Season Index value – paint a compelling picture of shifting Crypto Market Trends . What Does This Mean for Investing in Altcoins? For investors, the potential arrival of an Altcoin Season presents both opportunities and challenges when considering Investing in Altcoins . Potential Benefits: Higher Potential Returns: Altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, can offer significantly higher percentage gains than Bitcoin during a bull market phase. Diversification: Adding altcoins to a portfolio can provide exposure to different technologies, use cases, and market segments within the crypto ecosystem. Innovation Exposure: Altcoins represent the cutting edge of blockchain technology, from DeFi and NFTs to Layer 2 solutions and Web3 infrastructure. Challenges and Risks: Increased Volatility: Altcoins are generally much more volatile than Bitcoin. Prices can swing wildly in short periods. Higher Risk of Failure: Many altcoin projects do not succeed. Some may be scams or simply fail to gain adoption. Liquidity Issues: Smaller altcoins may have lower trading volumes, making it harder to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. Complexity: Evaluating altcoins requires understanding specific project fundamentals, tokenomics, technology, and competitive landscape, which can be complex. Therefore, approaching Investing in Altcoins during this period requires a strategic mindset. Actionable Insights for Navigating Potential Altcoin Season Given the signals suggesting a potential shift in Crypto Market Trends towards altcoins, what steps can investors take? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Do not invest based solely on hype. Thoroughly research any altcoin project you consider. Understand its whitepaper, team, technology, use case, and community. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: Look for projects with real-world utility, active development, a clear roadmap, and a dedicated community. Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your funds into one or two altcoins, spread your investments across different sectors (e.g., DeFi, Layer 1s, Gaming, AI) and market capitalizations. Start with Larger Caps: If you are new to altcoins, starting with more established ones like Ethereum, Solana, or Cardano might be less risky than jumping straight into micro-cap tokens. Implement Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downside. Stay Informed: Keep track of market news, project updates, and changes in Bitcoin Dominance and the ETH BTC Ratio . Understanding these dynamics is key to successfully navigating the potential opportunities presented by a shifting market landscape and confidently Investing in Altcoins . Is This the Start of a Major Altcoin Season? While the signals discussed – the drop in Bitcoin Dominance , the rebound in the ETH BTC Ratio , and the rise in the Altcoin Season Index – are compelling indicators, it’s important to note that market movements are never guaranteed. The index is still in the ‘neutral’ zone, meaning altcoins haven’t definitively outperformed Bitcoin over the full 90-day period yet, but the recent trend is clear. Several factors could influence whether this momentum continues and evolves into a full-blown Altcoin Season : Overall Market Sentiment: A sudden negative macroeconomic event or regulatory news could impact the entire crypto market, including altcoins. Bitcoin’s Stability: A large, rapid drop in Bitcoin’s price could pull the entire market down, regardless of dominance trends. Capital Inflows: Continued inflow of new capital into the crypto market is generally bullish for both Bitcoin and altcoins. Therefore, while the signs are promising for those interested in Investing in Altcoins , caution and continuous monitoring of Crypto Market Trends are advised. Conclusion: Positioning for Potential Growth The recent decline in Bitcoin Dominance , coupled with the strengthening of the ETH BTC Ratio and the upward trend in the Altcoin Season Index, provides strong analytical support for the possibility of an impending Altcoin Season . This potential shift in Crypto Market Trends signals that capital may be rotating from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies, offering exciting prospects for growth. While the index has not yet reached the threshold confirming a full altcoin season, the current indicators suggest a favorable environment for those considering Investing in Altcoins . However, the inherent volatility and risks associated with altcoins demand a diligent approach, emphasizing thorough research, strategic diversification, and robust risk management. Staying informed about these key market indicators and exercising prudence will be essential for navigating the opportunities that a potential altcoin season could unlock.

Ordinals’ popularity highlights rising demand for non-financial blockchain uses. Removing the OP_Return limit could prevent mining centralization and improve block propagation. The recent ongoing debate over the potential removal of the OP_Return policy limit in Bitcoin Core has raised concerns in the cryptocurrency community. With Bitcoin mining being industrialized, the proposal to eliminate the OP_Return limit has gained some support. On the other hand, others argue that it could lead to unintended consequences. BitMEX Research argues that removing the OP_Return limit can make Bitcoin’s mempool more useful, allowing users to set appropriate Bitcoin transaction fees and enhance the network functionality. OP_Return Policy and Its Impact on Bitcoin’s Mempool The OP_Return output type in Bitcoin Core is intended to hold arbitrary data in Bitcoin’s blockchain.

This move puts the AI-focused coin up by 139% in a fortnight and by 250% in a month, while it also sits on a hugely impressive 1,350% gain in a year. VIRTUAL’s trading volumes have exploded over the past couple of weeks, rising from around $60 million on April 21 to $570 million today. This increase has followed from a recent uptick in whale purchases, while Virtuals’ fundamental position as a decentralized AI platform puts it in a very strong position to grow over the longer term . Is VIRTUAL the Next AI Mega Coin? Looking at VIRTUAL’s chart, it’s encouraging to note that the coin’s 30-day average (orange) has just overtaken the 200-day (blue), forming a golden cross that usually signals a break out. It’s also bullish that VIRTUAL’s relative strength index (purple) is rising back towards 70 after dipping a little over the past couple of days, suggesting that it has firmly entered a growth spurt. Source: TradingView Indeed, VIRTUAL had been struggling for two or three months prior to this week’s lift, meaning that it remains strongly undervalued and has plenty of room left to rise. Also bullish is the fact that transfer data has revealed that whales have been stocking up on VIRTUAL in the past couple of weeks, an indication that smart money expects the coin to continue rising in the near term. And in the longer term, VIRTUAL is arguably one of the most bullish altcoins in the market, given the promise of the Virtuals Protocol as a platform. Its network allows for the creation and deployment of AI agents, which developers can program to perform a variety of functions, spanning commerce and trading. Since its mainnet went live in October 2024, it has grown to encompass over 180,000 owners of AI agents and over 17,000 developers, according to its website . Autonomous businesses are here. ⁰⁰Powered by the Agent Commerce Protocol—an open standard for multi-agent commerce and coordination, leveraging the blockchain.⁰⁰Imagine an autonomous hedge fund business composed of information agents, trading agents, TEE-secured treasury… pic.twitter.com/P9rWqe00FA — Virtuals Protocol (@virtuals_io) February 19, 2025 On the other hand, DappRadar data currently states that Virtuals Protocol has 2,000 unique active wallets , whereas the same figure for Ethereum (for example) is 1.36 million . As such, it still has plenty of work left to do, but with AI remaining the biggest area of tech, it certainly has the potential for big future growth. The VIRTUAL price could therefore reach $2 again by June, while it could reach $5 by the end of the year. This Explosive Presale Token Could Crush the Market After Launch Virtuals Protocol is one of the most exciting new entries in the top 100, but it won’t be the only altcoin performing well over the coming the weeks. Certain newer coins are also likely to outperform the market this summer, including several presale tokens that have generated substantial momentum. Chief amongst them is Solaxy (SOLX), a layer-two network for Solana that has now raised a whopping $33.6 million in its ongoing ICO. HyperSpeed Achieved! 33 Million Raised! pic.twitter.com/HgswKcnnVM — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 3, 2025 This makes it one of the biggest sales of the year, and with over 72,000 followers on X , Solaxy is also one of the most popular unlaunched coins in the market. It owes its popularity to the fact that it’s Solana’s first true layer-two network, and as such it will provide users with very low transactions fees and super fast confirmation times. Additionally, it will also enable instant bridging between itself and Solana, with compatibility with other major chains coming after its launch. Solaxy is aiming to because an important hub for meme token trading, which remains probably the biggest part of the Solana ecosystem. This could help it grow quickly once it launches in the next few weeks, with SOLX attracting huge demand as the only means of paying for its transaction fees. Investors can join the coin’s presale at the Solaxy website , with SOLX available at $0.001718. This price will rise again tomorrow, yet given the size and success of Solaxy’s presale, it could rise much higher once the token launches.

44398335,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159227,1746835228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Bitcoin Institutional Demand: Why Supply Can’t Keep Up in 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-institutional-demand-outpaces/,"Are you watching the crypto markets, wondering what’s really driving the recent movements? While retail interest is always a factor, the big story quietly unfolding is the sheer scale of Bitcoin institutional demand . Forget the headlines about daily price swings for a moment and look at the underlying mechanics: institutions are buying Bitcoin at a pace that far exceeds the rate at which new Bitcoin is entering circulation. This fundamental supply-demand dynamic is setting the stage for potentially significant market shifts, not just now, but looking ahead into 2025. What’s Driving Massive Bitcoin Institutional Demand ? The narrative around Bitcoin has evolved dramatically over the past few years. What was once considered a fringe asset is now firmly on the radar of major financial players. This isn’t just about speculative trading; it’s about large entities – from asset managers running ETFs to publicly traded companies and even sovereign entities – allocating significant capital to Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Their motivations are varied but often include: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential store of value in an era of quantitative easing and rising national debt. Digital Gold: Positioning Bitcoin as a scarce, censorship-resistant alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. Growth Asset: Recognizing the potential for significant appreciation as adoption grows and the network effect strengthens. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional investment portfolios. This growing conviction from sophisticated investors is the engine behind the surging demand we’re witnessing. The Numbers Don’t Lie: Bitcoin Supply vs. Surging Demand The disparity between how much Bitcoin is available and how much institutions want to buy is becoming starkly clear. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan recently highlighted this imbalance, sharing compelling data points: According to his analysis: Year-to-Date Bitcoin Supply: Approximately 58,109 BTC Year-to-Date Institutional Demand (Public Companies, ETFs, Governments): Approximately 227,286 BTC Let that sink in. Demand from these major players alone is roughly four times the amount of new Bitcoin that has been mined and entered circulation so far this year. This doesn’t even account for demand from private funds, high-net-worth individuals, or retail investors. This fundamental imbalance is crucial because, unlike traditional assets where supply can often be increased in response to demand, Bitcoin’s supply is programmatically fixed and predictable. This brings us to the supply side of the equation. Understanding Bitcoin Supply Dynamics Bitcoin’s supply schedule is one of its most defining features. New Bitcoin is introduced into the market through a process called mining. Miners solve complex computational problems to validate transactions and are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin. However, this reward is cut in half approximately every four years in an event known as the ‘halving’. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, reducing the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This event immediately cut the rate at which new Bitcoin enters the market by 50%. Combine this reduced inflow of new supply with the accelerating institutional demand, and you create a powerful squeeze. The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, a scarcity model designed into its protocol from day one. With a significant portion of existing Bitcoin held in long-term storage or considered lost, the amount of Bitcoin actively available on exchanges or for sale is even lower, exacerbating the supply constraint relative to surging demand. How Are Bitcoin ETFs Reshaping the Market? A primary catalyst for the recent surge in Bitcoin institutional demand has been the approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States in January 2024. These investment vehicles provide institutions and traditional investors with a familiar, regulated, and easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, custody, or security. The success of these ETFs has been remarkable. Funds managed by major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others have attracted billions of dollars in inflows within months. These ETFs operate by buying and holding actual Bitcoin to back the shares they issue, directly translating investor demand for ETF shares into buying pressure on the underlying Bitcoin market. The sheer volume of Bitcoin absorbed by these ETFs since their inception is a major component of the 227,286 BTC demand figure cited by Bitwise, illustrating how significant this new access point has become for institutional capital. Why is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Accelerating? Beyond the ease of access provided by ETFs, the increasing maturity of the Bitcoin ecosystem and the growing clarity (in some jurisdictions) around regulation are boosting institutional confidence. More companies are comfortable holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and more fund managers are comfortable allocating client capital to the asset class. Prominent examples of companies leading the charge in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption include: MicroStrategy: A business intelligence firm that has made accumulating Bitcoin a core part of its corporate strategy, holding tens of thousands of BTC. Metaplanet: A Japanese company recently announcing a strategy to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, signaling growing international interest. Mara Holdings (Marathon Digital Holdings): A major Bitcoin mining company that also holds significant amounts of BTC on its balance sheet. These early movers provide a template and validation for other institutions considering similar strategies. As more join, it creates a positive feedback loop, further normalizing and accelerating institutional adoption. What Does This Imbalance Mean for the Bitcoin Price Outlook ? Basic economics tells us that when demand significantly outstrips supply, the price of an asset tends to rise. With the rate of new Bitcoin supply cut in half by the halving and institutional demand continuing to surge, the stage is set for potential upward pressure on the Bitcoin price outlook , especially as we move towards and through 2025. While predicting exact price movements is impossible due to various macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment, the fundamental supply/demand picture painted by institutional inflows is undeniably bullish from a long-term perspective. Institutions are buying for the long haul, reducing the available supply on exchanges and making Bitcoin scarcer for everyone else. This doesn’t mean there won’t be volatility or price corrections. The crypto market is known for its swings. However, the persistent, large-scale buying pressure from institutions provides a strong underlying support structure and suggests significant upside potential if demand continues on its current trajectory. Benefits of Institutional Interest The influx of institutional capital brings several potential benefits to the Bitcoin market: Increased Liquidity: Larger players can add depth to the market. Validation: Institutional adoption lends credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Infrastructure Development: Demand from institutions drives the development of more robust and regulated infrastructure (custody, trading platforms). Reduced Volatility (Potentially): As long-term holders accumulate, it could theoretically reduce the impact of short-term speculative trading, though this is debatable in the short term. Potential Challenges However, institutional involvement isn’t without its potential challenges: Market Manipulation Concerns: Large players can potentially exert significant influence on price. Centralization Risk: Concentration of Bitcoin holdings in a few large entities could raise concerns about centralization. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional activity often attracts greater attention from regulators. Operational Risks: For institutions, managing custody and security of large BTC holdings is complex. Actionable Insights for Readers Given this landscape, what should you take away? Monitor Institutional Flows: Keep an eye on ETF inflow/outflow data and corporate announcements regarding Bitcoin purchases. This provides real-time insight into institutional appetite. Understand the Supply Schedule: Remember the impact of the halving and Bitcoin’s fixed total supply. This scarcity is a core part of its value proposition. Consider the Long Term: Institutional adoption is a long-term trend. While short-term volatility exists, the fundamental picture of increasing demand meeting constrained supply is a powerful driver for the future. Do Your Own Research: Understand the risks and opportunities before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin? The data is compelling: Bitcoin institutional demand is currently far outpacing the rate at which new Bitcoin is being created. Driven by the accessibility of Bitcoin ETFs and the growing conviction in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption as a strategic imperative, major players are absorbing significant amounts of the available Bitcoin supply . This fundamental imbalance, coupled with the post-halving reduction in new supply, creates a powerful dynamic that is likely to influence the Bitcoin price outlook significantly in 2025 and beyond. While challenges remain, the trend of institutions embracing Bitcoin signals a maturation of the asset class and a potential new era where its scarcity is truly tested by unprecedented levels of sustained demand.

Presales are drawing serious buyer interest, legacy networks are adapting to evolving regulation, and high-speed platforms are stepping into the spotlight. Today, performance is being judged not by hype but by actual progress, working testnets, product rollouts, and ecosystems that deliver. That’s why the best long-term cryptos for 2025 are selected based on momentum, technology, and near-future goals. From presale giants like BlockDAG to established networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Litecoin, each of these five assets presents a unique value proposition. Whether you’re focused on speed, staking, smart contracts, or stability, there’s a compelling case to be made. Here’s a closer look at why these projects will lead the way in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: $231.5M Raised & One Week Left for $0.0019 Price Offer BlockDAG is emerging as a headline story in 2025, having already raised over $231.5 million and distributed 19.8 billion BDAG coins. Its $0.0019 price is attracting buyers until May 13. After that, the presale moves into Batch 28 at $0.0262, offering over 2,500% upside compared to earlier stages. With a $0.05 listing planned, buyers are acting fast. But BlockDAG’s strength isn’t just in its entry point. Its beta testnet is already processing 800 TPS, with the mainnet targeting 15,000 TPS. It features built-in DeFi tools, daily Buyer Battles, and a referral bonus program paying out 25%. More than 110,000 wallets have joined in, and centralised exchange listings are confirmed for this year. An active ambassador program offers BDAG and USDT rewards for content creators and community leaders. With a live product, rising adoption, and a coin price under two cents, BlockDAG leads the best long-term cryptos for 2025, not just as a presale, but as a complete ecosystem already in motion. 2. Ethereum: Upcoming Fusaka Fork Could Revive Activity Ethereum remains a key player in the crypto landscape and is preparing for another upgrade in 2025. The anticipated Fusaka fork is expected to raise the gas limit to 150 million, helping to ease network congestion and bring down transaction costs. With ETH currently ranging between $1,749 and $1,855, developers stay focused on scalability and efficiency. Daily active addresses have increased by 22%, reaching 485,000 as of April 27, indicating growing engagement. While Ethereum may not offer the dramatic ROI of newer tokens, it is one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025 due to its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 ecosystems. With the upcoming upgrade, ETH could enter a new phase of broader adoption and technical refinement. 3. Cardano: Rising Volume, Protocol Upgrades, & Regulatory Optimism Cardano is gaining traction in terms of network upgrades and price. ADA recently reached $0.72 after a long consolidation period, with trading volume spiking 46%. It’s also overtaken Dogecoin in market cap, due to consistent developer efforts. The April 25 progress report highlights ledger improvements and roadmap advancement toward future eras. Founder Charles Hoskinson has added momentum by suggesting that U.S. crypto legislation could pass by September, potentially easing regulatory hurdles. This combination of technical updates and a more favourable policy landscape makes Cardano one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025. With stronger fundamentals and a refocused community, ADA shows signs of a major comeback. 4. Solana: Network Stability & DeFi Growth Drive Strength Solana has bounced back to $142, supported by a critical bug fix that strengthened token security. Its network activity is on the rise, with total value locked in DeFi surpassing $4.9 billion. Solana is also moving forward on governance, including a proposal to cut inflation from 4.5% to 0.87%, even though it didn’t reach the vote threshold. The protocol thrives in 2025 with high throughput and a growing ecosystem. Solana is also seeing increasing institutional interest and integration into mainstream apps. For investors searching for scalability and on-chain usage, Solana holds a clear place among the best long-term cryptos for 2025 with continued growth potential ahead. 5. Litecoin: ETF Buzz Sparks Renewed Confidence Litecoin is back in the spotlight, this time due to speculation surrounding a potential ETF approval by the SEC for Canary Funds. A decision is expected around May 5, and if approved, it could push LTC well past $100. Currently trading near $87, Litecoin has already gained nearly 10% in two weeks. Technical patterns, like the Pi Cycle Top, are signalling short-term upside. What gives Litecoin its staying power is its user base. Over 20% of its supply has been held for five years or more, indicating strong long-term conviction. Even without flashy features, its consistency and low transaction costs continue to appeal. If the ETF receives a green light, Litecoin could become one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025, proving that steady fundamentals can still deliver big results. Why BlockDAG Stands Out in 2025 Each of these five projects offers something valuable: proven platforms, growing communities, and clear development plans. But BlockDAG stands out of the best long-term cryptos for 2025 because it brings everything together in one presale: working infrastructure, massive user interest, and a clear roadmap to launch. With over $231.5 million raised, a live beta testnet, 25% referral incentives, and centralised exchange listings confirmed, BlockDAG is already delivering, and it’s still priced at $0.0019 for a few more days. That rare blend of traction and affordability puts it ahead of the rest. The biggest opportunities in 2025 may not come from the giants we already know.

Members of two criminal organizations in Maryland have been charged with participating in a criminal gang, attempted murder, armed carjacking, armed robbery, assault and firearms-related counts, reports WMAR 2 News. Authorities say the groups targeted customers visiting physical bank branches, specifically at Bank of America, Capital One, Wells Fargo and Navy Federal Credit Union. The groups would allegedly follow victims after they used an ATM or emerged from inside the bank – striking them at their homes or businesses. In one especially bold move, the thieves are accused of purposefully crashing into a victim’s car to force a stop, robbing them at gunpoint. From August 2023 to July 2024, prosecutors say the groups robbed 34 victims of over $155,000 across five Maryland counties. At time of publishing, a total of seven people have been indicted.

Would you follow suit and adopt a bold Bitcoin treasury strategy like the one pioneered by Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy? This was a real consideration for Coinbase , as revealed by none other than its CEO, Brian Armstrong. Why Did Coinbase Consider a Bold Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? The idea of holding significant amounts of Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet gained considerable traction, largely thanks to Michael Saylor’s aggressive approach at MicroStrategy. For many, Bitcoin represents a potential hedge against inflation, a store of value in uncertain economic times, and a way to signal confidence in the future of digital assets. Companies adopting this strategy often aim to: Preserve purchasing power of corporate reserves. Potentially benefit from Bitcoin’s price appreciation. Attract investors interested in crypto exposure. Diversify traditional treasury assets (like cash or bonds). Given Coinbase ‘s position at the heart of the crypto ecosystem, exploring such a strategy seemed almost natural. They are deeply familiar with Bitcoin and other crypto assets , understand the market dynamics, and have the infrastructure to manage these holdings. The potential benefits – aligning their balance sheet with the asset they facilitate trading for, potentially boosting returns on treasury holdings – were likely appealing. Understanding the ‘Saylor-Style’ Bitcoin Strategy When we talk about a ‘Saylor-style’ Bitcoin treasury strategy , we are primarily referring to the actions taken by Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy starting in 2020. Their approach was characterized by: 1. Aggressive Accumulation: MicroStrategy didn’t just dip its toes in; it went all-in, making Bitcoin its primary treasury reserve asset. 2. Funding Mechanisms: Saylor famously used various methods to fund these purchases, including issuing convertible senior notes (debt) and selling company stock (equity). This allowed them to acquire far more Bitcoin than their operational cash flow alone would permit. 3. Long-Term Conviction: The strategy is underpinned by a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a digital store of value. This model was revolutionary for publicly traded companies and sparked a conversation about corporate Bitcoin adoption globally. It demonstrated that companies could use traditional financial tools to acquire and hold a non-traditional asset. Why Did Coinbase Pump the Brakes? The Risks Involved Despite the potential upside and the trend of increasing corporate Bitcoin adoption , Coinbase ultimately decided against fully embracing the ‘Saylor-style’ model. Brian Armstrong pointed to significant risks, particularly concerning cash flow and the company’s stability as a still-growing entity. Here’s a breakdown of the potential risks that likely factored into Coinbase’s decision: Cash Flow Sensitivity: As an exchange, Coinbase’s revenue is heavily reliant on trading volume, which can be volatile. Holding a large, illiquid asset like Bitcoin (relative to cash needs) could strain operational liquidity, especially during market downturns or unexpected expenses. Startups and growth companies often prioritize cash on hand for flexibility, payroll, and investments in infrastructure and talent. Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings. A significant drop could lead to substantial impairment losses on the balance sheet under current accounting rules (though this is changing). This could negatively impact earnings, investor perception, and even the company’s ability to raise capital. While MicroStrategy has accepted this volatility, for a financial services company like Coinbase, it could be seen as a greater systemic risk. Regulatory Scrutiny: Holding large amounts of crypto assets , especially Bitcoin, could attract increased attention from regulators, potentially complicating compliance efforts and future business expansions. Potential Conflict of Interest: Coinbase’s core business is serving its customers who trade crypto. Holding a massive corporate stash of the same assets could, in theory, create perceived conflicts or raise questions about market influence, even if unfounded. CFO Alesia Haas’s comment about not competing with customers highlights this consideration. Funding Risks: While MicroStrategy used debt and equity, these methods come with their own risks – interest payments on debt, potential dilution from equity sales, and the risk of margin calls if Bitcoin was used as collateral (though MicroStrategy has managed this carefully). For Coinbase, adding significant debt or equity solely for Bitcoin purchases might not align with their growth strategy or risk appetite. Armstrong’s statement underscores that while the potential rewards of a large Bitcoin treasury might be high, the risks, particularly to a company’s fundamental operational health and cash flow, were deemed too significant for Coinbase at this stage. Coinbase’s Actual Approach to Crypto Assets Rejecting the aggressive ‘Saylor-style’ model doesn’t mean Coinbase avoids holding crypto assets altogether. Far from it. The company maintains a significant portfolio, but its strategy appears more measured and aligned with its core business operations and strategic investments rather than purely a treasury reserve play funded by external capital. In Q1, Coinbase invested $153 million in crypto, primarily Bitcoin. This demonstrates a continued commitment to holding digital assets. As of their reports, Coinbase holds approximately $1.3 billion in digital assets on its balance sheet. This figure represents a substantial holding, but it is acquired differently and serves a potentially different purpose than MicroStrategy’s vast accumulation. CFO Alesia Haas has clarified that their approach is about growing their crypto portfolio strategically without creating a situation where they are seen as competing directly with their users’ trading activities. This suggests their holdings might be related to operational needs, investment activities, or simply holding some reserves in the assets they facilitate trading for, but not pursuing a strategy of leveraging up specifically to buy as much Bitcoin as possible for the treasury alone. Is Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Still a Growing Trend? Yes, the trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption continues, although perhaps not always with the same intensity or funding methods as MicroStrategy. The Bloomberg report mentioned indicates that more firms are indeed looking at ways to incorporate Bitcoin into their strategies, sometimes using stock and debt, emulating aspects of Saylor’s model. While not every company will or should replicate MicroStrategy’s strategy due to varying business models, risk tolerances, and regulatory environments, the conversation around holding Bitcoin and other crypto assets on corporate balance sheets is now firmly established. Companies are exploring different models, from holding a small percentage of cash reserves in Bitcoin to more significant, but perhaps less leveraged, investments than MicroStrategy’s. The key takeaway here is that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to Bitcoin treasury strategy . What makes sense for a software analytics firm like MicroStrategy with a specific capital structure and investment philosophy may not be suitable for a regulated financial exchange like Coinbase with different operational demands and stakeholder expectations. Comparing Approaches: Coinbase vs. MicroStrategy Let’s quickly look at the fundamental differences in their approaches: Feature MicroStrategy (Saylor Style) Coinbase Primary Goal Make BTC primary treasury asset, hedge against inflation, long-term value store. Hold strategic crypto assets, support ecosystem, operational needs (?), potential investment. Funding Method Significant use of debt and equity financing specifically for BTC purchases. Primarily operational cash flow and existing reserves. Scale of BTC Holding Very large relative to market cap and operational cash flow. Significant, but likely more modest relative to market cap and primarily funded internally. Risk Tolerance High tolerance for volatility and debt risks for BTC exposure. Lower tolerance for risks impacting cash flow and operational stability. Customer Relation No direct customer trading platform for crypto. Core business is facilitating customer trading; avoids perceived competition. This comparison highlights why the same strategy doesn’t fit every company, even within the crypto-adjacent space. Michael Saylor ‘s vision for MicroStrategy is distinct from Coinbase ‘s operational realities and regulatory landscape. What Are the Actionable Insights? For investors and market observers, Coinbase ‘s decision offers several insights: Risk Management is Paramount: Even companies deeply involved in crypto prioritize financial stability and cash flow, especially during growth phases. The ‘Saylor-style’ strategy isn’t universally applicable. Business Model Matters: A company’s core operations heavily influence its suitability for aggressive treasury strategies. An exchange has different liquidity needs and regulatory considerations than a software company. Corporate Adoption is Evolving: While MicroStrategy was a pioneer, future corporate Bitcoin adoption may take more varied and perhaps less leveraged forms, tailored to individual company needs and risk profiles. Transparency is Key: Coinbase’s openness about considering and rejecting the strategy provides valuable transparency into corporate decision-making in the crypto space. Conclusion: Different Paths in Corporate Crypto Adoption The revelation that Coinbase considered but ultimately rejected a ‘Saylor-style’ Bitcoin treasury strategy due to concerns about cash flow risk and stability is a significant one. It underscores that while the idea of holding crypto assets on a corporate balance sheet is gaining traction, the execution depends heavily on a company’s specific circumstances, risk appetite, and business model. Michael Saylor ‘s bold approach at MicroStrategy paved the way and demonstrated a potential model, but Coinbase ‘s more cautious stance highlights the crucial importance of liquidity, operational stability, and regulatory considerations for companies operating in the dynamic crypto landscape. The trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is undoubtedly growing, but it’s clear that companies are finding their own unique paths, balancing potential rewards with very real financial and operational risks.

This move places BTC deep into range-highs territory, with the next major challenge now clearly in sight: the all-time high at $109,000. The market’s strength comes on the back of strong technical performance and increasingly optimistic sentiment, as BTC continues to lead the crypto rally and altcoins follow suit. Related Reading: Cardano Approaches Critical Resistance – Break Above Could Trigger Move To $0.80 On-chain data from CryptoQuant adds further weight to the bullish narrative. One standout metric highlights the growing confidence among large holders: the absolute difference between the Realized Price of new whales and old whales now stands at $59.7K. Specifically, new whales have entered the market at an average price of $91.9K, while old whales’ basis remains at $32.2K. This translates to a 185% relative spread to the long-term holder (LTH) basis—a massive divergence. This wide gap signals that a new wave of high-conviction buyers is entering the market at significantly elevated prices. Unlike the cautious whale accumulation during previous cycle lows, this phase reflects strong belief in continued upside, even at premium levels. It’s a clear sign that institutional FOMO may be kicking in. Bitcoin Faces Resistance At $104K As Whale Activity Signals Growing FOMO Bitcoin is currently encountering resistance around the $104,000 mark—a level that may take time to break as it represents a critical barrier before entering price discovery above the all-time high near $109,000. The recent rally has shown remarkable strength, but as BTC consolidates just below its ATH, some selling pressure is expected. A successful breakout could lead to a swift surge beyond $109K; however, failure to do so may result in short-term consolidation or retracement. Top analyst Axel Adler shared key on-chain insights on X that highlight the evolving psychology of Bitcoin’s largest holders. According to Adler, the absolute difference between the Realized Price of new whales ($91.9K) and old whales ($32.2K) is $59.7K, representing a 185% relative spread to the long-term holder (LTH) basis. This sharp divergence reveals that new “whales” are entering the market at nearly three times the price of early entrants. In comparison, the same spread in November 2022 was only 62%, indicating more cautious accumulation near the market bottom. The current surge to 185% reflects rising confidence and FOMO, with large buyers willing to accumulate even at elevated prices. For context, during the 2021 cycle peak at $63K, the spread widened to 437%. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Extremely Undervalued Against BTC’ – Supply Pressure May Delay Recovery This trend suggests that the market is entering a more aggressive accumulation phase, where belief in higher prices is driving demand despite the premium. If bulls manage to absorb the resistance around $104K, it could mark the start of a parabolic move—fueled not just by momentum, but by conviction from both retail and institutional players betting on a new Bitcoin all-time high. BTC Price Analysis: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading around $103,000 after reaching a high of $104,300 earlier today. The 4-hour chart shows BTC facing resistance at the $103,600 level, which aligns with a key supply zone from late December 2024 and early January 2025. This area acted as a previous rejection point during the last major rally and is now being tested again as potential resistance. BTC’s recent surge from the $87K–$90K consolidation zone has been aggressive, breaking above both the 200 EMA and 200 SMA (currently at $91,806 and $89,400, respectively) with strong volume. This confirms bullish strength and trend continuation, suggesting that buyers are still in control. However, the current range between $103K and $104K is historically significant, and bulls may need to absorb selling pressure before attempting a move toward the all-time high near $109K.

Market structure remains bullish overall, but this resistance zone will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin enters price discovery or pauses for accumulation.

The company said it wanted to discuss how staking should be treated, including the possibility of allowing exchange-traded products (ETPs) to offer staking features. The company noted that while Ether ETFs have been successful, they are incomplete without the ability to stake. BlackRock’s current Ether ETF filing does not describe staking. However, the firm also believes that Ethereum ETFs are missing out on the full value without staking. During the meeting, the asset manager said it wants to offer Ether ETFs that can engage in staking so investors can earn additional yield. Other leading crypto ETF players, such as Grayscale and some regulators, agree. Grayscale also filed for rule changes to bring staking to its Ether ETF. In April, the SEC postponed its decision on Grayscale’s proposal. That demonstrates how carefully the regulator is tiptoeing into staking features. Even then, if the SEC permits staking in Ether ETFs, it could pave the way for similar ETFs based on other cryptocurrencies that also use proof-of-stake, such as Solana or Cardano. BlackRock explores blockchain tokenization of traditional assets In addition to staking, BlackRock spoke about tokenizing products from the traditional world of finance — such as bonds, real estate, or other assets. This entails converting assets such as bonds or stocks to blockchain-based tokens. Tokenization is a hot topic in finance. It has several advantages, like shorter settlement times, lower fees, and the ability to trade around the clock (unlike traditional markets, which close on weekends and holidays). The asset manager already dominates this field with its digital fund “BUIDL.” This fund is known as a tokenized or STO (security token offering) fund comprising U.S. Treasury assets. The Ethereum blockchain powers it and holds about $2.9 billion in digital currency. That makes it the largest fund of its kind anywhere. Franklin Templeton also operates in this ecosystem, launching its “BENJI” tokenized fund. The two firms are among the early movers in a market that could transform securities trading. Brokerage firm Robinhood is said to be developing its blockchain. The plan is to allow individual European investors to trade U.S. shares in tokenized form. If successful, it could upend traditional financial firms and inject more transparency and speed into trading. BlackRock–SEC talks signal rising institutional interest This is the second time BlackRock has gone to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force this year. The inaugural session was held on April 1 and focused on the firm’s proposed Ethereum ETF. These ongoing discussions hint at growing interest from big finance for crypto-linked products. They also indicate that the SEC is receptive to hearing from the public but cautious. Only a handful of spot Bitcoin ETFs have been approved by the SEC, with the first one from BlackRock in January 2025. That’s one of the most important things ever. But the chatter is now around Ethereum. What are Ethereum’s new ETFs likely to include? The SEC has not yet decided whether it should let staking happen. But when such calls are coming from the likes of BlackRock and investor demand has been increasing for more inventive strategies, a decision may not be far off. A decision favoring the ETFs could set off a burst of new ones, offering investors more opportunities to profit from digital coins — and further eroding the wall between mainstream finance and blockchain tech.

Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of those tokens — quietly positioning itself to break out, with some analysts projecting that it could hit $1 much sooner than expected. Still priced at just $0.025 during its presale, MUTM has started gaining traction among long-term investors looking for practical utilities and sustainable token models. With over $7.75 million already raised and the fourth presale phase more than 65% complete, the token’s early momentum is building — and the current price level won’t be available for long. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Let’s look at a simple example. An investor who enters Mutuum’s presale with $2,200 today would be securing a position at one of the lowest price points before listings begin. When MUTM reaches $1, that investment would become $88,000 — a transformation that’s not based on hype, but on well-defined mechanics and a growing foundation of functionality. For those exploring what crypto to invest in right now, these are the kinds of entry points that rarely last once exchange visibility kicks in. One of the strongest features of Mutuum Finance is how it structures lending. Instead of offering a single route, the protocol supports both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. In the P2C system, users deposit their assets into a shared liquidity pool, which is then made available to borrowers who provide overcollateralized positions. Interest rates adjust dynamically depending on how much of the pool is in use, ensuring a balance between supply and demand. The P2P model gives users full control by allowing them to negotiate terms directly with one another. This model is particularly useful for lending out speculative tokens like meme coins — such as DOGE or PEPE — which may not be supported in the shared pool. The flexibility of the two-tiered system opens up the platform to a wide range of strategies, appealing to both conservative lenders and high-risk borrowers. Another major development is Mutuum’s ongoing work toward Layer 2 compatibility. This isn’t just a technical upgrade — it’s a move that directly supports scalability and cost-efficiency. With Layer 2 support, users will be able to interact with the platform at faster speeds and lower gas fees, without sacrificing security or decentralization. This kind of foresight is one of the reasons some are labeling MUTM as a top crypto to buy before it breaks out, especially as network congestion and cost remain persistent challenges in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance has also made security a priority. All smart contracts are currently undergoing a full audit by CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms in the industry. This step not only protects early users but also signals that the team is focused on transparency and long-term trust — two factors that play a major role in serious crypto investment decisions. The token is still in its early presale stage, priced well below its confirmed launch rate of $0.06. Once the fifth phase begins, the price will increase to $0.03, trimming down the potential upside for those who waited. That small difference today could become a much larger gap in returns if the token reaches higher milestones — especially the $1 mark that many believe is within reach given the project’s utility-first approach. Mutuum Finance isn’t trying to replicate the hype-driven paths of other tokens. Instead, it’s focused on building infrastructure that solves real problems in decentralized finance — while aligning token value with actual platform usage. Between its two lending models, upcoming Layer 2 capabilities, and verified smart contract audit, the groundwork for long-term success is already being laid. For those asking which cryptocurrency is the best cheap crypto to buy now, MUTM is starting to look like one of the most promising bets. The price is still under 3 cents — but based on its roadmap, growing adoption, and token-linked revenue model, that likely won’t be the case for much longer.

Arbitrum’s focus on Layer-2 rollups and reward programs helped it move near $1.10 during Q1 2025. At the same time, Stacks gained from Bitcoin’s strong showing, rising from $0.69 to $1.12 by adding smart contract features to BTC’s base. While both projects highlight solid development, Web3Bay is gaining interest for a different reason. Its low entry point and multi-stage presale are showing how timing can lead to stronger gains. Now in Stage 5, the project’s structured rollout is rewarding those who act early. Why Web3Bay’s Early-Stage Entry Could Make a Big Difference Web3Bay’s crypto presale is now in Stage 5 of 28, with more than 420 million tokens sold and nearly $2 million raised. The current price is $0.00524, but each new stage brings a higher price. That means early buyers are securing more tokens for less before the next increase. This kind of pricing model supports those who think ahead. It gives a clear benefit to early buyers, helping them build larger holdings while keeping costs low. It’s not about chasing the market, it’s about acting before the shift. The 3BAY token isn’t just built for price growth. It supports a decentralized e-commerce platform, giving holders access to payment perks, staking rewards, and voting power. These real uses support token demand over time. With early-stage pricing still open and clear value built into the project, Web3Bay is gaining attention from people looking for working ideas in crypto. Acting in Stage 5 could be the last low-cost chance before the price begins to climb faster. Arbitrum Shows Steady Growth as Ethereum’s Key Layer-2 Partner Arbitrum has slowly but firmly built its name as a major Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, improving speed and lowering costs through its optimistic rollup system. Since launch, the project has focused on growing its ecosystem, bringing in developers and users through strong performance and early rewards. A big part of this growth came from major airdrop events and incentive campaigns that helped boost user activity and strengthen the network’s community. In Q1 2025, ARB saw stronger price movement, trading between $1.05 and $1.10 by late April, as confidence rose from both everyday users and larger investors. The network has also built deeper ties with leading dApps and DeFi projects, which has helped it remain relevant in the expanding Ethereum space. As a result, with more transactions and active developers, Arbitrum continues to grow as part of Ethereum’s scaling effort. Its system of rewards and tools is showing it can support lasting growth and loyalty in the long run. Stacks Builds on Bitcoin’s Strength in Early 2025 At the same time, Stacks has developed a strong position by bringing smart contracts and apps to Bitcoin in a way that keeps its original design untouched. Its goal of adding new features while using Bitcoin’s security has drawn developers looking for both trust and flexibility. Stacks has moved forward with steady upgrades, focusing more on long-term progress than short-term buzz. Early investors saw real results as STX kept building, helped by the launch of Clarity contracts and the arrival of stacking rewards. In Q1 2025, STX traded between $0.69 and $1.12, lifted by more usage in Bitcoin-based apps and rising interest in projects connected to Bitcoin. As Bitcoin regained attention, Stacks gained as well from interest in making BTC more usable. The continued growth of developer support and grant programs has helped its wider network expand. As more users explore DeFi tools built on Bitcoin, Stacks could become one of the most practical platforms for turning Bitcoin into more than just a store of value. Web3Bay Offers a Clear Path for Early Participation While Arbitrum and Stacks show how long-term progress in infrastructure can grow slowly over time, Web3Bay presents a simpler route for those looking to join early. Its tiered pricing setup supports those who take action before rising interest leads to higher entry costs. With almost $2 million raised and more than 420 million tokens sold, the Stage 5 price is set at $0.00524, creating a clear benefit for early backers. Unlike other projects still building their full use case, Web3Bay already gives buyers a working idea and a chance to shape its future. For investors who want to join before wider attention arrives, Web3Bay offers that opening right now.

While the Hedera (HBAR) price hangs near a critical $0.15 level and Tron (TRX) activity shows signs of cooling despite heavy USDT flow, BlockDAG (BDAG) is heading in a different direction. Instead of waiting for momentum, it just passed a major milestone, a full CertiK audit, and that could make all the difference in 2025. Now that its smart contracts and protocol have been officially verified, BlockDAG is showing it’s built for security and scale. Its $0.0019 presale price, which ends May 13, is still available, giving new buyers a chance to enter early. For anyone looking at which crypto will explode this year, BlockDAG’s progress is worth noting. BlockDAG Gets Certified for Security: Door Still Open For Buyers1 BlockDAG just earned a major credibility boost after completing a full audit by CertiK, putting it among the few projects with verified security before launch. CertiK reviewed the project’s main smart contracts and signed off after passing all tests. The team didn’t stop there, they added a 2-of-3 multisig wallet and a 24-hour timelock to add more protection. While many projects fix bugs after launch, BlockDAG is doing things differently by locking in security from the beginning. But it’s not only about safety. BlockDAG runs on a hybrid Proof-of-Work and DAG system, which offers both energy efficiency and speed. The beta testnet already clocks over 800 TPS and allows for parallel block confirmations. That makes it scalable too. More than 1 million users are already mining with the X1 app, signaling growing interest and network use. The crypto presale is still live, with BDAG priced at $0.0019 until May 13. It’s currently in Batch 28. So far, over $231.5 million has been raised, and more than 19.8 billion BDAGs have been sold. The launch price is set at $0.05, offering early buyers a potential 2,531% return. You can buy BDAG using ETH, BTC, USDT, BNB, SHIB, DOGE, XRP, ADA, and several other popular cryptos. If you’re asking which crypto will explode, BlockDAG checks every box: strong tech, growing adoption, verified security, and serious upside. With CertiK’s stamp of approval, it just became an even stronger contender. This could be the right moment to take a closer look before exchanges get involved. Can Hedera (HBAR) Price Hold the $0.15 Line? The Hedera (HBAR) price is hovering near $0.1503 after sliding down from $0.19. Sellers have had the upper hand lately, with a pattern of lower highs and lower lows forming a bearish trend. HBAR attempted to bounce from $0.175 but couldn’t push past the $0.185 resistance. If the current level breaks, the next major support is around $0.1276. Trading volume has remained low, which only adds to the downward pressure. On the 4-hour chart, a bearish flag breakdown suggests more downside could be ahead. Earlier this year, HBAR touched $0.40, but the rally didn’t last. If bulls can’t move it back above $0.2007, it may continue to struggle. Without a pickup in buying volume, traders could start focusing on other assets that show better recovery signals. Is Tron (TRX) Activity Slowing or Building for a Breakout? Tron (TRX) activity has cooled a bit on-chain, yet the price has held up well. TRX is trading near $0.2495, with a 2.6% gain over the last two weeks, even as overall market momentum dips. On-chain data shows fewer new wallet addresses and a drop in gas use, usually signs of declining user activity. But analysts think this might be a classic buildup phase rather than weakness. Historically, slow periods like this have often preceded sharp price moves. There’s one bright spot, USDT supply on Tron just hit a record high of over $71 billion, second only to Ethereum. This shows that Tron (TRX) activity remains strong when it comes to stablecoin transfers, even if other metrics are soft. Tron’s low fees and high liquidity continue to attract DeFi users. If this pattern holds, TRX might be gathering strength under the radar and setting up for its next price surge. What to Watch Next? Tron (TRX) activity is down in some areas, but USDT usage suggests hidden strength. At the same time, the Hedera (HBAR) price is struggling to hold key support at $0.1503 and could dip lower without stronger buyer action. Both are at make-or-break moments. TRX might be preparing for a breakout, while HBAR could slip further if support fails. But if you’re wondering which crypto will explode , BlockDAG is making a clear case. It just passed CertiK’s full audit, confirming its smart contracts and protocol are built right. Its hybrid model, no-code tools, and focus on privacy are all points in its favor. With a presale price of $0.0019 available until May 13 and $231.5 million already raised, the numbers speak for themselves. The listing price is locked in at $0.05, meaning serious upside potential.

XRP gained over 8% even after news of a serious JavaScript library flaw. At the same time, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) surged 32% before hitting strong resistance. While traders analyze the future paths of these assets, a new name is quietly gaining momentum: Dragoin. Currently priced at $0.0000386, Dragoin ($DDGN) isn’t relying on hype. It offers a live beta game, contract audits, and a design prioritizes privacy. While many projects are still promising future products, Dragoin is delivering now. With its functional game and built-in user protections, it’s becoming one of the top crypto coins, drawing real attention. XRP Holds Up Despite XRPL Code Breach XRP rose 8.14% over the past day and 9.66% this week, trading near $2.27, even after a serious flaw surfaced in one of its main developer tools. A backdoor in the XRPL JavaScript library, found on NPM, exposed users to wallet key theft. This did not affect XRP’s core protocol but raised concerns across developer communities. Despite this, XRP’s price pushed past its usual $2.00–$2.14 range, lifted by Bitcoin’s broader market rally. Analysts say strong overall demand helped soften the impact of the news. Even so, security experts are urging developers to check their tools to prevent supply chain risks manually. XRP’s strength shows trust remains for now, but platform teams must improve transparency and safety to keep that confidence going forward. PENGU Hits Resistance After Sharp 32% Climb Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) jumped 32% in just one day, breaking out of a long-term triangle and hitting $0.0068, its best price since March. A bullish daily candle helped confirm the move, but the rally slowed at $0.0070, a level it had reversed before. Market tools like Weighted Sentiment jumped to 1.05, hinting at overheated vibes. RSI touched 65.39, signaling that buying pressure is building but not yet overextended. Chart watchers now see $0.0070 as a key level. If it breaks with substantial volume, another leg higher could follow. But if it fails, the price could return to $0.0060 or even $0.0054. PENGU remains volatile, but its fast rise has put it under the spotlight as one of this week’s top crypto coins. Dragoin: Real Product, Audited Contracts, and 6,700% ROI Potential Dragoin is stepping up with fundamental tools and a working product, something rare for presale projects. At just $0.0000386, it’s attracting early traction, thanks to a Telegram-based Tap-to-Earn game that’s already live and being used. Unlike many presales relying on roadmaps and future hopes, Dragoin is fully functional. Its strong user base is no accident. The design focuses on user privacy from the start. There is no IP logging, third-party scripts, or behavior tracking, just a clean, secure experience. For a crypto platform, this stands out. Dragoin’s structure favors user control and safety. Back-end security is also solid. Smart contracts have already passed audits, providing transparency on how the system works, which helps remove uncertainty for users. The presale entry of $0.0000386 comes with a planned launch price of $0.002, which opens a path to a potential 6,700% ROI. Dragoin isn’t just about future vision; it’s about the value users can unlock today. With privacy-focused tech, working gameplay, and a strong foundation, Dragoin is quickly being seen as one of the top crypto coins to watch. At a time when many projects overpromise, Dragoin is showing results. That’s what makes it different and why it’s gaining momentum now. Final Overview XRP’s ability to grow despite a major code flaw shows how demand can often outweigh concerns, at least in the short term. Long-term strength will still depend on improved system checks and open communication. PENGU’s breakout confirms meme coin energy remains strong, but its next move depends on whether it clears $0.0070 with power. In contrast, Dragoin offers clarity. With a price of $0.0000386, a real game already live, and security measures built in, it’s delivering what others delay. For those exploring top crypto coins with real functionality, Dragoin offers a working platform, not just hype.

However, the company ultimately decided against going all-in on Bitcoin, citing concerns over the risks to its startup status and financial stability . Coinbase chose risk management over Saylor-style Bitcoin gamble On a Friday video discussion on the X social network, Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase , looked back at his company’s decision-making. He admitted that at various times over the last 12 years, the thought of putting 80% of their balance sheet into crypto — especially Bitcoin — was interesting. But as tempting as it was to get in on the action, Coinbase didn’t want to take such a danger-fraught route. Armstrong said the move was calculated by assessing risks. He noted that going all in on Bitcoin would have risked the financial solvency of a startup and possibly “killed” the company. It was a reasoned decision arising from how to manage risk well. While Coinbase declined to take the Bitcoin bet Saylor’s company made, it still sits on a sizable crypto portfolio. However, according to its latest shareholder letter, the company purchased $153 million in cryptocurrency, mostly Bitcoin, in the first quarter of 2025. Its investment portfolio is now worth $1.3 billion in crypto assets. Alesia Haas, Coinbase’s chief financial officer, who also appeared at the X discussion, emphasized the company’s conservative stance. She said the company did not want to be seen as in competition with its crypto investor customers. Haas also said the firm will grow its crypto holdings. Companies follow Saylor’s lead, emulating his Bitcoin strategy Meanwhile, other companies have tried replicating Saylor’s model of funding Bitcoin purchases by issuing stock and debt. Since Strategy’s Bitcoin buying spree began in 2020, its shares have surged more than 3,000%, bolstered by the rising value of the cryptocurrency. Strategy currently holds approximately $54 billion in Bitcoin. Several other companies and new entities are now following Saylor’s approach to give investors different ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Among them are firms such as Twenty-One Capital Inc., which Cantor Fitzgerald LP, Tether Holdings SA, and SoftBank Group back. Meanwhile, a subsidiary of Strive Enterprises, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, is merging with Asset Entities Inc. to form a Bitcoin treasury company. In other news, Next Technology Holding Inc. shares soared more than 600% on Friday after the Beijing-based software company announced that it had substantially upped its Bitcoin holdings from 833 BTC to 5,833 BTC, causing volatility halts in the stock. Coinbase launches 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum futures trading for US Investors On Friday, Coinbase Derivatives officially activated 24/7 trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, becoming the first CFTC-regulated derivatives exchange to offer around-the-clock access to crypto futures contracts in the US. Coinbase first revealed the initiative in March, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional US trading hours and the global crypto market, which makes up over 75% of worldwide trading volume. The exchange will provide both nano and large-sized contracts. Coinbase’s latest offering lets U.S. investors trade, hedge, and manage exposure around the clock, matching the nonstop nature of crypto markets. The exchange has built its infrastructure to support this new setup, with all trades cleared through Nodal Clear, a CFTC-regulated clearinghouse that operates 24/7. Major firms like Virtu Financial help provide liquidity. While Coinbase has remained cautious about fully adopting a Bitcoin-centric strategy, the surging interest in crypto-based corporate treasuries underscores the growing allure of Bitcoin as a store of value in the corporate world.

Hyperliquid began its life as a focused, app-specific chain but has gradually transformed into something much more complex and interesting—a dynamic ecosystem that now attracts large crypto investors (or “whales”), active traders, and growing interest from institutional players. Hyperliquid Surpasses $1 Billion in TVL @HyperliquidX continues to strengthen its presence in the crypto market, recently surpassing the significant milestone of $1 billion in Total Value Locked. What began as an app-specific chain is now steadily evolving into a more robust and… pic.twitter.com/xw3h4FHGZ8 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 8, 2025 This accomplishment signifies a key turning point for Hyperliquid as it establishes itself as a high-performance decentralized exchange meant especially for trading perpetual futures. The $1 billion TVL threshold not only reflects user confidence in Hyperliquid but also highlights its emergence as a serious player in the Layer 2 and DeFi derivatives spaces. High Stakes: Whale Doubles Down on HYPE Short Position Amid Mounting Losses While celebrating Hyperliquid’s swift expansion, a high-stakes drama unfolds on the platform’s trading floors. A leading whale trader has positioned a colossal leveraged short against HYPE—Hyperliquid’s native ecosystem token—even as the market has shifted against him. A whale just deposited another $1.8M $USDC into #Hyperliquid , doubling down on a losing $HYPE short. In the past week, this whale has funneled $10.36M into a 5x leveraged position—now worth $29.1M—with a $1.24M unrealized loss and liquidation looming at $25.01. Will the whale… pic.twitter.com/MmLxDvCqGw — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) May 7, 2025 As per on-chain information, this whale has put in another $1.8 million of USDC into Hyperliquid in the last 24 hours, intensifying what looks like a seriously bearish stance on HYPE. This new capital is being used to bolster a very significant short position that is currently being opened with 5x leverage. Overall, the trader has now channeled $10.36 million into this one position over the last week. That leveraged bet has since swelled to $29.1 million, even as the trade heads into the red. At present, the whale is looking at an unrealized loss of approximately $1.24 million and a liquidation price that is gushing blood at $25.01. This action has attracted much focus from the Hyperliquid community and wider crypto trading spheres. Although high-leverage positions are standard fare in the perpetual futures market, the scale and timing of this specific trade—executed at a time when the platform was enjoying growth and positive momentum—has prompted a number of onlookers to scrutinize what the whale is really up to. Should the price of HYPE keep climbing and get close to the liquidation limit, it might set off a chain reaction of liquidations, and we’re not just saying that because it sounds good. We mean it. Why? Because it’s a huge position we’re talking about. Conversely, if sentiment shifts and the token’s price falls, the whale stands to make a ridiculous amount of money. If that happens, it could turn out that this THAAD (that’s right, we said it) in HYPE is a contrarian profit play. Hyperliquid’s Growing Role in the DeFi Landscape The drama’s broader backdrop is Hyperliquid’s rapid ascension in the DeFi rankings. It has managed to build a nimble and efficient on-chain environment for advanced derivatives traders. Very few newer trading platforms can make this claim. In fact, most seem to trip into the same pitfalls of user bottlenecks, unstable UX, and liquidity fragmentation that have victimized DeFi trading platform projects since mid-2020. Achieving $1 billion in TVL does not happen by accident. It requires a reliable platform that users can trust, and that is exactly what Hyperliquid has become. The platform is now attracting very sophisticated users, like hedge funds, who appreciate its speed, interface, and other configurable features. To hedge fund types, $1 billion matters because it signifies a whole lot more than just another round number in the DeFi space. Hyperliquid’s application-specific chain allows Hyperliquid to optimize for performance in ways that general-purpose blockchains just can’t. We started out with a pretty narrow focus on perpetual futures, and while we still do that—and do it really well—we’ve begun to expand into an ecosystem that is integrating stablecoin liquidity, yield-bearing instruments, and all the tokenized incentives you could want for both traders and liquidity providers. Hyperliquid is quickly becoming one of the most observed platforms in DeFi, with a rising total value locked, increasing daily trading volumes, and intensifying interest from both analysts and deep-pocketed investors. The platform’s next growth phase is upon it, and its bold whale trade is the current focus of attention. Is this oh-so-grainy picture of the CEX taking shape under platform-wide bull conditions—wherein we’re on the cusp of a brave new world for digital trading—actually a grainy picture of an expensive prescient move in a whale world for a CEX under platform-wide bullish conditions? One thing is for sure—Hyperliquid’s story is no longer just about protocol growth. It’s now about the high-risk, high-reward ecosystem it’s enabling in real time.

Fentanyl overdoses take the lives of dozens of thousands of people in the U.S. and Canada annually. China is a key player in the North American fentanyl market. According to unnamed sources cited by The Wall Street Journal, China may propose cooperation on the fentanyl crisis as an “off-ramp from hostilities” to foster dialogue with the Trum administration. Potentially, China has a resource to tackle the North American fentanyl problem as its role in this crisis and market is essential. Reportedly, Chinese chemical companies export fentanyl precursors and provide consultations to Americans wishing to synthesize the drug on online forums. China may hope for dialogue as the role of fentanyl was explicitly cited by Donald Trump when he motivated imposing the harshest tariffs on China, the only country not granted a 90-day tariff pause. The dialogue between China and the U.S. is not impossible, as recently Trump himself said, “it’s a natural thing to ask,” referring to asking China to assist in solving the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. REPORTER: Will you be asking China to help you close the gap between Ukraine and Russia? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think so. If we can get the fighting stopped that would be a great accomplishment. We're trying very hard and I think we're close. pic.twitter.com/U5G0xwIhHu — Bannon’s WarRoom (@Bannons_WarRoom) May 8, 2025 Fentanyl crisis statistics Terms like “fentanyl crisis” and “fentanyl epidemic” are no exaggeration. The word “tragedy” also fits. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid used medically as an anesthetic but far more potent than heroin or morphine. In the 2010s, recreational use of fentanyl exploded in North America, resulting in hundreds of overdose deaths daily. At the peak in 2022, the fatal overdoses on synthetic opioids (mostly fentanyl) reached nearly 80,000 in the U.S. alone. In Canada, with its 5x lower population, the numbers are not as high as in the U.S. For instance, 2023 was marked with around 6,000 deaths related to fentanyl. However, if we look at the deaths per 100,000 of the population, we’ll see that Canada is close to the U.S. Most of the victims of overdose are men under 45 years old, but the number of elders among fentanyl casualties is on the rise . The crisis affected both men and women of all ages, including preschoolers. These numbers may seem too huge to realize the scale of the tragedy. To get a more vivid and striking idea of this epidemic’s deadliness, we may think that at the peak, it was killing one person per hour in Canada and one person every seven minutes in the U.S. Although after 2022 both the U.S. and Canada saw a drop in fentanyl deadly overdoses, the epidemic scale is still damning. Council on Foreign Relations notes that the 2022 fentanyl death count is 10x bigger than the total casualties of the U.S. army in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. Comparisons to wars don’t look misplaced. The death toll in the fentanyl crisis is in line with the number of deaths in the most dismaying military conflicts of the 2020s: in Sudan , Gaza, Yemen, and Ukraine. Somehow, North America reached the point at which it has war-scale casualties, while it doesn’t participate in a war. Except for the U.S. trade war. Two countries subjected to the harshest tariffs are the key players in the fentanyl trade in America: China and Mexico. Another country that faced high tariffs is Canada. Fentanyl from Canadian Valerian Labs was a part of the problem too. Read more: U.S. DOJ indicts eight Chinese firms for using crypto in fentanyl trade Fentanyl trade: China, Mexico, and cryptocurrency In 2022, the Drug Enforcement Agency called China the prime source of fentanyl killing Americans. The drug is sent to North America from China by mail or through Mexico. Two years later, a Congressional committee claimed that China is subsidizing the production of fentanyl precursors that then turn into illicit drugs in North America. The report reads: “The PRC (People’s Republic of China) scheduled all fentanyl analogues as controlled substances in 2019, meaning that it currently subsidizes the export of drugs that are illegal under both U.S. and PRC law. [Some of the substances] have no known legal use worldwide.” Chinese authorities deny responsibility for the crisis and claim to have cooperated with U.S. enforcement efforts to suppress trafficking. AG Pam Bondi sounds the alarm: “People in China don't get addicted to fentanyl because they're shipping it to our country to kill 18-34-year-olds… It is a weapon of mass destruction in my opinion… They're killing our kids and it's got to stop.” pic.twitter.com/ehrO54syDN — Proud Elephant 🇺🇸🦅 (@ProudElephantUS) May 5, 2025 Meanwhile, cryptocurrency is playing a dual role. A February 2025 Chainalysis report highlighted how digital assets both facilitate and expose the fentanyl trade. On darknet markets, fentanyl and its precursors are often sold for Bitcoin or Monero. Chainalysis noted that some buyers and sellers don’t anonymize their activity, allowing analysts to map out trafficking networks. Cryptocurrency enables remote drug purchases and money laundering but also provides transparency that cash doesn’t. “While the cartel may have benefitted from speed, low transaction fees, and cross-border efficiency, their reliance on the blockchain has allowed investigators to trace these transactions more easily than would have been possible with traditional cash-based money laundering. Furthermore, it allows even greater disruptive potential, because issuers and centralized services typically have the ability to freeze assets when necessary.” That’s an unobvious way in which crypto facilitates drug trafficking and helps to disrupt the illicit substance markets at the same time. Conclusion Whether China is truly willing or able to dismantle its transcontinental fentanyl supply chain remains unclear. Still, it’s a powerful bargaining chip as trade talks with the Trump administration loom. In 2019, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matt Cronin put it bluntly: “It is a fact that if the People’s Republic of China wanted to shut down the synthetic opioid industry, they could do so in a day.” You might also like: Fentanyl ‘precursors’ made $32m in crypto last year, report says",Feature|Canada|China|Crime|Donald Trump|tariffs|trade war,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|ZRX,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-05-10 01:38:00

Defined by speed, ferocious competition, and furious innovation, the chain has in the past 24 hours alone turned up some explosive engagement by users and other activity that’s key for a serving of serious Layer-1 momentum. An ecosystem promising high throughput and innovative tokenomics is taking concrete shape. Core contributors like Sonic Labs and initiatives like Shadow on Sonic are pushing the project toward a vision of it becoming a high-performance, community-driven chain with long-term potential. Here’s more about the ambitious project in a nutshell. Daily Activity Soars as Ecosystem Grows The latest information from Sonic depicts a chain that is growing very quickly. Almost in a single day, Sonic was able to secure 122,700 active users — a 29% increase — that makes it sound like Sonic is kind of really heating up, promising to bring in a lot more user interest and sustained usage. May 6 alone saw 100,000 unique addresses sending out transactions, resulting in a total of 839,000 transactions in a 24-hour time span. These figures aren’t simply numeral values—merely a collection of adding and subtracting—that exist in and of themselves. They’re far more significant to an ecosystem that, in a landscape where Layer-1 not just networks but all kinds of platforms are vying for attention and throughput, seems to be gaining traction on both the developer and user sides. So what gives? Sonic is picking up serious momentum. In the past day: – 122.7K active addresses (+29%) – 839K transactions – Nearly 100K senders on May 6 alone With @ShadowOnSonic and @SonicLabs leading the charge, the chain’s ecosystem is clearly heating up. pic.twitter.com/6HIC3iTB8U — Nansen (@nansen_ai) May 8, 2025 A sizable chunk of this growth can be pinned down to the continual expansion of Sonic’s ecosystem. Two substantial factors in this ecosystem growth are Sonic Labs and the Shadow on Sonic project. Sonic Labs is building infrastructure and tooling that increase usability and utility for developers working with Sonic. Shadow on Sonic is doing the same for users of Sonic. Altogether, these projects are making Sonic the kind of network you can use right now. Sonic Construction’s competitive advantage is its ability to deliver what many Layer 1 blockchains have struggled to do consistently: perform at scale. Their current offering achieves a phenomenal 400,000 transactions per second (TPS), with the potential to do much more. This is moon math, in part because we don’t know how many TPS a Layer 1 must deliver to be useful. For now, we can only gauge Sonic’s performance in terms of the handful of TPS that leading Layer 1s purport to deliver. @SonicLabs is emerging as a new force in the Layer-1 race. With performance reaching 400,000 TPS, a deflationary tokenomics model, and a strategic dual airdrop system, $S is not just making noise — it’s laying the foundation for long-term, sustainable growth. A real… pic.twitter.com/Ou7FQxOn2o — Sonic Insider (@insider_sonic) May 7, 2025 Tokenomics and Airdrops: Building a Sustainable Growth Model Sonic isn’t just fast and active; it’s also constructing a carefully devised economic model for long-term success. This model is underpinned by a token called $S, which is a deflationary asset, designed to reward both long-term holders and active participants of the Sonic ecosystem, while also maintaining a healthy token supply over time. Sonic is attracting new participants and boosting user engagement with its innovative dual airdrop system. What makes this so engaging is that it ensures that token distribution stimulates a more active ecosystem rather than just makes token holders wait to sell their tokens for a profit in the future. Sonic rewards both kinds of people who interact with its system—not just those who participate in the system day to day but also those who potentially might be in the future. $S’s utility and deflationary design make it a sustainable token — quite unusual among the many inflationary tokens. Even so, it’s important to recognize that building a sustainable token economy fully within the Sonic ecosystem would not be possible without strong application growth and a fast-growing partner network, since the Sonic experience is a key context for users to hold and use $S. Sonic Labs has also played a crucial role in directing this model and supporting the broader ecosystem with tools, funding, and developer incentives. They furnish structure and vision, and act as a stabilizing force as the ecosystem grows. Sonic in recent weeks has shown that it is no longer just another Layer-1 hopeful but a serious contender operating in a crowded market. Seen now is an immediate next phase for Sonic, where it shifts from not just community momentum but real tokenomics momentum with an approach that allows for sustainable and scalable growth in its community. With daily activity that is absolutely sky-high and new all-time highs in daily number of transactions. Seen now is a next phase for Sonic, which aspires to achieve a more decentralized structure. In 2025, as the Layer-1 race intensifies, Sonic is more than just a pace setter — it is establishing the tone for the next generation of blockchains.

In the past day, Virtuals has delivered breathtaking price performance and continued its march toward expansion, a development that has played a significant role in pumping the otherwise lackluster total AI-agent sector valuation up to $9.28 billion. With an investor interest that is now shifting toward smaller, high-potential projects, Virtuals has been quietly going about its business of establishing itself as an AI-agent core pillar — not just because of its market cap, but also owing to its apparent technological leadership and community traction. Virtuals Sees 15% Daily Price Surge Amid Sector-Wide Gains On the day, the real showstopper was $VIRTUAL, the very native token of the Virtuals ecosystem, which saw a price increase almost in the realm of a bull rider’s reward: a 15% surge just in the last 24 hours. That brings us to the present moment, where $VIRTUAL is priced at $1.6357, and where the Virtuals ecosystem’s overall market cap is now at $1.96 billion, which is just about 17% more than what it was before today. This sharp movement upward was part of a sectoral rebound in the AI-agent group, which grew by 7.34% to hit $9.28 billion. The performance indicates reenergized interest in intelligent crypto agents, an emerging vertical that sits at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Virtuals now commands 26.45% of total mindshare in the AI-agent sector, which is up a slight 0.45%. This figure reflects both brand recognition and network effect — indicators that users and investors alike are consolidating around the Virtuals brand as the sector’s flagship platform. As the market sentiment brightens and capital rotates with gusto back into cutting-edge, AI-driven enterprises, Virtuals is cashing in on what looks more and more like a precocious bet on the future of the metaverse. The company has invested its own money (and raised some from eager investors) to build metaverse infrastructure, to put it in simple terms—right now, it has a pretty good stake in what could easily become a cornerstone of tomorrow’s internet. With the investment in place, it has a very active community both in and around its virtual spaces to serve, and it’s engaged in a constant process of iteration and improvement, which is what virtually every successful tech company does. Top Gainers: Smaller Agents Spark New Wave of Momentum While $VIRTUAL remains the cornerstone of the ecosystem, smaller cap agents within the VIRTUAL network are also seeing tremendous growth. This suggests a good distribution of capital within the ecosystem, along with a rising investor appetite for differentiated agent technologies. The list below names some smaller cap agents within the VIRTUAL network that are experiencing rapid growth. Heading the gains over the past 24 hours was GEKKO (@Gekko_Agent), which shot up by 51.2%. GEKKO’s individual trading logic and the way it’s coupled with real-time sentiment analysis tools have made it a darling of the sorts of users who favor high-frequency, data-driven decision-making. Close behind is MUSIC (@MusicByVirtuals), which gained 43.48%. This audio-focused AI agent has a strong following and a clearer path to monetization than its sibling. Personalization is at the foreground of MUSIC’s experience. Users interact with the product while it learns. And it produces something special: generative music. POLY (@polytraderAI) continued to build on its momentum as a versatile trading assistant, rising 41.6%. Its modular design allows users to program multi-asset strategies, making it appealing to DeFi traders navigating multiple ecosystems.

While SANTA is positioning itself as a gamified gift-giving and engagement engine, MISATO focuses on cross-platform identity and reputation scores — both reflecting the increasing diversity of agent use cases being explored within Virtuals. The pronounced advances of lower-cap assets mark a turn in the investor landscape. It’s one thing to buy a large, well-known token with some hope of utility. It’s another to plow money into niche, specialized AI assets that are used for specific purposes and, in many cases, are much smaller and less profitable than the top tokens. Like many AI projects, Virtuals has moved from proof of concept to real utility, but it’s not there yet. It has received sustained capital, but quite a bit of the narrative seems to be ecosystem innovation and increasing mindshare. Overall, the next stage of the Virtuals narrative seems… unclear. The recent rally isn’t only a flash in the pan—it’s an indication that the AI-agent sector is solidifying its presence in the wider Web3 economy. Virtual’s leadership in this space, alongside a thriving community of agents and developers, positions it nicely for further expansion in 2025 and well beyond.

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. Ether ( ETH ) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard. Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives . Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen. Ether 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.ch The ETH futures premium has yet to exceed the 5% threshold typically associated with a neutral market, indicating that demand for leveraged bullish positions remains notably limited. ETH's continued underperformance—trailing the altcoin market capitalization by 17% in 2025—helps explain the prevailing lack of investor confidence. Some analysts interpret this as an opening for further short covering, while others contend that Ethereum's core fundamentals have yet to improve meaningfully. Ethereum maintains leadership in decentralization and TVL Irrespective of Ether’s price action, recent network upgrades have notably enhanced layer-2 scalability . More importantly, they have helped solidify Ethereum’s position as the leading platform in terms of decentralization and security. This is reflected in Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL), which stands at $64 billion. For comparison, the three largest direct competitors—Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron—collectively hold a total value locked (TVL) of $22.3 billion. The limited demand for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has emerged as a key warning sign. Even Ether’s strongest single-day price performance in four years failed to prevent a third consecutive day of net outflows, according to data from Farside Investors. On May 8 alone, US-listed Ether spot ETFs experienced net outflows totaling $16 million. Ether US-listed spot ETFs' daily net flows, USD million. Source: Farside Investors The muted enthusiasm following Ether’s recent bullish momentum can be partly attributed to the sharp 85% drop in Ethereum network fees from January to April. Reduced network activity lowers overall demand for ETH and negatively affects net staking yields, as the protocol’s burn mechanism relies on competition for data processing. ETH options markets also offer insight into whether whales and market makers anticipate further downside risks. Deribit 30-day ETH options delta skew (put-call). Source: Laevitas.ch Currently, put (sell) options are trading at similar levels to equivalent call (buy) options, indicating a neutral sentiment. This outcome is somewhat discouraging for Ether bulls. Nevertheless, Ether could regain market attention after US President Donald Trump reversed his position following earlier public endorsements of competing altcoins. Related: Ether clocks ‘insane’ 20% candle post Pectra — A turning point? According to a Politico report published on May 8, President Trump felt he had been “used” and had severed ties with the lobbyist who reportedly proposed the idea of a strategic crypto reserve. While Trump’s social media post on March 2 specifically mentioned Solana ( SOL ), Cardano ( ADA ), and XRP, the subsequent March 6 “Digital Asset Stockpile” Executive Order struck a much more reserved tone. Despite the evident apathy in both the Ether derivatives market and spot ETF flows, a rally toward the $2,700 level remains plausible—especially if investor sentiment shifts in response to the failed lobbying efforts undertaken by some of Ethereum’s competitors.

After a sustained spell of not-so-exciting price changes, Ethereum has lately had all the excitement it can handle, capped by another nearly 10% price pop in just the last few hours. Ethereum Breaks $2,000 As the crypto market turns bullish once again, $ETH is showing strong price momentum following the recent Pectra upgrade rising 9.33% in the past 24 hours. Could this mark the beginning of @ethereum comeback? https://t.co/XMztWV1XuS pic.twitter.com/1Q2kz4WdtJ — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 8, 2025 This price action—actually upward instead of downward for a change—has a lot of traders and investors in the Ethereum ecosystem pretty pumped. And now, right on the heels of the latest price run, everyone is trying to figure out what these developments could mean for the future of ETH. Ethereum’s price surge is after a phase of fluctuating market conditions and stiff competition from other blockchain networks. But the renewed optimism around Ethereum isn’t just about the price. It’s also about what’s happening on the network. And what’s happening on the network is that it’s showing real signs of life, not just in the price, but in what people are doing with the network—its developers, for one, are super active; and two, they’re building things—activity reminiscent of crypto’s halcyon days in 2018. If the next chapter for Ethereum is an exciting one, that’s definitely a good sign for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Developer Activity and Ethereum’s Long-Term Potential One major indicator of the health of any blockchain network is developer activity, and for Ethereum, this has seen a truly remarkable resurgence. The figures show that the number of commits tagged to Ethereum open-source repositories has returned to levels seen back in 2018. More impressively, this was after Ethereum had peaked at an all-time high of 176,000 weekly commits in August 2023. Even now, Ethereum accounts for a substantially impressive 44% of all the commits being made in the weekly crypto ecosystem. Developer activity returns to 2018 levels The number of commits tagged to open-source repositories has now returned to 2018 levels after peaking at 176K weekly commits in August 2023. @ethereum ecosystem accounts for 44% of the total weekly commits, with a current figure of… pic.twitter.com/llL6UEsEaM — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 7, 2025 The increase in developer activity indicates a sharpened focus on constructing and refining the Ethereum network, particularly post-big upgrades such as the Pectra upgrade. The affair and vigor exhibited by developers signify a renewed long-term commitment to Ethereum’s steady evolution, and in the developers’ words, to “future-proofing” the network for what kind of potential growth could come its way. Notably, Ethereum’s network upgrades—especially the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and the shift to proof-of-stake—have set the stage for far greater scalability, much lower energy consumption, and overall improved network efficiency. These developments, along with a dedicated base of developers and contributors, give the Ethereum ecosystem a definite aura of vitality and innovation. Ethereum ETFs and Institutional Interest Although the price of Ethereum and the level of development activity seem to be on the upswing, the appearance of the institutional side of things is one of caution. As of May 7, Ethereum spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $21.77 million, which was really just an unfortunate reflection of the investor sentiment toward the asset. To make matters worse, none of the nine Ethereum-focused ETFs could muster up even a single dollar of net inflow during that period. So, what could this be telling us? On May 7, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $142 million, with none of the twelve ETFs recording net outflows. In contrast, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $21.77 million, with none of the nine ETFs registering net inflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 8, 2025 Even with this short dip, Ethereum continues to hold strong as a long-term viable network. Why? Because it keeps its developer activity at high and growing levels, and because it keeps up with successful upgrades. Its most recent upgrade, the Pectra implementation, has gone off without a hitch as far as I know (that is, as far as any major problems that could indicate some kind of upgrade calamity). Now, I know this is a lot of good news for Ethereum to bathe in, and trust me, I’m aware of the negative price action for the long-suffering Ether. A decline week in and week out is never a pleasant sight. But the sea of red that has become part of Ether’s price history seems to lie in direct contrast to the reality of Ethereum the network. The Road Ahead: Ethereum’s Bullish Momentum Could Signal New Heights Ethereum’s latest performance is seeing a lot of promise attached to it, as traders look to see if it can finally break through the important $2,000 mark. For many in the market, this was a key psychological barrier to get through for Ethereum and represented a serious test of its resilience. If it can maintain its upward momentum and overcome any potential resistance, there’s a possibility it could rise a lot more and potentially set new all-time highs in the months ahead. To keep the bullish movement alive, Ethereum must keep the developers interested, accomplish promised updates to its network, and furnish powerful use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other areas. Yes, the recent outflow from Ethereum spot ETFs might raise eyebrows and elicit some hand-wringing, given how much is also riding on the appearance of demand for Ethereum these days. But the ETF concern is a half-building block of a bearish narrative. The other half, which also happens to be on much more solid ground, is that Ethereum is a pretty good hedge to have in a DeFi-based portfolio over the longer term. From this point on, Ethereum’s ability to retain its crown as the preeminent smart contract platform in the crypto world will most likely determine its continued thriving in the crypto space. Backed by a fervently devoted developer community and a robustly interested cryptocurrency market, Ethereum keeps moving forward with its ongoing evolution. If nothing else, the latest price surge clearly states that the asset is not in a death spiral. Even as the crypto market moves in other directions, Ethereum remains resilient and a source of technical promise. This outlook may provide some optimism for any price pullbacks that might occur in early 2022. If Ethereum’s price continues to rise in 2022, it may do so on the back of both the momentum that the crypto market currently has and the potential future technical developments of the network.

Even with the price surge, the overall resistance levels for Bitcoin might not be as tough to topple as some experts had expected, meaning the cryptocurrency could clear these hurdles in the near future with the same ease as it did its last few rising price points. The price of Bitcoin is around $94,719, a strong support level where a substantial amount of $BTC has been accumulated. This floor seems to be solid, a sort of base the price can bounce off of as it heads toward the $100K level. However, there are obstacles to overcome on the way up, with resistance levels lying between here and the next major milestone price point at around $101,673, where once again a significant amount of Bitcoin has been amassed. Sell-Side Pressure and Resistance: On-Chain Indicators Show Limited Downside Risk One of the most critical insights that on-chain data provides is understanding the selling pressure and potential resistance in the market. When Bitcoin gets close to crucial price points, the sell-side activity tends to ramp up, often coming from holders with underperforming assets. On-chain analytics from places like Santiment reveal there’s still some serious sell-side pressure judging by the red bubbles they see on the charts. These bubbles represent volume coming from what we would call “distressed” holders. To be more precise, these sellers aren’t really distressed; they are far better positioned than they were a year ago. Bitcoin is once again approaching the $100K threshold, and on-chain data suggests potential resistance may be limited. The red bubbles highlight volume that's still in an unrealized loss; cohorts more likely to sell to break even or minimize further downside. This group… pic.twitter.com/yAhdHXp6IR — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 8, 2025 This group of likely sellers is very limited in size compared to the total available supply of Bitcoin. That essentially means that the sell-side pressure is more contained than in previous episodes where a larger number of holders were underwater. If we take together the profit-taking rendering the price action of Bitcoin for the past few weeks and the fact that profit-taking usually happens when a dire resistance level is being approached, it seems like sellers might still be at a very strategic advantage. Again, this isn’t exactly a positive delisting catalyst, but it is some indication that, regardless of the price action in the short term, buyers on the Bitcoin network are better off for now. Conversely, the levels where accumulation has occurred are apparent in the @#@substantial accumulation zones. Bitcoin is mirroring key support at $94,719, where 195,000 BTC were amassed over a short period of time. It is likely that these holders, who we term ‘believers,’ have strong incentives to defend this level. As a result, this zone becomes a good candidate to consider absence of any formation that signals a breakdown into lower levels. The path to $100,000 and up is not clear of roadblocks. A key obstacle lies just in front of us, at $101,673, where 81,910 BTC have been gathered. This is a much more prominent and wider resistance level than even the next one, at $111,732, which has also accumulated significant buying interest. #Bitcoin has established a strong support floor at $94,719, where 195,320 $BTC were accumulated. On the upside, a key resistance wall stands at $101,673, with 81,910 #BTC accumulated at that level. pic.twitter.com/PRFCKAeDFY — Ali (@ali_charts) May 8, 2025 Needless to say, if Bitcoin does head toward $100,000, much less if it surpasses that, it will have to deal with these two obvious pockets of profit-taking for traders who have been long Bitcoin. Surely, such trading dynamics could induce a consolidation at best and a retracement at worst. Whale Activity and Spot ETF Inflows Indicate Confidence in Bitcoin’s Price Surge As Bitcoin’s price keeps climbing, there has been considerable movement from Bitcoin’s big holders. On-chain data shows that these big players have been taking the opportunity to cash out a fair amount of their holdings. Santiment’s data this week highlighted that these large Bitcoin holders (i.e., the whales) sold over 60,000 BTC in recent days. This, according to Santiment, is further evidence that these big investors are taking advantage of the rising price to lock in some of their profits. Whales capitalized on the recent price surge, booking profits by selling over 60,000 #Bitcoin $BTC , shows on-chain data from @santimentfeed ! pic.twitter.com/Ilmw0zXQHx — Ali (@ali_charts) May 7, 2025 Even so, the total trend is still very much in the bullish camp, with growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as an asset; this confidence seems to be underpinning the inflow of capital into Bitcoin-focused spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On May 7, the Bitcoin ETF had a net inflow of $142 million—there were no outflows from any of the 12 ETFs that track Bitcoin. My take is that this signals a pretty robust institutional demand for Bitcoin and further reinforces the optimism under which its price might be moving. On May 7, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $142 million, with none of the twelve ETFs recording net outflows. In contrast, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $21.77 million, with none of the nine ETFs registering net inflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 8, 2025 The Road Ahead: Potential for Further Growth and Continued Volatility The current price action of Bitcoin shows that interest in the cryptocurrency market is once again escalating, with not only institutional players maintaining their interest but also long-term holders remaining true to their positions. The next few weeks could see Bitcoin testing some key price points, with a solid support level at $94,719 and resistance looming at $101,673. Volatility is a constant in the world of cryptocurrency, and investors need to stay alert to the possibility of not just rapid price increases but also swift pullbacks. That said, relatively low sell-side pressure and strong accumulation might just mean that Bitcoin is ready to break through its resistance levels and establish a new record high. Of course, there are a lot of different ways to play this scenario. Spot ETFs have been receiving decent inflows, and whales are certainly still playing a large role in price action. Those are two pretty important aspects for a healthy Bitcoin market. But, as usual, it’s mainly a question of the price itself resolving at critical levels across time frames.

For most of the year, memecoins and speculative assets have been the darlings of the headlines. Now, utility-driven tokens are stepping into the spotlight—especially those tokens that exist at the intersection of AI and decentralized infrastructure. A few tokens are emerging that seem to be winning, with $VVV, $LAYER, and $HOOK capturing most of the investor attention. That said, $TANK and $CYBER also have momentum building behind them, and if they keep moving in the direction of upward price action, they could be next in line to garner the serious interest of investors. This shift is occurring for reasons that are very much tied to artificial intelligence and infrastructure. Venice Protocol ($VVV) Dominates the AI Infrastructure Narrative At the forefront is $VVV, the native token of the Venice Protocol—also known by its handle @AskVenice. This decentralized generative AI platform empowers a multitude of possibilities, spanning text conversations, image and code generation, and more. In contrast to AI services of the traditional Web2 era, Venice resides in a computational layer that is decentralized, censorship resistant, and redefining the contours of value capture in AI infrastructure. What’s been dominating mindshare? Over the past month, there’s been a noticeable rotation into $VVV , $LAYER , and even $HOOK . $TANK and $CYBER climbed the ranks toward early May. pic.twitter.com/EBKtqb3bD4 — Nansen (@nansen_ai) May 9, 2025 In the course of just a week, $VVV has rocketed upward by more than 80%, and now has a market cap of $135 million. Its growth isn’t just hype; it’s being driven by some impressive numbers. Venice now has over 50,000 daily active users (DAUs), strong evidence that its adoption is being driven by real utility and not just a bunch of speculators. What differentiates Venice is its unique model of ‘stake-for-access.’ Users don’t pay a subscription fee or burn tokens to use the generative AI capabilities of the platform. Instead, they stake $VVV to access them. This is a clear value proposition to stakers, and it creates an interesting value loop. The more people using the tokenized service, the more demand there is for the token, which is designed to strengthen the network. If this model works, it might give AI and tokenomics something to talk about. A Broader Rotation into AI and Infra-Focused Tokens $VVV may be at the head of the pack, but it hardly runs alone. Tokens like $LAYER and $HOOK have seen mounting interest and an inflow of capital, too. Both are linked to infrastructure layers that, in the case of both tokens, aim to serve the next generation of decentralized applications, especially those driven by AI. $LAYER is all about a modular, scalable, global compute layer. It’s letting developers build highly customized, high-performance environments. And at the same time, it lets those developers rely on standard primitives, or building blocks, for the kinds of applications they’re creating. These assets reflect a more extensive market understanding: as AI becomes further incorporated into our digital existences, the infrastructure undergirding it has to be decentralized, resilient, and open. The platforms that furnish this backbone seem most primed to gain, both in user numbers and in goodwill from investors. From Speculation to Substance: Real Utility Becomes the Key Driver Right now, more than just another hype cycle is happening. With the platforms like Venice rising and the tokens that power them, the crypto market is showing signs of maturing. The way things are playing out, the story is shifting from a purely speculative rotation into something that’s more about real, long-term sustained use cases. Platforms providing decentralized AI that can’t be censored, are accessible to everyone, and are able to capture their economic value on-chain, are something I’m increasingly seeing as a very important component of the modern digital world. In that context, we’re looking at tokens like $VVV not as ephemeral, here-today-and-gone tokens, but as basic building blocks of an economic layer for decentralized AI. If the current momentum continues, expect further inflows into tokens that are based around AI and those that are in the infrastructure layer. These tokens have not only good fundamentals, but they also have the kinds of good fundamentals that are leading to them having a user base that is growing quickly. So these tokens, in particular, are not just winning “mindshare”; they are well on their way to winning “market share” as well. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In the last 24 hours, the total market cap for AI agents has soared by 17.12%, climbing to a record-smashing $10.89 billion. At the heart of this exploding rally is the AI project Virtuals, whose token $VIRTUAL has not just reclaimed, but soared past the $2.00 price point, closing today at $2.04—a 24.64% one-day gain. The total investor confidence wave that the broader Virtuals ecosystem experienced carried it to a total market cap of $2.39 billion, which is a 27.13% increase. Virtuals has 27.13% mindshare, which means it is leading the rapidly expanding AI agent market. $VIRTUAL Reclaims Momentum, Driving Ecosystem Growth Today’s performance of the virtuals was nothing short of commanding. After a brief consolidation period earlier in the week, the token staged a sharp breakout of sorts, crossed the $2.00 threshold, and peaked at $2.04 by the daily close. The 24.64% surge in price (wasn’t just a technical move—it was) driven by (heightened trading volume, renewed community attention, and a) sharp uptick in developer activity across the platform. Virtuals keeps on carving a unique space in the AI agent market by offering modular, programmable agents that can interact across decentralized applications. These agents perform tasks like automating smart contracts, managing on-chain communities, and integrating AI into DeFi protocols. The demand for these capabilities seems to be increasing and this has driven not only token demand but also ecosystem growth. At a present market cap of $1.33 billion, $VIRTUAL now constitutes over 12% of the whole AI agent field as a sector. Some analysts are closely watching this breakout to see if it can sustain itself, particularly as the usage metrics and developer traction keep climbing. Top Performers: Small Caps Stage Major Breakout Despite the attention drawn by the Virtuals, numerous smaller projects also enjoyed impressive increases over the last 24 hours.

For instance, HOLLY and VADER have both become widely used and are talked about because they offer entertainment-focused AI agents. Meanwhile, GUAN is growing and growing as an AI company because its research assistants, who are powered by AI, are helping users across the globe to conduct research. LUNA, a constituent of the Virtuals ecosystem, had a particularly strong day, rallying nearly 35% alongside the breakout of $VIRTUAL. Performance like this suggests that secondary ecosystem tokens might represent an opportunity to gain leveraged exposure during broader market moves. What’s Next? Momentum Faces a Key Test The AI agent market has surged past $10.89 billion, and $VIRTUAL has broken new ground. The momentum is undeniable. But what we should really be asking is: can this rally be sustained? A number of things will be, and rightly should be, taken into account. First, an adoption of these by users in the real world may well serve to validate the valuations in question. That takes us to the second factor: broader market conditions, especially in the crypto world, could well impact either direct or indirect sentiment toward these assets in the short term. Lastly, traditional venture capital works in cycles. The Virtuals will have to keep the spark of imagination going pretty well non-stop if it is to retain its top-of-mind status. Nevertheless, one clear thing has emerged from their output in recent weeks: the AI agent market is heating up fast, and Virtuals is placed right in the thick of it. With a relatively young but rapidly growing ecosystem, strong community support, and what Utz envisions as a clear product-market fit, the project appears well positioned to lead the next wave of decentralized AI growth.

44401868,https://nulltx.com/?p=149367,1746841707,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethereum Defies Retail Sentiment, Surges Past $2,075 Post-Pectra Dip",https://nulltx.com/ethereum-defies-retail-sentiment-surges-past-2075-post-pectra-dip/,"In the extremely volatile realm of cryptocurrency, Ethereum has once more given investors a timely reminder of a golden rule: The market frequently moves in the opposite direction of expectations held by retail investors. Just one day after the Pectra upgrade—an event long anticipated by many—failed to produce the immediate price rally that so many had hoped for and instead sent a wave of disappointment and a flurry of sell-offs in Ethereum’s direction, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has sharply reversed course. Today, Ethereum burst beyond the $2,075 level, making its peak price in over six weeks and leaving behind many who’d staked a bet on its not-so-distant future. The surge smacks of what seasoned traders might call “contrarian value”—the principle that doing what most people are not doing can lead to outsized gains. Retail Capitulation, Meme Coin Hype, and the Unexpected Rebound Yesterday’s Pectra upgrade had a quick and, for many, disheartening reaction. The immediate price action was underwhelming for the many in the upgrade camp who were just hoping for a move to all-time highs in ETH. If we are being real, though, it was mostly a narrative surrounding the upgrade that had people excited, not the math behind the upgrade itself. The narrative was mostly a way to say that we have been in a bear market for a long time, and what a bull signal this upgrade was. Retail traders who had been long on this narrative sold into weakness and, in a fit of frustration, told others to buy meme coins instead. The sentiment on social media took a distinctly negative turn as ETH’s price fell and attention turned to more exciting, unstable assets that promise quick returns. But the people who held their ground and remained calm for just a bit longer than most were rewarded at the end of that same day with an unexpectedly large uptick in Ethereum’s price. The event served to reinforce yet again the idea that having a strong, long-term belief in an investment pays off much more handsomely than giving in to the short-term buzz. The rally that brought Ethereum (ETH) up to the $2,075 mark today wasn’t just a nice number to see—it was an important sign to see. For over a month, month-and-a-half, ETH has had a hard time making any kind of headway in an upward direction. If anything, it had been mostly taking backward steps. Almost the only time in that period when ETH appeared to make even a modest gain was when it was momentarily lifting back up through the $1,750 mark. Ethereum has provided a textbook example on how it pays to be a contrarian against the retail crowd. Following disappointing price performances following the Pectra upgrade yesterday, many traders sold off their ETH bags and instructed others to do the same in favor of various… pic.twitter.com/ABIqtfnpKw — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 8, 2025 One analyst said that retail investors continue to underestimate Ethereum. ‘Every time sentiment shifts to a bearish position based on a single event, we tend to see the asset respond with strength not long after. It’s almost a case study of how markets punish emotional trading and reward strategic patience.’ The Crowd is Often Wrong—And Ethereum Proved It Again One of the clearest messages from Ethereum’s post-Pectra price action is that the market has a repeated tendency to move against retail investors. When price extremes happen—be they euphoric tops or panic-driven bottoms—they tend to occur at the very moments when the crowd is most confidently wrong in its direction. Ethereum’s recent surge fits this pattern perfectly. Traders keeping an eye on sentiment metrics, and especially those focused on social engagement and predictions of an imminent ETH price collapse, may have been alerted to the possibility of a reversal. The charting of retail sentiment extremes has become an unexpectedly valuable guide. It highlights how FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt)—which is plentiful around Ethereum these days—often sets the stage for a contrarian bounce. To recover so quickly—and decisively—suggests that what lies underneath, in the fundamentals of Ethereum, is quite strong. The network, as it stands, is aiming for the kind of scalability that will one day allow it to support something more than just a few hundred dapps and smart contracts—if not millions of them. Ethereum might be getting there, folks, and it might not be unwise to consider what this means for ether (ETH) as an investable asset. This episode serves as a lesson not just in trading Ethereum, but in the behavior of markets more generally. When fear is at its loudest, and when exits are most crowded, opportunity often lies just beneath the surface. Once more, Ethereum has reminded the crypto world that patience and fundamentals can still outperform hype and herd behavior. Ethereum continues to be near short-term highs, and because of this, all eyes can now turn to whether or not this momentum can be translated into a sustained rally. But what happens next might be a less important story than the one that’s already been told: Following the crowd in crypto is a peculiarly dangerous pastime, and Ethereum just made that point impossible to ignore.

Pi coin is holding near $0.60 after sliding sharply from its highs. XRP, on the other hand, is showing positive signs with some predicting a move beyond $5 as major support builds behind it. While these coins dominate headlines, Web3 ai is quietly gaining attention, and it might not stay quiet for long. Web3 ai is not just joining the AI crypto trend, it’s creating something practical. The platform’s dashboard brings together tools for price forecasting, yield farming, and live trading bots across Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain. Unlike many projects, $WAI is more than a symbol, it gives access to actual tools already in development. Those who missed early growth from TAO or ChainGPT may want to pay attention. As top-rated crypto options are compared, from Pi coin’s movement to the latest XRP price prediction, $WAI is shaping up to be a contender that can’t be ignored. Web3 ai: Could This Be the Top Missed 100x of 2025? Web3 ai is being developed as one of the most complete AI-driven platforms in crypto for 2025. Made for traders who prefer a unified system, it brings together DeFi features, automated portfolio tracking, real-time insights, and multi-chain access in a single layout. With 12 built-in AI modules, the platform features a deep learning price prediction tool (LSTM), automated bot trading, a scam alert system, arbitrage insights, and DeFi farming support. These tools are powered by active blockchain and exchange data, supporting Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain from the first day. $WAI also enables full access to the dashboard’s tools and gives holders a voice in future governance. What gives Web3 ai its edge is its readiness; it’s not a distant idea but a functioning product. Once $WAI is listed, the full tool suite becomes available. Currently in stage 3, $WAI stands at $0.000331. The presale has 50 stages, starting from $0.0003 and ending at $0.003267, with an official exchange price of $0.005242. This means an expected ROI of 1747% before it even goes live. With AI and crypto gaining traction together, Web3 ai is fast becoming one of the top-rated cryptocurrencies for 2025. It isn’t just creating excitement, it’s offering real services. If TAO or ChainGPT passed you by, this could be a second chance. For those exploring early-stage coins with genuine use, Web3 ai could be the one that ends up being 2025’s most talked-about miss. Pi Coin Price Slides but May Still Hold Promise Pi coin has dropped to roughly $0.60 after falling from nearly $3 earlier this year. The launch of its open mainnet brought real user interaction, including P2P payments and verified apps. However, limited exchange support and slow retail use have held its price back. Even so, momentum may return. The MACD indicator has flipped to the bullish side, and RSI data suggests a potential move toward the $0.73–$0.76 range. The project’s founder is also set to speak at Consensus 2025, which might add fresh energy if new platform updates are shared. Though still early-stage, Pi’s progress and community presence keep it on the radar for small-cap traders. XRP Price Prediction Points Toward $5 Target XRP is regaining attention, now priced near $2.23 after gaining 5% in April and reversing a long pattern of losses during the same month. Some predictions suggest a fallback toward $1.55, but others believe it could reach $5 by May based on current technical trends and increased buying activity. From a broader view, XRP has cleared regulatory hurdles, ending its legal battle with the SEC. Ripple has rolled out new futures on the CME, acquired a brokerage firm, and introduced RLUSD, a new stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar. XRP’s inclusion in a U.S. crypto reserve plan further improves its position with major institutions. These steps suggest XRP’s momentum could continue and is backed by real-world upgrades. Summing Up! Pi coin may be down from its peak, but its team is pushing adoption through real use and upcoming updates. XRP price prediction remains strong as legal clarity and major partnerships push it forward. Both show upside, but have already seen movement. Web3 ai brings something different. With a 12-tool AI platform, live market features, and a structured presale offering 1747% ROI, it’s still early in the game. Built for users who want a ready-to-go dashboard with everything from auto trading to price forecasts, Web3 ai is focused on real use, not speculation. If you’re watching the top-rated crypto and still undecided, now might be the time to take a closer look. Web3 ai could be remembered as the one that most people noticed, too late.

While some coins are still dealing with price swings, others are showing steady growth and signs of real progress. The top trending crypto projects today aren’t just riding waves; they’re backed by adoption, real-world use, and long-term goals. This article looks at four cryptos making big moves this year. Cardano is gaining momentum with large holders accumulating and a possible breakout ahead. XRP is in the spotlight with ETF speculation and futures listings coming soon. Solana is approaching a major resistance level with strong upside potential. And BlockDAG is quietly rising as a powerful crypto presale project with strong fundamentals and major growth potential. If you’re building a future-focused portfolio, these top trending crypto picks are worth watching closely. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): A Rising Star with $231.5M Raised BlockDA (BDAG) is capturing serious attention in 2025 as one of the top trending crypto projects. With over $231.5 million raised and more than 19.9 billion coins sold, it’s clear the project is drawing strong early support. What’s pushing the urgency even further is the limited-time entry price of $0.0019, available only until May 13. With a public launch set at $0.05, early backers are staring at an expected 2,531% return. BDAG isn’t just gaining traction because of numbers. It’s built as a fully EVM-compatible Layer 1 network focused on scalable, fast, and low-cost smart contract deployment. The project also emphasizes developer usability and has support from respected tech collaborators like HackerEarth and SpaceDev. The ecosystem is expanding quickly. The X1 Miner app has now passed 1 million downloads, creating a large pre-listing user base. Additionally, BlockDAG’s mining hardware has brought in over $7 million in revenue, with 17,376 miners sold so far, demonstrating real market demand. Analysts are already discussing BDAG’s potential to reach $1, and with exchange listings expected soon, the timing couldn’t be more crucial. If you’re looking for a top trending crypto that blends tech, community, and early-stage potential, BlockDAG deserves your full attention before the price window closes. 2. Cardano (ADA): Building Momentum with Whale Accumulation Cardano is steadily regaining strength. Trading around $0.72, ADA has shown resilience by rebounding from April lows and maintaining key support levels. Technical analyses suggest a potential breakout if it surpasses the $0.74 resistance mark. Notably, large holders accumulated over 420 million ADA in April alone, signaling growing confidence in Cardano’s long-term prospects. Analysts anticipate a price movement toward $1.30 if bullish momentum continues. Cardano’s ongoing development and expanding ecosystem keep it at the forefront of smart contract platforms. With a dedicated community and increasing institutional interest, ADA remains a top trending crypto for those seeking consistent growth. 3. Ripple (XRP): Anticipating ETF Approvals and Futures Listings Ripple XRP is back in the spotlight. Currently trading around $2.21, it has experienced a 7% uptick in recent weeks amid growing anticipation of a potential spot ETF approval. Additionally, XRP futures are expected to launch on the CME this May, potentially increasing trading volume and price discovery. Analysts predict XRP could reach $3.40 by mid-2025, with some forecasts suggesting a rise to $5 if ETF approval is secured. Conversely, a rejection might see prices dip toward $1.61. Nonetheless, XRP’s role in global payments and cross-border transactions ensures its continued relevance. For those monitoring top trending crypto assets with real-world applications and regulatory developments, XRP remains a key contender. 4. Solana (SOL): Approaching Critical Resistance Levels Solana has regained attention, trading around $154.65 after rebounding from April’s dip to $115. It is nearing a significant resistance zone between $153 and $155, marking a pivotal point for potential price movements. A breakout beyond this range could lead to further gains, with long-term projections aiming for $191.85 or higher by 2030. Solana’s high-speed network, active developer community, and low transaction fees continue to attract users and builders. With technical indicators aligning with growing market support, Solana offers a blend of performance and scalability. Its momentum and ecosystem strength solidify its position as a top trending crypto, especially for those interested in innovation-driven growth. Final Thoughts As seen above, these top trending crypto projects are standing out in 2025 by proving their value through utility, strong performance, and market readiness. Cardano shows solid technical patterns. XRP is gaining momentum with institutional interest. Solana brings speed and scale that continue to attract attention. But BlockDAG is rising fast. With a limited-time price of $0.0019 until May 13, over $231.5 million raised, and major partnerships secured, it’s building real traction. Strong tech and community support make it a standout. For those tracking future leaders, these four rank among the top trending crypto projects worth following this year.

After cycles filled with meme coins, flashy Layer 1s, and speculative NFTs, the focus in 2025 is clearly moving toward tokens that offer actual use. These are the ones powering real features inside crypto apps and tools. With users now more focused on function and reliability, utility tokens are quietly becoming the top performers. Unstaked (UNSD) , Ripple (XRP), and Chainlink (LINK) are three projects showing what real utility can look like. Each one tackles a unique issue using active systems and tested methods. However, they stand apart in their goals, reach, and speed of progress. Ripple (XRP): Known for Fast Global Transfers Ripple is often considered the most grounded crypto project with real-world use. Its token, XRP, helps banks and financial services move money across borders cheaply and quickly. This use case has wide demand, and RippleNet’s reach keeps growing in places like Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. This year, Ripple picked up pace thanks to clearer rules in the U.S. and new licenses abroad. On-chain activity jumped, and XRP pushed past $2.30. Analysts suggest a path to $5.00 if more big players keep using it. But XRP still faces issues around adoption. Its benefits mostly serve business users, not individuals, and it depends on big banks and legal clarity to stay useful. So while it has strong utility, it’s not widely used by everyday people. Chainlink (LINK): The Engine Behind DeFi Data Chainlink plays a key role in making smart contracts useful. It brings off-chain data like asset prices and weather updates into on-chain apps, enabling DeFi, insurance, and more. LINK tokens help pay node operators who verify and send this data. By 2025, Chainlink’s CCIP feature is seeing more use among blockchains, and partnerships with DeFi names like Aave and Synthetix have cemented its place as key infrastructure. While Ripple focuses on finance, Chainlink is embedded in developer tools. It supports back-end systems instead of user-facing apps. Its value grows with DeFi’s expansion, and it’s become a core part of how Web3 services function. Unstaked (UNSD): Powering AI Tools in Web3 Communities Unstaked shows a new kind of usefulness, AI that works for Web3 users directly. It will allow users to activate AI agents to manage and grow Web3 spaces on Telegram and X. These agents will operate without user input and only get rewarded in UNSD if they perform well. What sets Unstaked apart is its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) system. This setup tracks each task an agent completes and distributes rewards based on measurable outcomes. Web3 groups, DAOs, and NFT projects can rely on it for hands-free, AI-led activity that doesn’t require any centralized control. Currently in Stage 7 of its crypto presale , Unstaked is priced at $$0.00776 and has already brought in close to $3 million. With $20 million in launch liquidity planned for Q3 2025 and no VC or private allocations, the project gives access to the public fairly. While the AI agents are not live yet, they will go live once the presale ends and the launch begins. Compared to Ripple and Chainlink, Unstaked stands out by serving users directly. It supports content creators, project managers, and developers who need AI assistance but don’t want to depend on closed platforms. Final Thoughts! Ripple opened the door by showing how crypto can work in banking. Chainlink proved that hidden systems also carry big value. Now Unstaked brings that concept into Web3 communities by creating AI tools that work for the people, not just institutions or code. What’s becoming clear is that crypto is moving past hype into purpose. And in this space, the ones that provide real services, XRP, LINK, and UNSD, are leading from different directions but with shared importance. As more users demand actual function, tokens with clear roles and working systems will be the ones to stick around.

In his opinion, Bitcoin has already taken three distinct steps in its price trajectory: from $100 to $1,000, then to $10,000, and then to over $100,000. i’ve seen bitcoin go: – from $100 to $1,000. – from $1,000 to $10,000. – from $10,000 to $100,000. one more 10x to $1,000,000 is inevitable. — muneeb.btc (@muneeb) May 8, 2025 Ali pointed out how each move took more time but followed a familiar pattern. In 2013, Bitcoin climbed from $100 to $1,000 in four months. Four years later, in 2017, it reached $10,000. By December 2024, it had crossed the $100,000 mark. Based on that path, Ali said another 10x jump to $1 million isn’t just likely — it’s “inevitable”. However, he didn’t explain what would actually drive that kind of rise. New Projection Sees $116K Next Month The latest Bitcoin price forecast by CoinCodex has the price increasing by 13% and hitting $116,600 on June 8, 2025. Technical analysis indicates a positive trend, with 20 of the past 30 days (67%) closing in the positive. During the same timeframe, Bitcoin recorded 6.50% price volatility. Source: Alternative.me The Fear & Greed Index is currently at 73, which is Greed. Though this prediction is not quite hinting at reaching $1 million yet, it validates the notion that there is still space for Bitcoin to rise in the near future.

A US Government Buy-In Could Speed Things Up Zack Shapiro, a Bitcoin Policy Institute lawyer, also thinks that Bitcoin has a lot of potential — and quick. He studied a bill called the Bitcoin Act, which was reintroduced last March. The bill proposes the US government to purchase 1 million BTC within five years. That represents 5% of the total supply. If passed, the bill would fund the acquisition using profits from gold revaluation. Shapiro indicated that a plan like that would fuel demand so high it drives Bitcoin to $1 million earlier than anticipated. That’s provided that the bill gains momentum and secures the financing it requires.

SEI was one of those early 2024 movers that slipped through the fingers of many, and now the regret is loud. Those who acted fast when it launched turned modest entries into serious returns. But for the rest, it became yet another name on the growing list of missed crypto chances. It’s easy to brush these off—until you see what that early decision could’ve meant for your portfolio. And while SEI’s window may be closed, another door might be wide open—if you’re quick enough to catch it. Enter Qubetics . Qubetics isn’t promising magic—it’s delivering structure, purpose, and real-world integration. Built with a scheduled growth model and weekly stage-based pricing, Qubetics has caught the attention of those tracking the most popular cryptocurrency plays of the year. It’s not fueled by hype cycles—it’s grounded in planned development, including an advanced multi-chain wallet, strong infrastructure, and a presale model that’s moving at a clockwork pace. With each new stage bringing a consistent price increase, those waiting too long may find themselves sidelined once again. This might be the last chance to get in before the breakout happens. Qubetics Might Become the Most Popular Cryptocurrency Before You Realize It Those who got in on the earliest phases of Qubetics secured $TICS at just $0.01 during its initial launch back in September 2024. Since then, multiple presale stages have quietly closed, each with a precise 10% price increase every seven days. At Stage 33, the price has reached $0.2302—and many of the lowest-entry windows are long gone. Still, with only 12.85% of the total supply allocated to early community members, Qubetics remains one of the few large-scale Web3 projects offering a fair and open entry point. This isn’t just another token—it’s a tech-focused project anchored by long-term goals and immediate usability. And with the Qubetics mainnet launch confirmed for Q2 2025, there’s a clear path ahead for those aiming to align with the best crypto presale still within reach. As of now, the Qubetics presale has raised over $16.8 million, with more than 511 million $TICS sold across 26,000 unique holders. The numbers speak volumes, but it’s the ROI potential that truly makes this project stand out among other contenders for the most popular cryptocurrency . A $2,000 investment at today’s price of $0.2302 gives you 8,684 tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, that’s already $8,684, offering an ROI of 334.33%. At a $5 projection, that same amount skyrockets to $43,420. Push it to $10 or $15 after the mainnet, and your original investment could return $86,840 or even $130,260 respectively. These figures aren’t just hopeful—they’re structured outcomes based on Qubetics’ mathematical growth curve. For anyone looking to join this best crypto presale, the path is still clear. Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet is already drawing serious attention for practical reasons. Unlike wallets limited to single ecosystems, Qubetics Wallet supports integration with leading blockchains, debit card networks, and mobile pay systems. Whether you’re a freelancer receiving cross-border payments, a merchant looking for stable crypto-to-fiat conversions, or a traveler needing real-time digital access, this wallet adapts to your life. Virtual cards can be generated instantly, used globally, and canceled remotely—offering unmatched flexibility and security. Business owners can link it to payment processors like Google Pay, while everyday users gain seamless access to digital spending. In short, Qubetics isn’t building features for hype—it’s solving real-world problems. SEI’s Rise Was Loud—But All the Best Phases Are Already Gone SEI Network gained early traction by focusing on optimizing transaction throughput and minimizing latency across decentralized environments. Its early ICO price was a fraction of where it stands today, and those who entered during its genesis phases benefitted massively once the project achieved its first exchange listings and decentralized finance integrations. SEI’s technical edge quickly earned it a solid reputation in high-speed trading, which made it particularly appealing for Layer 1 scaling discussions. Community members who missed Solana’s earliest days flocked to SEI hoping for a repeat scenario—and many got just that. But those opportunities came and went fast. After reaching its all-time high within a few months of public trading, SEI became a textbook case of early participation success. Those who bought in late either settled for marginal gains or watched from the sidelines. Today, SEI remains a strong player in its category, but the overwhelming ROI potential that once surrounded its name has already diluted. That doesn’t mean it lacks relevance—but it does mean that those still searching for exponential upside are likely scanning the horizon for the next breakout. And that’s precisely where Qubetics comes into the picture. Final Call: Don’t Let the Most Popular Cryptocurrency of 2025 Slip Past You Again Opportunities like SEI don’t come around every month—and when they do, only a few get in before the big leap. The most popular cryptocurrency in 2025 might not be the one already making headlines. It might be the one still up for grabs, quietly gaining strength behind the scenes. That’s exactly what Qubetics represents today: a well-structured project, a timed token release, a non-custodial wallet application, and the clearest pricing logic in the current Web3 space. If your goal is to be part of something before the surge—not after—it’s time to act decisively. The Qubetics presale is still open, but not for long. Each stage ticks forward weekly with a built-in 10% price rise. This isn’t just math—it’s a countdown. And with Qubetics’ presale metrics and wallet infrastructure already proving their worth, it’s no surprise many believe it’s gearing up to become the most popular cryptocurrency of the year. If you’ve missed SEI and other past giants, this might be your signal to join this best crypto presale while the numbers are still on your side.

The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off Saylor said “lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” “A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added. Strategy’s Michael Saylor spoke to Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast. Source: Natalie Brunell Saylor said that many of these trustees do not have a “10-year investors mindset,” and as Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price began to rally, they took advantage and “thought this is a good exit point to get liquidity.” “So I think people less committed to the long term have taken the opportunity to exit the market and a whole new class of investors are entering by way of ETFs and by way of Bitcoin treasury companies.” After Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20 just hours before US President Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, it experienced a downtrend, falling as low as $76,273 on April 9, before starting to show signs of recovery. On May 8, Bitcoin reclaimed $100,000 for the first time since Feb. 1 after US President Donald Trump proposed tariffs. The recent price surge has pushed Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to 50.27% above their average Bitcoin purchase price of $68,569. At the time of publication, the firm holds 555,450 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $57.23 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. Saylor is surprised at US government sentiment shift Spot Bitcoin ETFs posted $564.7 in inflows over the past five trading days, according to Farside data. Meanwhile, Saylor said he’s not surprised the US government hasn’t yet bought Bitcoin for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve which Trump signed an executive order for on March 7. The reserve is holding Bitcoin that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. However, Saylor didn’t anticipate their stance to quickly change so positively following Trump’s inauguration.

44403904,https://nulltx.com/?p=149383,1746845517,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Gaming Tokens in Crisis: Millions Raised, Now Worth Pennies",https://nulltx.com/gaming-tokens-in-crisis-millions-raised-now-worth-pennies/,"Once lauded as the future of digital entertainment, Web3 gaming now confronts a stark reality. Despite pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars during the crypto boom, many gaming tokens now trade at market caps far below what those projects initially raised. The discrepancy between the capital raised and current valuations has triggered a sobering reassessment across the GameFi sector. This is no longer a mere bear market decline but a severe market revaluation. Dislocated Valuations Reveal Market Disbelief Let’s look at the figures to see how disconcerting this disconnect has become. Look at how far apart the colors are in these bar graphs. They practically took my breath away during the last meeting when our head of research presented them. Here are some of the token names he used: • LUNA • FTX token • Solana • Internet Computer (ICP) • Toncoin • Filecoin • near (NEAR) • HT • BB • PHT $GUNZ: Collected $82M → Currently assessed at $36.2M $MYTH: Collected $281M → Now under evaluation at $115.3M $SIPHER: Collected $44M → Presently trading at a mere $5.2M $AVG: Collected $27.2M → Currently sitting around $800K $AURY: Collected $108.8M → Down to an evaluation of about $8.4M The numbers are not merely technical corrections—they indicate a failure of confidence. In numerous instances, token market caps have fallen to merely 3–12% of what was initially garnered. This chasm between hope and current appearance signifies more than just subpar token action—it speaks to an increasing doubt about the business models of certain GameFi projects. Although investors once readily supplied funds to any venture that promised gaming integrated with blockchain technology or ecosystems centered around NFTs, today’s market is much more discerning. And increasingly, that discernment is manifesting in the form of disappointing investment returns. Why the Collapse? A Combination of Structural and Market Forces Between 2021 and 2025, Web3 gaming had a seemingly endless string of excitement. VCs invested in Web3 gaming at a breakneck pace, driven by the belief that it would help bring to life visions of the “metaverse”—the virtual environment where most of our future digital lives will take place—and create a new economy that would make some games play-to-earn. Yet, these investments have yet to demonstrate the sort of returns that other, more traditional segments of the gaming industry have secured. Now dragging valuations down are a few core problems: Protracted Development: Creating games of the sort and quality that funders expect takes not just years but many years. Even was launched in December 2022, still struggles to engage its intended gamer demographic. Much of what came after 2021 seems to have lacked in even this basic respect. Holding Invested Users: Of the relatively few users who can bob by in daily active user status, the level of engagement across the portfolio is poor and shallow. Better player engagement is necessary to bring any portfolio game into a sustainably profitable state and/or justify a game’s crypto pay-to-play economics. Token Utility and Demand: A majority of the portfolio projects without a portfolio game have either a token or something like a token. Among these games, and the projects have few ways of either generating or purposing meaningful demand for these tokens. Gaming Tokens: Raised Millions, Now Worth Pennies ? A brutal truth for Web3 gaming market caps are collapsing far below what projects raised. Here's a breakdown pic.twitter.com/0RXf4dE2zC — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) May 9, 2025 The outcome? Efforts that have gathered nine-figure sums now confront the stark reality that tokens lacking product-market fit or genuine community engagement are just too risky to be seen as viable investment opportunities in today’s climate. A Critical Inflection Point for Web3 Gaming Dangerous feedback loops happen when a token’s market cap drops below the amount of total capital it has raised. This is what is happening, for instance, with Axie Infinity (AXS). ‘Liquidity dries up,’ CoinDesk explains in an article. ‘That makes it hard for traders to enter or exit. New investors are understandably wary about putting their money in something the market has already heavily discounted. Most critically, future token emissions—supposed to incentivize players or fuel game economies—become value-destructive when you already have such a market scenario.’ The token is instead an obstacle to growth. This mismatch between the raised capital and market cap reflects a deeper problem. The market loses faith in many Web3 games to convert capital into sustainable ecosystems. Their development seems really hard, and it might not be leading to any sustainable ecosystem the market wants. It raises a deeper question: Are any of these games the ones that will give Web3 its needed capital markets success? For creators, the caution is unmistakable: create captivating gameplay, provide genuine utility, or else run the very real risk of adding your name to a growing list of entities in a sector where expectations are high, but actual performance is low, and where it’s becoming clear that being in the metaverse isn’t enough. As investor forbearance wanes and token unlockings proceed apace, GameFi finds itself at a fork in the road. It can morph into something substantive—or it can serve up a cautionary tale of overcapitalized hype and underdelivering execution. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In only a few weeks, USD1—a stablecoin launched by @worldlibertyfi that is tied to the Trump-branded Liberty Finance movement—has shot up in adoption and market capitalization, becoming one of the most dominant forces on the BNB Chain. Trump-linked stablecoin takes over BNB Chain @worldlibertyfi stablecoin #USD1 has surged from $130M to over $2.12B in market cap since late April. $2.11B worth of #USD1 has been issued on the @BNBCHAIN , pushing the total stablecoin market cap there close to $10B. pic.twitter.com/dtUQmp0hfm — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 9, 2025 Here’s what you need to know about USD1 and its politically charged progenitor. Since late April, USD1’s market capitalization has skyrocketed from just $130 million to an eye-popping $2.12 billion, representing a more than 1,530% increase in less than a month. The authorities in charge of overseeing the growing world of digital assets have largely been caught flat-footed. BNB Chain Booms as USD1 Drives Capital Inflows Most of this action is happening directly on the BNB Chain, Binance’s native blockchain network. Of the $2.12 billion issued in USD stablecoins, a staggering $2.11 billion has been minted on the BNB Chain—funneled directly onto this layer-1 chain in the same way a stablecoin like USDC would work on Ethereum or Avalanche. This stablecoin issuance has pushed the total stablecoin market cap on BNB Chain close to $10 billion, with DAI, USDC, and BUSD serving as the main drivers behind that figure. The rise in stablecoin liquidity is likely to ignite fresh movement in decentralized finance (DeFi) on BNB Chain, pushing it past Ethereum and other Layer 2 platforms. Trader eyes are glued to the signs: DEX volume increases, liquidity pool growth, and on-chain staking activity. Early data suggests that use of USD1 across DeFi protocols is already well underway. How soon until this use becomes commonplace? And what might it mean for the DeFi sector if it does? USD1 is gaining a renewed interest from users who are looking for stable alternatives to the often volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Still, what really sets USD1 apart isn’t the stable value it offers, but rather its direct connection to the Liberty Finance initiative, which is aligned with former President Donald Trump. Trump-Linked Wallet Moves Millions into ETH and BTC A wallet thought to be linked to Liberty Finance has made some interesting purchases over the last 24 hours. It’s been picking up substantial amounts of both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Confirming through blockchain analytics the purchases of the wallet, we see that it obtained 1,587 WETH at an average price of $2,200, which represents approximately $3.49 million in Ether. It also acquired 9.7 WBTC at a price of $103,092, which brings the total to roughly $1 million in wrapped Bitcoin. Altogether, the wallet deployed $4.94 million in capital into these two leading crypto assets. These purchases have prompted questions about Liberty Finance’s operational strategy. Accumulating both WETH and WBTC at this moment in time conveys a message of confidence in the overall market and its long-term trajectory. In fact, their decision may point to Liberty’s ambition to build out a more robust “crypto infrastructure”—beyond the stablecoin realm.

The mix of financial usefulness and ideological appeal could entice a wide array of users. What’s Next for USD1 and Liberty Finance? Now, with USD1 firmly among the top stablecoins on BNB Chain by market capitalization, the important question is whether this momentum can be maintained. The success of a stablecoin depends not just on inflows of capital but also on ongoing adoption and integration, as well as on transparency. Liberty Finance seems to be setting itself up as both a financial and an ideological entity in the Web3 world. It’s not clear yet how this will play out. If the movement takes off, it could encourage the development of more financial products within Web3, making them accessible to a larger audience; but if the movement stalls or attracts a lot of regulatory scrutiny, it could have the opposite effect. USD1 has become a significant new player in the stablecoin sector. Its rapid growth might be the harbinger of a new phase in politically motivated financial infrastructure. As Liberty Finance enlarges its asset base and extends its reach, it can be expected to work in concert with other healthy financial actor—to the tune of billions, presumably—watching all the while for any signs that the federal regulatory apparatus has either blessed or cursed the new outfit.

44404027,https://nulltx.com/?p=149381,1746845721,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Coinbase Misses on Revenue, Beats on Volume as Strategic Bets Begin to Pay Off",https://nulltx.com/coinbase-misses-on-revenue-beats-on-volume-as-strategic-bets-begin-to-pay-off/,"The prominent crypto exchange in the United States, Coinbase , issued its Q1 2025 financial earnings this week. The company delivered a whole assortment of results that underscored its part as a player in a digital asset market that is maturing rapidly. While the company missed total revenue and earnings targets, it unearthed some gems in terms of trading volume increases and an expanding global footprint. For the first quarter of 2025, Coinbase registered total revenue of $2.03 billion, which is below the Street’s consensus of $2.2 billion. Transaction revenue, which is a key metric for the company, came in at $1.26 billion and missed the expectation of $1.33 billion. The good news was that subscription and services revenue has been increasing nicely and was up 37% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter to $698 million, just slightly below the expectation of $702.5 million. EPS adjusted were $0.24, which is a far cry from the target set by analysts of $2.09. The company remains strong, however, with an adjusted EBITDA of $930 million and a net income that certainly made its balance sheet look better at $66 million. Add in an adjusted net income of $527 million, and you clearly see the company standing tall and remaining very profitable despite going through some market dynamics that are swaying it back and forth. Trading Volume Strength and Strategic Growth Shape the Quarter Even though it missed revenue expectations, Coinbase showed impressive trading activity strength. The total trading volume came in at around $393 billion this past quarter—just slightly above what they were projecting ($392.7 billion). A phenomenal metric was the 49% increase in USDC balances in Coinbase products since the end of the previous quarter, now totaling $12.3 billion. This figure reflects a demand from our users for stablecoin-based services and suggests that the platform in general, including our lending business, is seeing more adoption of recently launched products using USDC. The trust from both retail and institutional users is increasing, as evidenced by our custody asset base growing to $212 billion, up $25 billion from last quarter. We are seeing much-improved regulatory clarity combined with a much-expanded set of service offerings. In the future, Coinbase projects subscription and service income to be between $600 million and $680 million for the second quarter of 2025. At the same time, the company expects underlying operating expenses (technology and general administration) to range from $700 million to $750 million. Sales and marketing expenses are projected to come in between $215 million and $315 million, but with the sale of actual transactions already projected to be $240 million for the month of April. $COIN | Coinbase Q1'5 Earnings Highlights Revenue: $2.03B (Est. $2.2B) Adj.

It announced a $2.9 billion acquisition of the crypto options exchange Deribit, structured in both cash and stock. This puts Coinbase in a dominant position in crypto options and futures, broadening its reach into more sophisticated trading products. In their press release, Coinbase emphasized that this acquisition aligns with their mission of “building the most secure and compliant trading venue in the world” and that they are now working on an “orderly integration plan” for Deribit. From a regulatory perspective, the company had a really major legal win when the SEC lawsuit that had been hanging over the company for quite some time was dismissed—”with prejudice,” no less. That was a huge hurdle the company had to face, and now it has investor confidence on board, too. The company registered internationally as well, with both Argentina and India now recognizing it as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP). Regulatory operations across the globe continue to expand. Coinbase’s long-term vision is primarily centered around product development. Initiatives in place, like the Base Layer 2 network—a blockchain scaling initiative—saw $4 billion in stablecoin balances this past quarter. The company also shafted new products into the ecosystem, among them, Flashblocks, a solution that utilizes Ethereum to enable finality of transactions in less than a second. At the same time, Coinbase continued its work scaling its other products, namely, Coinbase One Premium and Verified Pools, for retail and institutional customers, respectively. In addition, there was an external development that fit neatly with Coinbase’s strategy. A U.S. Executive Order was issued that formally established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Although this wasn’t a Direct hit for Coinbase, it was widely interpreted as a sign that the U.S. government was starting to recognize Bitcoin as an asset of sufficient quality that they might hold it in reserve, right alongside gold. Even though the miss on earnings could have some impact on sentiment in the near term, I think this could be an opportunity to accumulate shares in Coinbase. Why? Because I still believe that this company’s strategic long-term initiatives are positioning it much better in the space to lead well into the next era of cryptocurrency adoption.

44404063,https://nulltx.com/?p=149380,1746845812,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Massive Liquidations and Expired Options Shake Crypto Markets,https://nulltx.com/massive-liquidations-and-expired-options-shake-crypto-markets/,"In the last 24 hours, the crypto markets were shaken as a wave of liquidations swept through global exchanges. Nearly $1 billion in positions were wiped out, and digital asset trading was again shown to be highly volatile and risky, especially for those using leverage. According to Coinglass, 200,194 traders were liquidated in this turbulent period, and forced sell-offs across both long and short positions were caused by sharp price movements. According to Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, a total of 200,194 people were liquidated globally, with a total liquidation amount of $972 million. Of this, long positions accounted for $134 million in liquidations, while short positions accounted for $838 million. The largest… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 9, 2025 A truly astonishing total liquidation figure of $972 million. All we can do is watch. What’s particularly notable is the skew in liquidations: while $134 million came from long positions, a dominant $838 million was wiped from shorts. This suggests a strong upward price movement caught bears off guard, leading to a short squeeze that amplified the market’s momentum. The single largest liquidation took place on Binance and involved a position in BTCUSDT that was worth $11.97 million. This liquidation alone illustrates the dangers that traders who use high leverage are exposed to, especially when options are expiring and during surprise shifts in market direction. Options Expiry Adds Fuel to the Fire Liquidations weren’t the only thing causing a stir on Friday. We also had a hefty Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry event to contend with—one with a lot of open interest that was set to unwind and reconstitute the market landscape for June. A total of 26,000 Bitcoin options expired, with a notional value of about $2.67 billion. The Put/Call Ratio at expiration was 1.05. This suggests that at the very least, option holders weren’t terribly imbalanced and were probably OK with the current price level. However, the max pain point was calculated at $94,000, far above current prices. This highlights how option writers were betting on much higher prices, and that any aggressive hedging or attempted short squeezes could be moves to drive prices up toward the levels necessary for options sold to be profitable. Regarding Ethereum, 165,000 ETH options expired with an associated notional value of $360 million. The Put/Call Ratio was more skewed at 1.42, indicating a heavier bearish positioning leading up to the expiry. The max pain was recorded at $1,850, which lines up a bit better with the current price action of ETH. Market analysts note that many of the previously leading bearish positions have now been cleared out. This clearing of negative sentiment could set the stage for a more bullish posture heading into June, especially as data shows a rising percentage of bullish options in the upcoming month’s expiries. Often the expiry clean-up acts as a reset button for the market, recalibrating expectations and removing distortions caused by heavily skewed options positioning. With bearish pressure significantly reduced and many shorts already liquidated, market participants now watch closely for signs of sustainable bullish follow-through. Liquidations and expiries have increasingly become a common sight in the crypto derivatives landscape, where rising institutional participation and complex strategies can create cascading effects in volatile conditions. As more capital flows into perpetual futures, options, and structured products, the market’s sensitivity to these expiration cycles has intensified. 26,000 BTC options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 1.05, a max pain point of $94,000, and a notional value of $2.67 billion; 165,000 ETH options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 1.42, a max pain point of $1,850, and a notional value of $360 million. Previously high bearish… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 9, 2025 This in turn makes the effects of these combination events on the underlying crypto asset prices more pronounced. The takeaway is the same for investors and traders: leverage is a double-edged sword. And what we learned during this episode is that expiring products add another layer of risk to an already risky equation. This isn’t to say that trading with leverage is evil. All of us do it in one form or another, even when we don’t realize it. In the future, watch will be kept on the macroeconomic indicators, regulatory developments, and looming project milestones to ascertain whether this recent rally—ignited by short liquidations and option rollovers—has staying power or if we are looking at another reversal in the not-so-distant future.

44404149,https://nulltx.com/?p=149379,1746845907,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,NEAR Protocol Sees Developer Activity Surge Amid Breakthrough Upgrades,https://nulltx.com/near-protocol-sees-developer-activity-surge-amid-breakthrough-upgrades/,"NEAR Protocol is back in the news, but this time there is no speculation surrounding it. Instead, onlookers can see a definite increase in not just one, but several important indicators of NEAR’s growth. The newest indicator is on-chain developer activity, which comprehensively measures how much attention developers are paying to a given blockchain. After a few months of relatively quiet growth, in April NEAR’s on-chain developer activity experienced a major uptick and is clearly trending upwards. As of April, daily NEAR contract deployments surpassed 280 and were deploying contracts at a pace five times the rate of March’s average daily deployments. Even more remarkable is how this accelerated pace has effectively been locked in as a permanent level of development. NEAR’s developers not only seem to have ramped up the pace of deploying new contracts but also appear to be doing so with a starting point close to March’s levels. This again points to a kind of engagement that may just get deeper as we enter the second quarter. Contract deployments on @NEARProtocol quietly surged in April. After months of low activity, daily deployments spiked over 280 — a 5x jump from the March average. Sustained volume followed throughout the month. Momentum like this usually doesn’t happen by accident. pic.twitter.com/xcaZw1U77c — Nansen (@nansen_ai) May 9, 2025 When it comes to this sort of ongoing effort, there is usually a good reason. And NEAR has had a very good reason for putting its head down and doing the work necessary to quietly roll out some of the most sophisticated architectural upgrades to be found anywhere in the blockchain world—upgrades that are starting to pay the network real dividends in the form of greater developer interest and ecosystem expansion. Nightshade 2.0 and Stateless Validation Set a New Benchmark A recent spike in NEAR’s community growth has emerged, spurred the by the Nightshade 2.0 update. This major improvement to NEAR’s sharding model significantly increased scalability, increasing its transaction throughput by four times while reducing costs for developers. Nightshade 2.0 massively optimized the way shards communicate with each other while executing transactions in parallel and allows for a much faster and more efficient data processing across the whole network. This update seems to have brought NEAR back in the spotlight, attracting community and developer interest. Another critical breakthrough in NEAR’s architecture is called stateless validation. It is a new feature that dramatically lowers the resource requirements for validators, which allows many more people to run validator nodes. Traditionally, validators must store the entire state of the blockchain, an expensive and technically demanding requirement. With NEAR’s approach, validators can now participate in consensus without retaining full network data. These upgrades together signal a substantial advancement in blockchain infrastructure and make NEAR a more tempting and accessible target for developers looking to build high-throughput applications. Improved User Experience Through Ethereum Compatibility and Chain Signatures Although the improvements that NEAR has made to its back end are truly remarkable, the platform has also directed its attention to improving user experience. A comparatively recent change that NEAR has made that dramatically increases that user experience is full compatibility with Ethereum wallets, such as MetaMask. Now, users of Ethereum can move directly into NEAR’s decentralized applications without having to create any new wallet or to figure out NEAR’s user interface. This change seems to be a significant push towards making NEAR more accessible. Complementing this is the enforcement of Chain Signatures, a powerful instrument that streamlines cross-chain account access. By using Chain Signatures, users can better function across multiple blockchain networks with a single account—removing the confusion and inconvenience of getting to your account across different wallets and keys on different chains. This makes cross-chain dApp access much more pleasant for the user; it’s uniformly easier to do so when all that must be navigated are Layer 1 and Layer 2 environments. NEAR Protocol's 2025 Tech Breakthroughs: NEAR Protocol has kicked off 2025 with powerful innovations that push the boundaries of blockchain performance and usability. Stateless Validation & Chain Signatures: NEAR now enables validators to participate without storing the full… pic.twitter.com/dDNB40QT6T — IBRAHIM (@M1sterIbrahim) May 9, 2025 Developer Attention Returns as NEAR Reinforces Its Technical Edge The April contract deployment surge is more than a number. It’s an indicator. It’s developers once again focusing on NEAR, and for good reason. We have tools now that open up accessible scalability and efficiency in contrast to the way decentralized applications used to work. Those tools make us rethink NEAR as a Layer 1 that can not only match Ethereum or Solana in performance but can also actually be used by regular people in a way that seems impossible with other programmable blockchains. Among the places that hype too often overshadows substance, NEAR is emerging as a beacon where deep technical innovation and long-term planning pay off in the delivery of actual results. As 2025 unfolds, the next challenge for NEAR is maintaining this momentum, continuing to attract a devoted allegiance among developers, and building real utility on top of its freshly upgraded infrastructure. If the present trend holds, NEAR might very well be creating the stage for its most impactful year yet. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Ethereum (ETH) is preparing for a major upgrade that could push its price toward $2,104, while Cosmos (ATOM) is aiming for a long-term target of $57. Both projects bring powerful features to the table, yet still face ongoing concerns around scalability, trust, and centralized control. With a focus on real transparency and on-chain accountability, Unstaked ($UNSD) was built to give users full control over their data and activity through a secure, decentralized structure. For those searching for the best crypto for the future, Unstaked’s verifiable, user-first approach sets it apart from hype-driven competitors. Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade Sets $2,104 in Sight Ethereum (ETH) is preparing for its Pectra Upgrade, scheduled for May 7, which introduces critical improvements to its staking model. The highlight is EIP-7251, which raises the validator cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. This change aims to boost validator participation, streamline operations for larger stakeholders, and reinforce the network’s overall security and decentralization. Despite its promise, Ethereum’s upgrade history includes delays and rollout issues. A smooth deployment could push ETH toward the $2,104 mark, but any hiccups may spark short-term volatility. Still, with its broad DApp and DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum remains one of the best crypto projects to watch. Cosmos Eyes Long-Term Growth with $57 Projection Cosmos (ATOM) continues to build its identity as the “Internet of Blockchains,” enabling seamless interoperability between independent networks through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. The Tendermint-powered architecture offers scalability and security for decentralized apps, with analysts forecasting a price surge toward $57 by 2031 as adoption grows. Still, Cosmos must navigate an increasingly competitive market. New blockchains boasting faster speeds and lower fees threaten its edge. Additionally, decentralized governance across multiple chains makes coordination more complex. While the Cosmos (ATOM) outlook remains strong, long-term growth depends on continual upgrades and unified community development. Unstaked Presale Goes Viral – Over $3.1M Raised While Ethereum and Cosmos chase scalability and interoperability, Unstaked is setting a new standard for blockchain security and transparency. At a time when many projects rely on vague promises and centralized controls, Unstaked is delivering a platform where every action is verifiable, recorded, and user-controlled. Priced at just $0.00776 in Stage 7 of its presale, Unstaked has already raised over $3.1 million, with a projected launch price of $0.1819, offering a potential 28x upside. Unstaked’s model centers around blockchain-recorded AI activity. Every task performed by its autonomous agents, on Telegram, X, and soon Discord, is written directly on-chain. From message automation to task execution, the transparency ensures no manipulation, no hidden processes, and full accountability at every level. It’s a security-first structure where function and integrity are permanently aligned. Adding to this is Unstaked’s wallet-first login system. Unlike centralized apps that store sensitive data on external servers, Unstaked users control their access, assets, and identity entirely through their Web3 wallets. This dramatically reduces the risks of breaches or unauthorized data access, making the platform both secure and user-centric. Governance further empowers the community. $UNSD holders shape protocol decisions through proposals and voting. This decentralized model ensures Unstaked evolves through consensus, not central authority, making it one of the best crypto for the future. Key Takeaways Ethereum and Cosmos continue to push forward with ambitious upgrades and long-term price goals, but their reliance on centralized development teams leaves users with limited control over core changes. Unstaked breaks from this model entirely, offering a secure, transparent ecosystem where users manage their assets through a wallet-first login system. But what truly sets Unstaked ($UNSD) apart is its decentralized governance. Token holders shape the platform’s evolution by voting on proposals and decisions. For those seeking the best crypto for the future, Unstaked delivers both control and security in one package.

New Bitcoin Whales Have Cost Basis Around $91,900 In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed how the Realized Price compares between the two major sides of the whale cohort on the Bitcoin network. The “Realized Price” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition level of the average investor in the BTC market. When the value of this metric is above the spot price of the asset, it means the holders as a whole are carrying a net unrealized loss. Similarly, the indicator being under the coin’s value suggests the dominance of profit among the investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver’s Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows In the context of the current topic, the Realized Price of the entire sector isn’t of interest, but rather that of two specific investor cohorts: the short-term holder and long-term holder whales. The short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs) make up the two main divisions of the BTC network based on the basis of holding time. All investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days are put into the STHs, while those who surpass this threshold mature into the LTHs. The STHs and LTHs of focus here aren’t just any ordinary investors, but rather the “whales,” entities who are carrying more than 1,000 BTC ($103.3 million) in their balance. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price for the STH and LTH whales over the past few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Price of the whales who got in during the past 155 days stands at $91,900 at the moment. With BTC’s recent recovery rally, the spot price has gained a notable distance above this line, so the cohort should be comfortably in the green now. That said, their situation is nowhere near as good as that of the veteran whales, who have their cost basis at just $32,200. This indicates that there is a spread of a whopping 185% between the bottom line of the two groups. According to the analyst, this indicates a growing confidence and FOMO among the investors, which is driving them to buy at even the recent high prices. This trend is in sharp contrast to the 2022 bear market, where the difference between the cost basis of the two groups fell to just 65%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resistance Limited Beyond $100,000, On-Chain Data Suggests It now remains to be seen whether demand from the new whales will continue to be strong in the near future, potentially driving up the spread between the cohorts further.

One project that has people talking is $BNKR ($BNKR), the token affiliated with the DeFi effort known as BankrBot. $BNKR has enjoyed a growth spurt that is almost beyond belief, adding an astounding 13,000 new holders in just the last week to bring its total holder count to a staggering 89,700. That puts it in a league well above most of the other tokens in the DeFi space, where the average is about 42,500 holders. So, what’s behind all this excitement, and how long might it last? $BNKR is about to flip $CLANKER and it’s super interesting to watch. $CLANKER ($28M mc): multiple team members, listed on Coinbase, nearly $30M sitting idle in the vault. $BNKR ($26.5M mc): came out of $CLANKER, solo dev, gained momentum on X with Grok coins and an actual… — Kien Nguyen (@KienNguyen_NFT) May 9, 2025 The response is based on a number of factors: the debut of the OK Computers NFT, a burgeoning wave of interest surrounding the project, and the pledge of a real working DeFi product. Let’s dissect the ongoings with $BNKR and see why it might soon be neck and neck with $CLANKER ($CLANKER) as the leading edge of conversation in DeFi. The $BNKR Surge: Unprecedented Growth and the Potential for Even More BNKR was most recently at the $BNKR world’s holders surge in holders is something we most deem bullish. With a sub $27 million market cap, I think most people would agree that it seems like we could just be overachieving expectations in this space to now have $BNKR in any near mainstream conversation. Largely, this seems to have come from the most recent NFT drop with the OK Computers; and boy, did that one seemingly drop as well. I would think the lead into that drop, all the engagement and attention from this space should have us set up to keep that vibe going from here. When we examine $BNKR’s growth in comparison to that of its competitor $CLANKER, the contrast is clear. With a market cap of $28 million, $CLANKER has a team that is not only much larger but also far more experienced and better established. $CLANKER is even listed on Coinbase, one of the top exchange platforms. By all typical measures, $CLANKER should be outpacing $BNKR. Still, in something of a curious case, $BNKR has recently been achieving a markedly higher rate of growth than $CLANKER. A notable point here is that $BNKR arose from $CLANKER, and, although it is an indie project rather than a large-team effort, it is building on the growing momentum of its predecessor. The big differentiator is that $BNKR already has an actual working DeFi product in the market—a key element in this industry for long-term success. Countless projects in our space claim to be the next big thing but don’t deliver. $BNKR is committed to proving such a functionality over hype point. In addition, $BNKR has been making gains on X (formerly Twitter) propelled by the launch of Grok Coins, which has generated a lot of buzz in the DeFi community. This is an obvious sign that $BNKR’s ecosystem is not just being noticed but also being actively participated in by users—something that is crucial for the lifeline of any crypto project. Could Coinbase Listing Push $BNKR Into the $100M Market Cap Club? One of the biggest questions surrounding $BNKR is whether it will be able to follow in the footsteps of other DeFi tokens and land a listing on big exchanges like Coinbase. Right now, $BNKR isn’t on Coinbase or any other big exchange, and its growth is all organic, with community-driven development and product deployment. If Coinbase were to list $BNKR, the token could rally like crazy, sending its market cap north of $100 million. It cannot be said strongly enough how important exchange listings are. When a project gets a listing on a major exchange, it often sees its liquidity and visibility boosted significantly. Then that project is even more conveniently positioned as it continues its adoption by retail and institutional investors in the crypto space. Should $BNKR land a listing on the Coinbase exchange, it is likely that the liquidity, visibility, and adoption fountain will be opened widely for it. In addition, because the $BNKR project’s special market position allows it to have an active working product and organic growth, it can leverage this potential listing to go well past the $100 million market cap threshold. Should it do so, $BNKR would surely be one of the most exciting DeFi projects of 2025 and beyond. The Future Looks Bright for $BNKR In summary, $BNKR has managed to build significant momentum. This could change the DeFi landscape. They are not yet in the universe of serious DeFi players, but you have to give them credit for actual achievement and the growth of their community. $BNKR has a working product. Their DeFi product, by the way, is different from those of most other DeFi players we cover. It is not a lending/borrowing platform. It is still unknown whether major exchanges such as Coinbase will list $BNKR. However, the project’s momentum seems almost inevitable, leading us to consider the wider crypto community’s attention as an end that’s already in sight. Investors and DeFi enthusiasts should watch $BNKR closely. We might witness its growth outpacing that of many larger competitors, and even faster than we’re accustomed to seeing for new market entrants. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While top names catch headlines, Web3 ai is steadily preparing for the long run, not just chasing short-term gains. Web3 ai has become a standout choice because it focuses on building useful AI-powered tools that go far beyond temporary trends. Its system serves practical needs, from smart trading alerts and portfolio tools to fraud detection. What’s drawing early interest is its long-term vision: Web3 ai is not just made for 2025; it’s shaped for what’s coming in 2026. A $100 purchase in the first batch could grow to $1847 by the time of listing, even before using any platform tools. Web3 ai Is Engineering the Next Phase of Crypto: Analysts Eye 1747% ROI Instead of aiming for quick gains in this cycle, Web3 ai is laying the foundation for the next one. While many AI coins chase trending headlines, this project is developing an entire stack. It includes trading bots, risk assessors, predictive ROI engines, and on-chain signal trackers. This isn’t just trend-following, it’s a full setup to take control of what’s ahead. That’s why early entries are already taking action. The $WAI coin powers the whole platform, used for insights, voting, and access features. It isn’t made for holding and waiting, but for real usage. As more users come on board, demand grows. Whether you’re a beginner or skilled at trading, the tools work seamlessly across centralized and decentralized exchanges, covering multiple blockchains. The presale is currently in its 3rd stage, priced at $0.000331. Buyers are rushing as the final batch hits $0.003267, with a public launch price of $0.005242. That means if you joined at stage one, you’re looking at a 1747% ROI, without even counting the platform’s future growth. Reflecting market confidence, the presale has raised more than $2 million in record time. For those looking at the top crypto in 2025, skipping early batches might mean missing easy gains. What sets Web3 ai apart is how it’s shifting AI excitement into solid, lasting features. With each presale stage, the price gets higher, and early support means bigger returns. Ethereum (ETH) Upgrade Postponed as Pectra Nears New Ethereum (ETH) updates reveal that the Pectra upgrade, originally expected to include EOF adjustments, will no longer feature them. These changes are now scheduled for the Fusaka release later in the year. This limits major technical shifts in the near term. Pectra will instead offer upgrades like support for USDC gas payments and increased validator slots. The real structural overhaul will arrive with Fusaka, which is set to introduce full EOF and redesign contract execution methods. This is important as Ethereum faces rising performance issues and slowing protocol earnings. Some big players, like Galaxy Digital and Paradigm, have already trimmed their ETH positions. This shows that while ETH remains active, newer projects could gain ground due to this hesitation. XRP Price Climbs on XRPFi and ETF Announcements XRP has surged beyond $2.30, thanks to excitement around the April 29 launch of XRPFi from Flare Networks. This new tool brings staking and DeFi functions to XRP using an FXRP wrapper, adding capabilities that weren’t available through its original system. The network will run on Flare’s oracles, which supply real-time pricing and support for liquid staking. The rise continues with ProShares confirming the release of three XRP futures ETFs, including leveraged and short versions. These updates, paired with the launch of Flare’s system, are giving XRP more function and greater market reach. Traders are monitoring $2.40 and $2.55 as possible limits, while a drop below $2.20 could suggest a move back to $2.00. For now, data hints that buyers are still active. Final Remarks! Ethereum is facing delays, and XRP is getting a lift from new DeFi features. But while these shifts respond to current market pressures, Web3 ai is working beyond those conditions. With smart contract scanners, trading prediction engines, and live market trackers, this platform is set for where crypto is heading next. It’s this approach that makes Web3 ai more than just another AI name in crypto. With 50 presale stages starting from $0.0003 and a launch price of $0.005242, the earliest buyers could see gains of 1747%. That means a $100 buy-in could grow to $1847 at listing, and that doesn’t count future platform development. Anyone watching the top bullish crypto trends for 2025 should consider that skipping Web3 ai might mean leaving serious growth behind.

As the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin has lately experienced a surge of new wallet creations, a renewed uptick in its dominance, and, more generally, an impressive show of renewed investor interest and confidence. All this has led some observers to suggest that, at the moment, a rather pronounced and palpable sentiment shift is taking place. Bitcoin's network saw 344,620 new wallets be created on its network as FOMO poured in. Crypto's top market cap asset has silenced bears, reaching a high of $103.8K for the first time since January. pic.twitter.com/hai245lQJz — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 9, 2025 On May 8, the price of Bitcoin shot up to $103.8K, its highest since January 2025. This sharp price increase was accompanied by an unprecedented wave of excitement that led to the creation of 344,620 new wallets on the Bitcoin network in just a few days. This surge reflects the ever-growing demand for Bitcoin from a diverse group of investors, as the asset continues its robust upward trend. Right now, it’s Bitcoin’s market dominance that investors seem most interested in. At over 60 percent, it’s approaching levels last seen in early 2021. Bitcoin’s Market Dominance Soars as Investor Confidence Builds The current trend in Bitcoin’s price is a mirror of the growing investor faith that is being placed in the cryptocurrency. After spending several months in limbo, Bitcoin has come roaring back as the premier asset for crypto aficionados. Its resurgence to market dominance is the clearest indication of this newfound enthusiasm. The cryptocurrency’s dominance is now sitting above 60%, which is a pretty significant occurrence. Essentially, it means that more and more investors are looking to Bitcoin as the most reliable option in a sea of digital tokens. In contrast, at 2024’s onset, Bitcoin’s dominance wobbled around 40%, which seems almost laughable considering today’s numbers. To see it climb to over 60% is honestly unexpected and almost magical in how it illustrates the shift toward Bitcoin’s appearing to be the standard against which other cryptocurrencies are measured. Altcoins, on the other hand, seem to be showing increased volatility, which is making Bitcoin’s price stability and network activity look reassuring to those worried about the digital gold appearing to be a hedge against such volatility. Bitcoin’s price hike to $103.8K, which is its highest since January, has been credited to much the same kind of institutional interest that has led to price increases in traditional assets. Mini surges have taken place this year during the kinds of special events that intrigue crypto traders. One such occurrence was a “halving” in May, when the reward for mining a new Bitcoin was cut in half. As Bitcoin’s price goes up, it continues to draw more and more attention from both individuals and institutions as a seemingly viable storage method for long-term, value-preserving assets. A Surge in Active Users and Institutional Interest The Bitcoin network is not only witnessing new wallet creations but also experiencing a rise in daily activity. The average number of daily active Bitcoin addresses exceeded 817,000 this week, failing to achieve that level since last December. This apparent uptick in activity signifies that many more individuals are not just holding onto Bitcoin but are also partaking in network transactions. The average number of daily active Bitcoin addresses surpassed 817k this week, the highest level since December of last year pic.twitter.com/npge6cUYlL — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 9, 2025 Also, the cryptocurrency’s much-more-than-before allure to gigantic investors is evident in the stupendous inflow seen in Bitcoin spot ETFs. On the 8th day of May (the year 2023), Bitcoin spot ETFs registered a net inflow of 117 million U.S. dollars, which is a signal that financially traditional institutions and big whale investors are very interested in the prospect of Bitcoin. This obvious growth in participation by such high-profile investors is an indication of something: the long-term prospects of Bitcoin seem to be much better, with more and more big entities backing it. Bitcoin possesses reliable network fundamentals, an established presence among institutional investors, and growing interest among retail investors. These factors combine to enhance its reputation as the leading cryptocurrency. While some observers still regard it as an experimental asset, a growing number of investment professionals, including those working for large pension funds and hedge funds, consider it a “mainstream” alternative to cash. On May 8, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $117 million. Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $16.11 million, marking three consecutive days of net outflows. https://t.co/SF4brkkBta — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 9, 2025 Looking Ahead: Bitcoin’s Long-Term Bullish Outlook Many analysts see Bitcoin as a winner in the long run. They consider its burgeoning network, the rising confidence of all types of investors, and even its recent bump in institutional adoption to be almost crypto-favorable developments. They’ve painted a nice picture of all that combining into something almost ‘sunny’ for Bitcoin: it’s reaching new all-time highs, enjoying its highest level of market dominance (more than 50 percent) since 2021. Even if the wider crypto market is still fluctuating, the very fundamentals of Bitcoin do seem solid. Its network effects are as powerful as ever, the elementary law of supply and demand dictates a price very much above where it currently is, and more and more Bitcoin seems to be finding a home in traditional finance. If anything, the use case for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation seems to be gaining steam. And investor sentiment appears to be carrying it upward. To sum up, not only has Bitcoin’s recent showing managed to hush bearish voices, but it has also demonstrated that this cryptocurrency has resilience and appeal in a rapidly changing market. It is not only surviving but also growing in popularity. Indeed, the near-term future of Bitcoin looks very bright, with sustained growth in wallet creations, daily activity, and inflows from institutions. Investors and enthusiasts are watching closely and with good reason because this cryptocurrency’s potential is far from being fully tapped. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Data from DeFi analytics firm SentoraHQ shows that over the past 24 hours, exchange outflows of Ethereum have reached a staggering $559 million. This increase in outflows fits right in with Ethereum’s price rally that it’s on as we speak, with its price hitting above $2,300 recently—meaning the asset is now up over 20% just from yesterday to today. ETH has surged past $2,300, up more than 20% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Abraxas Capital continues to accumulate, withdrawing 61,401 $ETH ($116.3M) from exchanges over the last 2 days. https://t.co/ObH6pw7cwd pic.twitter.com/cKk7K8ZXe0 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 9, 2025 The recent increase in price and outflows shows that the market is shifting, with investors now casting their votes in favor of Ethereum’s long-term vision. The uptick in ETH’s price has not only gained the attention of everyday investors but has also drawn the eyes of big-name institutions. These organizations are now starting to custody ETH themselves—means to an end that, in Ethereum’s view, further hashes out the network’s future value. Ethereum exchange outflows reach $559M amid price rally Ethereum $ETH has seen accelerating exchange outflows for the third straight week, driven by its ongoing price surge, according to DeFi analytics firm @SentoraHQ on X (formerly IntoTheBlock). About $559 million worth of ETH… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) May 9, 2025 Abraxas Capital Takes a Bold Step, Increasing its Ethereum Holdings A very important event in the Ethereum market has been the accumulation of ETH by institutional investors, especially Abraxas Capital. Just in the last two days, the firm has taken an impressive 138,511 ETH, worth about $297 million, off exchanges. This appears to be a not-so-subtle way of signaling its intent to hold more Ethereum in the sort of context that makes one think it’s just waiting for the price to go up before it’s yet again returning to more modern investment strategies. Massive $ETH accumulation! Abraxas Capital has withdrawn 138,511 $ETH ($297M) from exchanges in the past 2 days. https://t.co/scgYjuISN0 pic.twitter.com/Dvtr1IIubS — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 9, 2025 Large-scale withdrawals from Abraxas are just one obvious reversal of a much-discussed institutional accumulation trend. This accumulation trend has seen a growing number of large entities, especially in the U.S., buying up not only Bitcoin (BTC) but also a quite surprising amount of Ethereum (ETH), all in these past few months. Ethereum ETFs Face Outflows, but Price Rally Continues In spite of the favorable Ethereum price rally, the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have encountered some difficulties. On May 8, Ethereum spot ETFs endured a net outflow totaling $16.11 million, which was the ETFs’ third consecutive day of outflows. Now, those numbers might cause one to raise an eyebrow in concern. A declining asset under management is, after all, a sign of something being undesirable. On May 8, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $117 million. Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $16.11 million, marking three consecutive days of net outflows. https://t.co/SF4brkkBta — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 9, 2025 Indeed, the outflows could be a reflection of changing investor strategies. As Ethereum’s price keeps climbing, it’s likely that a number of investors are moving in the direction of direct holding methods that provide more control and security. This might mean self-custodying or moving Ethereum to a staking arrangement where it’s earning interest-yielding rewards. Notably, this trend matches the broader pattern of Ethereum outflows from exchanges, as holders aim to sidestep any price-dipping disaster that could occur if the Ethereum in question is simply parked on an exchange. Moreover, the price of Ethereum keeps on climbing despite ETF outflows, and this suggests that investor sentiment around Ethereum is still quite solid. Once again, the price has now transcended the $2,300 mark, making this the highest that Ethereum has reached in 2023, and it’s continued to do really well relative to everyone’s expectations. Most of the confidence around Ethereum’s price rally is based on how well the network is expected to perform in the near term, particularly with big events like its full transition to Ethereum 2.0 later this year and with the adoption of its Layer 2 solutions. The Bigger Picture: Ethereum’s Growing Strength Ethereum’s sustained price rally and record exchange outflows show increasing trust in the network’s future. With market dominance right alongside Bitcoin’s, Ethereum is staking out a place as the go-to blockchain for not just decentralized applications but also the sorts of “smart contracts” that, in theory at least, could make things like computerized financial derivatives work. An enormous developer ecosystem makes at least some of us think at least some of the time that there’s something really, really valuable in all this. The Ethereum network has already displayed virtuous technology over the years, and its advancements—like Ethereum 2.0, for instance—along with the increasingly unidirectional adoption of Layer 2 solutions—like, say, Optimism—give further cause for optimism. Investors are betting on these unidirectional long-term improvements, transferring Ether off centralized exchanges—on which it has been exposed to as much as 80% downside risk in the event of a hack or insolvency—and into their unsecured crypto wallets. Ethereum is still building on its successes. Rising prices and accumulation by institutions are taking Ethereum to a significant next level of development. In terms of both technological and market performance, Ethereum is now assured for a promising future. With a combination of price action and accumulation by institutions, Ethereum is now solidifying its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. And it is not going anywhere: unlike the first assembly of Bitcoin forks in 2017, which mostly withered away, Ethereum is a blockchain ecosystem that maintains a strong, secure position. To conclude, the latest spike in exchange outflows—and a recent price rally—gives Ethereum a shiny new outlook. These price moves seem to have been driven mainly by buying from institutions and a heightened level of confidence from retail investors. With these two types of players now being much more involved in the Ethereum space, it seems quite likely that Ethereum will be able to maintain its upwards price trajectory well into the next several months.

Here Are The Best Cryptos To Buy Now Before Altcoin Season,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/has-bitcoin-dominance-topped-here-are-the-best-cryptos-to-buy-now-before-altcoin-season/,"Bitcoin ‘s price is rising again and investors everywhere are wondering: What’s the best altcoin to buy now before the next alt season kicks off? Sure, Bitcoin is still king, but seasoned crypto enthusiasts know the real excitement and often the biggest gains come from spotting promising altcoins early. One name that’s buzzing right now is Remittix (RTX) , a fresh project still in presale that has already raised over $14.8 million and is gearing up for its exchange debut. Alongside established players like Bitcoin , Solana and SUI , Remittix offers a compelling opportunity for investors looking to ride the next crypto wave. Remittix – Is the best looking for the future Remittix (RTX) isn’t just another crypto project, it’s positioning itself at the forefront of the PayFi revolution. What exactly is PayFi, you ask? It’s the intersection of crypto and traditional fiat payment systems and Remittix is bridging that gap beautifully. Imagine sending cross-border payments instantly, cheaply and without hidden fees. That’s the Remittix promise. While Bitcoin is great as digital gold and Solana and SU I are busy building scalable dApp ecosystems, Remittix is laser-focused on the massive $250 trillion cross-border payments market. This clear, practical use case gives Remittix a unique edge and enormous growth potential. What is Remittix and how does it work? At its core, Remittix is an innovative payment network that seamlessly connects crypto to traditional fiat banking systems. Users can instantly convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currency, sending it directly to any global bank account. The recipient doesn’t even need to know crypto was involved, they simply see a regular bank transfer. For businesses, Remittix offers the Remittix Pay API, allowing merchants to accept crypto payments and receive fiat currency straight into their bank accounts. With support for over 30 fiat currencies and 50+ crypto pairs, businesses have complete flexibility and control. And if security is your concern (as it should be!), rest easy: Remittix has passed a thorough SolidProof audit with flying colors. Bitcoin – Setting market trends Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and it often leads market trends. Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency that allows peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. It’s a favorite store of value among investors. Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $108,786 in January and then its price fell to $76,329 in April. It recently jumped to around $103,000, up around 7% in the last 7 days. Bitcoin’ s price movements typically set the tone for the entire crypto market. When Bitcoin consolidates, altcoins often follow suit. Image source: CoinGecko Solana – Known for speed Solana (SOL) is known for fast transactions and minimal fees. It’s a popular choice for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi projects and NFTs. Currently priced around $167, Solana is often considered Ethereum’s biggest rival. Its rapid growth has made it stand out in the altcoin community and investors are watching closely to see if it can sustain its momentum. Image source: CoinGecko SUI – Onboarding users into Web3 SUI is a newer Layer 1 blockchain explicitly designed to onboard the next billion users into Web3. With a focus on high throughput, low latency and a developer-friendly programming model, SUI aims to become a go-to platform for decentralized apps. Currently priced around $4.00, SUI is still in its early days. It has already attracted attention for its ambitious goals and strong backing. Remittix price prediction Remittix (RTX) is still in its presale phase, offering investors an attractive entry price before it hits exchanges. Historically, presales provide the best opportunities for significant returns. Given Remittix’s clear use case in the enormous cross-border payments market, its robust security credentials and practical utility, it has the potential to grow. Unlike more speculative assets, Remittix’s value is tied directly to adoption and real-world usage, potentially making it less volatile than Bitcoin, Solana or SUI in the long run. RTX could see impressive price appreciation once it hits exchanges and starts gaining traction. What are the best altcoins to buy now ? With Bitcoin’ s dominance signaling a maturing crypto market, investors are eagerly hunting for the best altcoins to buy now . While Bitcoin , Solana and SUI each offer unique strengths, Remittix (RTX) stands out with its practical application in the massive global payments industry.

As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $102,922, up 3.5% on the day and just 5.2% shy of its all-time high of $109,000 recorded in January. The latest push above this critical psychological threshold marks a renewed phase of bullish market behavior, following weeks of range-bound trading between $93,000 and $98,000. Related Reading: Massive Buy Pressure Hits Binance as Bitcoin Reclaims $100,000 Short Liquidation Clusters Ignite Rally According to insights shared by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha, the recent rally has been driven in part by a sequence of short liquidation events on Binance. These events not only removed downward pressure from the market but also flipped the derivatives funding market, signaling a possible change in trader sentiment. Taha explained that a large cluster of short positions had accumulated in recent days, creating conditions ripe for a squeeze. Taha noted that the first key liquidation occurred at the $97,000 level, where a large number of short positions were wiped out, totaling approximately $360 million. Traders had positioned themselves for a local top, but instead, BTC broke through this zone, triggering a cascade of short covers and forced liquidations. This resulted in a rapid price acceleration as sellers were pushed to close their positions. Shortly after this surge, the price consolidated below the $101,000 mark, where another dense cluster of short interest had formed. This acted as a magnet for a second liquidation wave. When BTC breached $101,000, nearly $240 million in shorts were liquidated, contributing to a breakout that pushed the price toward $104,000. Data from liquidation heatmaps highlighted both $97,000 and $101,000 as high-liquidity targets, reinforcing the narrative that these were calculated liquidation sweeps. Bitcoin Funding Rate Shift Signals Bullish Sentiment The impact of these events extended beyond spot price movement. Taha pointed to Binance’s funding rate chart, showing that prior to the liquidation events, the funding rate was negative, a reflection of bearish bias among traders who were paying to maintain short positions. Following the twin liquidation waves, the funding rate flipped to +0.01%, a key signal that demand for long exposure was increasing. This transition from negative to positive funding is often interpreted as a shift in market structure, from bear-dominated to bull-dominated sentiment. It suggests that many traders now expect further upside, at least in the near term.

XRP is holding attention for a breakout, and Aave’s new buyback plan has sparked cautious interest, but there’s something else catching attention. Projects offering real usability and tools, like Web3 ai , are changing how people engage with digital assets, offering more than just watching prices go up and down. While many cryptos rely mainly on price movements, Web3 ai offers real-time AI-powered tools, including automated trade support and advanced risk analysis. For anyone checking out the best crypto to invest in now, utility might be the smarter focus than price charts. XRP Forecast: Can Sideways Trading Lead to a Summer Push? With XRP trading close to $2.10 and moving between $2.05 and $2.23, the current pattern shows tight consolidation. Flat MACD indicators and the coin’s position near the 50-period EMA suggest calm trading, a condition that sometimes hints at bigger changes ahead. Forecast opinions remain split. Some analysts see a breakout coming in July, following past seasonal patterns, while others, like Peter Brandt, warn of a possible 50% drop in XRP’s market cap by late 2025 if sellers take control. What happens next largely depends on whether XRP can hold or break key levels. Rising above $2.23 could see targets of $2.35 and $2.48. However, slipping below $2.05 may signal deeper dips toward $1.93 or even $1.84. Aave (AAVE) Update: DAO Backs Major $50M Buyback Aave has made a major move with its $50 million buyback, a step that reflects strong support from its DAO. This strategic effort, widely approved by the community, has stirred renewed interest as more users accumulate AAVE. The buyback signals a push for better liquidity and long-term support for the token’s role within the protocol. On-chain activity also reveals growing wallet usage, rising interest from retail and institutional circles. Planned in phases to reduce market shocks, this buyback is part of a broader plan to keep AAVE stable and sustainable. With treasury management at the core, Aave’s governance is playing a central role in shaping its financial direction.

The latest XRP price forecast reveals a bullish five-wave pattern that could push the token toward $6.30 by year-end. Meanwhile, VanEck’s Binance Coin (BNB) Spot ETF filing is sparking fresh excitement around institutional demand. If it’s approved, BNB could see a surge toward mainstream adoption. But it’s not just XRP and BNB stealing the spotlight; BlockDAG’s (BDAG) Buyer Battles are turning heads too! The daily frenzy to grab leftover coins from a 25 million BDAG pool has created non-stop action, pushing presale totals past $231.5 million. It’s a thrilling time for both retail traders and presale analysts watching this momentum unfold! XRP Eyes $6.30: A Bullish Setup That Could Shape 2025 The latest XRP price forecast from analyst Dark Defender is sparking interest, with a bullish five-wave pattern pointing to a possible $6.30 by the end of 2025. After recently bouncing off the $2.13 support level, XRP could make a short-term push to $2.80, followed by a slight pullback to $2.30. From there, a stronger third wave could drive XRP past the 2017 high of $3.80. The final waves of the cycle are expected to bring it closer to that $6.30 target. Of course, this forecast relies on favorable market conditions, but if support levels hold, there’s real potential for significant upside. It’s a pattern worth keeping an eye on as things unfold. What VanEck’s BNB Spot ETF Filing Means for Its Future Traders are closely watching the recent VanEck filing for a Binance Coin (BNB) Spot ETF in the U.S., coming just days after the company’s CEO met with Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. This move is significant, as VanEck already manages approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. If the BNB Spot ETF gets the green light, it could open the door for institutional investors to access BNB legally, potentially boosting its price. BNB has already bounced back from previous losses, holding steady above $600. Some analysts believe this momentum could push it toward the $1,000 mark. While regulatory challenges remain, the BNB Spot ETF filing is adding serious potential to the coin’s long-term outlook. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles: Why Traders Can’t Look Away! The BlockDAG (BDAG) leaderboard is shaking things up every single day. Here’s how it goes down: 25 million BDAG enters the ring, buyers snatch up their portion, and the biggest participant pockets whatever’s left. This simple formula is turning heads, driving presale totals over $231.5 million, and moving a massive 19.7 billion BDAG coins. The rewards are undeniable, with current holders raking in about 2,520% in gains! The math behind it all is crystal clear. BDAG is still priced at a mere $0.0019 until May 13. That’s a fraction of batch 28’s price of $0.0262 and a long way off from the projected $0.05 launch. Even if only a quarter of the daily pool goes unsold, that’s $163,750 up for grabs; $312,500 once the exchange listings kick in. But here’s the kicker: landing at the top of the leaderboard means turning a regular buy into a six-figure bonus in just one reset. Early buyers are jumping back in, hoping to repeat their big wins before the deal disappears. New participants? They’re eyeing the opportunity to snag 16 times more coins for the same price as today’s batch. It’s a rare chance to get in while the cost is still low, all while chasing the thrill of leaderboard fame. Analysts are buzzing about BlockDAG’s potential to be a major player in the next crypto bull run, especially with its ability to keep liquidity flowing nonstop. The clock is ticking! The next cycle starts at midnight UTC. With fewer resets left before prices climb, wallets are loading fast. Big buys mean big rewards—no staking, no waiting, just bragging rights and a stash of BDAG! Which Is The Top Crypto to Buy Before The Bull Run? Crypto markets are heating up again, with strong technical setups like the XRP price forecast and the growing buzz around the BNB Spot ETF. These moves are getting traders excited about positioning themselves early before the next bull run kicks off. While XRP banks on chart strength and BNB rides the ETF wave, BlockDAG is shaking things up with something completely different: its Buyer Battles. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are more than just a catchy feature; they’re drawing real interest and consistent volume. With the $0.0019 deal expiring on May 13, there’s even more urgency to act before prices rise. But here’s the twist: it’s not just about buying coins. BlockDAG’s loyal community gets daily chances to snag bonus rewards, adding a whole new layer to the excitement. It’s a unique opportunity to join the action and get in on the rewards!

According to a new filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Goldman Sachs has significantly increased its exposure to Bitcoin ETFs. As of March 31, the Wall Street giant holds 30.8 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), valued at over $1.4 billion—up from 24 million shares previously. The updated position, first reported by financial analyst MacroScope, places Goldman Sachs as the largest institutional holder of IBIT, surpassing other major investors like Brevan Howard, which holds over 25 million shares worth nearly $1.4 billion. Source: Fintel Other notable IBIT investors include Jane Street, D.E. Shaw, and Symmetry Investments, reflecting the growing confidence of hedge funds and trading firms in the Bitcoin ETF market. Goldman Sachs sticks with Fidelity’s Bitcoin fund Goldman Sachs has already revealed a big position in a number of the US spot Bitcoin ETFs . In his February filing, he listed over $1.5 billion in several Bitcoin ETF products. That figure included $1.2 billion in IBIT and $288 million in Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin fund (FBTC). Bank of America continues to be fair value. The latest 13F release from Goldman Sachs shows the bank has made no major changes to its portfolio in FBTC. However, the lack of any Bitcoin options contracts is striking. By December 2023, the bank owned more than $157 million in call options and more than $527 million in put options on IBIT, a hedged position that would provide gains from price swings. It also had $84 million in put on FBTC. As market volatility and risk appetite changed, those positions are not listed in the latest report, indicating that Goldman may have eliminated those contracts or let them expire. IBIT continues to dominate ETF market IBIT has quickly become the largest of the spot Bitcoin ETFs for BlackRock. As of May early 2025, it has about $62.8 billion in assets under management, Farside Investors figures show. Since starting the fund, IBIT has taken in over $44 billion in net inflows — a historic clip for any ETF, crypto or not. The fund has $674 million in new inflows so far this week. On Friday, shares of IBIT climbed by $1.04 to close at $58.66. The price jump tracks a higher rebound for Bitcoin over the past month amid a broader stabilization above $60,000. Analysts think that Goldman’s growing exposure suggests increasing institutional confidence in the long-term value of Bitcoin—specifically through regulated vehicles like ETFs. These funds allow regular investors to get in on crypto without dealing with self-custody or unregulated exchanges. Goldman’s expanding presence in the Bitcoin ETF realm is viewed by many as a powerful vote of confidence — not just in Bitcoin but in the development of financial products that facilitate broader access to digital assets. The move also reflects a bigger shift: Wall Street is increasingly weaving digital assets into standard investment portfolios, particularly as several spot Bitcoin ETFs were greenlit by US regulators recently. As institutional inflows are anticipated to increase and regulatory clarity continues to take shape, the Bitcoin ETF landscape may still have room for growth. For the moment, Goldman Sachs is in the lead. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Meanwhile, XRP’s price outlook is turning heads, with Fibonacci-based projections placing it as high as $27 if current patterns hold. But beyond these headline-making tokens, Unstaked (UNSD) is quietly setting a new benchmark for utility in Web3. Its AI agents operate across platforms like Telegram and X, with every action scored and logged on-chain through its Proof of Intelligence system. Currently in stage 7 of its presale and priced at just $0.00776, Unstaked isn’t selling potential, it’s delivering functionality right now. Ethereum Price Action Signals Possible Breakout to $2,000 Ethereum (ETH) has broken past the $1,820 resistance, trading near $1,859.73 and now testing the next key level at $1,850. A confirmed breakout above this mark could set the stage for a continued move toward $1,920 and potentially $2,000. The technical picture is strong, with the MACD entering bullish territory and the RSI holding above 50, signaling sustained buying momentum. Still, downside risks remain. If ETH loses its grip above $1,820, it could revisit support at $1,780 or even $1,750. The next few sessions will be critical in determining whether this move marks the start of a broader rally. XRP Eyes $27 as Technical Structure Tightens Top analyst EGRAG Crypto has laid out a bold projection for XRP, mapping potential targets between $9.50 and $27. The forecast hinges on a symmetrical triangle pattern in the XRP/BTC chart, supported by Fibonacci levels that point to an explosive upside if current conditions hold. Crucially, XRP must stay above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement (0.00001552 BTC) to preserve its bullish structure. A close above the 0.786 level (0.000029 BTC) could trigger the start of a major upward move. According to EGRAG, patience now could lead to one of XRP’s most significant breakouts yet. Unstaked: Trustless AI Built for Web3, Powered by Proof of Intelligence Unstaked is redefining how Web3 evaluates AI, not with marketing buzz, but with real, verifiable results recorded on-chain. At the core of its platform is Proof of Intelligence, a proprietary system that logs and scores every action performed by an AI agent. From moderating chats to generating content and engaging users, every task is tracked transparently, ensuring that only meaningful, high-impact contributions earn rewards. This eliminates human bias and centralized oversight. There’s no off-chain scoring or delayed validation, just an immutable, trustless system where performance speaks for itself. Every AI interaction on platforms like Telegram, X, and soon Discord is logged directly to the blockchain, making it impossible to fake results or manipulate reward systems. Unlike many AI crypto projects still caught up in concept phases or whitepapers, Unstaked has a working infrastructure. Its autonomous agents are already designed to operate across real platforms, with live tracking and output-based incentives baked into the protocol. The system is built to deliver measurable value from day one. Now in stage 7 of its presale, Unstaked is priced at just $0.00776, with a projected launch value of $0.1819. Few tokens offer this level of tech readiness and transparent utility at such an early stage, making Unstaked a standout in AI crypto. Crypto Market Takeaways Ethereum’s rally and XRP’s ambitious $27 target reflect strong technical setups, but both remain tied to market sentiment and speculative momentum. Unstaked, on the other hand, is building traction through real, working AI infrastructure. Its Proof of Intelligence system actively tracks agent performance, like community growth and engagement, and records every outcome directly on-chain for full transparency. Currently in stage 7 of its presale at $0.00776, Unstaked ($UNSD) offers direct access to a live, utility-driven ecosystem. While others project future impact, Unstaked is already delivering measurable results, making it a clear standout in the next phase of Web3 development.

Bitcoin dominance has dropped sharply from over 65% to 63.89%, hinting at a capital rotation into altcoins. Ethereum surged nearly 13%, while major altcoins like SOL, DOGE, and ADA rallied over 6%. Notably, the ETH/BTC ratio rebounded from its lowest level since 2020, signaling a potential structural shift in investor sentiment. With the tide turning, analysts at Altcoin Daily have revealed their top 14 coins they believe are primed to explode in 2025. Top Altcoins to Watch in May Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum leads the charge amid growing institutional interest . Coinbase added 21,000 ETH to its treasury last quarter, now holding over 140,000 ETH. With Layer 2 solutions like Kraken, OKX, and Uniswap scaling the ecosystem, ETH is seen as climbing the store-of-value adoption curve—making it one of the safest and most promising bets. Ondo Finance (ONDO) Backed by BlackRock, ONDO is at the forefront of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) for institutions. With the U.S. pushing tokenization forward, ONDO is well-positioned to benefit from institutional-grade on-chain finance. XRP (XRP) With U.S. regulatory clarity, XRP is being used for enterprise payments. A Florida pharma firm recently adopted XRP for a $50M treasury and vendor payment use case, proving its real-world financial utility. Cardano (ADA) ADA remains efficient and eco-friendly . It’s expanding Bitcoin bridges and supporting World Mobile Token (WMT), making it a strong contender in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. World Mobile Token (WMT) Deeply tied to Cardano, WMT is expanding across Ethereum and Cosmos, aiming to bring decentralized connectivity worldwide and become a major Cardano partner chain. Borg Token (BORG) This exchange token powers the Swissborg ecosystem (CeFi to DeFi). With one-third of its supply staked and recent integration into Hyperliquid, BORG is gaining traction fast. COTI (COTI) Originally Cardano-native, COTI is now an Ethereum L2 focused on compliant privacy and RWAs. It’s powering the digital euro and collaborating across Africa and the Middle East in a $30 trillion market space. Foxy (FOXY) More than a meme coin, FOXY is the mascot of Linea, a rising Ethereum Layer 2 . If Linea continues to grow, FOXY could gain infrastructure-level support rare among meme coins. Solana (SOL) Still central to the L1 narrative, Solana is praised for its speed and scalability. Analysts call it “the next Ethereum” despite past challenges. Sui (SUI) Dubbed “the next Solana,” Sui is gaining attention for its high-performance architecture. Analysts say it’s in a strong race alongside Solana this cycle. Supra (SUPRA) Seen as a “next-gen blockchain,” Supra might be “the next Sui.” It’s a part of the rising L1 narrative, focused on speed and interoperability. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : 97% of Bitcoin Holders in Profit After $100K Surge: Will BTC Price Hold or Face Selling Pressure? , Injective (INJ) Tailored for decentralized finance , Injective enables tokenized stocks and RWAs like MAG7. Analysts say it’s paving the way for a decentralized Wall Street. Paid Network (PAID) An OG crypto project, PAID is building legal and crowdfunding tools for startups. Now in its third cycle, it’s seen as a strong small-cap survivor. ResearchCoin (RSC) Powering the DeSci (Decentralized Science) movement, RSC rewards researchers for publishing open data. It’s poised to become a leading token in decentralized scientific discovery. Final Thoughts As Bitcoin dominance drops and Ethereum gains steam , the spotlight is shifting toward altcoins. With real-world use cases, institutional adoption, and emerging narratives, these 14 tokens could be the breakout stars of the next crypto bull run. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Japanese firm recently launched its U.S.-based arm, Metaplanet Treasury Corp. , dedicated to accumulating Bitcoin. As part of this bold strategy, it’s planning a $250 million bond sale to fund additional BTC purchases—signaling a deep commitment to its Bitcoin-first approach. Adam Back: Metaplanet Outperforms MicroStrategy According to Blockstream CEO Adam Back , Metaplanet is significantly more efficient than MicroStrategy in generating returns from Bitcoin. Using a metric called “months to mNAV cover,” Back said Metaplanet delivers a 2x BTC yield in just 3 months. Currently, Metaplanet’s market Net Asset Value (mNAV) stands at 3.3x , and could hit 8.3x if the current pace continues. This would allow its stock price to jump from ¥533 to ¥1,340 , according to Back. “Metaplanet is growing 3.8 times faster than MicroStrategy in terms of mNAV coverage,” Back wrote on X. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Tops $100K Again! Changpeng “CZ” Zhao Urges Traders to ‘Stay Calm and Hold’ , Metaplanet Stock Is Gaining Momentum As of now, Metaplanet holds over $536 million in Bitcoin , acquired at an average price of $86,672 per coin . In 2025, its BTC yield stands at 136.7% , and the company’s stock has recently surged 11.5% , closing at ¥477 ($3.33) . Risks Still Exist While the performance looks strong, crypto analyst @agentic_t noted that markets are volatile and emphasized that risk-adjusted returns should be considered. “2x yields are great, but not always guaranteed,” he warned.With fast Bitcoin accumulation, a growing presence in U.S. capital markets, and high praise from industry experts like Adam Back , Metaplanet stock could become one of the top BTC plays globally.

The renewed momentum around stablecoins has reignited concerns among U.S. lawmakers, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is pushing to keep Big Tech players like Meta from issuing their own digital currencies. Meta’s communications director, Andy Stone, has publicly denied these claims, stating bluntly, “Diem is dead. There is no Meta stablecoin.” Still, insiders suggest informal discussions are ongoing behind closed doors. Whilst Diem failed in the aftermath of regulatory, legislative, and financial watchdog backlash, Meta seems to quietly find new methods to gain entry to the stablecoin market . There has been no official word of this development. Still, speculation is growing that the company will begin to deploy stablecoins to optimize creator payments and facilitate international transactions. Senator Warren demands tougher GENIUS Act to block Big Tech from controlling stablecoins Senator Elizabeth Warren is sounding the alarm over the GENIUS Act — the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act — demanding crucial changes to prevent Big Tech from entering the stablecoin market. Warren argues that the Senate must strengthen the GENIUS Act and clarify that Big Tech and other large commercial firms should not be allowed to own or control stablecoins . Before the GENIUS bill was defeated, she said, “If we can reach a compromise solution on these issues today, I will vote for the bill. If not, I will be fighting against it.” Her concern is clear: If Big Tech companies have financial control over digital currency systems, they can use it to untangle user transactions, tinker with digital payments, and perhaps stamp out competitors and dissenters. Addressing the involvement of Meta, Warren explicitly questioned Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, asking whether his company plans to quietly bring back what was once its plans to roll out its stablecoin. Warren said that Zuckerberg owes it to Congress to explain whether this is another ploy to indirectly use the American people’s money to support the market. For Warren, the prospect of Meta or any tech company overseeing a digital currency threatens not just the business of finance — but the very idea of democracy. She fears it could put these companies on steroids, with outsize sway over politics, commerce, and civil liberties. Lawmakers block stablecoin legislation as Meta attempts revival On Thursday, Democrats blocked the Senate from considering the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. The bill was voted down 48-49, falling short of the 60 votes required to bring it closer to final passage. The vote was split almost entirely along party lines after bipartisan support for the legislation fell apart last week. Though initially expected to secure prompt approval of another must-do measure, the bill faced opposition from some Democratic senators. They said they still had concerns about provisions on anti-money laundering, national security, and a handful of other issues and could not support the bill’s current version. Warren and her allies argue that the bill could allow corporate interests to control financial transactions without stronger safeguards. The GENIUS Act is getting a hard look or two now, with some calls to fix it. Sen. Ruben Gallego (Ariz.), the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, had initially asked to delay the vote until Monday to give senators more time. However, his request was rejected, and Democrats voted down the bill. At the heart of the debate is whether companies like Meta should be allowed to re-enter the stablecoin space, a prospect that many lawmakers, including Warren, view as a serious risk to financial stability and democratic oversight. The GENIUS Act is now back in negotiations, and some lawmakers remained hopeful it could reappear on the Senate floor as early as next week.

Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying” “I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November . SWFs are government-owned investment funds that manage national savings , often built from surplus revenues like oil profits or trade gains. Norway has the largest SWF in the world, with approximately $1.73 trillion in assets under management, followed by China with $1.33 trillion, according to data from Visual Capitalist. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) market cap is approximately $2.05 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Anthony Scaramucci spoke to Anthony Pompliano on his podcast on May 8. Source: Anthony Pompliano Scaramucci said that if stablecoin regulation is passed, clear guidance is provided for traditional banks to custody of Bitcoin and other digital assets, and there’s progress on tokenizing stocks and bonds, a significant wave of buying from Sovereign Wealth Funds is likely to follow. “Then I will tell you that there will be large blocks of buying, or people worth 10, 20, 30 trillion dollars, buying a half a billion dollars of Bitcoin, buying a billion of Bitcoin,” Scaramucci said. Related: Institutional investors continue to scoop up Bitcoin above $100K “But if you wanna see a million dollar Bitcoin, that’s when someone at a sovereign says ok, this is part of the infrastructure of the world’s financial services architecture,” he added. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently said that the chances of Bitcoin reaching a seven-figure price by 2030 have increased. “We actually think the odds have gone up that our bull case will be the right number because of what is becoming the institutionalization of this new asset class,” Woods said in February.

Ethereum Staking Back in Spotlight During the early July meeting, BlackRock stressed that Ethereum ETFs are “less perfect” without staking, as investors miss out on yield from locked ETH. Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, described staking for spot ETH ETFs as a “step change upward,” though he acknowledged regulatory and operational complexities ahead. Under SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the agency previously blocked staking features in ETH ETFs. But with the potential shift in stance, staking approval could allow ETH ETFs to generate revenue by earning yield. Other firms like Fidelity and Grayscale are also lobbying for staking support. Notably, the NYSE proposed a rule change in February to enable staking in Grayscale’s fund—currently under review. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin With a 35% Breakout; A New ATH at $6000 is Loading! , Tokenization Momentum Builds The meeting also covered BlackRock’s push to tokenize traditional financial assets. The firm highlighted its $2.9 billion BUIDL fund—a tokenized U.S. Treasury product—promoting blockchain -based solutions for bonds and securities with faster settlements, lower fees, and round-the-clock trading. Rival efforts include Franklin Templeton’s BENJI fund and Robinhood’s blockchain project aimed at offering tokenized U.S. stocks to European users. While the SEC has not disclosed the outcome of the meeting, BlackRock’s continued advocacy signals growing momentum in blending crypto innovation with mainstream finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

33767162,[object Object],1746853205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Court Convicts US Man in ISIS Crypto-Funding Case; Sentenced to Over 30 Years,https://bitcoinist.com/court-convicts-us-man-isis-crypto-funding-sentenced/,"A US citizen from Springfield, Virginia has been sentenced to over three decades in federal prison after being convicted of using cryptocurrency to financially support the Islamic State (ISIS), a group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the US government. According to a press release from the US Department of Justice (DoJ), the individual, Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa, 35, was sentenced to 364 months in prison on charges related to providing material support to ISIS. Conviction and Sentencing Highlight Scope of Support Court documents reveal that Chhipa was involved in an extended campaign between October 2019 and October 2022, during which he funneled funds to female ISIS members in Syria. These funds were used to assist with various activities, including escape attempts from detention camps and the broader support of ISIS operatives. Chhipa utilized social media to solicit donations, accepted funds electronically, and at times traveled significant distances to collect physical cash. He would later convert these funds into cryptocurrency, which he transmitted through intermediaries in Turkey to be smuggled into Syria for use by ISIS members. The DoJ stated that Chhipa’s efforts involved sending over $185,000 in cryptocurrency to support the terrorist group. This financial support , prosecutors argued, enabled ISIS operatives to continue their activities. “This defendant directly financed ISIS in its efforts to commit vile terrorist atrocities against innocent citizens in America and abroad,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi in the statement. FBI Director Kash Patel added that this case underscores the bureau’s commitment to holding accountable all individuals involved in supporting terrorism, regardless of whether that support is financial or operational. The FBI’s Washington Field Office led the investigation, and federal prosecutors secured convictions on one count of conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, as well as four counts of providing and attempting to provide such support. A jury returned the guilty verdict in December 2024, leading to Thursday’s sentencing. Crypto’s Role in Terror Financing Draws Scrutiny The US Attorney’s Office emphasized the severity of Chhipa’s actions, stating that facilitating financial support for a violent extremist group while residing in a country that values individual freedom represents a serious breach of national security. “Those who fund and facilitate terror bear the same responsibility as those who carry out attacks,” said US Attorney Erik S. Siebert. The press release also identified Chhipa’s primary co-conspirator as an ISIS member based in Syria. This individual played a role in raising funds for ISIS operations, including planned terrorist attacks and prison breakouts. The use of cryptocurrency in this scheme reflects a trend in terror financing, where digital assets are now being exploited for their pseudonymous nature and ease of cross-border transfer.

Tim Scott promises “painful repercussions” for Democrats who stalled crypto’s GENIUS Act,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/scott-painful-repercussions-dems-crypto-bill/,"Senator Tim Scott said on Thursday night that Democrats who voted against the GENIUS Act should expect “painful” political consequences. He made the statement after the crypto bill failed in the US Senate, where Democrats blocked it despite months of bipartisan talks. The GENIUS Act, led by Senator Bill Hagerty, would have created the first legal framework for stablecoins in the US But two Democratic co-sponsors flipped their votes, and two Republicans—Josh Hawley and Rand Paul—also voted no. According to Eleanor Terrett, former Fox Business journalist and founder of Crypto in America, Scott told her he hoped the crypto industry’s reaction would push lawmakers to return and pass the bill. Scott, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said his party had made “major concessions” to get the bill across. Those included reducing the time for stablecoin issuers to register in the US, tightening national security rules, and softening anti-money laundering measures. Still, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks—who helped write the bill—turned their backs on it. Scott told Eleanor, “If you can get so much of what you want, and you still can’t say yes, I don’t get it.” He said he hopes both Democrats and the two Republicans who opposed it will come around after realizing how the delay hurts financial inclusion and blocks crypto innovation. Democrats stall bill as Trump’s crypto ties dominate talks The bill failed in a Senate where crypto had, until now, enjoyed its most favorable climate under President Donald Trump’s second term. The setback was the first major blow for the industry in the Trump era. Republican leaders needed Democratic votes to push the bill through, and they didn’t get them. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, had warned his caucus a week before the vote not to commit to supporting the bill. Behind closed doors, he asked them to use their leverage to demand more changes. Lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Chris Murphy raised concerns about passing any crypto legislation while the Trump family remained so deeply involved in the space. Trump’s sons launched a stablecoin venture last year, and Trump himself issued a memecoin just two days before taking office again. Murphy said, “The Trump crypto coin scam is the biggest corruption in the history of the White House.” He and others demanded language in the bill that would bar any president from creating or profiting from crypto. Not everyone agreed. Senator Ruben Gallego, who voted for an earlier version of the bill and led last-minute negotiations, said Trump’s coin had nothing to do with the actual bill. “If we don’t pass any stablecoin legislation, he’s still going to do everything he’s going to do right now. The most important thing we can do is get a strong, strong bill.” After the bill died, Scott stood on the Senate floor and said, “It was a vote to stop President Trump from having a victory in the digital asset space. It was a vote against common sense — that simple.” He accused Democrats of letting “Trump Derangement Syndrome” hijack what could’ve been a win for both parties and the crypto space. Democrats said they needed more time to finalize the deal. Gallego asked to delay the vote on the Senate floor, but Republicans rejected the request. Now, Senate Majority Leader John Thune has filed a motion to reconsider, which could bring the bill back. Senator Warren told reporters, “I always worry about the influence of money in Washington, but the crypto industry seems to think that they have a lot of power right now because of the contributions that they’ve made.” After the vote, Scott’s team made it clear they don’t want crypto donors wasting money on Democrats anymore. Jennifer DeCasper, Scott’s longtime aide and the current Executive Director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said, “Anyone backing Senate Democrats in hopes of crypto progress is ignoring reality.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

On Friday, Senior US District Judge Susan Illston issued a court order that blocks Trump’s executive plan to lay off thousands of federal workers. This came after a February directive from the White House, signed by Trump, called for a massive shake-up of the federal workforce, one that would shut down agencies and force early retirements across multiple departments. The order was about to go live, but the court just hit the brakes—hard. The ruling stalls the administration’s move to fire workers at Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration, State, Treasury, and Transportation, just days before the layoffs were set to begin. Illston said the government can’t skip the legal steps. She made it clear Trump does have the power to restructure agencies, but only by following the rules, and when it involves large cuts, Congress has to be involved. Judge says layoffs can’t start until May 23 According to Politico, Illston froze all new layoff notices and stopped any existing ones from being carried out until May 23. This includes notices by the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management. Some agencies were less than two weeks away from starting the firings. The court order now stops every single one of them—at least temporarily. The court named several departments targeted in Trump’s executive order. That includes Energy, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Interior, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, DOGE , AmeriCorps, the National Labor Relations Board, National Science Foundation, and the Small Business Administration. During the Friday hearing, Illston said the executive order looked like it was written to dodge all the slow parts of the law. She didn’t hold back on why she believed the plan moved the way it did. “I think that is probably why the executive order said what it said, because there is some impatience with how slow that process can be,” she told the courtroom. “But if the statutes provide for the process, then the process needs to be followed.” Illston reminded everyone this isn’t the first time Trump tried something like this. In 2017, he made another effort to overhaul the government, but that time, he asked Congress to pass legislation to support it. In her ruling, she wrote, “Nothing prevents the President from requesting this cooperation — as he did in his prior term of office.” Unions and nonprofits push back against Trump’s plan The court fight started when major federal worker unions and several nonprofits sued the administration over the February order. They said Trump’s plan to shut down offices and fire workers through voluntary retirement and large-scale reductions-in-force broke federal law and violated the Constitution. They argued the White House ignored the requirement to provide 60 days’ notice, assess veteran status, and check if workers could be reassigned instead of fired. Lawyers for Trump claimed the court didn’t have the power to hear the case. They said workers could take their complaints to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the body that handles job disputes in the federal workforce. But that’s where the whole thing fell apart. Illston pointed out that the Merit Systems Protection Board doesn’t have enough people to make decisions. She also said the Trump administration hadn’t told Congress or the unions anything about how the layoffs would be done.

However, the rising RSI suggests the asset may be overbought and vulnerable to a short-term pullback. New Peak on the Way? The price of the leading cryptocurrency has been booming lately, briefly climbing above $104,000 earlier today (May 9). As of this writing, bitcoin (BTC) is worth approximately $103,000, which represents a 33% monthly increase. The asset’s impressive rally sparked huge enthusiasm on crypto X, with multiple users predicting that an upswing toward a new all-time high is just a matter of time. Some important factors support the bullish thesis. An example is BTC’s exchange netflow, which has been predominantly negative on most days in the past week or so. This indicates a shift from centralized trading platforms toward self-custody methods and reduced selling pressure. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant The interest in BTC is also worth mentioning. Over the last few weeks, Google searches with the word ‘bitcoin’ have been on the rise, signaling increased attention from investors, especially retail. BTC searches, Source: Google Trends As CryptoPotato reported earlier today (May 9), Bitcoin’s network saw almost 350,000 newly created wallets in a single day, signaling a FOMO effect. On some occasions in the past, the massive influx of retail investors has been a precursor of cycle tops. Although the current retail numbers are higher now than in the last several weeks, they are still far from what could be described as the bull run top. Last but not least, we will focus on the upcoming meeting between US and Chinese officials scheduled for this weekend. The two sides will supposedly discuss de-escalation of the ongoing trade war. Recently, American President Donald Trump hinted that the tariffs imposed on China might be cut in the near future. Eased tension between the two biggest economies in the world could positively impact the financial and crypto markets since it would reduce uncertainty and might boost investor confidence. Greed Is Here, But Watch Out BTC’s recent bull run seems to have affected investors’ sentiment. Today, the popular Fear & Greed Index surged to “greed” territory of 73, a level last observed in January this year. BTC Fear and Greed Index, Source: alternative.me The metric tracks numerous segments, such as price volatility, social media comments, and surveys, to determine the momentary investor feelings toward BTC. The predominantly bullish sentiment might sound encouraging, but one should keep in mind Warren Buffett’s advice, who once urged people “to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.” The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is another indicator worth monitoring. The momentum oscillator measures the speed and magnitude of the latest price changes and varies from 0 to 100. It helps traders spot potential trend reversals, as readings above 70 typically signal that the asset could be overbought and headed for a pullback. Currently, the ratio stands at almost 75.

Notably, BTC surged past $100,000 yesterday for the first time since February 3. Bitcoin On The Verge Of Trend Reversal? At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $100,000, approximately 5.2% below its all-time high (ATH) of $108,786, set earlier this year on January 20. The leading cryptocurrency has staged an impressive rebound of over 20% from its recent low of $74,508 recorded on April 6. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Apparent Demand’ Makes Sharp Rebound – Will BTC Breakout Soon? In their analysis, crypto analyst burakkemeci referred to the CryptoQuant Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator, saying that it is flashing the early signs of a potential bullish trend reversal. The analyst noted: With Bitcoin surging back above $100K, the indicator has started flashing bullish signals again – for the first time in weeks. Although the signal is still weak (coefficient: 0.029), the mere appearance of a positive shift is encouraging. To explain, the CryptoQuant Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is an on-chain tool that tracks long-term and short-term market sentiment by comparing price momentum and investor behavior trends. It uses two key components – the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MA) – to identify shifts between bull and bear cycles. Importantly, the analyst pointed out that the Bull-Bear 30-day MA has started to turn upward. If this metric crosses above the 365-day MA, historical trends suggest Bitcoin could enter a phase of parabolic price growth. Recent macroeconomic developments may further support the bullish narrative for Bitcoin. Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor, recently highlighted the relationship between the global M2 money supply and the price of BTC. Bittel shared a chart that overlays BTC’s price with the M2 money supply, adjusted with a 12-week lag. The data reveals a steep increase in global liquidity since early 2025, implying that BTC could follow this trend and continue rising in the months ahead. Warning Signs Still Linger For BTC Despite recent strength, not all signals are bullish. Analysts caution that the current rally has been accompanied by aggressive profit-taking, increasing the chances of a local top forming. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still Far From A True Supply Shock, Analyst Explains Further, recent analysis shows that BTC’s Demand Momentum is yet to come out of negative territory. The analyst noted that such market behavior is mostly prevalent during late-cycle distribution phases or macro-level consolidation periods. That said, Bitcoin’s Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) is beginning to reflect renewed bullish momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $103,444, up 4% in the past 24 hours.

However, the assets remain locked within the ecosystem and are inaccessible for transfer or resale. Powered by blockchain technology, Web3 gaming introduces true asset ownership via fungible and non-fungible tokens. Players can sell or trade their in-game items across platforms, building a player-driven economy that mirrors real-world markets. Blockchains introduce transparency and reduce restrictions Blockchains introduce transparency, verifying and reliably storing each in-game transaction, which helps prevent fraud and builds trust between developers and players. Web3 games are hosted on a decentralized node network, making them very hard to hack or shut down. The network also allows users to play Web3 games from anywhere in the world as long as they have an internet connection. Tradition meets modernity in the mobile-friendly Web3 game NFL Rivals, officially licensed by the National Football League and the NFL Players Association. It brings together NFT trading and fantasy football, allowing players to create and manage a virtual team, trade individual game characters as NFTs, compete against other teams, etc. The unique NFTs come with different strengths and rarity levels and can be sold, bought, and traded on Mythical Marketplace, the trading platform of the game’s creator, Mythical Games. More than 150,000 people signed up to play NFL Rivals in its beta phase, and this number increased further after the official launch. The game was downloaded more than five million times in the inaugural season when more than 115 million games were played . NFT trading volume reached $6 million in 2024. In-game NFT trades took just over a month to increase from $4 million to $5 million and 27 days to grow from $5 million to $6 million. The platform will launch FIFA Rivals, targeting soccer fans across the globe, in the summer of 2025. Web2 continues to dominate global gaming While Web3’s rapid progress has been remarkable, Web2 games remain more accessible to a wider audience. In February 2025, Roblox alone reported 85 million daily active users , with its monthly player base including 50% of US children under 16. Other major titles, such as Call of Duty, Minecraft, and Fortnite, each boast tens of millions of active players. In addition, user engagement with Web3 games tends to fluctuate. The industry reached 5.5 million daily active users in November 2024, up 15.7% from October . However, this growth is not consistent across platforms. Hamster Kombat claimed over 300 million users in August and September 2024, but actual engagement was far lower, with 51.9 million monthly active users at the end of October. Web3 gaming may be growing, but it still represents a small fraction of the global gaming market. What’s more, concepts like Web3, NFTs, and blockchain have failed to resonate with many Web2 users. This prompted the developers or publishers of Steam, GTA V, and Minecraft to remove everything related to Web3 from their platforms. Real interest in company growth makes all the difference Web2 platforms sell user data to advertisers to make money, contrasting with the sacrosanctity of personal information in Web3. How do the games make a profit, then? The difference lies in the interest of organizations like the DAO supporting Mythical Games in company development and growth. If the platform grows, the value of the native token (in this case, MYTH) required to participate in the ecosystem increases, and players can sell it. What’s more, MYTH token holders play a crucial role by voting on DAO proposals, taking part in governance decisions, and generally influencing the Mythical ecosystem’s direction. While Web2 players spend money on digital items without external value, Web3 currencies and goods can appreciate over time, giving players a reliable incentive to engage. These processes are palpable in emerging markets, where blockchain-based games can offer a feasible alternative to conventional forms of employment. Players can enjoy the games while capitalizing on project growth. Web3 is still in its infancy, but the lucrative mechanisms underpinning it promise to enhance and sustain players’ motivation to a greater extent than its predecessor.",Information|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-10 05:32:22

Expert Shares Best XRP Exit Strategy",https://timestabloid.com/diamond-hands-until-10000-expert-shares-best-xrp-exit-strategy/,"In a recent tweet, prominent crypto commentator and XRP analyst “All Things XRP” addressed the widely repeated sentiment among XRP holders about maintaining so-called “diamond hands” until the asset reaches an improbable $10,000 price point. The post calls into question the psychological feasibility of such a strategy, arguing that many investors are underestimating the emotional and financial pressures associated with large, sudden gains. DIAMOND HANDS UNTIL $10,000? LET'S GET REAL ABOUT YOUR XRP EXIT STRATEGY. You claim you're holding your XRP until it hits $10,000, but let's have an honest conversation about human psychology and life-changing wealth. Picture this: You've got 10,000 XRP coins. At… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 7, 2025 The tweet challenges the idea that individuals who hold significant amounts of XRP would remain unaffected by rapidly appreciating value. A scenario is laid out: a holder with 10,000 XRP sees their holdings reach $100 million if the asset hits $10,000 per coin . The commentator asks whether anyone would passively watch their portfolio climb to $50 million and then decide it’s still insufficient. According to the post, the human response to that level of wealth is rarely rooted in restraint, especially when faced with the opportunity to improve one’s quality of life drastically. From $10 to $1,000: The Gradual Unraveling of Idealism The commentary illustrates how most investors react incrementally as their holdings grow. When XRP reaches $10, a $10,000 investment becomes $100,000, a point where many think seriously about liquidating. By the time it hits $100, that same investment reaches $1 million, and real-world considerations—such as family responsibilities, debt relief, and career changes — take priority. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At a $1,000 valuation per coin, a $10,000 initial position can reach $10 million, drawing in extended family, unexpected attention, and pressure to address financial needs outside the investor’s immediate goals. The Difference Between Memes and Maturity Rather than relying on slogans or idealistic memes, the tweet emphasizes the need for a more grounded view of wealth accumulation. The commentator dismisses the talk of “diamond hands” versus “paper hands” and instead promotes a third category: realistic, prepared investors who understand that wealth management involves discipline, not denial. According to the tweet, professional investors typically do not wait for a singular “moonshot” moment. Instead, they operate with pre-defined exit strategies, taking profits at logical intervals to reduce exposure and manage risk. The suggestion is not necessarily to abandon the idea of long-term holding , but to be transparent and deliberate about one’s thresholds for profit-taking. Private Exit Strategies Deserve Honest Reflection The commentator concludes by urging followers to confront their actual plans. Many, they argue, privately hold more nuanced exit strategies than they publicly admit. These include partial sell-offs at various price milestones or gradual reduction of holdings as key targets are met. The overall message is that maturity in investing does not come from holding forever, but from being prepared to act responsibly when opportunity arises.

Built on Ethereum and introduced as a playful alternative to Dogecoin, it quickly gained traction through online communities and social momentum. The Shiba Inu dog mascot came to represent the rise of retail investor enthusiasm, attracting a massive wave of participants to the crypto space. Over time, the Shiba Inu ecosystem expanded to include a decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), its own Layer 2 network (Shibarium), and even a foray into metaverse development. Yet, despite these additions, market activity around SHIB has cooled, with much of its early surge driven by sentiment rather than consistent on-chain utility. While the token still holds cultural value and has a loyal base, many long-term investors are now exploring alternatives that prioritize financial functionality over hype. One of those alternatives is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a project that’s gaining momentum not for memes, but for real passive yield and lending infrastructure. With a current price of only $0.025, it’s emerging as one of the top low-cost cryptocurrency options for investors aiming at long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t aiming for virality — it’s focused on solving real problems in DeFi. The protocol offers decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing, where users can supply assets like ETH or BTC and unlock liquidity without needing to sell their core holdings. This structure provides flexibility. Users can borrow stablecoins against collateral and still benefit from future market gains on the assets they’ve deposited. It’s a practical tool, not a speculative bet. That shift in purpose — from meme to mechanism — is what’s attracting a new wave of interest. Adding to this utility is Mutuum’s use of mtTokens. Users who contribute assets to the protocol receive mtTokens in exchange — tokenized assets that reflect their original deposit and steadily accumulate interest over time. These tokens are transferable and compatible across DeFi platforms, making them more than placeholders. They’re functional instruments of value within the ecosystem. Currently in its fourth presale phase, MUTM remains available at $0.025 — a figure that won’t last long. With over $7.75 million raised and the next price tier set at $0.03, interest is rising among early adopters aiming to enter before the price adjusts. The eventual launch is priced at $0.06, but projections for MUTM stretch much further, with long-term forecasts suggesting a potential to reach several dollars per token. For those making calculated crypto investment decisions, this timeline matters. Getting in now, at presale, means doubling returns before the token even lists on major exchanges. And with more than 9,500 holders already on board, it’s clear that demand is growing — but it’s still early. Unlike tokens that depend on external hype cycles, MUTM’s value is directly tied to activity within the protocol. The borrowing activity within the platform generates revenue that is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market, which are then redistributed to contributors, forming a sustainable, yield-driven cycle. This buy-and-distribute mechanism benefits those who hold and participate in the system, rather than relying on short-term speculation. It’s a model that aligns with investor goals in 2025 — passive income, utility, and transparency. With additional features like a protocol-native stablecoin under development and plans to roll out a beta version of the platform at launch, Mutuum isn’t waiting to build utility after the fact. It’s preparing to offer it from day one. SHIB captured attention and created a movement — no one can deny that. However, as the market evolves, attention is turning in a new direction. Utility, sustainability, and reward mechanisms are taking the lead, and that’s where MUTM is gaining ground. While one token built its foundation on hype, the other is building yield-backed infrastructure designed to scale. For those exploring the best cryptocurrency to invest in with future returns in mind, Mutuum Finance may be the better choice — and right now, it’s still trading under three cents.

At the same time, other whales continue to accumulate the asset, perhaps to secure a place in the upcoming dinner with the President. TRUMP Team Sells Again? The controversy around the fourth-largest meme coin continues as the team behind it has made another sizeable transaction into centralized exchanges. In the latest example, a wallet linked to them deposited over $52 million worth of TRUMP into trading platforms, which is typically associated with sales; otherwise, why would they transfer funds to exchanges, as everything on the blockchain is visible and traceable? The wallet linked to the $TRUMP team just deposited 3.5M $TRUMP ($52.66M) into exchanges again. https://t.co/9nc4YjTvxE https://t.co/Y8lStmCWyw pic.twitter.com/alY3TRv1oz — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 10, 2025 This is far from the first similar instance. Recall that in late April, the team transferred a more modest $20 million worth of the meme coin to Binance, OKX, and Bybit. At the time, TRUMP’s price had also risen in value after the announcement of the upcoming dinner with the president at one of his golf establishments in Washington, DC. A recent report by Chainalysis, cited by CNBC, indicated that the TRUMP team has profited somewhere around $320 million from different activities with the token, including fees routed to wallets tied to the creators. At the same time, the US President continues to claim that he has not profited even a cent from the meme coin’s price gains. Whales Keep Buying Following the dinner announcement made last month, which says that the top 220 TRUMP holders will have a chance to attend a special event with the POTUS on May 22, many investors rushed to purchase the profit, some with the obvious intention to attend it, others to profit by speculating. With just a few days left until the holders’ snapshot deadline is over, on-chain data shows that one whale spent 4 million USDC to acquire 276,968 TRUMP tokens at $14.44. As of press time, this secures them a seat at the presidential table.

Wall Street’s wealthiest institutions are cutting down on their dollar holdings and piling into European markets, as new data shows a massive pullback from US equities and bonds. According to the Financial Times, this is not a one-time reaction. It’s a long-term retreat, driven by chaos in Washington, falling confidence in the Federal Reserve, and the latest wave of tariff fights started by President Donald Trump. The White House has been on a warpath against the Fed chair, while the broader policy outlook has turned into a mess. Even though US stock prices bounced after Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, they’re still down this year, and trailing behind global competitors. Meanwhile, the US dollar has lost over 7% since January, and traders are now watching what some are calling early signs of a capital exodus into safer European investments like German bonds. European equities soak up investor money while ETFs bleed Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said the flow is already underway. “It is happening. It will be slow but inevitable,” he said, pointing to low valuations and Germany’s rising defense budget as clear reasons why investors see more value in Europe. The evidence is everywhere. In March, a Bank of America survey showed investors made their biggest cut ever to US stock holdings, and the pivot to Europe was the fastest since 1999. In April, €2.5 billion flowed out of European-domiciled ETFs holding US stocks and bonds—the highest figure since early 2023, based on Morningstar Direct data. The bleeding didn’t stop there. Early May numbers show more outflows from equity ETFs, though fixed-income ones managed to claw back a bit of interest. Spot markets are seeing a steady dump of US dollars in favor of euros, and investment banks say institutional players are doing the bulk of the trading. Pension funds across continents turn their backs on US assets Big retirement funds are now leading the exodus. Laura Wickström, CIO at Finland’s Veritas Pension Insurance Company, said they slashed US stock exposure in the first quarter. She cited overpriced valuations and the confusion caused by tariff decisions. “The uncertainty and the communication around tariffs … the confusion and unpredictability associated with that made us question the idea that you should pay that sort of premium,” said Laura. In Australia, John Pearce, who runs investments at the A$149 billion UniSuper fund, echoed the same doubt. He told the fund’s podcast that his team had “quite a large exposure to US assets” but were now “questioning that commitment.” He added, “Frankly, I think we’ve seen peak investment in US assets.” Danish pension funds joined the trend too. In Q1, they sold US stocks for the first time since 2022 and made their biggest purchase of European-listed shares since 2018. Sam Lynton Brown, head of macro strategy at BNP Paribas, said if European pension funds bring their US exposure back to 2015 levels, that would mean dumping €300 billion in dollar-denominated investments. For years, the US was the top destination for capital, backed by liquidity and strong market returns. But John Butler, a strategist at Wellington Management, said the tide is turning. “If the globalisation of capital goes in reverse, the question becomes how far and fast it does so.” Even in the US, institutions are no longer sure about sticking with the dollar. Scott Chan, CIO at California’s $350 billion State Teachers’ Retirement System, told his board this week that “one of the unintended risks and consequences of opening Pandora’s box on tariffs” could be that America’s top trade partners start selling US assets. “The question for us is do we need greater diversification because we are very focused on US assets,” he said. The dollar plunge has been hurting foreign holders who didn’t hedge their positions. Bank of America estimates that if European investors hedge their currency exposure like they did pre-Covid, that would involve $2.5 trillion in hedging—something that could drag the dollar down even further.

Here’s the Latest Development,https://timestabloid.com/blackrock-xrp-etf-is-coming-heres-the-latest-development/,"In a significant development for the cryptocurrency sector, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has reportedly met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force to discuss standards for approving Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Crypto influencer Amelie shared the news on X, sparking widespread excitement within the XRP community. BREAKING: BLACKROCK MEETS WITH THE SEC CRYPTO TASK FORCE TO DISCUSS ETF APPROVAL STANDARDS! BLACKROCK #XRP ETF IS COMING SOON! pic.twitter.com/fPj2FwG5wU — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 9, 2025 BlackRock’s Strategic Move Towards an XRP ETF The meeting between BlackRock and the SEC’s specialized crypto team signals the asset manager’s growing interest in launching a dedicated XRP ETF. As the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, BlackRock’s proactive engagement with the SEC highlights its commitment to navigating the compliance complexities of introducing a crypto-based financial product. While details of the discussions remain sparse, the meeting’s agenda reportedly focused on establishing standardized criteria for ETF approval. This development follows recent trends in the financial industry, where major asset management firms are increasingly exploring ways to incorporate digital assets into traditional investment portfolios. Why an XRP ETF Matters If approved, BlackRock’s XRP ETF would mark a groundbreaking milestone for Ripple and the broader crypto market. ETFs offer investors a way to gain exposure to assets without directly purchasing them, simplifying investment while potentially boosting liquidity. In the case of XRP, an ETF would provide institutional investors with a regulated and easily accessible avenue to invest, significantly increasing market participation. A potential XRP ETF launch highlights increasing institutional investment in the digital asset, driven partly by recent developments around the Ripple vs SEC saga. With XRP now recognized as a regulated cryptocurrency in the United States, asset managers like BlackRock are seizing the opportunity to capitalize on the renewed market confidence. What an ETF Could Mean for XRP’s Price The prospect of a BlackRock XRP ETF has stirred speculation about how it could influence XRP’s valuation. Past approvals of cryptocurrency ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have typically led to bullish price movements, suggesting a potential trend. Analysts believe XRP ETF could similarly trigger substantial upward momentum, fueled by increased demand from retail and institutional investors. Market experts also point out that BlackRock’s involvement lends significant credibility to XRP’s investment potential. As a financial giant managing trillions in assets, BlackRock’s endorsement of XRP through an ETF would likely attract other major players to consider similar financial products. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory Hurdles and Market Outlook Despite the optimism, securing approval for an XRP ETF is far from guaranteed. The SEC’s cautious stance on crypto ETFs stems from worries about market volatility and protecting investors. However, the meeting signals progress, indicating that BlackRock is actively addressing these regulatory concerns. Some analysts speculate that the recent settlement agreement between Ripple and the SEC could work in BlackRock’s favor. XRP’s clearer regulatory status could pave the way for a more favorable SEC review of the ETF proposal. Industry Reactions and the Road Ahead The potential launch of an XRP ETF has drawn considerable attention from the crypto and financial communities. Supporters argue that such a product could significantly bolster XRP’s mainstream adoption, while skeptics remain cautious, pointing out that regulatory approval is never a given. Amelie’s update has sparked anticipation in the XRP market, generating excitement among investors. The crypto community will wait for further updates, hoping BlackRock’s efforts will lead to a fully approved XRP ETF. Should the SEC ultimately give the green light, it would mark an unprecedented moment in the intersection of traditional finance and the cryptocurrency ecosystem..

Many altcoins continue to post impressive gains, with ETH standing well above $2,300, while DOGE has soared past $0.21. BTC’s Impressive Week If we roll back the clock to May 6, we will see that BTC’s price was just rejected at $98,000, and the asset had slipped back down to under $94,000. Although this $4,000 price drop might sound painful, a broader look would show that bitcoin has still added roughly $20,000 since the early April lows. Impressive, right? Well, the primary cryptocurrency wasn’t done yet, not by a long shot. It bounced off that support line, and it took about a day to fly past the coveted $100,000 line.

The gains kept coming on Friday as bitcoin exploded to its highest price level since late January of over $104,000. It met some resistance there and was pushed south by a few grand, but that was short-lived. As of now, BTC stands well above $103,000 – a 7% weekly surge and a 26% monthly pump.
