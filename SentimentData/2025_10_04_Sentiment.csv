CleanSpark Bitcoin production for September totaled 629 BTC, with 445 BTC sold for approximately $48.7 million and the company holding 13,011 BTC in its treasury. The update also highlighted a 26% year‑over‑year improvement in fleet efficiency and an average operating hashrate of 45.6 EH/s. COINOTAG reviewed the company’s disclosed figures and comparable industry data to contextualize the results. Sales are consistent with CleanSpark’s stated strategy to monetize production for liquidity. How did CleanSpark’s efficiency and sales affect its treasury and liquidity? CleanSpark sold 445 BTC in September at an average realized price of about $109,568, generating roughly $48.7 million in proceeds. The company ended the month with 13,011 BTC after the sale, reflecting a balance between accumulation and cash-generation objectives. Fleet-level efficiency improved 26% year over year, which supports lower unit costs per BTC mined. Average operating hashrate of 45.6 EH/s sustained production despite rising network difficulty. CleanSpark shares performance. Source: Yahoo Finance Why are miners facing new pressures? Bitcoin miners face higher energy costs and potential tariffs on imported mining rigs, which can materially affect margins and capital expense forecasts. Tariff exposure has been reported as a significant risk for several publicly traded miners. Customs allegations that some rigs were manufactured in China have created potential tariff liabilities for firms, with reported exposures reaching into the hundreds of millions for certain companies. Tariff rates reported in industry commentary vary by origin and may reach an effective duty of over 50% for China‑origin machines. Network mining difficulty also reached record highs in September and October, increasing the computational work required per BTC and pressuring energy consumption and cost per coin. Bitcoin mining difficulty over 3 years. Source: Coinwarz.com When did CleanSpark change its sales strategy and why? CleanSpark began selling a portion of monthly production in April to pursue greater financial self-sufficiency. The firm also opened an institutional Bitcoin trading desk to facilitate scheduled sales and improve execution. In August, CleanSpark sold 533.5 BTC for about $60.7 million, illustrating the company’s recurring liquidity approach. Management framed sales as a tool to support operations and capital needs rather than a change in long‑term accumulation policy. Frequently Asked Questions How many BTC does CleanSpark hold now? CleanSpark reported 13,011 BTC in its treasury at the end of September after mining 629 BTC and selling 445 BTC during the month. Does selling monthly production mean miners are abandoning accumulation? Selling part of monthly output is a cash-management tactic. Many miners balance accumulation with sales to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures while still retaining strategic BTC reserves. How do tariffs affect miner economics? Tariffs on imported mining rigs increase upfront capital costs and extend payback periods. Reported potential liabilities and duties can materially change project IRRs and equipment replacement cycles. Key Takeaways Production and sales: 629 BTC mined in September; 445 BTC sold for ~ $48.7M. Operational improvement: Fleet efficiency +26% YoY; 45.6 EH/s average operating hashrate. Industry pressures: Rising energy costs, tariffs on rigs, and record mining difficulty are key headwinds. Conclusion CleanSpark Bitcoin production strengthened in September, combining improved fleet efficiency with an active sales program to support liquidity. COINOTAG analysis shows the company balancing accumulation (treasury 13,011 BTC) with operational funding amid rising difficulty and tariff risks.

If approved, this will make it the first major U.S.-regulated exchange to offer around-the-clock access to crypto derivatives, aligning it with DeFi standards. Rising Client Demand The derivatives marketplace announced in a Thursday statement that, subject to regulatory green light, it plans to offer customers the ability to trade cryptocurrency futures and options “24 hours a day, seven days a week” starting in early 2026. The initiative is driven by growing user demand for continuous risk management and liquidity. “While not all markets lend themselves to operating 24/7, client demand for around-the-clock cryptocurrency trading has grown as market participants need to manage their risk every day of the week,” said Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equities, FX and Alternative Products at CME Group. The expanded operation hours will apply to CME’s suite of crypto products, including Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and options. Trading will be available continuously via the CME Globex electronic platform, except for a two-hour maintenance window on weekends. On the other hand, weekend and holiday trades will be done on the next business day, with clearing, settlement, and regulatory reporting processed in the same way. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said the development shows that traditional finance is quickly conforming to DeFi practices, stressing that it was “just the beginning.” At a joint roundtable hosted by the SEC and CFTC this week, CEO Terrence Duffy said he expects demand for around-the-clock trading to grow, noting that crypto offers the clearest path to achieving it. Other executives shared the same views, with Intercontinental Exchange CEO Jeff Sprecher highlighting that markets should determine which assets are suited for continuous trading. Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman explained that her firm is working toward 24/5 equities but still faces practical challenges. Crypto Derivatives Hit Record Highs CME’s initiative might attract institutions seeking the security of a regulated exchange while avoiding the limitations of standard market hours. If approved, it could position the platform ahead of offshore rivals that already run nonstop but operate with less regulatory oversight. Meanwhile, the company’s crypto derivatives have reached new highs in 2025, with notional open interest hitting a record $39 billion in September. In August, average daily open interest rose by 95% from last year to 335,200 contracts, while average daily volume jumped 230% to 411,000 contracts. The exchange also reported a record of more than 1,010 large open interest holders across its crypto offerings.

The coin design was ordered by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach, who currently oversees the Mint. It shows Trump’s face on one side, and his fist raised before an American flag on the other, with the words: “FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.” The project stems from bipartisan legislation passed in 2020, which Trump signed during his first term. That law gives the Treasury Secretary authority to issue $1 coins in 2026 that must reflect the United States’ semiquincentennial. While the design isn’t final, a spokesperson said the draft “reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles.” They added, “Despite the radical left’s forced shutdown of our government, the facts are clear: Under the historic leadership of President Donald J. Trump, our nation is entering its 250th anniversary stronger, more prosperous, and better than ever before.” Brandon Beach commented in a post on X that more details would be released “once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over.” Trump pushes $1,000 to $2,000 rebate checks from tariffs On Thursday, Trump floated new checks for Americans, paid for with tariff revenues from his trade agenda. In an interview with One America News Network, Trump said the tariffs imposed on foreign countries are now starting to kick in, and he claimed they’d soon total “over a trillion dollars a year.” He added, “We’re thinking maybe $1,000 to $2,000 — it would be great,” referring to the payments being considered. He’s previously called it “a dividend to the people of America.” But he acknowledged that Congress must approve any disbursement. The idea comes as the Supreme Court prepares to hear a case next month on whether the president has the power to carry out global tariffs without congressional consent. Trump’s proposal is tied directly to that ongoing legal battle. According to Treasury data cited by Fox Business, the federal government has pulled in around $214.9 billion in tariff income so far this year. In September, $31.3 billion was collected, which was $73 million lower than August’s record. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the U.S. is expected to hit $300 billion in total tariff revenue by the end of 2025. Trump uses shutdown to target Democratic-led agencies As the federal government shutdown entered day two, Trump made it clear he sees it as a chance to slash funding for agencies he calls partisan. Speaking Thursday, Trump said Democrats handed him an “unprecedented opportunity” to start dismantling what he describes as wasteful parts of government. He pointed the blame directly at Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York and leading the opposition to his agenda. Just a day earlier, the Trump administration froze $18 billion earmarked for infrastructure projects in New York City, and canceled another $8 billion in climate-related funding for Democrat-controlled states. These cuts were announced not by the departments involved, but by Russell Vought, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Trump said he’d soon sit down with Vought “to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut.” He also said they’ll decide “whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.” On Truth Social, Trump posted, “I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-03 21:53:10

Judge ruled NFTs were consumable collectibles, not investment contracts Judge Fernando M. Olguin found no common enterprise or explicit profit promise tied to Yuga’s NFT sales. Court cited precedent that most digital assets are not securities and noted independent fees and public blockchain trading data. Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed: Judge rules BAYC NFTs not securities under Howey Test — read the ruling and implications for NFT buyers and markets. What is the ruling in the Yuga Labs lawsuit? Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed by Judge Fernando M. Olguin concluded the plaintiffs failed to show Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), ApeCoin (APE) and other Yuga NFTs qualify as securities under the Howey Test. The court held purchasers bought consumable digital collectibles and membership perks, not investment contracts tied to Yuga’s efforts. How did the court apply the Howey Test to BAYC and ApeCoin? The judge assessed the three Howey prongs—an investment of money, a common enterprise, and an expectation of profit produced by others—and found the plaintiffs proved none. The ruling noted Yuga marketed NFTs as collectibles with membership benefits and did not make explicit profit promises to buyers. Judge Olguin dismisses investor lawsuit against Yuga Labs. Source: Court Listener Why did the court find no common enterprise or profit expectation? Judge Olguin determined the NFTs’ trading on public blockchains and the transactional structure did not create the ongoing, dependent financial relationship required for a common enterprise. Fees paid to Yuga were treated as independent charges, and the roadmap and promotional statements did not equate to enforceable profit promises. The court emphasized: “Statements about a product’s inherent or intrinsic value are not necessarily statements about profit.” Even references to past prices or trading volumes were insufficient to establish an actionable expectation of profit under Howey. What evidence and precedent influenced the decision? The ruling referenced legal precedent that most digital assets are not automatically securities and examined specific contractual and marketing language from Yuga. Commentary from market participants and attorneys — including public posts by industry lawyers — were discussed as factual context without altering the court’s statutory analysis. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed: Judge finds BAYC and ApeCoin not securities under Howey Test"", ""description"": ""Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed: Judge rules BAYC NFTs not securities under the Howey Test and finds no common enterprise or explicit profit promises."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199abe3-4502-79f8-bcbf-3bfe50df810b"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/yuga-labs-lawsuit-dismissed"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How the court applied the Howey Test to Yuga Labs NFTs"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step summary of how Judge Olguin evaluated whether Yuga Labs NFTs are investment contracts under the Howey Test."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199abe3-4502-79f8-bcbf-3bfe50df810b"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Identify the investment of money"", ""text"": ""The court reviewed whether purchasers provided money or its functional equivalent when buying NFTs."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess common enterprise"", ""text"": ""The judge examined whether buyers’ fortunes were linked to Yuga Labs through an ongoing dependent financial relationship."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Evaluate expectation of profit"", ""text"": ""The court analyzed marketing, roadmaps and public statements to determine if Yuga promised profits derived from others’ efforts."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are BAYC NFTs and ApeCoin securities after this ruling?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. The court dismissed the lawsuit, finding plaintiffs did not show BAYC NFTs or ApeCoin met the Howey Test requirements to be securities."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What did the court say about promises of profit?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The judge ruled that product-value statements and mentions of trading volumes alone did not constitute explicit promises of profit sufficient to meet Howey’s expectation-of-profit prong."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does this ruling change SEC policy on digital assets?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""This decision is a federal court ruling applying Howey to specific facts; it provides judicial analysis but does not unilaterally change SEC regulation or enforcement policy."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Do the court’s findings apply to all NFTs? The decision applies to the specific facts of the Yuga Labs case. It reinforces that classification depends on contractual terms, marketing, purchaser expectations and how tokens function in practice. What role did the project roadmap play in the ruling? The roadmap and forward-looking statements were reviewed but the court found they did not create enforceable promises of profit tied to Yuga’s efforts, and thus did not satisfy the Howey expectation-of-profit prong. Key Takeaways Legal outcome : Federal judge dismissed investor claims that BAYC and related NFTs are securities. Howey Test application : Plaintiffs failed to show a common enterprise or clear expectation of profit produced by Yuga. Market implication : The ruling underscores that NFT classification is fact-specific; creators should clarify marketing and purchaser expectations. Conclusion The Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissal clarifies how a federal court applied the Howey Test to iconic NFTs, emphasizing that marketing as consumable collectibles and the absence of explicit profit promises weigh against securities classification. Market participants should document product features and communications to reduce regulatory ambiguity.

MAGACOIN FINANCE can be seen as one of the highest analyst picks that is expected to have an ROI of 55x at the end of 2025. XRP is in the meantime clinging to major support, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is drawing the interest of whales from ETFs. Analysts indicate that the next altcoin season might be determined by these three coins, with MAGACOIN FINANCE becoming one of the best presale opportunities to deliver high returns. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best crypto presale Analysts place MAGACOIN FINANCE as the best crypto presale that could bring a 55x ROI by the end of 2025. This is an early-stage project that operates on the Ethereum blockchain with a deflationary token model and a transaction burn rate of 12% , meant to lower supply and push demand long term. It has independent smart contract audits, adding credibility to it, while aiding in ensuring investors of transparency and security in a time when trust is critical. Future exchange listings increase the presale momentum. By offering early buyers a potential return from increased demand when listings become available, analysts expect MAGACOIN FINANCE to have a healthy debut. Its mix of proven smart contracts, tokenomics based on scarcity, and aggressive growth strategy makes it stand out among dozens of speculative crypto presales on the market. In addition to technical strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in line with the major market trends. History has demonstrated that quality projects with strong fundamentals and a supportive community can perform well during the altcoin season. The project is anchoring its value proposition on both scarcity and adoption, thus creating a place of sustainable relevance. XRP price holds support as analysts monitor october move XRP is still under the watch of analysts, retaining the $2.67 support level , which has been defended over the months. Starting around $3.65 in July, XRP calmed down following Bitcoin, which went down to a low of about $109,000 after reaching a high of $125,000. However, analysts suggest the pullback is a good rest before possible upside to $7 in October. Supported by many macro and regulatory triggers, the spot crypto ETF application is undergoing review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, while the MiCA framework in Europe is progressing towards bringing digital asset clarity. Also, a speculation by traders that the Federal Reserve rate may be cut to $3.75-$4.00 could open up institutional inflows. Such advances would raise liquidity and trust in crypto markets, and XRP would have the catalyst to break out. Under this larger construct, MAGACOIN FINANCE will attract investors willing to have an early exposure with high growth prospects, rather than well-established projects such as XRP. With analysts estimating the Ethereum-based presale to yield 55x ROI , some traders are cashing in on XRP profits to purchase outsized presales to earn disproportionate profits. DOGE price steadies as whales accumulate and ETF buzz builds Dogecoin (DOGE) is drawing attention from analysts, having withstood volatilities in the market and held the support level of $0.22 . On-chain data show that whales purchased 2 billion DOGE in 48 hours , contributing almost $480 million to its market value. This aggressive buildup has been a historical precursor of price rallies, which is an indicator of a possible bullish action in the coming weeks. On the other hand, sentiment is also driven by institutional adoption. The recently introduced REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF had inflows in excess of $8.7 million, and corporate investors like Thumzup Media are introducing DOGE to treasury reserves. Moreover, such moves, coupled with technical arrangements towards $0.30 and $0.35, according to analysts, indicate a stronger long-term development. With this bullish backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a presale opportunity that strengthens the upside of established names such as Dogecoin by having greater early-stage growth prospects. Conclusion According to analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best crypto presale with a 55x ROI expectation , whose smart contracts and tokenomics are audited. As both XRP and Dogecoin remain strong contenders with institutional-level engagement and solid price action, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents an exceptional opportunity to get outsized returns before mainstream listings, placing the altcoin at the center stage in the next altcoin season.

It has clear resilience in one coin but overall weakness. Even during bouts of volatility, it is evident that the bull market shows no sign of dying. The conditions for expansion continue to be in place, from broad accumulation and undervalued altcoins to macro tailwinds, sentiment cycles and narrative rotation. If you aren’t looking at Bitcoin or Ethereum, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE could potentially benefit greatly as capital looks for profit upside. In the following paragraphs, I will highlight five major signs of durability this cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s role within the larger ecosystem, and provide tactical guardrails for participation. 1. High Proportion of Altcoins Below Key Moving Averages The altcoin universe is rife with latent upside, which is one of the most promising signals for bull market longevity. Despite a wider rally in crypto, 76 % of utcoins on major exchanges are still trading below their 200-day simple moving average (SMA), latest data indicates. This suggests that much of the market could still be in accumulation/discount zones instead of overbought areas. This difference means that if the feeling and money availability are right, many altcoins can go up. Furthermore, it lowers the odds of a straight reversal because strong bull markets tend to rally off weakness, meaning capital rotations in from laggards after leading assets confirm strength. 2. Declining Selling Pressure and Stabilizing Accumulation A strong bull market comes from confidence, not just momentum. A drop in selling pressure by long-term holders is one subtle but strong sign, paired with steady accumulation. Based on on-chain and exchange metrics, large level distributions appear to have slowed, whereas mid-tier wallets are seeing inflows. In other words, that kind of behavior indicates building of patience behind the moving averages, not panic buying at tops. In this market, crypto does not necessarily have to keep making new highs, but must avoid aggressive breakdowns. That ability to be resilient under pressure is a sign of deeper cycles. When accumulation zones hold, confidence returns and rotation into speculation becomes possible. 3. Macro Liquidity Tailwinds & Rate Dynamics Supporting Risk Assets Bull markets in crypto rarely exist in a vacuum. The situation with macro backdrops, especially liquidity flows and central bank policy direction affects strength. The latest investor expectations regarding interest rate cuts for late 2025 could lessen discounting pressures on the growth assets. Liquidity across the global markets is loosening and money flows from equities, private markets, and institutional allocations are eyeing digital assets. That cross-asset momentum can amplify crypto cycles. In previous runs, a considerable amount of the strongest legs came from macro/sector alignment. Speculators are aggressive when the risk appetite arises and rates fall. 4. Narrative Rotation and Expanding Themes Analysts are pointing to five key signals showing the bull market remains intact, from ETF inflows to rising retail participation. Within that framework, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining mention as a presale embodying the speculative wealth-creation angle. With contract audits from CertiK and HashEx , it avoids the pitfalls of many short-lived launches, while still carrying scenarios of 100x-style generational wealth outcomes under extreme bullish conditions. For long-term investors, the takeaway is clear: combining secure majors with small presale bets like MAGACOIN FINANCE is a way to capture both safety and exponential potential. As signals confirm bull strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being highlighted as the speculative ticket that could transform modest entries into cycle-defining wealth stories. Rather than competing with top alts, MAGACOIN FINANCE acts as a high-reward complement, an asset where flows looking for hidden alpha might concentrate once macro and narrative conditions are favorable. 5. Institutional & Retail Flows Still Entering – Not Exiting One of the easiest distinctions between a bull market that is tired and one that has matured is large flows. At the high points in the market cycle, we see exits and liquidations. For the time being, we’re seeing flows into Bitcoin and early-stage speculative allocations. ETF trackers are indicating sustained demand for spot Bitcoin funds. Retail and small cap interest remains healthy. Metrics show people are just re-engaging, not capitulating. In addition, retail search trends and social sentiment show this. The so-called “stable core inflows” plus speculative appetites form a stable core around which other financial systems can revolve. It indicates that there is more than just momentum driving the market, but new capital. Putting the Signs Together: Bull Market Underlying Strength A combination of five items including selling pressure, altcoins trading below long-term averages, macro tailwinds, narrative expansion, and institutional/retail flows can provide a blueprint for a bull market with legs. These signals show structural resilience, rather than a single breakout or hype event. Many cycles fail when one or more of these pillars breaks—the macro tightening, the narrative exhaustion, and the wholesale exits. But for now, the architecture remains intact. Tactical Strategy & Risk Management To position yourself through such a phase, here’s a disciplined approach: Anchor a core portfolio in BTC/ETH and market leaders. Allocate a growth bucket to promising alts with fundamentals. Reserve a tactical optional bucket for high-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Use layered entries in speculative assets – don’t rush all capital at once. Watch confirmation triggers : volume breakouts, listing announcements, accumulation bursts. Maintain tight stop or reallocation zones to guard against sharp reversals. Track macro and narrative inflection points closely – liquidity, rate shifts, regulatory developments matter. Conclusion The crypto bull market still shows signs of life in the midst of noise. The entire cycle architecture is still intact, from undervalued alts and decreasing selling to macro support and narrative rotation and consistent inflows. Now, the real difference comes from where capital allocates next. During this stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE type projects are not very core holdings rather leveraged optionality at this stage. When the cycle expands outwards, they often capture disproportionate upside. For traders and allocators who are ready to balance the structured as well as the asymmetric bets; this stage could be one of the most rich when it comes to opportunities in the evolving history of crypto.

Ripple (XRP) remains a favorite, with its strong position in cross-border payments and ongoing regulatory progress maintaining it firmly in the crosshairs of institutional investors. Attention is now, however, trending more in the direction of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at a mere $0.035 in its Phase 6 presale, now over 55% sold out, MUTM is generating colossal hype among early adopters and whales alike. With 16,710+ addresses and $16.7 million raised, Mutuum Finance is turning out to be a DeFi altcoin with the potential to overshadow industry stalwarts like XRP, making it one of the most promising cryptos to buy now. XRP Experiences Symmetrical Triangle Breakout as SEC ETF Gives Updates XRP is forming a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart, which would represent a breakout after recent price action higher. Price currently is trading in this pattern, where the breakout zone is at approximately $3.15, and a confirmed move above this point would seek to reach $3.50 and beyond based on previous momentum. Close resistance is seen around $3.08, and a heavy volume breakout would signal bullish continuation and good trading entries. With the US SEC withdrawing delay notices for XRP and other crypto ETFs, the market is poised for potential upside, and XRP is a key stock to watch on the watchlist. Meanwhile, investor focus is also turning towards emerging Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is drawing rising interest in addition to established rivals. MUTM Presale Momentum Expands Velocity MUTM tokens currently cost $0.035 during Presale Round 6, a 16.17% rise from the previous round. Extremely firm investor appetite persists with over 16,710 investors moving over $16.7 million into the project so far. As a further step in enhancing platform security, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat developers and hackers are welcome to report bugs. Four levels of severity of bugs, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, are made available so that bugs could be detected early and remediated. It is based on robust collateral management to protect the network and participants. Unlimited deposit limits, lending limits, and collateral ratios are some of the properties that secure it. Undercollateral position real-time closing and remediation charges and penalties stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is at the very center of the design of Mutuum Finance. Through LTV ratio optimization and assuming overcollateralized positions, the protocol engages as much capital as possible with effective guards. Reserve requirements are employed to act as a shock absorber to market volatilities, and reserves overlying can be employed to hedge volatility in risk assets. Mutuum Finance is reshaping decentralized finance on three axes: long-term sustainability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable lending and borrowing platform is bringing DeFi to the retail and institutional investor bases. As a gesture to its growing base, Mutuum Finance launched a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 winners would be given $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. The move is an indication of the platform’s intent to reward early adopters, as well as showcase its vision more prominently. Position Early for the ETF-Driven Surge With the ETF approval environment growing as rapidly as it is, both Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are set to benefit. XRP’s proven track record as a major international payment contender and regulatory progress keep it among the institutional exposure leaders. Yet those hoping for even greater upside have a limited early-stage window in MUTM. The project has already raised more than $16.7 million from more than 16,710 investors so far, with Phase 6 of its presale more than 55% sold and tokens still at $0.035. Its dual lending ecosystem, collateral optimization, and $50,000 bug bounty contribute to platform security and long-term upside, while a $100,000 giveaway encourages early adoption. Since ETF approvals drive market expansion at an accelerating pace, securing a stake in MUTM today might provide substantial returns during the next notable bull cycle.

According to crypto analyst Kevin, the historical risk levels that usually mark cycle tops are currently nowhere near flashing red for Dogecoin. Chart analysis of Dogecoin’s historical risk levels shows that the meme coin is still sitting in what looks like a mid-cycle phase, and the kind of overheated price action that preceeds exhaustion has not yet appeared. Dogecoin Historical Risk Levels Point To More Upside Kevin’s latest post on the social media platform X showcased Dogecoin’s historical risk levels in a color-coded chart between 0 and 1, with 0 being the lowest risk and 1 being the highest risk. The chart, which covers many cycles going as far back as 2014, shows moments when risk was at extreme levels and prices were near exhaustion. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts What Dogecoin Investors Should Expect Price-Wise This Month Periods of high market exhaustions are classified in warm colors, with red being the highest. For instance, Dogecoin’s all-time high in 2021 was classified by a red risk level. On the other hand, those of low market activity are classified in cool colors, with deep blue being the lowest level of activity. The current reading of 0.52 is far from those red danger zones, which have historically aligned with blow-off tops. Instead, Dogecoin is currently in what Kevin describes as a mid-cycle state. That assessment aligns with the latest price action, which shows Dogecoin now holding above $0.25 after last week’s consolidation between $0.22 and $0.23. Dogecoin’s Biggest Move Still Ahead? With the latest Dogecoin risk level sitting at around 0.52, this suggests that Dogecoin has not yet entered the type of frenzy that often defines the final phase of a cycle. Therefore, it means that the king of meme coin still has a lot of rally to play out, and there’s the possibility of charting a path to a new all-time high if crypto market conditions provide the right backdrop. We have not had that type of price action yet this cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Dogecoin Price To See Face-Melting Rally: The Bullish Pattern That Suggests New Highs Kevin’s latest update builds on observations he made earlier in August, where he noted the importance of monthly Stoch RSI crosses during bull market environments. Whenever Dogecoin registered such crosses outside of bear markets, the result was a massive upside rally. At that time, the Stoch RSI was climbing from the 13 level, and this is associated with weak momentum turning into strength. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2554, meaning it is up by about 12.5% in the past 24 hours. Given the current setup and the possibility of a Spot Dogecoin ETF hitting the US market soon, it is reasonable to expect that Dogecoin could climb much higher before it enters the overheated territory. In this case, hitting the $1 price level is not out of the question.

Solana’s ongoing upward trend in price has coincided with a remarkable surge in the blockchain’s on-chain activity and adoption. Q3 Blockchain Revenue Race Heats Up, And Solana Is Leading Following a recent rally in the price of SOL, there has been a strong uptick in on-chain activity and engagement. Specifically, the Solana blockchain is experiencing substantial inflows, as revenue increases sharply. The report from Solana’s official page on the social media platform X reveals that the blockchain is witnessing one of the fastest revenue growth rates in history. A surge in user activity, active DeFi participation, and a surge in demand for on-chain applications likely drive this sharp growth in revenue . Furthermore, the development highlights the blockchain’s competitive advantage and durability in a dense market. While competitors have found it difficult to keep up, Solana’s effectiveness and scalability keep drawing in developers and funding, putting it at the vanguard of blockchain ecosystem expansion and profitability. According to the data, Solana has cemented its position as a top-performing blockchain in the third quarter of this year in terms of overall revenue generated in the quarter. With over $222 million in revenue recorded in Q3, the blockchain has surpassed all major crypto networks in the sector. It is worth noting that after dominating Q3 of 2025, Solana has now led all major crypto networks for 4 consecutive quarters as number 1. SOL’s persistent dominance in revenue for the past four quarters is obviously sending a strong message about SOL’s place in the future of decentralized finance and scalable blockchain infrastructure. Over the last year, the platform highlighted that users on the SOL blockchain have paid the network more than $2.1 billion for blockspace. Interestingly, data shows that over 46% of the entire fees were paid in cryptocurrency. SOL Blockchain Is Becoming The Hub For Stablecoins The Solana blockchain’s adoption and interest are evidenced by the large number of stablecoin flows on the chain. In another X post from the official Solana page, stablecoin adoption on SOL is surging at an unprecedented pace when compared to other chains. In terms of stablecoin inflows , the SOL blockchain is at the top, outpacing all layer 1 and layer 2 chains over a period of 24 hours. This development implies that SOL is becoming the go-to settlement layer for stablecoin transfers due to its lightning-fast transaction speeds and incredibly cheap costs, which encourage record inflows and on-chain activity. With this dramatic increase in stablecoin inflows, SOL’s role in global crypto payments and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is clearly growing. In addition, it solidifies the network’s standing as the leading hub for dollar-pegged assets in the dynamic blockchain market.",Solana|decentralized finance|DeFi|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana Blockchain|Solana news|Solana price|solusd|SOLUSDT|stablecoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 22:00:30

The charter would allow Coinbase to build on its existing custody business by offering services such as payments and settlement, without seeking a charter as a full-service bank. ""Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank,"" Greg Tusar, vice president of institutional product at Coinbase, said in a blog post. ""It is our firm belief that clear rules and the trust of our regulators and customers enable Coinbase to confidently innovate while ensuring proper oversight and security."" Today, the U.S. crypto exchange's main regulated custody service is run through Coinbase Custody Trust Company (CCTC), which is licensed under New York state’s BitLicense regime. That framework, introduced in 2015, was one of the earliest state-level regulatory models for crypto in the U.S. A federal trust charter would give the company more flexibility to launch new financial services such as crypto payments without needing state-by-state approvals.

World Liberty Financial Sets Its Sights on Expansion Witkoff, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, made the announcement alongside WLF co-founder Donald Trump Jr. at the Singapore-based crypto event on October 1. “We’ll be rolling out a pilot program here in the next quarter, and that debit card will either be live Q4 or Q1 ‘26,” Witkoff said. The WLF CEO also touted that the organization is “actively working” on the tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, oil, and gas.

In March 2025, WLF launched USD1, a dollar-pegged stablecoin that the digital asset organization dubs “the US dollar…for a new era.” In May, WLF announced that MGX, a state-backed Abu Dhabi firm, planned to invest $2 billion worth of USD1 into crypto exchange Binance. Critics have argued that the deal poses serious ethics violations , with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley calling it “a staggering conflict of interest.” “This deal raises the troubling prospect that the Trump and Witkoff families could expand the use of their stablecoin as an avenue to profit from foreign corruption,” the U.S. lawmakers said. Despite concerns, it appears that WLF is pressing ahead with its tokenization and crypto payment ventures.

In a statement released on October 2, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), chaired by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, pointed out vulnerabilities in so-called “third country multi-issuer” stablecoin models and called for immediate policy action. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a steady value by pegging to fiat currencies or government securities, have surged over the past five years into a market worth more than $300 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The sector is dominated by dollar-backed tokens, with Tether’s USDT controlling more than 58% of the market. Euro-backed tokens, by contrast, account for just 0.15% of the global total. The ESRB, during its 59th General Board meeting on September 25, stressed that interchangeable tokens issued both within and outside the EU contain “built-in vulnerabilities.” Lagarde Pushes Back on Offshore Stablecoin Structures Under MiCA Gaps Under this structure, EU-regulated issuers must hold reserves locally, while non-EU partners manage identical tokens backed abroad. Regulators warn that during times of stress, investors could rush to redeem in the EU, overwhelming local reserves and leaving the bloc exposed to offshore liabilities. According to people familiar with discussions, the ESRB endorsed a recommendation to ban such models. Though non-binding, the move places pressure on EU authorities to either impose restrictions or outline other protections. At its meeting on 25 September, the General Board assessed the main risks to EU financial stability. Read the press release https://t.co/WHx4JHyIWc pic.twitter.com/YmVEGSIB4D — European Systemic Risk Board (@ESRBofficial) October 2, 2025 Both the ECB and ESRB declined to comment on the proposal, but Lagarde has repeatedly shown concern that the bloc’s regulatory framework, known as MiCA, leaves gaps in coverage for cross-border schemes. Lagarde compared the risk to past banking crises, where liquidity mismatches and inadequate reserves destabilized institutions across borders. She argued that unless strong equivalence regimes and safeguards for cross-border transfers are introduced, multi-issuer models should not be permitted to operate in Europe. The warnings come as global financial risks remain elevated. The ESRB noted that investor optimism has pushed asset valuations to record highs, leaving markets vulnerable to reversals. While stress tests show European banks are resilient, weak growth prospects and rising fiscal pressures continue to weigh on stability. The board pointed to ongoing geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies as additional challenges for Europe’s financial outlook. Stablecoins Face Rising Global Scrutiny as Regulators Warn of Systemic Risks Stablecoins are also under scrutiny elsewhere. Earlier this month, the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee warned that poorly managed reserves could trigger fire sales and destabilize broader markets. The committee also flagged the risk of currency substitution, where foreign-denominated stablecoins weaken the use of domestic money. On October 1, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said systemic stablecoins may gain access to central bank accounts but warned that such tokens could reshape Britain’s financial system by separating money-holding from credit provision. Bank of England Governor says stablecoins could reduce UK reliance on commercial banks while proposing controversial ownership caps. #UK #Stablecoin https://t.co/TW5EGT8a6O — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 1, 2025 In the United States, regulators have moved in a different direction. In July, Congress passed the GENIUS Act , the first federal law covering stablecoins, which sets capital and reserve requirements for issuers. Analysts at Morningstar DBRS project the market could exceed $1 trillion in annual payments by 2030. The firm described stablecoins as programmable money, combining fiat stability with blockchain efficiency to deliver faster, cheaper payments compared to systems such as SWIFT or wire transfers. Still, the rapid expansion of stablecoins has unsettled parts of the U.S. banking sector. Trade associations warn that adoption could drain deposits and disrupt lending. Coinbase has countered this view by releasing research in August , arguing that fears of deposit flight are overstated and that stablecoins reinforce the global role of the dollar. Coinbase published a defense against banking claims that stablecoins threaten financial stability, calling the ""deposit erosion"" narrative a ""myth"" protecting banks' $187 billion monopoly. #Coinbase #Stablecoin https://t.co/Kpshr7e1K2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 16, 2025 The exchange noted that banks already hold trillions in reserves at the Federal Reserve, offering little benefit to depositors, while stablecoins provide higher yields and near-instant settlement. For European regulators, the debate extends beyond banking competition. Officials warn that reliance on dollar-based tokens undermines financial sovereignty and weakens the effectiveness of monetary policy. ECB adviser Jürgen Schaaf has cautioned that the dominance of U.S. issuers such as Tether and Circle leaves Europe dependent on offshore structures. Circle and Paxos are among the issuers most affected by the EU’s proposed restrictions. Both manage reserves primarily in U.S. dollars and short-term Treasuries, while their EU operations are overseen by regulators in France and Finland. Authorities in both countries have so far declined to comment. The ESRB said it will publish a detailed report on stablecoins, crypto-investment products, and multi-function financial groups in the coming weeks. Its latest risk dashboard shows systemic risks in the EU remain “elevated,” reinforcing why stablecoins are now viewed as a pressing concern.

AI agents will route liquidity to the best-priced, most reliable stablecoins. Regulatory clarity and growing market depth have pushed stablecoins past $300 billion in market cap. Autonomous agents could compress fees, boost transaction volume and reshape payments infrastructure. AI agents stablecoins — Learn how AI routing can turn fragmentation into a competitive advantage; read expert insights and next steps. AI agents stablecoins are autonomous programs that can detect pricing and liquidity across issuers and instantly move funds to the most efficient stablecoin, potentially making fragmentation a market-level optimizer rather than a barrier to adoption. What is the role of AI agents in stablecoin adoption? AI agents stablecoins means autonomous software will analyze rates, liquidity and counterparty risk, then execute transfers to the optimal issuer. This capability can reduce user friction and ensure liquidity concentrates where execution and economics are best, speeding stablecoin adoption for payments and commerce. How could fragmentation become an advantage? Fragmentation historically creates liquidity silos and user confusion. But AI agents can treat fragmentation as a selection mechanism. By continuously comparing issuer economics, agents can route transactions to the lowest-cost provider. That competitive pressure may compress spreads, raise service quality and force issuers to improve fundamentals. Why has stablecoin market cap reached $300 billion and what does that mean? The stablecoin market exceeded $300 billion due to clearer regulation in major jurisdictions, institutional demand and increased retail use. Higher market cap increases depth and reduces slippage, making automated routing by AI agents more effective and reliable. Who are the key market participants and emerging models? Major dollar-backed issuers, algorithmic and synthetic stablecoins, and corporate-backed tokens like PayPal’s PYUSD now coexist. Each model offers different tradeoffs in liquidity, redemption mechanics and settlement speed. Market participants include industry leaders and new entrants building on unique business integrations. The rise of AI agents in crypto: what industry leaders say Paxos Labs co-founder Bhau Kotecha warns fragmentation can create confusion but adds AI agents will “switch instantly” to the best economics, turning fragmentation into a market optimizer. Similar views were expressed by other industry figures who expect agents to become core stablecoin users. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz highlighted that AI agents can drive transaction volumes for stablecoins by handling routine purchases on behalf of users, replacing slower settlement rails. Which companies are building relevant infrastructure? Cloudflare announced a project called NET dollar to enable instant AI-driven transactions. Other industry teams are experimenting with payment standards—examples include discussions around HTTP 402 as a payments primitive for agent-driven commerce. These initiatives point to an emerging stack combining fast rails, stablecoins and intelligent routing. NET Dollar stablecoin characteristics. Source: Cloudflare (mentioned as plain text) How will AI agents change fees, liquidity and user experience? AI agents can compress fees by constantly selecting lower-cost execution venues and aggregating liquidity. That reduces friction for end users and can enable micro-payments that were uneconomical with higher fees. Improved UX arises from agents handling complexity—users delegate choices and see fewer failed transactions or confusing options. Stablecoin ecosystem participants. Source: Ethereum Foundation (mentioned as plain text) What are the risks and required infrastructure changes? Risks include concentration of systemic liquidity, oracle and routing manipulation, and interoperability gaps across chains and custodians. Addressing these requires intent-based blockchain primitives, robust auditability and user data controls. Experts like Adrian Brink emphasize the need for intent-based infrastructure so users retain control over data and assets while agents act on their behalf. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can AI agents reduce stablecoin fragmentation?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

AI agents evaluate economics, liquidity, settlement speed and counterparty risk, then route transactions to the issuer that optimizes those factors for the user’s intent. Are AI agents already using stablecoins today? Companies and research teams are building prototypes and standards; early production use is limited but accelerating as rails and regulation mature. Key Takeaways AI agents can optimize liquidity : Autonomous routing concentrates flows to efficient issuers, improving execution. Fragmentation may become competitive : Multiple issuer models can coexist if agents handle selection efficiently. Infrastructure matters : Intent-based primitives, fast rails and transparent pricing are prerequisites for safe adoption. Conclusion AI agents stablecoins are poised to change how stablecoins are used by routing liquidity, lowering costs and enabling new commerce models. As market cap grows past $300 billion, the focus shifts to building secure rails and standards so agents can safely act on users’ behalf.

Bitcoin, the $2 trillion cornerstone of the digital asset market, is currently trading about 4% shy of its record high of $124,128. It advanced 2% overnight, mirroring the 2% increase in overall crypto market capitalization, which has now reached $4.19 trillion. Historically, October, (nicknamed “Uptober”), has been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, adding weight to expectations that new peaks for leading cryptocurrencies may be just around the corner. Meanwhile, U.S. policy shifts are providing additional tailwinds. In July, President Trump enacted the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first federal law requiring stablecoins to maintain full reserve backing. Soon after, the SEC unveiled Project Crypto, a sweeping modernization effort to align securities regulations with the digital asset space. With clearer rules emerging, some analysts believe the upcoming altcoin run could even surpass the heights of 2021. If DeepSeek’s predictions play out, XRP, Solana, and Pepe could be at the forefront of this move. XRP (Ripple): DeepSeek AI Sees Path Toward $10 According to DeepSeek, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could rally to $10 by the end of 2025, more than triple its current $3.04 price point. Source: DeepSeek AI The token has already shown resilience this year, briefly touching $3.65 on July 18, its highest since 2018’s $3.40 peak, before sliding back 16.5% due to various macro-economic and political pressures. Ripple continues to strengthen its payments infrastructure, securing institutional adoption worldwide. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund recognized XRP as a cost-effective remittance tool for developing nations. A major turning point came in early 2025, when the SEC officially dropped its long-running lawsuit after a 2023 court decision ruled that retail XRP sales did not constitute securities. DeepSeek believes that a decisive breakout above the July high could set XRP on course for $5 to $10 before year-end. ChatGPT and other AI models even suggest a more aggressive scenario, projecting potential runs toward $20. Over the past year, XRP has gained 492%, dramatically quintupling Bitcoin’s 99% and Ethereum’s 90% gains over the same period. Technicals are favorable as well, with three bullish flag formations developing in 2023, hinting at high upside potential into Q4. Although Fed rate cuts and the launch of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t trigger an immediate breakout. However, Uptober hype, new ETF approvals in mid-October, and fresh U.S. crypto legislation by Christmas could be powerful catalysts. Solana (SOL): DeepSeek AI Predicts a Surge Toward $1,200 Solana ($SOL) has firmly established itself as a leading smart contract blockchain, boasting a market cap above $124.8 billion and over $12.6 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its ecosystem. Developer activity and institutional adoption remain strong and expanding. Speculation is building that a spot Solana ETF in the U.S. could soon emerge, potentially sparking inflows similar to those seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Adding fuel to the narrative, President Trump has floated the possibility of incorporating Solana into a proposed U.S. Bitcoin reserve. Under his concept, however, the government would only acquire SOL through asset seizures, not direct buying. In terms of price action, Solana peaked at $250 in January, slipped to $100 in April, and rebounded to $247 on September 19, nearly retesting this year’s highs. At it’s current price of $230, it’s once more eying a new high watermark. Now breaking out of a bullish flag, DeepSeek projects that Solana could reach $1,200 by year-end, more than quadruple its all-time high of $293.31. Still, this target hinges on ETF approval and ongoing regulatory clarity. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin With 10× Upside Potential Pepe ($PEPE) , launched in April 2023, has quickly cemented itself as a top-three meme coin with a market capitalization of $4.2 billion, the most valuable meme coin not tied to a dog theme. Its appeal lies in cultural relevance, drawing from Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic series. Despite fierce competition, Pepe’s strong liquidity and community backing have helped it stay relevant. Elon Musk has even joked about holding Pepe alongside Dogecoin on X, further boosting its visibility. Currently priced at $0.00001003, Pepe has pulled back but continues to hold firm at key support levels. A decisive breakout above $0.000018–$0.000022 could open the path to $0.00003 by mid-autumn. DeepSeek envisions a bull market scenario where Pepe could climb as high as $0.0001, a staggering 10× jump. While such gains may be constrained by its already substantial market cap, the token could still deliver outsized performance compared to other meme plays. Technical charts show a descending wedge between November and March, a typically bullish pattern that could help drive Pepe to $0.00005 by winter, effectively quintupling its value. With U.S. regulatory clarity improving, Pepe could be positioned for far larger moves. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Side Play While DeepSeek sees propitious things for the above coins, one project that is flying under its radar is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a speculative meme coin marketing itself as Dogecoin’s long-lost degen gym bro cousin. It caters to traders drawn to high-volatility, small-cap bets backed by community hype. Unlike Dogecoin, which has matured into a large-cap asset, Maxi Doge embraces its high-risk, meme-driven identity. Since its launch, it has already raised $2.7 million in just a few weeks. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI focuses on community-led growth via Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading competitions, and upcoming partnerships. Out of its 150.24 billion tokens, 25% are allocated to a “Maxi Fund” dedicated to marketing and collaborations. Staking is live, offering rewards up to 125% APY, though yields will decline as participation increases. At present, presale tokens are available at $0.0002605, with higher pricing scheduled in future rounds. Investors can buy through the Maxi Doge website using wallets such as MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Bitcoin is holding strong near $120,400, just 3% away from its record-breaking ATH in August. But while BTC holds the spotlight, smart money is flowing rapidly into altcoins and top-performing meme coins , many of which have already hit new highs this year. What’s behind this surge? Two historic policy shifts from Washington are rewriting the rules of the game. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act , the first-ever U.S. law built to legitimize and regulate stablecoins. Then came the SEC’s Project Crypto , a sweeping initiative to modernize securities laws for the digital asset era—a clear green light for broader institutional involvement. With bullish momentum accelerating, tokens like XRP, Zcash, and Aster are quickly emerging as top picks for traders hunting the next breakout opportunity. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Pioneer and Best Large Cap Crypto Altcoin of 2025 XRP ($XRP) reached a fresh peak of $3.65 on July 18 following the passage of the GENIUS Act, surpassing its 2018 high of $3.40. Since then, it has cooled to about $3.04, reflecting a 16.5% retracement. The asset’s appeal lies in its efficiency as a low-cost, fast settlement network for international transactions, positioning it as a viable challenger to traditional payment rails like SWIFT. Partnerships with organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and rising adoption among U.S. financial firms have only strengthened its credibility. Ripple’s growing influence was highlighted when CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a White House crypto policy roundtable earlier this year. Its launch of RLUSD, a dollar-backed stablecoin, shows its ambition to carve out a slice of the potentially trillion-dollar stablecoin sector. A decisive 2023 court ruling confirmed retail XRP sales are not securities, removing a long-standing regulatory overhang and allowing the token to rally to multi-year highs. Over the past year, XRP has gained 492%, far outperforming Bitcoin’s 98% rise. After a summer breakout, the coin consolidated near $3 before its typical September correction. Currently, its RSI has risen from 45 mid-week to around 57 today, indicating that a fairly broad and quick buy-in has been happening this week. While recent rate cuts and approval of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t spark an immediate breakout, likely due to markets pricing in the news, technical patterns show multiple bullish flags forming. With additional ETF decisions expected in mid-October, analysts suggest XRP could climb anywhere between $5 and $10, or higher. Zcash ($ZEC): Privacy-First Crypto Rallies an Astonishing 172% in 7 Days Zcash ($ZEC) is a developing privacy-focused cryptocurrency that emerged in 2016 from a fork of the Bitcoin codebase. While Bitcoin’s transactions are public and pseudonymous, Zcash was engineered to offer a solution for those who seek genuine financial privacy. The core of its technology is a cryptographic breakthrough known as zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge). This innovation allows for transaction validation on a public blockchain without revealing key metadata, such as the sender, recipient, or the amount transacted. The Zcash protocol provides a unique dual-address system, giving users the choice between transparent, Bitcoin-like addresses and completely shielded addresses, allowing for selective disclosure and enabling users to share transaction details for auditing or compliance purposes while maintaining confidentiality for other transactions. In the last seven days, Zcash rallied a phenomenal 172% and now trades around $147, as demand for privacy coins surges with a broader “Uptober” rally. Zcash may have gained the most, but other projects like Dash ($DASH) and Verge ($XVG) rallied close to 100% over the last seven days. That said, Zcash’s high RSI of 92 indicates it is due a correction, which could take it back to the sub-$100 level in the short-term. However, as we move towards the New Year, bulls will likely be eying $300 as the next leg up. Aster (ASTER) Aster ($ASTER) represents a new generation of decentralized perpetual exchanges, a project born from the strategic merger of two successful DeFi protocols, Astherus and APX Finance. The platform’s objective is to bridge the gap between the user experience of centralized exchanges and the security of on-chain trading. By offering both perpetual contracts and spot trading on a single interface, Aster aims to simplify and enhance the DeFi trading experience for a broad spectrum of users, from novices to seasoned professionals. In the last fortnight, Aster rose 206% and now trades at around $194. In the last 24 hours, the price rose 6%, making it one of the most profitable cryptos all around. With Binance’s CZ continuing to promote the project, ASTER has a real chance of reaching $5 and beyond soon. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Meme-Infused Bitcoin Layer-2 and One of 2025’s Hottest Presales For those looking outside the listed tokens, over in the presales market, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is gaining momentum as one of 2025’s standout ICOs. It blends Bitcoin’s proven security with Layer-2 scalability while tapping into the viral energy of meme culture and community-led governance. The project’s mission is to expand Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling faster payments, smart contract support, and decentralized governance. So far, the presale has raised more than $21 million, with some analysts projecting 10× returns or more once it launches. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers ultra-low-cost smart contracts, a Canonical Bridge for instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp integration, meme tokens, and seamless payment rails. A recent Coinsult security audit confirmed zero vulnerabilities, increasing confidence among early investors. The HYPER token underpins the ecosystem by powering staking, governance rights, and transaction fees. Early backers can currently earn up to 56% APY through staking while also securing voting privileges once the DAO activates.

XRP trading range compressed in a descending triangle with $2.70–$2.80 support and $3.60 as the immediate breakout target. Fibonacci resistances at $3.12 (0.5), $3.25 (0.382) and $3.40 (0.236) align with recent rejection zones. Long-term inverse head-and-shoulders structure sets a $4.80 potential if neckline support holds and volume confirms the breakout. Meta description: XRP breakout setup front-loaded with primary keyword. XRP breakout nears $3.60; monitor Fibonacci resistances and volume — read technical outlook and next steps. XRP trades at $3.03 with analysts eyeing $3.60 breakout as Fibonacci levels and long-term patterns point toward $4.80 potential. XRP consolidates in a descending triangle, with analysts targeting a potential $3.60 breakout. Fibonacci levels show key resistance at $3.12, $3.25, and $3.40 before a move higher. Long-term structure signals a possible path toward $4.80 if neckline support holds firm. XRP is showing technical signs of strength as it trades near a critical breakout point. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $3.03 after rebounding from September’s low of $2.71. Chart structures and Fibonacci levels are pointing toward a possible upward move toward the $3.60 mark. What are the key technical breakout levels for XRP? XRP breakout technicals center on the descending triangle that has contained price action since August. The immediate support range sits at $2.70–$2.80 while near-term resistance clusters at $3.12, $3.25 and $3.40. Clearing these zones increases the odds of a move to $3.60 within the triangle projection. How do Fibonacci retracements shape short-term targets? Fibonacci retracement plotted from $2.67 to $3.66 places the 0.618 at $2.93, a level buyers have defended. The 0.5 and 0.382 levels at $3.12 and $3.25 respectively map to recent rejection areas. The 0.236 near $3.40 is the final resistance band before the projected $3.60 breakout target. $XRP looks set to break out of a triangle, with $3.60 as the target. pic.twitter.com/ldP7rMCCn4 — Ali (@ali_charts) October 2, 2025 Analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the triangle’s projection to $3.60, matching the July swing high. The pattern shows compressed volatility typical before decisive moves, meaning volume confirmation and a clean weekly close above the descending trendline would be meaningful confirmations. What does long-term structure indicate for XRP? Higher-timeframe structure suggests a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern with a neckline near current resistance bands. If support above the neckline holds and buyers sustain momentum, the measured target from that structure sits around $4.80. Source: JavonMarks (X) Market participation supports the technical case: spot and futures activity show elevated open interest and near $7 billion in trading volume across major venues. Rising volume during a breakout would add conviction to extension targets in the $3.85–$4.00 area and the longer-term $4.80 projection. How should traders monitor the breakout and manage risk? Traders should watch for a weekly close above the descending trendline and $3.12–$3.25 resistance band, confirmed by rising volume and open interest. Risk management should prioritize keeping stops below the $2.70–$2.80 support zone and scaling position size ahead of major resistance tests. Frequently Asked Questions Will XRP reach $3.60 soon? Short-term price action favors a move to $3.60 if XRP breaks above the descending trendline and clears resistance at $3.12–$3.40 with volume confirmation. The probability increases with a weekly close above the triangle’s upper boundary. Is $4.80 a realistic long-term target for XRP? Yes. A confirmed inverse head-and-shoulders on higher timeframes points to a measured target near $4.80, provided the neckline holds and macro liquidity conditions remain supportive. Key Takeaways Triangle consolidation: Price compressed between $2.70–$2.80 support and a descending trendline, signaling a potential breakout. Fibonacci alignment: Resistance at $3.12, $3.25 and $3.40 are key levels to clear for a move to $3.60. Volume & structure confirm: Rising volume and a weekly close above the trendline would support extensions toward $3.85–$4.00 and $4.80. Conclusion Front-loaded technical signals for the XRP breakout show a clear short-term path to $3.60 if resistance zones and the descending trendline are overcome. Long-term structure offers a $4.80 upside scenario contingent on neckline support and volume confirmation. Monitor Fibonacci levels, volume, and weekly closes for actionable signals. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@graph"": [ { ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-technical-outlook-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""XRP Nears $3.60 Breakout; Fibonacci Levels and Long-Term Structure Point to $4.80"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-33.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""XRP trades at $3.03 with analysts eyeing a $3.60 breakout; Fibonacci resistance and long-term patterns point toward $4.80 potential if neckline support holds."" }, { ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will XRP reach $3.60 soon?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""If XRP breaks above the descending trendline and clears resistance between $3.12 and $3.40 with confirming volume, the projected triangle target of $3.60 is likely."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is $4.80 a realistic long-term target for XRP?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A higher-timeframe inverse head-and-shoulders pattern targets approximately $4.80, conditional on sustained neckline support and continued market participation."" } } ] }, { ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor an XRP breakout"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step checks to validate an XRP breakout using price, Fibonacci levels, and volume."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-33.png"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-technical-outlook-2025#step1"", ""name"": ""Identify pattern and key levels"", ""text"": ""Locate the descending trendline and support at $2.70–$2.80.

Liquidations And Short Squeeze The heavy liquidation figure points to a sharp and fast move that forced leveraged traders out of the market. Short sellers bore the brunt, which helps explain the sudden surge. Rapid liquidations can push a price higher quickly, and that kind of move often brings extra volatility right after the spike.

An unexpected ADP payroll print showed a decline of 32,000 jobs in September versus forecasts calling for a 50,000 gain. Official US employment data took a timeout amid stoppage of government functions, leaving traders to weigh partial signals. The CME FedWatch tool put the odds at about 97% for a 25 bps rate cut at the October 29 Fed meeting, and it flagged another potential cut at the December 10 meeting. Those shifting rate expectations appear to have pushed some investors toward assets like gold and cryptocurrencies. Network Changes And Fee Cuts BNB Chain’s own moves helped the rally. Validators cut the minimum gas fee from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei earlier this week, following prior reductions that moved fees from 3 Gwei to 1 Gwei in April 2024 and then to 0.1 Gwei in May 2025. Block intervals were tightened from 750 milliseconds to 450 milliseconds, and proposals now aim for per-transaction fees near $0.005 with a longer-term target of $0.001. Today, all BNB Smart Chain (BSC) validators and builders have adopted the new minimum gas price of 0.05 Gwei and BSC is fully ready to accept transactions at this rate. That’s ~$0.005 per transaction, making BSC one of the most cost-efficient blockchains in crypto.

Community Speculates,https://bitcoinist.com/what-ripple-cto-resignation-mean/,"With Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz announcing plans to resign, community members have begun to speculate what this could mean for the XRP price . This comes as XRP reclaims the psychological $3 level, providing a bullish outlook for the altcoin. What Ripple CTO’s Resignation Means For The XRP Price In an X post , community member unknowDLT said that it is no coincidence that the Ripple CTO is stepping down right before XRP ETFs and global ISO 20022 adoption . He added that Schwartz knows the liquidity flood will trigger a supply shock and push XRP’s price up as it becomes the backbone for settlements. However, it is worth noting that the Ripple CTO stated that he will not be stepping down until the end of the year. As such, he is expected to still be in his role when this projected XRP price surge occurs. The XRP ETFs are expected to launch as early as this month, while the adoption of ISO 20022 could occur in November. While unknowDLT believes that the XRP price is set to rally amid Ripple’s CTO departure, crypto pundit Bitlord has suggested that this is bearish for the altcoin. He stated that it was time to sell XRP, highlighting why the resignation was suspicious. The pundit further remarked that the market is at the stage where Ripple will begin to openly admit failure. Resignation Comes Amid Increased Competition Bitlord also noted that Schwartz’s announcement came at a critical time, when SWIFT announced plans to launch its blockchain ledger. The crypto pundit had declared that it was ironic that XRP was replaced overnight by the very thing it sought to replace. With SWIFT building its ledger, there is a belief that XRP may not be the foremost crypto for payment settlement, which is bearish for the XRP price. He further explained that there is increased competition to look forward to and no clear answers from Ripple. In line with this, he remarked that the Ripple CTO stepping down to enjoy life and hobbies isn’t exactly bullish for the XRP price. The pundit also speculated that XRP can no longer dump successfully on retail, which is why Schwartz was joining Ripple’s board. He believes that this move is in preparation for an IPO . Bitlor questioned what this would mean for XRP holders , adding that they would find out in the coming months. The XRP price has climbed above $3 amid the speculations about what the Ripple CTO’s resignation could mean for the altcoin. It is also worth noting that the altcoin showed little reaction on the day Schwartz announced plans to resign. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $3.02, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Ripple|Altcoin|Bitlord|Coinmarketcap|David Schwartz|ISO 20022|ripple|SWIFT|UnknowDLT|XRP|XRP holders|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Spot ETFs|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|ALTCOIN|WALLET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 23:00:23

Analysts point to the similarities with a 37,800% explosion rally in 2017, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) is on a climb following a trend breakout. Similarly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making altcoin headlines with high presale demand and DeFi integrations. XRP Price Could Hit $5 This Altseason XRP price ended Q3 2025 at around $2.90, equivalent to a 28% quarterly gain which is the highest price recorded by the crypto. Analysts such as Milkybull Crypto believe the trend is reflecting 2017, when a comparable breakout was followed by an eventual rally to $3.31. The decisive move of the Ripple token over the $2.20-$2.30 resistance band is an indication of further strength. Moreover, there is on-chain data that confirms this bullish rally. The MVRV Z-Score is in the middle range, meaning that it can gain between $3 to $5. Mid-sized holders, with 10,000 to 100,000 XRP, are not selling, hence adding to the market confidence. Additionally, further buying pressure may be ignited by pending October ETF decision deadlines, such as Grayscale and 21Shares filings. Regardless of the above positives there is technical caution. XRP is currently 470% above the low it had in November 2024 and the weekly RSI shows divergence, indicating that it is losing momentum. XRP Price $15 Long-term Target Meanwhile, several analysts see Ripple’s current formation as the beginning of a multi-year rally toward $15 . Top analysts compared today’s quarterly breakout to 2017, when XRP quickly surpassed multi-year resistance. Technical indicators such as a symmetrical triangle and bull flag indicate eventual price increase within the range of $5-$15. Source: TradingView Following this perspective, the long-term projection of XRP gives an average price of $3.40 by December 2025 and a possible increase to $4.48 in 2026. By 2030, certain models project a peak of up to $9.86 and with the long term market momentum, there is a possibility of reaching as high as $15 with the right macroeconomic factors. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently broke above a descending trendline on the 2-hour chart, sparking predictions of a 25% short-term rally. Market analyst Satososhi1242 predicted a move toward $0.00001460 after SHIB rebounded from a retest at $0.00001158. Source: TradingView Community optimism is reinforced by larger patterns, including a potential falling wedge breakout on the weekly chart. Analyst expects a climb toward $0.00004567, while MMBTrader predicts a long-term rally as high as $0.00007730. Key SHIB price support remains near $0.00001230, a crucial level that must be maintained to sustain bullish momentum. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is Leading the Altcoin Buzz As XRP and SHIB dominate price discussions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining the crypto presale market. The Ethereum-based DeFi project has gathered over $14 million with over 13,500 holders. Alternatively, the capital efficiency and security of the project are also attractive to retail and institutional investors. Anti-rug systems and transparent vesting plans, as well as Hashex and CertiK audits all create trust in the coin. Analysts estimate returns of up to 400x , making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the best-performing altcoins to watch in the next crypto bull cycle . Conclusion XRP price records an all-time high quarterly close, supporting the argument of a rally to $5 in 2025 as well as $15 in the long term, with short-term corrections. In the meantime, a breakout in Shiba Inu price trend supports a short-term upswing, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is a powerful presale, having DeFi utility and 400x ROI. These strong points are influencing investor sentiment as the market enters the next altcoin season.

PolyMarket Split 50/50 as $500M Meme Coin Factory Faces Crash Fears,https://cryptonews.com/news/pump-fun-ath-this-year-polymarket-split-50-50-as-500m-meme-coin-factory-faces-crash-fears/,"Polymarket has opened a new prediction market centered on Pump.fun, the Solana-based meme coin launchpad that has rapidly become one of the most active platforms in the crypto ecosystem. The market lets users wager on whether Pump.fun’s token, PUMP, will reach a new all-time high by December 31, 2025. NEW POLYMARKET: Pump​.fun ATH this year? https://t.co/JqBmmJqSZn — Polymarket (@Polymarket) October 3, 2025 At present, the betting odds are split evenly, with “Yes” and “No” outcomes each priced at 50%. The balance reflects uncertainty among traders, who are weighing Pump.fun’s rapid growth against questions about its long-term sustainability. Pump.fun Drives Nearly 13M Token Launches on Solana, $500M in Fees Collected Since launching in early 2024, Pump.fun has facilitated the creation of more than 7 million tokens, according to Galaxy Research. Nearly 13 million of the 32 million tokens on Solana have been launched through Pump.fun, marking a near 300% increase in under two years. Tokens on the platform represent $4.8 billion in fully diluted market value, while Pump.fun itself has generated close to $500 million in fees. The platform’s expansion has had a direct impact on the wider Solana ecosystem. High trading volumes on Pump.fun have funneled liquidity into Solana, at times supporting gains in SOL’s price. At its peak, Pump.fun revenue reached $13.48 million in a single week between August 11 and August 17, its strongest performance since February. Over the past 30 days, the launchpad has generated around $120 million in fees, according to DefiLlama. Source: DefiLlama Daily activity remains high. In the last 24 hours, Pump.fun recorded $134.3 million in trading volume and 114,457 active addresses. More than 20,000 new tokens were deployed on the platform, while 95 “graduates” advanced beyond the bonding curve stage. Fees collected over the same period totaled $1.29 million. Source: Dune Despite these milestones, concerns linger. Data shows that 98.6% of Pump.fun tokens are classified as scams or pump-and-dump projects, raising questions about sustainability. Median holding times for Solana meme coins have also collapsed to about 100 seconds, down from 300 seconds a year earlier, showing the dominance of bots and scalpers in trading activity. Pump.fun launched its own token, PUMP, in July through an initial coin offering that raised $500 million in under 12 minutes. The token has since seen sharp moves. It reached an all-time high of $0.008819 but now trades at $0.007028, about 20% below that peak but still up 75% in the past 30 days. Its market capitalization stands at $2.48 billion, ranking it 66th on CoinGecko. The introduction of Polymarket’s new betting market adds another dimension to the story, giving investors a structured way to quantify sentiment. With odds currently split, the market highlights both confidence in Pump.fun’s explosive growth and caution over the volatility of meme coin-driven ecosystems. Pump.fun Token Gains Momentum Amid Ecosystem Upgrades and Institutional Interest Pump.fun has continued to draw attention with a mix of ecosystem updates, exchange listings, and corporate adoption, fueling bullish sentiment for its native token, PUMP. The platform’s major upgrade, Project Ascend, announced on September 2, introduced a new creator fee structure aimed at improving token sustainability . The system, called Dynamic Fees V1, lowers fees as market capitalization rises, encouraging long-term projects rather than short-lived speculative launches.

Expansion efforts have followed swiftly. In mid-September, Binance added PUMP to its spot market, offering traders a chance to share in a 350 million token reward pool. On October 1, Pump.fun announced new payment integrations with Apple Pay, Robinhood, Phantom, and others, streamlining onramps for users with low fees and instant trading access Institutional interest has also emerged. On October 2, Australia’s Fitell Corporation disclosed a purchase of 216.8 million PUMP tokens worth $1.5 million , adding them to its treasury as part of a broader Solana-focused investment strategy.

Tron supply squeeze: ~89% staked, tight circulating supply. Strong taker-buy CVD and positive funding rates support continued gains.

Key levels, funding rates and CVD confirm bullish bias with elevated volatility risk.""} What is the Tron supply crunch? Tron supply crunch refers to the steady reduction of liquid TRX available for trading as a large portion of the circulating supply is locked in staking. With nearly 89% of circulating tokens staked, the circulating float is thin, which intensifies price moves on relatively small flows. How does TRX staking affect liquidity? High staking ratios reduce available liquidity and magnify the market impact of inflows and outflows. When 89% of supply is staked, even modest taker-buy volume in futures can push the TRX price sharply higher. Conversely, a wave of unstaking or exchange inflows can produce swift corrections. Can TRX price sustain momentum above its ascending trendline? The daily chart shows TRX holding above a multi-month ascending support trendline, preserving a bullish structure. Key technical levels to watch are support near $0.331 and resistance at $0.355 , where a sustained breakout could open targets toward $0.40 and higher. Failure to maintain the ascending support would increase downside risk and could shift sentiment quickly, given the market’s elevated leverage and concentrated staked supply. Source: TradingView (price chart) What market signals confirm Tron’s next major move? Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) shows persistent taker-buy dominance, indicating futures traders are aggressively leaning long. Positive funding rates and strengthening momentum together validate the bullish thesis while also increasing liquidation risk if momentum reverses. Futures taker buy volume signals: What does CVD reveal? The CVD surge demonstrates that buy-side flow is strong and consistent, reinforcing price resilience. When taker-buy CVD rises alongside price and positive funding, it signals conviction among leveraged participants that the trend will continue. Source: CryptoQuant (on-chain / derivatives flow) TRX positive funding rates: Why they matter? Funding across TRX perpetuals is modestly positive (≈0.009% at time of writing), meaning longs pay shorts. This confirms leverage is skewed to longs and supports higher spot prices, but prolonged positive funding raises liquidation vulnerability.

High staking tightens float, and elevated leverage amplifies both gains and losses; traders should size positions conservatively and use stop management because liquidity shocks can trigger rapid moves. What signals would invalidate the bullish case for TRX? A decisive daily close below the ascending support near $0.331, combined with falling CVD and a shift to negative funding, would weaken the bullish outlook and increase downside probability. Key Takeaways Supply squeeze : Heavy staking (~89%) reduces circulating TRX and magnifies price sensitivity. Derivatives confirmation : Rising taker-buy CVD and modestly positive funding support continuation. Risk management : Monitor $0.355 resistance and $0.331 support; use position sizing and stops to manage volatility. Conclusion Tron’s supply dynamics and derivatives positioning create a bullish setup for TRX price, but the same factors raise volatility risk. Traders should watch the ascending trendline, CVD and funding rates closely. With demand intact, TRX can continue higher — yet disciplined risk controls remain essential.",News|FLOW|TRX,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRX|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-03 23:14:05

X user Kevin Capital, who is followed by more than 24,000 traders, pointed out that DOGE’s monthly chart has just triggered several buy indicators that have historically marked major breakouts.

The goal is to get the StochRSI to cross the 20 level and show follow through as anything below that level is… pic.twitter.com/FxrohrzlXo — Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) August 27, 2025 The combination of these technical indicators favors a bullish Dogecoin price prediction that could see the token rising to $1 first during this cycle and possibly to $10 in the long term. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Needs to Break Out of This Pattern to Start Its Next Leg Up The daily chart shows that Dogecoin has been on an uptrend for a while, making a series of higher lows along the way since October 2024. A bullish breakout above the price channel shown in the chart would set off a strong rally for the token that would likely reach those levels first. Meanwhile, if DOGE surpasses that mark, the stage will be set for another move toward $1 , meaning a new all-time high for the token. Although getting to $10 may take a while, DOGE’s long-standing upward trajectory should continue as Wall Street keeps embracing meme coins. The launch of an ETF linked to DOGE is evidence that institutional adoption is on the rise. Similarly, early crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could outperform well-established tokens during this cycle. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Brings 1000x Energy to the Trading World Maxi Doge ($MAXI) takes the legendary doge meme and turns it into the face of a trading community built for degens who love going big.

With total market capitalization climbing above $4.24 trillion, investors are preparing for what could be the most explosive phase of this cycle. XRP, ETH, and SOL are all showing signs of major breakouts following weeks of overselling and quiet accumulation. This article breaks down the technical and fundamental signals behind each coin, highlighting the levels to watch as the market gears up for its next leg higher. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETFs and Rising Open Interest Signal New ATH Incoming XRP has risen to $3.04 today, equalling a 2% gain in 24 hours and a 10% increase in a week. The major altcoin is also up by 7% in a month, while also boasting an impressive 490% increase in a year, underlying its growth in the wake of Donald Trump’s inauguration and the end of the Ripple-SEC case. There are many reasons to be bullish about XRP, including the fact that a wave of XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the coming weeks , boosting institutional demand for the token. Demand for XRP is also growing as a result of Ripple’s expansion as a firm, with the company signing multiple new partnerships in recent months, as well as expanding into new territories. This means that XRP is in a fantastic position to ride what may be the start of an end-of-year rally, judging by recent moves. Source: TradingView It looks as though XRP is going to break out of the pennant in which it has been trading in recent weeks, while its indicators are both rising strongly from oversold positions. Such changes come as open interest for XRP futures has risen back to $8 billion , having risen from just over $7 billion in August. This points to rising prices, with XRP likely to rise beyond $3.50 by the end of the month, before reaching $5 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Ethereum ($ETH) – Institutions and Company Reserves to Push Altcoin Even Higher in Q4 Ethereum has risen by 2.5% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $4,487 also representing a bullish 15% increase in the last seven days. The coin is also up by 96% in a year, giving it a good platform from which to post more gains, especially when it’s still undersold relative to recent moves. Looking at its chart, we see that it has begun to gain strong momentum, with its relative strength index (yellow) bouncing from 30 in late September to just over 50 today. Likewise, its MACD (orange, blue) is about to turn positive for the first time in a couple of weeks, implying that buying pressure will be ramping in the near term. Source: TradingView And when combined with Ethereum’s almost peerless fundamentals, this makes for a fantastic crypto price prediction for ETH. Ethereum continues to dominate the crypto ecosystem in terms of TVL ( at $93.7 billion ), while a growing number of firms have been establishing ETH reserves in recent weeks. Based on this, and based on the expectation of a bull rally, we could see the ETH price break the $5,000 barrier by the end of this month, before hearing towards $10,000 in the longer term. Crypto Price Prediction: Solana ($SOL) – Altcoin Could Break ATH in Matter of Weeks Solana has risen to $230 today, making for an 18% increase in a week and a 10% return in a month. Also of note is the fact that Solana has risen by 67% in the past year, which is arguably not that much in comparison to other major alts (especially XRP). Yet the argument to make from this is that it means that Solana still has big gains left in it this year, with the coin only 21% away from its ATH of $293. Probably the most exciting thing about Solana right now is that, as with XRP, it has several ETFs waiting to launch. We could therefore see an explosion in its price in the next couple of months, also helped by public firms opening SOL reserves and funds . Source: TradingView Its chart today suggests that it has begun to break out after the correction it sustained in late September, and its next stop is $250, which if broken could predict a climb towards its ATH. Because of the bullishness surrounding SOL, it has every chance of rising above $300 in the next few weeks, while it could comfortably near $500 in December. PEPENODE Crosses $1.6 Million in Presale: Could Mine-to-Earn Be Next Big Pepe Token? As good as the tokens above look, some traders may want to diversify into newer coins, so as to widen their exposure to potential market-beating gains. One way of doing this is to look at presale coins, which under the right circumstances can rally big once they list for the first time. An interesting example of such a token is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 coin that recently opened its ICO. Just as the legends predicted… A Virtual Mine-to-Earn platform in the palm of your hand. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/tOsvFJMgo4 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 1, 2025 It has now raised over $1.6 million in this sale, testifying to its potential once it launches. Much of this potential stems from its status as the market’s first ‘mine-to-earn’ crypto, one which gives holders the ability to earn rewards by building their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to acquire more virtual nodes, users can earn greater rewards, which the project will pay out in established meme coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin. This could drive demand for PEPENODE, which will also be open to staking, with its current yield in excess of 800%. All of this makes PEPENODE one of the more exciting presale tokens, with investors able to join its sale by going to the project’s official website . The token is currently available at $0.001083, but newcomers should act quickly since this price will continue to rise regularly until the sale ends. Buy PEPENODE Here.

The release, which took place on Thursday, October 2nd, coincides with the start of a bullish period many in the crypto community have dubbed “Uptober.” According to blockchain monitoring platform Whale Alert , the unlocked XRP was distributed in four separate transactions: two batches of 400 million and two batches of 100 million, totaling 1 billion XRP. Based on XRP’s trading price at the time, these tokens represented approximately $3 billion in market value. While Ripple’s monthly escrow releases are predictable, this month’s release was slightly delayed, occurring a day later than the usual schedule. Ripple’s Escrow System Ripple’s escrow mechanism is designed to regulate the circulation of XRP and prevent excessive supply from destabilizing the token’s value. Each month, the company releases up to 1 billion XRP, often returning unsold portions to escrow after limited market activity. This structured approach aims to balance liquidity and scarcity, ensuring that XRP’s price is not unduly impacted by large, uncontrolled sales. The October release attracted particular attention due to its timing. The market momentum surrounding XRP has been strong, with the token recently breaking above the $3 resistance level. As of press time, data from CoinMarketCap shows XRP trading around $3.02, reflecting a 1.3% gain over the past 24 hours. Investors are closely monitoring the impact of the unlocked tokens, which could influence short-term price movements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for Market Activity Market analysts suggest that the freshly available XRP could serve a dual purpose. On the one hand, increased supply sometimes pressures prices by reducing scarcity. On the other hand, the additional liquidity may facilitate institutional transactions and broader adoption, particularly as regulatory decisions on XRP ETFs approach . Several major ETF filings are under review, and investor confidence remains elevated with the expectation that these products could bring substantial capital into the XRP ecosystem. The release also underscores Ripple’s commitment to transparency and predictability in its token management. By adhering to a monthly schedule and providing clear data on unlocked amounts, the company aims to minimize market uncertainty and maintain investor trust. As the market enters October, XRP’s recent performance, coupled with the escrow release, has prompted optimism among traders. While supply increases can sometimes trigger short-term corrections, many analysts believe the event strengthens XRP’s infrastructure for institutional use. If combined with potential ETF approvals, these developments could reinforce upward momentum throughout the month.

Be ready. https://t.co/5JtfTm82Wi — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 29, 2025 Solana Price Predictions: Could TradFi Exposure Push SOL Beyond $1,000 These new touchpoints for TradFi demand come as Solana nears the apex of a 6-month ascending wedge pattern. The Solana price now approaches a retest of its upper support as momentum indicators flip decidedly bullish. SOL / USD 1-day chart, 6-month falling wedge points bullish. Source: TradingView. The RSI has found its footing above the neutral line at 55, a sharp rise from recent oversold conditions as buyers overwhelm sellers. The MACD histogram has also mounted a golden cross above the single line, suggesting the current move represents more than a bounce, but a potential lasting uptrend. However, psychological resistance found at $335 today could threaten the integrity of the push, particularly as technical indicators only just scratch bullish. The key threshold for a breakout sits around $300, Solana’s early-year high. Flipping this level into support would validate a potential 130% move to $500 . But with U.S. interest rate cuts expected to stimulate risk appetite, ETFS could see the s olana price extend 350% to $1,000 before year-end. And with CME Group’s global market tapping in, round-the-clock TradFi exposure could push it further in 2026. Solana Waits For 2026 While These ICO Investors Are Raking In Gains For large-cap coins like Solana, a noteworthy breakout takes months of built-up momentum and catalysts at just the right time to see it surge. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) takes a different approach. PEPENODE is the first mine-to-earn meme coin that lets anyone earn rewards by building virtual mining rigs – no expensive hardware, no tech skills needed. Think of it like a crypto game where you buy digital nodes , upgrade your rigs , and collect rewards in popular meme coins like $PEPE – all before the token even launches. It’s a fun, low-barrier way to tap into passive income during the presale phase, and early players are already stacking up gains while others are still waiting on the sidelines. Deflation is hardwired into the system: 70% of $PEPENODE tokens spent on rigs and nodes are burned, driving scarcity and supporting long-term returns. Momentum is rising fast. The presale has surged past $1.6 million, while early adopters are still earning a massive 800% APY on staking. Join the $PEPENODE presale now on the official website to start mining. With the next price increase only hours away, waiting could make entry more expensive. To stay updated, you can also follow PepeNode on X (formerly Twitter) . Buy $PEPENODE Here.

Bitcoin is currently consolidating above $119,000. Traders are looking for an altcoin that will dominate the next two years. Most tokens won’t survive the competition, but those with strong narratives, institutional catalysts, and vibrant ecosystems usually outlive the hype. The three names that are starking the noise for the year 2026 are DeAgentAI (AIA), PancakeSwap (CAKE), Coin98 (C98). Each have varied strengths, with some offering specialised AI-driven products, others crafting DeFi upgrades and some focused on regional adoption roadmaps that differ from US-centric players. At the same time, investors are also watching for new projects with the potential to amplify growth beyond today’s majors. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly positioned as one such asset, combining audit-backed credibility with viral momentum. Together, these four names highlight the shifting dynamics of capital rotation heading into the next stage of the bull cycle. DeAgentAI (AIA): AI Agents Meet Multi-Chain Infrastructure Not many projects have come out of the woodwork like DeAgentAI. In the middle of September 2025, it was listed for the first time on Binance Alpha and Binance Futures to facilitate spot trading and perpetual contracts, with a maximum leverage of up to 50×. In just 24 hours, the price skyrocketed by 179.83%, with an increase of 401.68% over the course of the week; market cap nearly $137 million. DeAgentAI is gaining momentum with an airdrop for Binance users that broadened its initial distribution and contributed to its liquidity. What makes it special is its infrastructure that consists of decoupled AI agents running on Sui, BNB Smart Chain and Bitcoin. This ties in nicely with one of the hottest narratives in Web3 – AI meets DeFi. Still, sustainability remains the key challenge. Getting listed on exchanges will get you the publicity you need but the real long-term price growth will depend on actual developer activity, real adoption of its AI tools and continued cross-chain integrations. If DeAgentAI turns hype into real usage, it could be one of the most relevant tokens by 2026 PancakeSwap (CAKE): DeFi’s Veteran Reinvents Itself PancakeSwap has been present in the DeFi space since 2020. However, PancakeSwap Infinity aims to change this trajectory. The launch of this gas-efficient Layer 2 solution at the end of September 2025 sparked unprecedented trading activity, with volumes reaching over $772 billion in Q3. The price of CAKE surged by 27.92% within 24 hours and increased by nearly 29% in the past week as its market capitalization stands at $1.16 billion. The upgrade added custom liquidity pools and accounting following ERC-6909 standards to enhance scaling while reducing costs for liquidity providers. These new ideas help improve capital efficiency, a DeFi pain point. PancakeSwap will certainly be tested on its ability to maintain dominance with Uniswap moving into new territory. In 2026, CAKE’s ability to keep expanding total value locked (TVL) and maintain protocol revenue from swap fees and staking will be the key to its future appeal. As institutions get comfortable with revenue-backed tokens, I believe PancakeSwap’s combination of innovation and track record makes it one of the best possible DeFi plays for the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Beyond the Noise While DeAgentAI, PancakeSwap, and Coin98 dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a different kind of narrative. Looking toward 2026, analysts are building lists of the most promising altcoins to hold long-term. Alongside majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is finding its way onto those watchlists as the speculative piece of a multi-year portfolio. Its scarcity-driven tokenomics and cultural branding offer potential for 100x wealth-style outcomes in bullish cycles. What sets it apart is that it isn’t just narrative hype: its contracts are verified through CertiK and HashEx audits , providing reassurance for longer-term holders. For those constructing portfolios aimed at 2026 and beyond, the idea is simple, combine infrastructure leaders like ETH and SOL with small allocations into speculative presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The blend of security and risk could position investors for the generational outcomes crypto is known for. Coin98 (C98): A Regional Powerhouse Finds Momentum Coin98 might have a smaller market cap than other cryptos but has recently made headlines. C98 saw trading volume skyrocketing by nearly 1,930% in early October 2025. This caused the crypto to gain 21.81% in 24 hours and 45.55% weekly. Currently, this crypto has a market cap of $64.8 million. Its momentum stems from both macro and micro catalysts. Bitcoin’s rise to $116,000 this week has caused a chain reaction on the macro front which is uplifting low-cap tokens. In August 2025, Coin98’s integration of Concordium ID will add an important privacy-preserving age verification layer that may prove critical to Southeast Asia’s Web3 development on the micro side. C98 is the right crypto project that can take advantage of the fast-growing crypto adoption of the region. The key watchpoint for Coin98 is token unlocks. In June 2025, more than 5.5 million C98 will unlock, which could pressure the token to sell-off in the short term. If partnerships continue and adoption takes off in Southeast Asia, premier small-cap names to hold into 2026 could include (C98)? Coin98. Investor Psychology Heading Toward 2026 DeAgentAI, PancakeSwap, Coin98 and MAGACOIN FINANCE share a commonality in their ability to tap into investor psychology. Traders don’t just want utility. They want growth. They want the narratives that power the market. They want leverage coins in a bull cycle. DeAgentAI satisfies the hunger for AI-driven DeFi. PancakeSwap delivers proven utility and innovation. Coin98 appeals to regional adoption narratives. MAGACOIN FINANCE is appealing because they’re scarce and community-focused. The winning portfolios in 2026 will likely be a balanced mixture of established platforms, emerging leaders and credible growth plays across all the four. Conclusion Which Altcoins can hold the price surge in the long term from now to 2026? DeAgentAI has a daily increase of 179.83%, PancakeSwap achieves record volumes, and Coin98 gains from regional adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be a solid growth-oriented complement to the majors, credible and with some upside. Investors looking to position their strategy for the next cycle are not looking for a winner, rather a series of assets that optimally balances scalability, adoption, and growth optionality. Portfolios will be able to handle fluctuations in the crypto space and still benefit from major gains.

The announcement has revived one of the most ambitious XRP price forecasts in the community, a long-term projection of $20,000 per token. The discussion began after RippleX Senior Director of Engineering, J. Ayo Akinyele, shared updates on his team’s work in a recent Ripple Insights article . Akinyele revealed that Ripple is developing tools designed to support private yet regulatory-compliant transactions. Over the next year, the company plans to implement zero-knowledge proofs, which would allow financial institutions to process sensitive data more securely while maintaining performance and scalability. Steingraber’s Bold Valuation Model The renewed focus on privacy has drawn attention back to a valuation model introduced in 2022 by game developer and XRP community analyst Chad Steingraber . In his analysis, Steingraber described a framework that could theoretically drive XRP toward a $20,000 price point, relying on three key dynamics: demand, market perception, and scarcity. This is where it gets interesting… XRP https://t.co/2L9UgxJ17j pic.twitter.com/g8Wxz5v6Dx — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 2, 2025 First, he highlighted demand as the central force behind value creation. In his view, assets that lack meaningful demand are undervalued, while surging demand can result in rapid price appreciation. Second, he pointed to how shifts in market perception can elevate valuations without necessarily requiring new inflows of capital, a dynamic he said applies broadly across financial markets. Finally, he emphasized scarcity, noting that XRP has a capped supply of under 100 billion tokens and is subject to gradual deflation, as a small amount is destroyed with every transaction. Steingraber argued that traditional market capitalization figures do not always reflect true investment in an asset. At the time of his model, XRP’s reported market capitalization was around $18 billion, but he maintained that this overstated real exposure due to thin trading volumes and retail-driven activity. He asserted that circulating supply and available liquidity, rather than theoretical market cap numbers, ultimately determine price. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Privacy Matters for Institutions Building on this framework, Steingraber predicted that major banks and payment providers would not rely on public exchanges or standard liquidity tools. Instead, he suggested they would adopt private ledgers while holding XRP as a reserve asset. According to his model, banks could issue internal digital instruments backed by XRP reserves, using them for customer balances and interbank transfers. He further projected that liquidity providers would play a key role by accumulating large pools of XRP to facilitate settlement between institutions. In this scenario, competition among major financial players to secure XRP would significantly reduce available supply on public markets. Steingraber also pointed to the permanent loss of some XRP, including tokens locked in inaccessible accounts, as a factor that compounds scarcity. He estimated that only about 20 billion tokens are available on exchanges, meaning institutional accumulation could quickly drain order books and accelerate price increases. Linking Ripple’s Strategy to Price Theories Ripple’s current focus on integrating zero-knowledge proofs aligns with the type of privacy and compliance features that Steingraber’s model assumes institutions will require. For proponents of his $20,000 projection, the company’s technology roadmap offers support for the idea that banks and large-scale payment systems may adopt XRPL for settlement. While most analysts view a $20,000 valuation as highly speculative, the intersection of Ripple’s privacy initiatives with Steingraber’s institutional demand thesis has kept the debate alive within the XRP community. At minimum, the company’s efforts to expand privacy and scalability are seen as essential steps in preparing the ledger for broader enterprise use.

Bitcoin will not realize this massive potential unless mechanisms are created to move and utilize capital directly on its network. Why Bitcoin Can’t Absorb Global Wealth Overnight Analyst BRITISH HODL presents a powerful thesis on BTC’s role, arguing that its impact extends far beyond its own valuation, fundamentally changing how global capital is allocated. In an X post, BRITISH HODL stated that while BTC aims to absorb global capital, this is conditional, and BTC will not capture all of the capital flow on earth unless it is redirected onto the BTC network. Related Reading: No Accident: The Powerful Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Late-September Rally However, as BTC becomes more widely understood, capital will become extremely sensitive, and only the highest quality equities will attract capital. This is simply an existing, long-term trend, evidenced by the dominance of a select few, such as the Magnificent Seven (Mag7) stocks in traditional markets over the last 30 years. Bitcoin intensifies this trend because it provides a highly accessible and transparent standard for risk-free returns. As the risk hurdle rate increases, investors are no longer satisfied with marginal gains from poor-quality assets. The consequence of this will be a significant market cleaning and a lot of concentrated value-creating innovation as companies are forced to deliver exceptional performance to earn capital. Meanwhile, there will be a very fast turnover of terrible companies as BTC’s value proposition becomes increasingly understood by investors. BRITISH HODL makes it clear that in a BTC-dominant era, you must outperform BTC on a risk-adjusted basis to capture any capital. The Growing View Of Bitcoin As An Alternative Money Billionaire investor Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, maintains a balanced yet skeptical view of Bitcoin, acknowledging its growing influence while pointing out fundamental flaws that will prevent its ultimate adoption by nation-states. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Expands As Ohio Approves Vendor For State Cryptocurrency Payments Dalio starts by stating that while he can’t say exactly how effective BTC is as a money, the fact that it’s being perceived by many as an alternative money is worth paying attention to. He frames the utility of any currency as both a medium of exchange and a store of wealth, emphasizing that the latter is more important. Despite its revolutionary technology, Dalio highly doubts that any central bank will take it on as a reserve currency. However, since all of the transactions are public, there is no privacy, which is unacceptable for sovereign entities managing vast financial operations. As a result of the risk in the future, the code could be broken to make it less effective through government controls. The expert confirms that he does have some BTC in his portfolio, though not a significant amount.

MoonBull’s 11,800% ROI Packs a Punch as Hedera and Aster Rally",https://timestabloid.com/chasing-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-2025-moonbulls-11800/,"The best crypto to invest in is the question every trader and student of blockchain keeps asking in 2025. The market is buzzing again, with meme coins stealing the show and established networks holding their ground. Three names stand out for different reasons this October: MoonBull, Hedera, and Aster. Each project carries its own flair, yet one of them is pulling all the eyeballs with a presale that feels like catching lightning in a bottle. Meme coins have dominated crypto headlines for years, from Dogecoin’s internet-fueled rise to Shiba Inu’s viral run. They’ve taught the market that humor and culture can be just as valuable as tech-heavy whitepapers. Now in 2025, the trend is shifting toward meme coins that pair laughs with real tokenomics. This is where MoonBull enters, a meme-fueled rocket propelled by a solid economic engine. MoonBull Presale is live now, and it is shaping up as a second shot for traders who missed early giants like Dogecoin or Solana. Hedera and Aster may have strong market caps and proven adoption, but MoonBull’s first-come, first-served model with 23 scarcity-driven stages is where fortunes might be made. Let’s break it down coin by coin. MoonBull Presale: The Best Crypto to Invest in 2025 MoonBull ($MOBU) isn’t just another meme coin floating in space. It’s an Ethereum-based project combining hype with long-term sustainability. The presale is already in Stage 4, with more than $200K raised and over 700 holders on board. At $0.00005168, early buyers are staring at an ROI north of 11,800% by the time it hits the projected listing price of $0.00616. That’s not peanuts – that’s life-changing money if timed right. Picture this: putting down $20,000 at the current stage translates into nearly 387 million MOBU tokens. By the time the presale reaches its final stage, the value of that bag could soar past $2.3 million. This kind of upside doesn’t come every season, which is why many see MoonBull as the trending best crypto to invest now. What sets MoonBull apart is its ecosystem. It’s not only about flipping tokens. Holders can stake for a 95% APY starting at Stage 10, letting them double up passively. A massive staking pool of 14.6 billion tokens ensures payouts stay smooth. Add the referral program – with 15% bonuses for both referrers and referees plus leaderboard rewards in USDC – and you have a snowball effect designed to grow the community fast. Mobunomics: The Bull’s Engine of Scarcity and Rewards Mobunomics is where MoonBull’s design flexes its muscles. Every trade splits value across three tracks: 2% goes into liquidity for price stability, 2% heads to holders as reflections, and 1% is burned to make supply scarcer. Selling doesn’t weaken the system; it strengthens it. The total supply of 73.2 billion tokens has been carved up to balance presale, staking, referrals, and community rewards. Half the supply is allocated to presale alone, making early stages like today’s a rare golden gate. With its deflationary mechanics, staking pools, referral boosters, and Ethereum-powered backbone, MoonBull ($MOBU) isn’t just a joke coin. It’s shaping up as the best crypto to invest with ROI, and it’s pulling retail and whale investors into one herd. The bull is charging – and the question is whether you’ll be on its back or in its dust. Hedera (HBAR): Solid Tech, Market Struggles Hedera, priced today at $0.2239, is ranked #25 on CoinGecko with a market cap near $9.5 billion. It has seen a 8.3% gain this week, but that’s still a hair below the global crypto market’s 9.1% rise. With a fully diluted valuation of $11.2 billion, Hedera shows the weight of its token supply, which stretches to 50 billion HBAR in circulation potential. The project remains a favorite among developers for its Hashgraph tech, a faster and more scalable alternative to traditional blockchain. Yet, the coin’s price action often feels like a hippo stuck in mud compared to nimble meme plays. Even though it once soared to an all-time high of $0.569, it’s still trading over 60% below that level today. For long-term holders, Hedera might be seen as the best crypto to invest long term, given its enterprise partnerships and ecosystem stability. However, in short-term cycles, it doesn’t pack the same excitement as a hot presale. It’s steady, but steady doesn’t always get headlines. Aster (ASTER): A Rising Star with Heavy Volume Aster trades at $1.89 with a market cap of around $3.18 billion, ranked #52 on CoinGecko. It’s riding a 4.1% weekly gain but trails behind the broader crypto market. With 1.7 billion tokens circulating and a fully diluted valuation over $15 billion, Aster is playing in the big leagues, even if the scoreboard shows mixed signals. Its all-time high of $2.41 is still within reach, though it sits 20% below that mark right now. On the flip side, Aster has climbed an eye-popping 1,824% since its all-time low. That kind of rebound reminds traders that Aster can run when the bulls wake up. Its trading volume of $1.07 billion in 24 hours shows liquidity isn’t a problem, though it did slip slightly compared to the day before. For some, Aster represents the new best crypto to invest October 2025, especially for those eyeing projects outside the meme craze. It offers stability, a strong market presence, and a chance at both short-term trades and long-term holds. But when compared to MoonBull’s presale madness, Aster feels more like a reliable runner than a wild sprinter. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, MoonBull is shaping up as the best crypto to invest in 2025. Its live presale, deflationary Mobunomics, staking perks, and sky-high ROI projections make it a standout in a market hungry for the next meme-driven rocket. Hedera and Aster hold their ground with proven technology and market caps, but neither offers the same ground-floor opportunity MoonBull delivers right now. For investors building a best crypto to invest watchlist 2025, the playbook is clear. MoonBull is the hot ticket for short-term and long-term ROI, while Hedera and Aster cater to those leaning on slower, steadier growth. The bull run is kicking, and MoonBull’s presale is calling.
